well<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.550> idea<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:11.880> might<00:00:12.179> we've<00:00:13.309> we've<00:00:14.309> been

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
well the idea is might we've we've been

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.980 
well the idea is might we've we've been
getting<00:00:14.790> asked<00:00:15.089> basically<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.570> make<00:00:15.690> throwing

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
getting asked basically to make throwing

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.689 
getting asked basically to make throwing
sticks<00:00:16.350> it's<00:00:16.560> an<00:00:16.619> idea<00:00:17.130> that<00:00:17.250> we'd<00:00:17.340> had<00:00:17.490> for<00:00:17.640> a

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
sticks it's an idea that we'd had for a

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.189 
sticks it's an idea that we'd had for a
while<00:00:17.880> was<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.150> couple<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.480> other<00:00:18.630> carbon<00:00:19.050> ones

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
while was a couple of other carbon ones

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:19.880 
while was a couple of other carbon ones
on<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.439> market

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
on the market

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.580 
on the market
so<00:00:20.850> we<00:00:21.060> thought<00:00:21.210> we'd<00:00:21.390> have<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.539> look<00:00:21.779> we<00:00:22.410> came

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
so we thought we'd have a look we came

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.070 
so we thought we'd have a look we came
up<00:00:22.769> with<00:00:22.859> some<00:00:23.039> ideas<00:00:23.510> took<00:00:24.510> some<00:00:24.720> initial

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
up with some ideas took some initial

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.019 
up with some ideas took some initial
prototypes<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.800> five<00:00:25.980> like<00:00:26.189> show<00:00:26.430> they

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
prototypes to the five like show they

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.060 
prototypes to the five like show they
didn't<00:00:27.330> spend<00:00:27.599> more<00:00:27.869> than<00:00:28.080> 30<00:00:28.439> seconds<00:00:28.890> on<00:00:28.980> the

when you're flicking it forward the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.700 
when you're flicking it forward the
force<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.610> stick<00:01:24.350> whacking<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.590> know

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
force of that stick whacking you know

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.460 
force of that stick whacking you know
hitting<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.970> know<00:01:27.090> me<00:01:27.390> yeo-eun<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.140> you're

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
hitting you know me yeo-eun and you're

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.960 
hitting you know me yeo-eun and you're
extending<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.130> joints<00:01:29.460> are<00:01:29.549> caught<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> lot<00:01:29.880> as

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
extending the joints are caught a lot as

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
extending the joints are caught a lot as
well<00:01:30.000> when<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.329> get<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.659> end<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.900> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
well when you get to the end of the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.600 
well when you get to the end of the
range<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.350> movement<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.009> tendons<00:01:32.400> never

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
range of movement that the tendons never

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.249 
range of movement that the tendons never
fear<00:01:32.850> getting<00:01:33.119> overextended<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:33.960> obviously

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
fear getting overextended and obviously

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.719 
fear getting overextended and obviously
the<00:01:34.380> more<00:01:34.500> white<00:01:34.740> you've<00:01:34.920> got<00:01:35.100> attached<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.430> it

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
the more white you've got attached to it

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.520 
the more white you've got attached to it
at<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:35.970> point<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.930> more<00:01:37.110> damage<00:01:37.409> you're

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
at that point the more damage you're

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.890 
at that point the more damage you're
going<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.710> do<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:39.090> lighter<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
going to do so the lighter is and the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.819 
going to do so the lighter is and the
less<00:01:40.049> stress<00:01:40.290> that's<00:01:40.439> going<00:01:40.650> through<00:01:40.710> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
less stress that's going through the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.530 
less stress that's going through the
tendons<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.310> use<00:01:41.490> most<00:01:41.970> people<00:01:42.240> get<00:01:42.360> like<00:01:42.420> a

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
tendons in use most people get like a

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.690 
tendons in use most people get like a
tennis<00:01:42.840> elbow<00:01:42.990> type<00:01:43.439> nasuh<00:01:43.740> efendi<00:01:43.890> unless

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
tennis elbow type nasuh efendi unless

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.289 
tennis elbow type nasuh efendi unless
it's<00:01:45.259> just<00:01:46.259> inflamed<00:01:47.100> tendons<00:01:47.610> basically<00:01:48.119> ah

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
it's just inflamed tendons basically ah

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.359 
it's just inflamed tendons basically ah
you<00:01:48.990> know<00:01:49.140> with<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.710> when<00:01:49.950> there's<00:01:50.130> nothing

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
you know with this when there's nothing

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.749 
you know with this when there's nothing
no<00:01:50.909> wait<00:01:51.210> there<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.380> like<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.920> don't<00:01:53.520> very

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
no wait there is this like I don't very

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.460 
no wait there is this like I don't very
ly<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:53.970> mean<00:01:54.210> that's<00:01:54.390> there's<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.020> 3<00:01:55.259> in<00:01:55.409> the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
ly I mean that's there's this 3 in the

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.380 
ly I mean that's there's this 3 in the
range<00:01:55.710> we've<00:01:56.130> got<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.399> one<00:01:56.640> which<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:57.270> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
range we've got this one which is the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.880 
range we've got this one which is the
little<00:01:57.570> what<00:01:57.750> we<00:01:57.780> call<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:58.020> stealth<00:01:58.350> one<00:01:58.560> and

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
little what we call a stealth one and

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.770 
little what we call a stealth one and
this<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.130> basically

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
this is basically

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.910 
this is basically
primarily<00:02:00.780> for<00:02:01.049> short-range<00:02:01.320> biting

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
primarily for short-range biting

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.590 
primarily for short-range biting
obviously<00:02:02.310> it's<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> short<00:02:02.700> state<00:02:02.969> curve<00:02:03.299> stick

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
obviously it's a short state curve stick

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.380 
obviously it's a short state curve stick
it<00:02:03.810> always<00:02:03.990> sticks<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.469> range<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.770> curved

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
it always sticks in the range of curved

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.029 
it always sticks in the range of curved
but<00:02:06.390> I've<00:02:06.509> actually<00:02:06.630> had<00:02:06.930> like<00:02:07.079> 70<00:02:07.619> yards<00:02:07.950> out

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
but I've actually had like 70 yards out

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.940 
but I've actually had like 70 yards out
of<00:02:08.129> this<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.879> know<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.149> right<00:02:09.300> conditions

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
of this you know in the right conditions

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.710 
of this you know in the right conditions
it<00:02:10.950> will<00:02:11.280> go<00:02:11.489> quite<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.760> long<00:02:11.970> way<00:02:12.120> but<00:02:12.180> ideally

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
it will go quite a long way but ideally

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.580 
it will go quite a long way but ideally
is

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
is

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.800 
is
using<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.099> catapult<00:02:14.550> range<00:02:14.849> and<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.360> find<00:02:15.660> with

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
using a catapult range and I find with

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.710 
using a catapult range and I find with
that<00:02:15.840> if<00:02:16.470> you're<00:02:16.709> if<00:02:16.980> your<00:02:17.129> catapult<00:02:18.090> in<00:02:18.300> bites

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
that if you're if your catapult in bites

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.140 
that if you're if your catapult in bites
out<00:02:19.019> pouch<00:02:19.620> of<00:02:19.800> all<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.040> bite<00:02:20.250> can<00:02:20.700> quite<00:02:20.940> often

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
out pouch of all to bite can quite often

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.940 
out pouch of all to bite can quite often
cause<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.510> lot<00:02:21.959> of<00:02:22.019> disturbance<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.739> water

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
cause a lot of disturbance in the water

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.770 
cause a lot of disturbance in the water
whereas<00:02:23.700> with<00:02:23.819> this<00:02:23.970> because<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.569> curved

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
whereas with this because of the curved

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.479 
whereas with this because of the curved
design<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:25.379> can<00:02:25.530> float<00:02:25.739> it<00:02:25.920> up<00:02:25.980> quite<00:02:26.190> high

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
design you can float it up quite high

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.550 
design you can float it up quite high
and<00:02:26.970> just<00:02:27.239> drop<00:02:27.450> them<00:02:27.569> in<00:02:27.690> one<00:02:27.959> at<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.379> time

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
and just drop them in one at a time

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.580 
and just drop them in one at a time
gently<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.430> hence<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.720> stealth<00:02:31.019> nine<00:02:31.290> we

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
gently and hence the the stealth nine we

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.009 
gently and hence the the stealth nine we
can<00:02:31.739> say<00:02:32.040> oh<00:02:32.069> you<00:02:32.640> know<00:02:32.760> we<00:02:33.060> catapult<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:33.840> get

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
can say oh you know we catapult you get

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.960 
can say oh you know we catapult you get
a<00:02:34.049> real<00:02:34.260> tight<00:02:34.530> letter<00:02:35.370> bait<00:02:35.610> then<00:02:35.819> you're

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
a real tight letter bait then you're

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.550 
a real tight letter bait then you're
wave<00:02:36.120> run<00:02:36.330> evasion<00:02:36.840> sort<00:02:37.080> of<00:02:37.140> spread<00:02:37.349> it<00:02:37.470> about

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
wave run evasion sort of spread it about

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.270 
wave run evasion sort of spread it about
more<00:02:38.780> that's<00:02:39.780> right<00:02:39.870> very<00:02:40.170> nice<00:02:40.620> now<00:02:41.010> things

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
more that's right very nice now things

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.770 
more that's right very nice now things
move<00:02:41.459> a<00:02:41.489> cat<00:02:41.670> bow<00:02:41.790> if<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.030> just<00:02:42.180> put<00:02:42.360> in<00:02:42.450> single

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
move a cat bow if you just put in single

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.940 
move a cat bow if you just put in single
bite<00:02:42.900> at<00:02:43.049> a<00:02:43.110> time<00:02:43.140> it's<00:02:43.470> going<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.620> take<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.799> look

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
bite at a time it's going to take a look

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.220 
bite at a time it's going to take a look
though<00:02:44.099> no<00:02:44.549> longer<00:02:44.580> than<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:46.170> it

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
though no longer than that and it

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.440 
though no longer than that and it
records<00:02:46.440> your<00:02:47.040> knuckle<00:02:47.430> unwrapped<00:02:48.030> in<00:02:48.209> there

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
records your knuckle unwrapped in there

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.150 
records your knuckle unwrapped in there
there's<00:02:48.720> things<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:49.110> notice<00:02:49.440> is<00:02:49.620> once<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:50.010> get

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
there's things I notice is once you get

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.470 
there's things I notice is once you get
once<00:02:50.370> you'd<00:02:50.549> get<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.819> neck<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.120> this<00:02:51.209> it's

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
once you'd get the neck of this it's

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.289 
once you'd get the neck of this it's
super<00:02:52.470> quick<00:02:54.769> oh<00:02:55.769> I<00:02:55.980> think<00:02:56.099> it's<00:02:56.370> 38<00:02:56.910> grams

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
super quick oh I think it's 38 grams

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.930 
super quick oh I think it's 38 grams
that<00:02:57.739> doesn't<00:02:58.739> even<00:02:58.829> feel<00:02:59.069> that<00:02:59.129> really

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
that doesn't even feel that really

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.690 
that doesn't even feel that really
really<00:03:00.120> like<00:03:00.829> next<00:03:01.829> one<00:03:01.980> up<00:03:02.099> we've<00:03:02.340> got<00:03:02.370> there

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
really like next one up we've got there

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.339 
really like next one up we've got there
that<00:03:02.940> you've<00:03:03.090> got<00:03:03.329> I<00:03:03.540> think<00:03:03.750> this<00:03:03.989> is<00:03:04.110> probably

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
that you've got I think this is probably

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.869 
that you've got I think this is probably
going<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.590> be<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.799> most<00:03:04.980> popular<00:03:05.370> one<00:03:05.700> in<00:03:05.819> the

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
going to be the most popular one in the

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.229 
going to be the most popular one in the
range<00:03:06.120> this<00:03:06.780> is<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.290> high<00:03:08.190> trajectory<00:03:08.489> one<00:03:09.000> a

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
range this is the high trajectory one a

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.330 
range this is the high trajectory one a
lot<00:03:10.049> of<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.200> research<00:03:10.530> did<00:03:11.010> when<00:03:11.220> we<00:03:11.250> put

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
lot of the research did when we put

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.680 
lot of the research did when we put
these<00:03:11.610> together<00:03:11.879> believe<00:03:12.299> it<00:03:12.420> or<00:03:12.480> not<00:03:12.540> is

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
these together believe it or not is

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.289 
these together believe it or not is
actually<00:03:12.810> based<00:03:13.170> around<00:03:13.970> concepts<00:03:14.970> for<00:03:15.060> golf

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
actually based around concepts for golf

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.809 
actually based around concepts for golf
and<00:03:15.450> golf<00:03:15.629> balls<00:03:15.959> so<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:17.459> high<00:03:17.579> trajectory

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
and golf balls so the high trajectory

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:18.740 
and golf balls so the high trajectory
one<00:03:18.329> we've<00:03:18.480> got

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
one we've got

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.240 
one we've got
with<00:03:18.959> it<00:03:19.049> being<00:03:19.079> lighter<00:03:19.500> you're<00:03:20.040> going<00:03:20.190> to

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
with it being lighter you're going to

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.490 
with it being lighter you're going to
create<00:03:20.549> a<00:03:20.579> lot<00:03:20.819> more<00:03:20.850> speed<00:03:21.600> automatically

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
create a lot more speed automatically

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.960 
create a lot more speed automatically
it's<00:03:23.010> not<00:03:23.190> it's<00:03:23.340> going<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.579> move<00:03:23.670> a<00:03:23.730> lot

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
it's not it's going to move a lot

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.610 
it's not it's going to move a lot
quicker<00:03:24.000> than<00:03:24.329> a<00:03:24.480> standard<00:03:24.930> plastic<00:03:25.139> stick

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
quicker than a standard plastic stick

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.979 
quicker than a standard plastic stick
which<00:03:26.069> is<00:03:26.220> going<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.459> enable<00:03:26.700> you<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.269> generate

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
which is going to enable you to generate

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.080 
which is going to enable you to generate
more<00:03:28.170> backspin<00:03:28.560> even<00:03:28.889> if<00:03:28.980> you're<00:03:29.130> a<00:03:29.489> relative

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
more backspin even if you're a relative

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.120 
more backspin even if you're a relative
novice<00:03:30.660> with<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.930> frying<00:03:31.109> stick<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:31.680> it's

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
novice with a frying stick and it's

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.620 
novice with a frying stick and it's
going<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.340> get<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.609> boilie<00:03:32.910> airborne<00:03:33.329> and<00:03:33.510> if

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
going to get the boilie airborne and if

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.690 
going to get the boilie airborne and if
you're<00:03:33.780> using<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.139> downwind<00:03:34.680> obviously<00:03:35.639> if

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
you're using it downwind obviously if

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.759 
you're using it downwind obviously if
you<00:03:35.790> can<00:03:35.910> get<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.209> boilie<00:03:36.900> airborne<00:03:37.319> and<00:03:37.560> on

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
you can get the boilie airborne and on

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.129 
you can get the boilie airborne and on
to<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.069> wind<00:03:38.280> it's<00:03:38.790> going<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.090> go<00:03:39.239> miles

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
to the wind it's going to go miles

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:41.990 
to the wind it's going to go miles
I<00:03:40.200> mean<00:03:40.349> we've<00:03:40.470> had<00:03:40.560> 150<00:03:41.370> yards<00:03:41.639> out<00:03:41.760> of<00:03:41.880> these

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
I mean we've had 150 yards out of these

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.330 
I mean we've had 150 yards out of these
damn<00:03:42.989> wind<00:03:43.260> no<00:03:43.410> problem<00:03:43.859> and<00:03:43.950> this<00:03:44.010> is<00:03:44.069> that

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
damn wind no problem and this is that

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.009 
damn wind no problem and this is that
you<00:03:44.519> know<00:03:44.609> the<00:03:44.730> short-range<00:03:45.239> one<00:03:45.540> of<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.780> of

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
you know the short-range one of the of

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.050 
you know the short-range one of the of
the<00:03:46.139> two<00:03:46.169> longer<00:03:46.650> sticks<00:03:46.919> twenty-five<00:03:47.639> now<00:03:47.880> I

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
the two longer sticks twenty-five now I

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.300 
the two longer sticks twenty-five now I
say<00:03:48.329> yeah<00:03:48.780> me<00:03:49.019> basically<00:03:49.410> got<00:03:49.560> two<00:03:49.739> sizes

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
say yeah me basically got two sizes

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.159 
say yeah me basically got two sizes
we've<00:03:50.609> got<00:03:50.760> boilie<00:03:51.150> this<00:03:51.510> is<00:03:51.690> this<00:03:51.810> all<00:03:51.989> their

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
we've got boilie this is this all their

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.770 
we've got boilie this is this all their
25<00:03:52.620> mil<00:03:52.859> one<00:03:53.040> will<00:03:53.190> handle<00:03:53.519> boilies<00:03:53.910> up<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.359> 20

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
25 mil one will handle boilies up to 20

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.930 
25 mil one will handle boilies up to 20
mil<00:03:54.959> and<00:03:55.169> then<00:03:55.680> we've<00:03:55.799> got<00:03:55.950> a<00:03:55.980> thirty<00:03:56.370> one<00:03:56.700> mil

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
mil and then we've got a thirty one mil

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.789 
mil and then we've got a thirty one mil
which<00:03:57.269> will<00:03:57.450> handle<00:03:57.599> the<00:03:58.049> bigger<00:03:58.230> bites<00:03:58.500> and

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
which will handle the bigger bites and

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.339 
which will handle the bigger bites and
then<00:03:59.250> lastly<00:03:59.639> with<00:04:00.329> that<00:04:00.510> said<00:04:00.810> we've<00:04:01.019> got<00:04:01.200> the

these nice handmade Cotswolds Aquarius
cases<00:04:08.790> they<00:04:09.630> eight<00:04:09.840> mil<00:04:10.139> padded<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:10.739> they

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
cases they eight mil padded and they

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.890 
cases they eight mil padded and they
made<00:04:11.130> out<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:11.280> call<00:04:11.519> juror<00:04:11.819> so<00:04:12.599> they<00:04:12.750> never

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
made out a call juror so they never

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.599 
made out a call juror so they never
you're<00:04:13.530> not<00:04:13.650> going<00:04:13.799> to<00:04:13.859> get<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.099> stick<00:04:14.280> damage

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
you're not going to get the stick damage

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.819 
you're not going to get the stick damage
the<00:04:14.760> tool<00:04:15.109> here<00:04:16.109> it's<00:04:16.260> really<00:04:16.470> really<00:04:16.680> nice

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
the tool here it's really really nice

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.740 
the tool here it's really really nice
touch<00:04:17.099> perfect<00:04:17.669> and<00:04:17.880> it<00:04:17.970> just<00:04:18.120> slips<00:04:18.419> in<00:04:18.599> there

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
touch perfect and it just slips in there

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.080 
touch perfect and it just slips in there
yeah<00:04:18.930> yeah<00:04:19.289> they're<00:04:19.470> good<00:04:19.650> for<00:04:19.769> anything<00:04:20.700> no

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
yeah yeah they're good for anything no

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.690 
yeah yeah they're good for anything no
none<00:04:21.510> of<00:04:21.539> that<00:04:21.659> so<00:04:22.620> you<00:04:22.680> see<00:04:22.860> this<00:04:23.010> LT<00:04:23.430> this<00:04:23.580> is

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
none of that so you see this LT this is

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.490 
none of that so you see this LT this is
the<00:04:23.820> low<00:04:23.969> trajectory<00:04:24.180> one<00:04:24.690> now<00:04:25.050> basically

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
the low trajectory one now basically

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.900 
the low trajectory one now basically
what<00:04:25.830> we've<00:04:25.979> done<00:04:26.130> with<00:04:26.310> these

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
what we've done with these

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.250 
what we've done with these
is<00:04:27.000> where<00:04:27.240> we<00:04:27.480> were<00:04:27.600> a<00:04:27.630> little<00:04:27.750> bit<00:04:27.990> delayed

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
is where we were a little bit delayed

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.770 
is where we were a little bit delayed
again<00:04:28.620> you<00:04:29.430> can<00:04:29.580> see<00:04:29.820> that<00:04:29.850> we've<00:04:30.450> pretty<00:04:30.660> much

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
again you can see that we've pretty much

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.450 
again you can see that we've pretty much
kept<00:04:31.140> the<00:04:31.230> stick<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.560> same<00:04:31.800> but<00:04:32.310> we've<00:04:32.430> just

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
kept the stick the same but we've just

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.700 
kept the stick the same but we've just
elongated<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.390> curve<00:04:33.600> slightly<00:04:33.930> okay<00:04:34.500> and

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
elongated the curve slightly okay and

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.650 
elongated the curve slightly okay and
you<00:04:34.770> can<00:04:34.920> see<00:04:35.160> where<00:04:35.730> the<00:04:36.060> boilie<00:04:36.390> is<00:04:36.450> going<00:04:36.600> to

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
you can see where the boilie is going to

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.630 
you can see where the boilie is going to
get<00:04:36.780> released<00:04:36.930> so<00:04:37.620> basically<00:04:38.040> the<00:04:38.490> high

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
get released so basically the high

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.270 
get released so basically the high
trajectory<00:04:38.850> one<00:04:39.330> you<00:04:39.660> can<00:04:39.840> see<00:04:40.050> it's<00:04:40.920> pointing

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
trajectory one you can see it's pointing

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.890 
trajectory one you can see it's pointing
much<00:04:41.400> higher<00:04:41.640> yeah<00:04:42.060> and<00:04:42.240> then<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.720> low

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
much higher yeah and then the low

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.290 
much higher yeah and then the low
trajectory<00:04:43.110> one<00:04:43.650> I've<00:04:44.010> just<00:04:44.250> pretty<00:04:45.090> much

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
trajectory one I've just pretty much

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.030 
trajectory one I've just pretty much
kept<00:04:45.540> the<00:04:45.660> stick<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:45.960> same<00:04:46.170> just<00:04:46.500> extended<00:04:46.950> to

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
kept the stick the same just extended to

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.460 
kept the stick the same just extended to
tip<00:04:47.220> by<00:04:47.340> a<00:04:47.370> couple<00:04:47.580> of<00:04:47.730> inches<00:04:48.470> interesting

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
tip by a couple of inches interesting

like casting in a way you don't really
see<00:05:02.370> what<00:05:02.610> can<00:05:02.820> be<00:05:02.850> done<00:05:03.210> until<00:05:03.540> you<00:05:03.720> get

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
see what can be done until you get

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
sticks at 60 70 yards most guys can do

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.540 
sticks at 60 70 yards most guys can do
that<00:05:10.530> but<00:05:10.740> until<00:05:11.010> you've<00:05:11.130> actually<00:05:11.250> got

hundred and thirty hundred and forty

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.900 
hundred and thirty hundred and forty
yards<00:05:16.500> you<00:05:16.890> start<00:05:17.190> to<00:05:17.310> look<00:05:17.430> at<00:05:17.610> how<00:05:17.730> you<00:05:17.790> can

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
yards you start to look at how you can

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.940 
yards you start to look at how you can
squeeze<00:05:18.270> a<00:05:18.300> bit<00:05:18.570> more<00:05:18.780> a<00:05:19.020> bit<00:05:19.230> more<00:05:19.560> out<00:05:19.590> of<00:05:19.710> it

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
squeeze a bit more a bit more out of it

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.710 
squeeze a bit more a bit more out of it
you<00:05:20.010> know<00:05:20.130> a<00:05:20.160> bit<00:05:20.310> more<00:05:20.460> range<00:05:20.730> so<00:05:21.510> for<00:05:21.630> this

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
you know a bit more range so for this

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.690 
you know a bit more range so for this
one<00:05:21.960> it's<00:05:22.350> an<00:05:22.410> elongated<00:05:23.070> curve<00:05:23.280> and<00:05:23.610> it's

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
one it's an elongated curve and it's

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.600 
one it's an elongated curve and it's
almost<00:05:24.000> when<00:05:24.870> you<00:05:25.050> when<00:05:25.320> your<00:05:25.440> arms<00:05:25.800> looked<00:05:26.100> at

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
almost when you when your arms looked at

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.580 
almost when you when your arms looked at
the<00:05:26.730> finish<00:05:27.000> position<00:05:27.210> this<00:05:27.960> is<00:05:28.140> almost

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
the finish position this is almost

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.800 
the finish position this is almost
letting<00:05:29.250> them<00:05:29.340> out<00:05:29.490> at<00:05:29.640> 90<00:05:30.000> degrees<00:05:30.300> so<00:05:30.540> it's

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
letting them out at 90 degrees so it's

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.130 
letting them out at 90 degrees so it's
just<00:05:30.990> coming<00:05:31.200> out<00:05:31.410> Ford's<00:05:31.920> so<00:05:32.700> much<00:05:32.850> like<00:05:33.090> a

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
just coming out Ford's so much like a

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.690 
just coming out Ford's so much like a
driver<00:05:34.140> you<00:05:34.650> know<00:05:34.770> in<00:05:34.920> a<00:05:35.010> golf<00:05:35.250> club<00:05:35.460> got<00:05:35.580> the

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
there no pull on your arm and obviously

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.430 
there no pull on your arm and obviously
I'm<00:06:33.000> still<00:06:33.030> adapting<00:06:33.810> to<00:06:33.960> get<00:06:34.140> the<00:06:34.260> right

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
I'm still adapting to get the right

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.370 
I'm still adapting to get the right
style<00:06:34.830> for<00:06:34.979> it<00:06:35.280> but<00:06:35.520> straightaway<00:06:35.850> you<00:06:36.840> know

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 
style for it but straightaway you know

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:43.010 
style for it but straightaway you know
now<00:06:38.370> that<00:06:41.150> you<00:06:42.150> can<00:06:42.300> savor<00:06:42.480> that<00:06:42.660> one<00:06:42.840> the<00:06:42.930> way

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 
now that you can savor that one the way

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.230 
now that you can savor that one the way
their<00:06:43.200> trajectory<00:06:43.680> why<00:06:43.980> it<00:06:44.040> comes<00:06:44.310> out<00:06:44.520> it's

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
their trajectory why it comes out it's

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.730 
their trajectory why it comes out it's
designed<00:06:45.570> to<00:06:45.690> go<00:06:45.840> forwards<00:06:46.290> rather<00:06:46.500> than<00:06:46.650> up

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
designed to go forwards rather than up

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.860 
designed to go forwards rather than up
in<00:06:46.860> the<00:06:47.010> air<00:06:47.130> so<00:06:47.400> luckily<00:06:48.000> today<00:06:48.420> we've<00:06:48.750> got

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870 
in the air so luckily today we've got

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.090 
in the air so luckily today we've got
we've<00:06:48.990> got<00:06:49.110> the<00:06:49.200> wind<00:06:49.380> behind<00:06:49.500> us<00:06:49.830> but<00:06:50.010> if

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100 
we've got the wind behind us but if

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.100 
we've got the wind behind us but if
you're<00:06:50.220> frying<00:06:50.520> those<00:06:50.700> into<00:06:51.030> the<00:06:51.150> wind<00:06:51.330> you'd

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110 
you're frying those into the wind you'd

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.230 
you're frying those into the wind you'd
still<00:06:52.380> get<00:06:52.530> a<00:06:52.590> similar<00:06:53.010> trajectory<00:06:53.370> current

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 
still get a similar trajectory current

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.600 
still get a similar trajectory current
let's<00:06:54.450> have<00:06:54.570> a<00:06:54.600> little<00:06:54.780> go<00:06:54.900> nail<00:06:55.200> -<00:06:55.740> x-ray<00:06:56.100> see

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:56.610 
let's have a little go nail - x-ray see

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.150 
let's have a little go nail - x-ray see
what<00:06:56.730> the<00:06:56.790> difference<00:06:57.090> is<00:06:57.270> just<00:06:58.010> to<00:06:59.010> use<00:06:59.130> a

00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 
what the difference is just to use a

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.430 
what the difference is just to use a
slightly<00:06:59.490> different<00:06:59.730> angle<00:07:00.690> for<00:07:01.140> this<00:07:01.200> Vanna

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 
slightly different angle for this Vanna

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.280 
slightly different angle for this Vanna
whom<00:07:01.710> they<00:07:01.860> I<00:07:02.430> didn't<00:07:02.910> it<00:07:02.970> yeah<00:07:03.300> I<00:07:03.690> do<00:07:03.960> at<00:07:04.260> least

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.290 
whom they I didn't it yeah I do at least

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.200 
whom they I didn't it yeah I do at least
one<00:07:04.500> obviously<00:07:04.770> guys<00:07:05.190> we're<00:07:05.820> downwind<00:07:06.180> today

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.210 
one obviously guys we're downwind today

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.990 
one obviously guys we're downwind today
the<00:07:06.570> high<00:07:06.690> you<00:07:06.750> can<00:07:06.990> get<00:07:07.170> them<00:07:07.290> further<00:07:08.150> on

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.000 
the high you can get them further on

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.880 
the high you can get them further on
yeah<00:07:12.000> so<00:07:14.780> how<00:07:15.780> do<00:07:15.840> you<00:07:16.020> hit<00:07:16.170> that<00:07:16.290> now<00:07:16.470> downwind

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:16.890 
yeah so how do you hit that now downwind

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.290 
yeah so how do you hit that now downwind
the<00:07:17.010> bear<00:07:17.160> you<00:07:17.340> kidding<00:07:17.580> right<00:07:17.700> more<00:07:17.880> backspin

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:40.770 
century you know was there technology in

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.110 
century you know was there technology in
carbon<00:07:41.220> and<00:07:41.340> everything<00:07:41.760> else

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.120 
carbon and everything else

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.510 
carbon and everything else
what<00:07:42.750> an<00:07:42.930> awesome<00:07:43.140> bit<00:07:43.830> I<00:07:43.980> thought<00:07:44.220> you'd<00:07:44.400> like

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 
what an awesome bit I thought you'd like

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.970 
what an awesome bit I thought you'd like
a<00:07:44.580> mic<00:07:44.880> when<00:07:45.420> they<00:07:45.540> gonna<00:07:45.690> be<00:07:45.810> out<00:07:45.900> they<00:07:46.830> are

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:46.980 
a mic when they gonna be out they are

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.490 
a mic when they gonna be out they are
out<00:07:47.130> there<00:07:47.370> no<00:07:47.490> shops<00:07:47.790> have<00:07:48.030> been<00:07:48.060> out<00:07:48.410> just<00:07:49.410> a

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:49.500 
out there no shops have been out just a

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.840 
out there no shops have been out just a
few<00:07:49.680> weeks<00:07:49.890> and<00:07:50.250> we've<00:07:50.370> almost<00:07:50.520> run<00:07:50.790> out

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:50.850 
few weeks and we've almost run out

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:52.670 
few weeks and we've almost run out
already<00:07:51.180> so<00:07:51.450> the<00:07:51.870> second<00:07:52.230> flight<00:07:52.380> should<00:07:52.590> be

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:52.680 
already so the second flight should be

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.880 
already so the second flight should be
in<00:07:52.770> the<00:07:52.890> shops<00:07:53.130> any<00:07:53.400> day<00:07:53.700> now
