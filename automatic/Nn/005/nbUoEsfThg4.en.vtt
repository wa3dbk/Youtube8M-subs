00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.480 
some prismacolor and new pastels so the
first<00:00:22.050> thing<00:00:22.230> i<00:00:22.320> do<00:00:22.590> here<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.980> i'm<00:00:23.130> just<00:00:23.160> going

first thing i do here is i'm just going

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.519 
first thing i do here is i'm just going
to<00:00:23.519> lightly<00:00:23.820> sketch<00:00:24.210> everything<00:00:24.720> out<00:00:24.869> pastel

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
to lightly sketch everything out pastel

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.380

pencil<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.550> notice<00:00:26.820> I'm<00:00:26.939> not<00:00:26.970> using<00:00:27.090> a

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
pencil you notice I'm not using a

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.060 
pencil you notice I'm not using a
graphite<00:00:27.840> pencil<00:00:27.900> because<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.680> graphite

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
graphite pencil because the graphite

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.580 
graphite pencil because the graphite
would<00:00:29.310> mix<00:00:29.609> with<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.630> chalk<00:00:30.840> pastels<00:00:31.349> and

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
would mix with the chalk pastels and

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.220 
would mix with the chalk pastels and
create<00:00:31.949> an<00:00:32.130> undesirable<00:00:32.759> gray<00:00:33.300> undertone<00:00:33.870> so

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
create an undesirable gray undertone so

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.560 
create an undesirable gray undertone so

colors now you'll notice that the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.630 
colors now you'll notice that the
strokes<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.559> I'm<00:00:52.710> making<00:00:53.100> are<00:00:53.219> following

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
strokes that I'm making are following

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.630 
strokes that I'm making are following
the<00:00:53.789> cross<00:00:54.059> contours<00:00:54.750> for<00:00:55.050> lips<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.710> that's

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
the cross contours for lips and that's

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.369 
the cross contours for lips and that's
going<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.820> help<00:00:57.059> define<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.660> lips<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.260> little

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
going to help define the lips a little

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:58.819 
going to help define the lips a little
bit

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
bit

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.160 
bit
you<00:00:59.340> also<00:00:59.489> notice<00:00:59.879> through<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> development

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
you also notice through the development

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.599 
you also notice through the development
of<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.410> drawing<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.370> goes<00:01:02.550> through

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
of this drawing that it goes through

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.600 
of this drawing that it goes through
phases<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:04.439> lot<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.010> people<00:01:05.400> get

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
phases and a lot of people get

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.550 
phases and a lot of people get
discouraged<00:01:06.119> from<00:01:06.240> these<00:01:06.450> pastels<00:01:07.080> right<00:01:07.409> off

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
discouraged from these pastels right off

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.340 
discouraged from these pastels right off
the<00:01:08.430> start<00:01:08.640> because<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.510> doesn't<00:01:09.900> look<00:01:10.080> like

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
the start because it doesn't look like

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.980 
the start because it doesn't look like
and<00:01:10.680> it's<00:01:10.860> drawing<00:01:11.340> well<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:12.600> know<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.720> kind<00:01:12.900> of

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
and it's drawing well you know I kind of

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.469 
and it's drawing well you know I kind of
laugh<00:01:13.170> when<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.470> say<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.860> because<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.790> drawing

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
laugh when I say that because a drawing

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.630 
laugh when I say that because a drawing
needs<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.780> be<00:01:15.900> developed<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.640> especially

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
needs to be developed and especially

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.760 
needs to be developed and especially
when<00:01:17.729> you're<00:01:17.880> using<00:01:18.000> pastels<00:01:18.540> or<00:01:19.049> oil<00:01:19.229> pastel

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
when you're using pastels or oil pastel

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.649 
when you're using pastels or oil pastel
color<00:01:20.159> pencils<00:01:20.610> or<00:01:20.820> any<00:01:20.970> medium<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.479> needs

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
color pencils or any medium that needs

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.350 
color pencils or any medium that needs
to<00:01:21.810> be<00:01:21.900> layered<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.530> have<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.729> go<00:01:24.119> through

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
to be layered you have to go through

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.080 
to be layered you have to go through
those<00:01:24.509> steps<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.409> layer<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.090> really

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
those steps you have to layer and really

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.700 
those steps you have to layer and really
take<00:01:27.299> your<00:01:27.420> time<00:01:27.479> before<00:01:28.049> your<00:01:28.170> drawings<00:01:28.530> will

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
take your time before your drawings will

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.550 
take your time before your drawings will
start<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.070> develop<00:01:29.479> now<00:01:30.479> while<00:01:31.409> I've<00:01:31.530> been

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
start to develop now while I've been

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.740 
start to develop now while I've been
talking<00:01:31.740> things<00:01:32.610> happened

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
talking things happened

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.810 
talking things happened

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
you might notice I'm darkening some of

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.520 
you might notice I'm darkening some of
the<00:01:35.909> areas<00:01:36.270> but<00:01:36.509> I'm<00:01:36.659> using<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.020> blue<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.500> a

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530

brown to do that out of black yet I will
use<00:01:39.869> black<00:01:40.140> later<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.770> demonstration<00:01:41.430> but

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
use black later in the demonstration but

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.380 
use black later in the demonstration but
just<00:01:43.100> just<00:01:44.100> here<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.520> there<00:01:44.700> black<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.149> pretty

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.030 
just just here and there black is pretty
powerful<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.140> haven't<00:01:46.439> used<00:01:46.560> black<00:01:46.770> at<00:01:46.950> this

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
powerful so I haven't used black at this

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.630 
powerful so I haven't used black at this
point<00:01:47.340> yet<00:01:47.520> now<00:01:48.270> I'm<00:01:48.420> taking<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:49.220> pastel<00:01:50.220> pencil

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
point yet now I'm taking a pastel pencil

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.910 
point yet now I'm taking a pastel pencil
and<00:01:50.840> again<00:01:51.840> with<00:01:52.020> kind<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.500> pinkish

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
and again with kind of that pinkish

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.639 
and again with kind of that pinkish
color<00:01:53.250> I'm<00:01:53.570> filling<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.689> more<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.320> area

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
color I'm filling in more of the area

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.420 
color I'm filling in more of the area
again<00:01:56.369> following<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.000> cross<00:01:57.329> contours<00:01:58.020> and

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
again following the cross contours and

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.709 
again following the cross contours and
you'll<00:01:59.430> notice<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.790> I'm<00:02:00.149> kind<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.390> working

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
you'll notice that I'm kind of working

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.780 
you'll notice that I'm kind of working
sketchy<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.409> as<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.680> go<00:02:01.890> along<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.340> get<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.549> little

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
sketchy and as I go along I get a little

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.550 
sketchy and as I go along I get a little
bit<00:02:02.969> more<00:02:03.149> detailed<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.930> more<00:02:04.110> controlled

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
bit more detailed and more controlled

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.210 
bit more detailed and more controlled
with<00:02:04.740> my<00:02:04.890> medium

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.650 

all<00:02:10.220> right<00:02:10.399> now<00:02:10.580> I'm<00:02:10.700> using<00:02:10.879> one<00:02:11.090> of<00:02:11.180> those<00:02:11.269> new

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
all right now I'm using one of those new

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.110 
all right now I'm using one of those new
pastels<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:13.099> the<00:02:13.160> new<00:02:13.310> pastels<00:02:13.790> are<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:13.970> little

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
pastels and the new pastels are a little

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.350 
pastels and the new pastels are a little
bit<00:02:14.300> more<00:02:14.330> compressed<00:02:14.930> than<00:02:15.230> regular<00:02:16.360> chalk

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
bit more compressed than regular chalk

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.390 
bit more compressed than regular chalk
pastels<00:02:17.540> so<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:19.459> material<00:02:19.970> comes<00:02:20.180> off<00:02:20.450> a

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
pastels so the material comes off a

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.190 
pastels so the material comes off a
little<00:02:22.400> less<00:02:22.670> powdery<00:02:23.180> it<00:02:23.780> will<00:02:23.930> give<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.140> a

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
little less powdery it will give you a

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.140 
little less powdery it will give you a
little<00:02:24.410> bit<00:02:24.530> more<00:02:24.709> control<00:02:25.160> but<00:02:25.819> it<00:02:25.970> is<00:02:26.120> a

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
little bit more control but it is a

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.460 
little bit more control but it is a
little<00:02:26.390> bit<00:02:26.569> harder<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.959> lay<00:02:27.110> your<00:02:27.170> view

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
little bit harder to lay your view

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.820 
little bit harder to lay your view
pastels<00:02:27.950> over<00:02:28.400> traditional<00:02:28.879> pastels<00:02:29.720> so<00:02:29.989> this

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
pastels over traditional pastels so this

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.059 
pastels over traditional pastels so this
is<00:02:30.980> kind<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.400> lighter<00:02:31.640> pink<00:02:31.970> in<00:02:32.209> color<00:02:33.069> now

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
is kind of a lighter pink in color now

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.619 
is kind of a lighter pink in color now
every<00:02:34.430> once<00:02:34.610> in<00:02:34.670> a<00:02:34.760> while<00:02:34.910> I'll<00:02:35.060> grab<00:02:35.239> my<00:02:35.360> white

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
every once in a while I'll grab my white

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.479 
every once in a while I'll grab my white
and<00:02:36.290> make<00:02:36.530> sure<00:02:36.739> I<00:02:36.769> define<00:02:37.160> some<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.400> the

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
and make sure I define some of the

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.550 
and make sure I define some of the
highlights<00:02:37.880> we<00:02:38.150> want<00:02:38.299> the<00:02:38.390> lips<00:02:38.599> to<00:02:38.720> have<00:02:39.530> a

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
highlights we want the lips to have a

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.270 
highlights we want the lips to have a
little<00:02:39.890> indication<00:02:40.430> of<00:02:40.549> being<00:02:40.900> wet<00:02:41.900> so<00:02:42.560> we're

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
little indication of being wet so we're

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.680 
little indication of being wet so we're
going<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.459> do<00:02:43.579> this<00:02:43.730> with<00:02:43.940> highlighted<00:02:44.390> areas

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
going to do this with highlighted areas

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.150 
going to do this with highlighted areas
with<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:44.959> white<00:02:45.170> pastel<00:02:47.500> now<00:02:48.500> since<00:02:48.799> lips

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
with the white pastel now since lips

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.130 
with the white pastel now since lips
protrude<00:02:49.730> out<00:02:49.940> they're<00:02:50.450> going<00:02:50.599> to<00:02:50.660> have<00:02:50.810> dark

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
protrude out they're going to have dark

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.319 
protrude out they're going to have dark
around<00:02:51.379> the<00:02:51.560> edges<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:52.069> the<00:02:52.730> lighter<00:02:52.940> areas

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
around the edges and the lighter areas

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.030 
around the edges and the lighter areas
would<00:02:53.510> be<00:02:53.569> closer<00:02:53.989> towards<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.530> center<00:02:55.010> of

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
would be closer towards the center of

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.650 
would be closer towards the center of
the<00:02:55.190> lips<00:02:55.459> you<00:02:55.700> can<00:02:55.849> see<00:02:56.030> that<00:02:56.209> a<00:02:56.239> little<00:02:56.480> bit

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
the lips you can see that a little bit

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.210 
the lips you can see that a little bit
developing<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.290> top<00:02:57.470> lip<00:02:57.709> from<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:57.920> bottom

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
developing the top lip from the bottom

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.210 
developing the top lip from the bottom
lip<00:02:58.370> all<00:02:58.549> right<00:02:59.290> now<00:03:00.290> I<00:03:00.319> finally<00:03:00.680> grab<00:03:01.010> my

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
lip all right now I finally grab my

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.520 
lip all right now I finally grab my
black<00:03:01.519> and<00:03:01.910> you<00:03:02.209> can<00:03:02.239> see<00:03:02.420> I'm<00:03:02.750> using<00:03:02.780> it<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.319> go

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
black and you can see I'm using it to go

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.780 
black and you can see I'm using it to go
over<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:03.950> colors<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:04.400> I've<00:03:04.489> already<00:03:04.640> put

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
over the colors that I've already put

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.300 
over the colors that I've already put
down<00:03:04.940> that<00:03:05.629> way<00:03:05.810> it's<00:03:06.200> not<00:03:06.410> straight<00:03:07.040> black

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
down that way it's not straight black

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.490 
down that way it's not straight black
but<00:03:07.700> rather<00:03:08.030> a<00:03:08.120> darker<00:03:08.540> value<00:03:08.870> because<00:03:09.230> it's

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
but rather a darker value because it's

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.650 
but rather a darker value because it's
already<00:03:09.709> there<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:13.340> just<00:03:13.670> making<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:14.030> bottom

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
already there and just making the bottom

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.240 
already there and just making the bottom
part<00:03:14.900> of<00:03:14.959> the<00:03:15.049> top<00:03:15.230> lip<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:15.530> little<00:03:15.799> bit<00:03:15.889> darker

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
part of the top lip a little bit darker

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.759 
part of the top lip a little bit darker
to<00:03:16.549> get<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:17.000> lips<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:17.870> little<00:03:18.019> indication<00:03:18.500> of

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
to get the lips a little indication of

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.860 
to get the lips a little indication of
pink<00:03:19.010> curve<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:19.609> there<00:03:20.600> should<00:03:20.750> be<00:03:20.780> some

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
pink curve and there should be some

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.830 
pink curve and there should be some
cracks<00:03:21.319> in<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.739> lips<00:03:21.950> too<00:03:22.250> so<00:03:22.639> I'm<00:03:22.970> to<00:03:23.630> find

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
cracks in the lips too so I'm to find

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.230 
cracks in the lips too so I'm to find
those<00:03:24.109> a<00:03:24.139> little<00:03:24.349> bit<00:03:24.500> with<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:24.889> darker<00:03:25.220> color

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
those a little bit with the darker color

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.020 
those a little bit with the darker color
and<00:03:28.240> my<00:03:28.480> teeth<00:03:28.750> as<00:03:29.020> well<00:03:29.550> don't<00:03:30.550> need<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:30.910> be

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
and my teeth as well don't need to be

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.990 
and my teeth as well don't need to be
completed<00:03:31.510> why<00:03:31.750> they<00:03:32.170> need<00:03:32.350> have<00:03:32.700> some<00:03:33.700> areas

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
completed why they need have some areas

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.430 
completed why they need have some areas
of<00:03:34.150> value<00:03:34.480> so<00:03:34.660> I've<00:03:34.750> had<00:03:34.930> a<00:03:35.110> little<00:03:35.230> bit<00:03:35.350> of

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
of value so I've had a little bit of

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.120 
of value so I've had a little bit of
lack<00:03:35.680> a<00:03:36.100> little<00:03:36.430> bit<00:03:36.520> of<00:03:36.610> brown<00:03:36.820> on<00:03:37.150> there<00:03:37.360> and

lack a little bit of brown on there and

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
lack a little bit of brown on there and
just<00:03:39.130> making<00:03:39.340> those<00:03:39.430> teeth<00:03:39.700> look<00:03:39.880> a<00:03:39.970> little

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
just making those teeth look a little

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.199 
just making those teeth look a little
bit<00:03:40.240> more<00:03:40.390> realistic<00:03:44.520> you<00:03:45.520> can<00:03:45.730> see<00:03:45.940> here<00:03:46.150> in

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
bit more realistic you can see here in

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.490 
bit more realistic you can see here in
the<00:03:46.270> video<00:03:46.390> that<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:46.780> blacks<00:03:47.020> not<00:03:47.260> really

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
the video that the blacks not really

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.410 
the video that the blacks not really
translating<00:03:48.100> to<00:03:48.220> these<00:03:48.430> blacks<00:03:48.790> that<00:03:49.270> it's

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
translating to these blacks that it's

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.840 
translating to these blacks that it's
just<00:03:49.720> translating<00:03:50.260> it's<00:03:50.440> a<00:03:50.500> darker<00:03:50.860> value<00:03:51.010> of

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
just translating it's a darker value of

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.949 
just translating it's a darker value of
the<00:03:52.060> colors<00:03:52.330> that<00:03:52.360> I've<00:03:52.600> already<00:03:52.780> put<00:03:52.930> down

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
the colors that I've already put down

00:03:52.959 --> 00:04:05.800 
the colors that I've already put down
that's<00:03:53.410> exactly<00:03:53.950> what<00:03:54.070> I'm<00:03:54.160> going<00:03:54.310> for

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.750 

now<00:04:06.410> I'm<00:04:06.590> telling<00:04:06.800> that<00:04:07.040> black<00:04:07.280> down<00:04:07.459> a<00:04:07.520> little

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
now I'm telling that black down a little

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.809 
now I'm telling that black down a little
bit<00:04:07.970> a<00:04:08.209> little<00:04:08.360> bit<00:04:08.510> of<00:04:08.660> that<00:04:08.750> light<00:04:09.050> red

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
bit a little bit of that light red

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.850 
bit a little bit of that light red
that's<00:04:10.819> going<00:04:11.150> to<00:04:11.390> make<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:11.900> black<00:04:12.080> look<00:04:12.530> even

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
that's going to make the black look even

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.500 
that's going to make the black look even
less<00:04:13.010> light<00:04:13.280> black<00:04:13.520> more<00:04:13.880> like<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.180> tonality

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
less light black more like the tonality

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.610 
less light black more like the tonality
that<00:04:14.810> I'm<00:04:14.930> going<00:04:15.200> for<00:04:17.260> again<00:04:18.260> two<00:04:18.440> more

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
that I'm going for again two more

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.930 
that I'm going for again two more
highlights<00:04:18.829> here<00:04:19.430> there

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.120 

now<00:04:23.940> our<00:04:24.090> lips<00:04:24.300> are<00:04:24.480> starting<00:04:24.690> to<00:04:24.810> look<00:04:24.960> wet<00:04:25.590> or

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
now our lips are starting to look wet or

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.590 
now our lips are starting to look wet or
starting<00:04:26.610> to<00:04:26.670> look<00:04:26.730> three-dimensional<00:04:29.600> we're

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
starting to look three-dimensional we're

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.580 
starting to look three-dimensional we're
going<00:04:30.720> to<00:04:30.780> add<00:04:30.870> a<00:04:30.900> little<00:04:31.080> bit<00:04:31.260> of<00:04:31.350> shadow

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
going to add a little bit of shadow

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.160 
going to add a little bit of shadow
underneath<00:04:31.950> that<00:04:32.250> lip<00:04:32.460> on<00:04:32.670> the<00:04:32.820> team<00:04:33.170> since

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
underneath that lip on the team since

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.990 
underneath that lip on the team since
the<00:04:34.320> teeth<00:04:34.620> are<00:04:34.830> recessed<00:04:35.220> in<00:04:35.460> the<00:04:35.520> mouth<00:04:35.700> we

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
the teeth are recessed in the mouth we

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.430 
the teeth are recessed in the mouth we
want<00:04:36.210> to<00:04:36.420> look<00:04:37.050> that<00:04:37.200> way<00:04:37.380> in<00:04:37.500> our<00:04:37.590> drawing<00:04:38.360> and

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
want to look that way in our drawing and

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
want to look that way in our drawing and
then<00:04:40.440> we're<00:04:40.590> just<00:04:40.620> going<00:04:40.830> to<00:04:40.890> clean<00:04:41.100> up<00:04:41.250> some

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
then we're just going to clean up some

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.670 
then we're just going to clean up some
of<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.610> edges<00:04:41.730> around<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.330> web<00:04:45.410> now<00:04:46.410> try<00:04:46.650> to

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
of the edges around the web now try to

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.270 
of the edges around the web now try to
keep<00:04:46.860> your<00:04:46.920> workspace<00:04:47.550> clean<00:04:47.880> as<00:04:48.150> well<00:04:49.280> now

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
keep your workspace clean as well now

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.350 
keep your workspace clean as well now
I'm<00:04:50.340> going<00:04:50.430> to<00:04:50.550> add<00:04:50.610> a<00:04:50.640> little<00:04:50.910> bit<00:04:51.090> of<00:04:51.120> skin

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
I'm going to add a little bit of skin

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.730 
I'm going to add a little bit of skin
tone<00:04:51.540> around<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:51.870> edges<00:04:52.200> just<00:04:52.230> so<00:04:52.500> you<00:04:52.590> can

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
tone around the edges just so you can

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.880 
tone around the edges just so you can
see<00:04:52.890> the<00:04:53.010> contrast<00:04:53.840> in<00:04:54.840> skin<00:04:55.230> tone<00:04:55.440> no<00:04:55.620> rips

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
see the contrast in skin tone no rips

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.620 
see the contrast in skin tone no rips
I'm<00:04:56.580> not<00:04:56.730> going<00:04:56.850> to<00:04:56.910> spend<00:04:57.120> a<00:04:57.210> whole<00:04:57.240> lot<00:04:57.570> of

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
I'm not going to spend a whole lot of

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.750 
I'm not going to spend a whole lot of
time<00:04:57.870> with<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:58.110> skin<00:04:58.350> tone<00:04:58.380> but<00:04:59.220> just<00:04:59.520> enough

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
time with the skin tone but just enough

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.130 
time with the skin tone but just enough
time<00:04:59.940> so<00:05:00.150> that<00:05:00.300> you<00:05:00.360> can<00:05:00.420> see<00:05:00.630> the<00:05:00.750> contrast

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
time so that you can see the contrast

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.530 
time so that you can see the contrast
between<00:05:02.040> the<00:05:02.340> lips<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.820> skin<00:05:03.060> tone<00:05:03.240> maybe

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
between the lips the skin tone maybe

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.660 
between the lips the skin tone maybe
around<00:05:03.720> it<00:05:06.500> if<00:05:07.500> I<00:05:07.710> was<00:05:07.890> to<00:05:08.040> develop<00:05:08.250> the<00:05:08.460> skin

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
around it if I was to develop the skin

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:09.950 
around it if I was to develop the skin
tone<00:05:08.880> a<00:05:08.910> little<00:05:09.120> bit<00:05:09.210> further<00:05:09.480> I<00:05:09.570> would<00:05:09.750> be

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
tone a little bit further I would be

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.050 
tone a little bit further I would be
sure<00:05:10.200> to<00:05:10.350> use<00:05:10.500> a<00:05:10.530> little<00:05:10.770> bit<00:05:10.920> red<00:05:11.190> maybe

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
sure to use a little bit red maybe

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.130 
sure to use a little bit red maybe
yellow<00:05:12.510> and<00:05:13.280> definitely<00:05:14.280> a<00:05:14.340> little<00:05:14.430> bit<00:05:14.580> white

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
yellow and definitely a little bit white

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.360 
yellow and definitely a little bit white
but<00:05:16.140> this<00:05:16.260> should<00:05:16.470> give<00:05:16.620> me<00:05:16.650> a<00:05:16.770> good<00:05:16.950> idea<00:05:16.980> of

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
but this should give me a good idea of

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.220 
but this should give me a good idea of
what<00:05:17.970> the<00:05:18.120> finished<00:05:18.300> lips<00:05:18.660> would<00:05:18.870> look<00:05:19.050> like

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
what the finished lips would look like

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.950 
what the finished lips would look like
I'm<00:05:20.130> also<00:05:20.310> going<00:05:20.790> to<00:05:20.940> let<00:05:21.120> some<00:05:21.360> of<00:05:21.450> the<00:05:21.510> edges

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
I'm also going to let some of the edges

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.220 
I'm also going to let some of the edges
kind<00:05:22.680> of<00:05:22.910> blend<00:05:23.910> in<00:05:24.090> with<00:05:24.330> the<00:05:24.540> lips<00:05:24.780> because

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
kind of blend in with the lips because

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.500 
kind of blend in with the lips because
the<00:05:25.590> lips<00:05:25.800> don't<00:05:26.070> necessarily<00:05:26.670> just<00:05:26.910> in<00:05:27.030> it's

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
the lips don't necessarily just in it's

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.150 
the lips don't necessarily just in it's
in<00:05:27.780> stars<00:05:28.140> it's<00:05:28.560> kind<00:05:28.740> of<00:05:28.770> a<00:05:28.890> smooth

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
in stars it's kind of a smooth

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:35.820 
in stars it's kind of a smooth
transition<00:05:29.610> between<00:05:29.910> the<00:05:30.150> lips<00:05:30.360> and<00:05:30.600> skinny

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.110 

I'm<00:05:36.830> going<00:05:37.130> to<00:05:37.190> be<00:05:37.280> sure<00:05:37.490> to<00:05:37.520> put<00:05:37.670> a<00:05:37.790> little<00:05:37.970> bit

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
I'm going to be sure to put a little bit

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.700 
I'm going to be sure to put a little bit
of<00:05:38.240> shadow<00:05:38.450> underneath<00:05:38.870> the<00:05:39.080> lips<00:05:39.290> and<00:05:39.590> so

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
of shadow underneath the lips and so

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.500 
of shadow underneath the lips and so
lips<00:05:39.920> protrude<00:05:40.340> out<00:05:40.550> it's<00:05:40.970> always<00:05:41.120> a<00:05:41.240> little

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
lips protrude out it's always a little

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.990 
lips protrude out it's always a little
bit<00:05:41.600> of<00:05:41.690> shadow<00:05:41.870> underneath<00:05:42.380> the<00:05:42.680> lips<00:05:43.000> and

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
bit of shadow underneath the lips and

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.970 
bit of shadow underneath the lips and
