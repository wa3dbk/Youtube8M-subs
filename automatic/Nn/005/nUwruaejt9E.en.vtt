00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.580
 hello in this video I'm going to show you how 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.890
 my operations in the copy trader of 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.110
 of bull I started about a 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:22.090
 month and a half with 400 dollars as you can 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:25.150
 see right now there are 649 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.890
 the strategy that I use is to use 15 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.230
 traders with small amounts of 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.580
 money as you can see here every trader 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.239
 has an amount of money allocated 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:37.660
 more or less equal and the benefits that 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.309
 go have the losses go 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.270
 being each one in your account then 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:46.809
 the trader is using this money to 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.280
 do the operations and the benefits 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.579
 they are going to invest with which they 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.350
 generate 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.289
 a pretty compound interest 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.989
 interesting here you can see the 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.670
 operations that are being made 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.280
 gains that go or lost that go on 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.519
 course you should not give much importance 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.159
 for example of these losses as 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.899
 the great lost wax an operation has been 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.689
 performed is obtained when the 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.689
 operation and not while you are performing 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.270
 as you can see in the history of the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.270
 closed operations 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.790
 here you have all the latest 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.610
 closed operations have last 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.460
 operations as they are obtained 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.680
 during 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.970
 Well, all the time they leave 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.729
 performing operations are obtained 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.940
 small and small benefits 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.210
 constants 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.770
 with alterations in a high number like 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.170
 you can appreciate positive 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.700
 in some case there is some operation 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.579
 negative but as you can appreciate 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.530
 also these negative operations that 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.009
 there may be as in this case they are covered 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.380
 quickly with positive operations to 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.940
 divide all the operative into 15 traders 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.360
 well 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.920
 let's say that the profit or 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.090
 losses are covering each other 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.769
 with which the profit is constant 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.009
 well I hope you liked this
