00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
it has on abs and that kind of stuff and

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:58.970 
it has on abs and that kind of stuff and
there's<00:00:58.020> just<00:00:58.140> no<00:00:58.289> room<00:00:58.500> for<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> law<00:00:58.949> that

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
there's just no room for a law that

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.729 
there's just no room for a law that
stuff<00:00:59.460> so<00:01:00.239> we're<00:01:00.449> going<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.629> cut<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.109> out<00:01:01.350> as

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
stuff so we're going to cut this out as

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.329 
stuff so we're going to cut this out as
you<00:01:02.340> can<00:01:02.430> see<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.820> old<00:01:03.890> f100<00:01:04.890> fender<00:01:05.189> wells

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
you can see the old f100 fender wells

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.830 
you can see the old f100 fender wells
are<00:01:05.549> straight<00:01:05.970> they<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.360> come<00:01:06.600> straight

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
are straight they just come straight

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.770 
are straight they just come straight
down<00:01:07.250> these<00:01:08.250> Crown<00:01:08.580> Vic<00:01:08.850> fender<00:01:09.270> wells<00:01:09.479> are

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
down these Crown Vic fender wells are

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.990 
down these Crown Vic fender wells are
rounded<00:01:10.320> over<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.040> should<00:01:11.520> make<00:01:11.760> some

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
rounded over so that should make some

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.820 
rounded over so that should make some
more<00:01:12.180> room<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.570> areas<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.049> plus<00:01:13.229> like<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.470> said

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
more room in areas and plus like I said

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.890 
more room in areas and plus like I said
it<00:01:14.010> they're<00:01:14.400> designed<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.210> these

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
it they're designed to have these

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.399 
it they're designed to have these
components<00:01:16.590> both<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.430> anyway<00:01:17.850> so

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
components both to it anyway so

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.890 
components both to it anyway so
hopefully<00:01:19.409> we'll<00:01:19.560> make<00:01:19.799> our<00:01:19.979> hood<00:01:20.900> engine

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
hopefully we'll make our hood engine

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.690 
hopefully we'll make our hood engine
compartment<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.470> hood<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.890> mean<00:01:23.100> look<00:01:23.580> a

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
compartment of the hood I mean look a

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.830 
compartment of the hood I mean look a
lot<00:01:23.880> more<00:01:23.939> cleaner<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.780> neater<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:26.750> won't<00:01:27.750> be

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
lot more cleaner and neater and won't be

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.490 
lot more cleaner and neater and won't be
as<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.229> as<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.939> cantankerous<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.900> work<00:01:31.079> on<00:01:31.320> or

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
as a as a cantankerous to work on or

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.910 
as a as a cantankerous to work on or
anything<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.280> no<00:01:32.960> big<00:01:33.960> deal<00:01:34.170> we'll<00:01:34.530> have<00:01:34.740> it

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
anything so no big deal we'll have it

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.160 
anything so no big deal we'll have it
back<00:01:35.670> together<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.119> think<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.570> week<00:01:36.720> or<00:01:36.930> so

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
back together I think in a week or so

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.840 
back together I think in a week or so
and<00:01:37.409> then<00:01:37.680> maybe<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.040> can<00:01:38.159> start<00:01:38.400> looking<00:01:38.549> and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
and then maybe I can start looking and

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.620 
and then maybe I can start looking and
getting<00:01:39.060> dry<00:01:39.270> chef<00:01:39.600> made<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:41.420> doing<00:01:42.420> some

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
getting dry chef made and doing some

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.210 
getting dry chef made and doing some
other<00:01:42.780> things<00:01:42.899> such<00:01:43.320> as<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.649> hopefully

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
other things such as that hopefully

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.010 
other things such as that hopefully
we'll<00:01:44.430> have<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.700> running<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.060> fall<00:01:45.360> later<00:01:45.840> on

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
we'll have it running this fall later on

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.179 
we'll have it running this fall later on
in<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> season<00:01:48.110> this<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.290> not<00:01:49.409> anything<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:50.009> do

parts off everything that was usable and
we<00:02:25.379> got<00:02:25.980> kind<00:02:26.190> of<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.400> chassis<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:26.910> frames<00:02:27.420> a

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
we got kind of a chassis that frames a

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.059 
we got kind of a chassis that frames a
little<00:02:27.720> been<00:02:27.930> on<00:02:28.110> this<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.440> from<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.709> being<00:02:28.920> in

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
little been on this and from it being in

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.430 
little been on this and from it being in
a<00:02:29.129> rear<00:02:29.340> end<00:02:29.489> collision<00:02:29.780> but<00:02:30.780> we<00:02:30.900> removed<00:02:31.290> the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
a rear end collision but we removed the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.830 
a rear end collision but we removed the
body<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.010> set<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.760> engine<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.180> trans<00:02:33.540> out<00:02:33.720> of

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
another one on this chassis we put

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.449 
another one on this chassis we put
bigger<00:02:36.500> pickup<00:02:37.500> truck<00:02:37.739> tires<00:02:38.040> on<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:40.459> what

bigger pickup truck tires on it and what

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.390 
bigger pickup truck tires on it and what
we're<00:02:41.640> what<00:02:41.970> my<00:02:42.120> vision<00:02:43.110> is<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.920> that<00:02:44.280> we're

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
we're what my vision is is that we're

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.039 
we're what my vision is is that we're
probably<00:02:44.549> put<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.000> firewall<00:02:45.510> off<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.840> crown

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
probably put the firewall off the crown

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.199 
probably put the firewall off the crown
vic<00:02:46.230> back<00:02:46.470> on<00:02:46.680> this<00:02:46.890> thing<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.310> then<00:02:48.000> we're

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
vic back on this thing and then we're

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.410 
vic back on this thing and then we're
going<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.480> build<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:49.140> wooden<00:02:49.500> body<00:02:50.239> around<00:02:51.239> us

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
going to build a wooden body around us

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.720 
going to build a wooden body around us
or<00:02:51.599> a<00:02:51.630> cab<00:02:51.989> that's<00:02:52.620> going<00:02:52.799> to<00:02:52.920> resemble<00:02:53.640> a

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
or a cab that's going to resemble a

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.670 
or a cab that's going to resemble a
Humvee<00:02:56.730> or<00:02:57.209> Hummer<00:02:57.870> or<00:02:58.019> whatever<00:02:58.379> you<00:02:58.470> want<00:02:58.590> to

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
Humvee or Hummer or whatever you want to

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.580 
Humvee or Hummer or whatever you want to
call<00:02:58.829> it<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.250> then<00:03:00.239> we<00:03:01.049> are<00:03:01.200> probably<00:03:01.440> going

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
call it and then we are probably going

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.920 
call it and then we are probably going
to<00:03:01.799> put<00:03:01.980> like<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.280> flat<00:03:02.700> dump<00:03:03.090> bed<00:03:03.299> on<00:03:03.569> the<00:03:03.690> back

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
to put like a flat dump bed on the back

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.740 
to put like a flat dump bed on the back
of<00:03:03.959> it<00:03:04.349> and<00:03:06.530> therefore<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:08.040> will<00:03:08.569> serve<00:03:09.569> as<00:03:09.720> a

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
of it and therefore it will serve as a

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.009 
of it and therefore it will serve as a
kind<00:03:10.049> of<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.400> jungle<00:03:11.400> an<00:03:11.910> overgrown<00:03:12.360> john<00:03:12.780> deere

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
is finished and I'm driving it this

project<00:03:36.329> i'm<00:03:36.480> guessing<00:03:36.989> may<00:03:37.290> take<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.620> little

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
project i'm guessing may take a little

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.710 
project i'm guessing may take a little
longer<00:03:38.010> not<00:03:38.609> because<00:03:38.940> it's<00:03:39.090> more<00:03:39.299> complicated

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
longer not because it's more complicated

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.170 
longer not because it's more complicated
the<00:03:40.049> truck<00:03:40.319> but<00:03:40.620> it's<00:03:41.489> going<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.760> be<00:03:41.849> solely

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
the truck but it's going to be solely

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.440 
the truck but it's going to be solely
dependent<00:03:42.599> on<00:03:42.750> school<00:03:43.079> funding<00:03:43.280> so<00:03:44.450> we'll

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
dependent on school funding so we'll

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.909 
dependent on school funding so we'll
just<00:03:45.480> have<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:45.870> do<00:03:45.989> it<00:03:46.109> as<00:03:46.260> school<00:03:46.560> funding

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
just have to do it as school funding

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.009 
just have to do it as school funding
