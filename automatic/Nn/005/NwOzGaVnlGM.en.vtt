wearing<00:01:38.719> those<00:01:39.020> glasses<00:01:39.259> well<00:01:39.979> they're<00:01:40.189> using

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
wearing those glasses well they're using

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.459 
wearing those glasses well they're using
and<00:01:40.729> I<00:01:41.420> hope<00:01:41.569> I<00:01:41.719> get<00:01:41.869> this<00:01:41.990> right<00:01:42.079> they're

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:42.469 
and I hope I get this right they're

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:47.559 
and I hope I get this right they're
using<00:01:42.799> a<00:01:42.889> passive<00:01:43.369> of<00:01:44.439> 3d<00:01:46.240> I'm<00:01:47.240> trying<00:01:47.450> to

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:47.569 
using a passive of 3d I'm trying to

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:48.999 
using a passive of 3d I'm trying to
remember<00:01:47.749> how<00:01:47.959> to<00:01:48.020> how<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.380> say<00:01:48.709> it<00:01:48.859> without

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
remember how to how to say it without

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.800 
remember how to how to say it without
giving<00:01:49.579> away<00:01:49.700> too<00:01:49.789> much<00:01:49.999> because<00:01:50.299> it<00:01:50.479> still<00:01:50.689> is

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
giving away too much because it still is

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.629 
giving away too much because it still is
a<00:01:50.840> concept<00:01:51.319> but<00:01:51.770> they're<00:01:51.950> taking<00:01:52.280> it<00:01:52.369> to<00:01:52.490> where

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:52.639 
a concept but they're taking it to where

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:54.219 
a concept but they're taking it to where
you<00:01:52.759> no<00:01:52.909> longer<00:01:52.939> need<00:01:53.359> the<00:01:53.630> red<00:01:53.810> and<00:01:53.959> the<00:01:54.020> blue

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
you no longer need the red and the blue

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.469 
you no longer need the red and the blue
they're<00:01:54.799> overlaying<00:01:55.340> it<00:01:55.549> slightly<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.450> that

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
they're overlaying it slightly so that

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.719 
they're overlaying it slightly so that
one<00:01:56.869> I<00:01:56.899> even<00:01:57.380> if<00:01:57.469> you<00:01:57.560> close<00:01:57.799> your<00:01:57.829> eye<00:01:57.979> and<00:01:58.369> you

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
one I even if you close your eye and you

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.160 
one I even if you close your eye and you
can<00:01:58.880> still<00:01:59.119> see<00:01:59.299> the<00:01:59.329> greedy<00:01:59.659> whereas<00:01:59.990> before

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
can still see the greedy whereas before

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.319 
can still see the greedy whereas before
you<00:02:00.469> needed<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:00.799> have<00:02:00.950> both<00:02:01.189> eyes<00:02:01.520> in<00:02:01.850> order<00:02:02.179> to

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
you needed to have both eyes in order to

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.239 
you needed to have both eyes in order to
see<00:02:02.389> everything<00:02:02.779> right<00:02:03.319> now<00:02:03.469> what<00:02:04.100> they're

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:04.249 
see everything right now what they're

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.069 
see everything right now what they're
doing<00:02:04.520> is<00:02:04.639> they're<00:02:04.670> kind<00:02:04.969> of<00:02:05.060> overlaying<00:02:05.569> the

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
doing is they're kind of overlaying the

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:07.389 
doing is they're kind of overlaying the
right<00:02:06.259> and<00:02:06.469> left<00:02:06.499> the<00:02:06.829> red<00:02:06.979> and<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.189> blue

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
right and left the red and the blue

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.400 
right and left the red and the blue
they're<00:02:08.090> overlaying<00:02:08.569> it<00:02:08.720> all<00:02:08.899> so<00:02:09.080> it<00:02:09.200> kind<00:02:09.380> of

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
they're overlaying it all so it kind of

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.170 
they're overlaying it all so it kind of
just<00:02:09.590> melts<00:02:09.979> together<00:02:10.130> so<00:02:10.819> you<00:02:10.880> no<00:02:11.150> longer

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
just melts together so you no longer

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.210 
just melts together so you no longer
need<00:02:11.629> the<00:02:11.810> glasses<00:02:11.959> you<00:02:12.470> can<00:02:12.650> cover<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.040> left

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
need the glasses you can cover the left

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.100 
need the glasses you can cover the left
eye<00:02:13.459> and<00:02:13.640> still<00:02:14.060> see<00:02:14.269> the<00:02:14.299> 3d<00:02:14.629> with<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.930> right

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
eye and still see the 3d with the right

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.540 
eye and still see the 3d with the right
eye<00:02:15.140> because<00:02:15.260> as<00:02:15.620> you<00:02:15.739> see<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.370> whole

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
eye because as you see the whole

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.250 
eye because as you see the whole
circumference<00:02:16.940> is<00:02:17.150> covered<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.840> whole<00:02:17.990> 3<00:02:18.200> D

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
circumference is covered the whole 3 D

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.860 
circumference is covered the whole 3 D
spectrum<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:18.980> there<00:02:19.250> so<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.880> LCD<00:02:20.480> layer<00:02:20.690> in

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
spectrum is there so the LCD layer in

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.840 
spectrum is there so the LCD layer in
the<00:02:20.960> barrier<00:02:21.200> level<00:02:21.620> flare<00:02:22.040> is<00:02:22.310> right<00:02:22.610> there

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
the barrier level flare is right there

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.540 
the barrier level flare is right there
you<00:02:23.270> can<00:02:23.390> see<00:02:23.510> with<00:02:23.660> one<00:02:23.810> eye<00:02:23.840> are<00:02:24.110> with<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.550> do

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
you can see with one eye are with to do

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.700 
you can see with one eye are with to do
something<00:02:26.000> at<00:02:26.180> me<00:02:26.390> about<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.020> angle<00:02:27.530> that<00:02:27.650> you

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
something at me about the angle that you

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.160 
something at me about the angle that you
hold<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.160> phone<00:02:28.400> very<00:02:28.850> first<00:02:29.180> is<00:02:29.330> a<00:02:29.360> TV<00:02:29.660> right

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.840 
hold the phone very first is a TV right
well<00:02:30.560> yeah<00:02:30.800> because<00:02:30.980> if<00:02:31.220> you<00:02:31.340> notice<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:31.820> I

up<00:02:35.330> here<00:02:35.570> on<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.780> top<00:02:35.810> there's<00:02:36.320> not<00:02:36.500> much<00:02:36.680> 3d

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
up here on the top there's not much 3d

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.560 
up here on the top there's not much 3d
you<00:02:37.070> can<00:02:37.190> kind<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.430> see<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.640> overlay<00:02:38.030> but<00:02:38.450> as

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
you can kind of see the overlay but as

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.360 
you can kind of see the overlay but as
you<00:02:38.750> go<00:02:38.930> out<00:02:38.960> and<00:02:39.470> get<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.680> direct<00:02:40.100> line<00:02:40.340> of

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
you go out and get a direct line of

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.180 
you go out and get a direct line of
sight<00:02:40.550> to<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.360> 3d<00:02:41.810> phone<00:02:42.110> if<00:02:42.410> it's<00:02:42.920> even

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
sight to the 3d phone if it's even

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.340 
sight to the 3d phone if it's even
better<00:02:43.370> 3d<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:44.030> yeah<00:02:44.180> so<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.510> angle<00:02:44.840> does

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
better 3d so yeah so the angle does

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.080 
better 3d so yeah so the angle does
matter<00:02:45.650> as<00:02:45.860> long<00:02:46.040> as<00:02:46.340> it's<00:02:46.460> slightly<00:02:46.670> tilted

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
matter as long as it's slightly tilted

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.400 
matter as long as it's slightly tilted
but<00:02:47.150> it's<00:02:47.300> just<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.570> way<00:02:47.660> you<00:02:47.720> normally<00:02:47.960> hold

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
but it's just the way you normally hold

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.170 
but it's just the way you normally hold
your<00:02:48.560> handset<00:02:48.980> you'll<00:02:49.550> be<00:02:49.700> able<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:49.910> see<00:02:50.090> the

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
your handset you'll be able to see the

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.300
