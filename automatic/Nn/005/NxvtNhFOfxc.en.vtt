then I'm going to go across the back any
place<00:00:42.660> where<00:00:42.870> juice<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.320> leak

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:58.160

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:21.149 

we<00:01:09.760> get<00:01:10.090> all<00:01:10.240> four<00:01:10.540> posts<00:01:11.020> first

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.289 

and<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.969> last<00:01:22.149> place<00:01:22.540> will<00:01:22.960> be<00:01:23.110> around<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
and the last place will be around the

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:37.149 
and the last place will be around the
escutcheon<00:01:25.750> for<00:01:26.469> the<00:01:27.750> hydraulic<00:01:28.750> press<00:01:29.079> plate

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.910 

and<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.909> last<00:01:38.149> step<00:01:38.450> will<00:01:38.719> be<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:39.439> smooth<00:01:39.770> it

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
and the last step will be to smooth it

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:54.929 
and the last step will be to smooth it
all<00:01:40.070> out<00:01:40.310> with<00:01:40.520> your<00:01:40.759> finger

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.969 

around<00:01:55.539> the<00:01:55.659> outside<00:01:55.689> of<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.320> sheetmetal<00:01:56.619> as

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
around the outside of the sheetmetal as

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.690 
around the outside of the sheetmetal as
well<00:01:57.249> as<00:01:57.939> I'm<00:01:58.210> doing<00:01:58.420> here<00:01:59.310> now<00:02:00.310> what<00:02:00.490> this<00:02:00.640> is

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
well as I'm doing here now what this is

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.410 
well as I'm doing here now what this is
going<00:02:01.060> to<00:02:01.149> do<00:02:01.359> is<00:02:01.689> going<00:02:02.079> to<00:02:02.200> prevent<00:02:03.420> any

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
going to do is going to prevent any

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.749 
going to do is going to prevent any
juice<00:02:04.929> from<00:02:05.469> leaking<00:02:05.950> down<00:02:06.130> below<00:02:06.549> the

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
juice from leaking down below the

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.630 
juice from leaking down below the
sheetmetal<00:02:07.030> and<00:02:07.769> believe<00:02:08.769> me<00:02:08.979> this<00:02:09.190> is<00:02:09.399> going

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
sheetmetal and believe me this is going

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.039 
sheetmetal and believe me this is going
to<00:02:09.810> prevent<00:02:10.810> a<00:02:10.929> lot<00:02:11.260> of<00:02:11.319> headache<00:02:11.950> later<00:02:12.220> and

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
to prevent a lot of headache later and

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:24.280 
to prevent a lot of headache later and
then<00:02:14.049> the<00:02:14.200> last<00:02:14.379> step<00:02:14.590> around

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.309 

and<00:02:24.379> there<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:25.159> have<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:25.370> my<00:02:25.670> friends<00:02:26.300> if<00:02:27.110> you

and there you have it my friends if you

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.710 
and there you have it my friends if you
caulk<00:02:27.650> your<00:02:27.860> hydraulic<00:02:28.430> area<00:02:28.790> you're<00:02:29.540> going

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
caulk your hydraulic area you're going

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.420 
caulk your hydraulic area you're going
to<00:02:29.780> prevent<00:02:30.170> juice<00:02:30.379> from<00:02:30.560> leaking<00:02:30.799> down<00:02:31.069> below

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
to prevent juice from leaking down below

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.420 
to prevent juice from leaking down below
where<00:02:31.909> it<00:02:31.940> will<00:02:32.209> become<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.569> bacteria<00:02:33.230> pit<00:02:33.530> and

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
where it will become a bacteria pit and

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.170 
where it will become a bacteria pit and
a<00:02:34.610> place<00:02:34.849> for<00:02:35.120> germs<00:02:35.480> growing<00:02:36.019> and<00:02:36.110> even<00:02:36.260> mold

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
a place for germs growing and even mold

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.300 
a place for germs growing and even mold
now<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.239> very<00:02:38.569> last<00:02:38.840> step<00:02:39.140> is<00:02:39.440> going<00:02:39.769> to<00:02:39.860> be<00:02:39.950> to

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
now the very last step is going to be to

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.150 
now the very last step is going to be to
install<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:41.060> press<00:02:41.330> plate<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:42.230> we're<00:02:42.950> going

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.380 
install the press plate and we're going
to<00:02:43.220> screw<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:44.170> guidepost<00:02:45.170> into<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:45.860> little

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
to screw the guidepost into the little

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.229 
to screw the guidepost into the little
seat<00:02:47.390> in<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.349> bottom<00:02:48.709> well<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.730> first<00:02:50.030> thing

we do is put in the guidepost find vise
where<00:02:58.430> you<00:02:58.549> screw<00:02:58.790> it<00:02:58.940> in<00:02:59.060> tighten<00:03:00.019> it<00:03:00.110> all<00:03:00.230> the

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
where you screw it in tighten it all the

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:07.059 
where you screw it in tighten it all the
way<00:03:00.500> down<00:03:03.190> put<00:03:04.190> it<00:03:04.310> in<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.549> post<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:05.920> you<00:03:06.920> will
