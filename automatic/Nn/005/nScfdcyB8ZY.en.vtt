so<00:00:52.370> we're<00:00:52.550> here<00:00:52.700> the<00:00:53.000> Salmon<00:00:53.360> River<00:00:54.070> this<00:00:55.070> is<00:00:55.340> a

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
so we're here the Salmon River this is a

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.470 
so we're here the Salmon River this is a
rotary<00:00:56.300> screw<00:00:56.690> trap<00:00:57.050> this<00:00:57.620> is<00:00:57.680> one<00:00:58.250> for<00:00:59.120> that

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
rotary screw trap this is one for that

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.210 
rotary screw trap this is one for that
we're<00:00:59.660> running<00:00:59.989> this<00:01:00.110> year<00:01:00.350> this<00:01:00.830> year<00:01:00.890> we're

we're running this year this year we're

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.660 
we're running this year this year we're
doing<00:01:01.520> in<00:01:01.610> the<00:01:01.700> Salmon<00:01:02.090> River<00:01:02.170> still<00:01:03.170> Creek

recapture them in this small trap and

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.380 
recapture them in this small trap and

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
fish and if we didn't pay attention to

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.310 
fish and if we didn't pay attention to
