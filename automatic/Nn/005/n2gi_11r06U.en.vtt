00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello friends how are I bringing you a 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.779
 news regarding grand theft auto 5 and 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.700
 I hope you have started a series 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.920
 of rounds of questions and answers 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.840
 about grand theft auto 5 in which 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.940
 They will try to solve some questions 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.460
 that fans of the series need to know 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.400
 and also know them 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.410
 this is the first compendium of them and 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.500
 it is assumed that from time to time we 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.420
 they will arrive more if they were willing to 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.730
 get more information about one of the 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.890
 most anticipated games of the generation is 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.410
 It is likely that this document will obtain the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.930
 answer 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.060
 michael franklin and trevor have their 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.550
 own separate lives with their own 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.410
 groups of friends and acquaintances and even 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.809
 your own ways to spend your time 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.210
 free when you 're not on a mission 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.739
 can change freely in real time 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.050
 for any of the three characters 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.330
 to enter and leave your life that you 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.550
 lets see what they are doing and why 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.769
 what have their own schedules never 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.960
 they know what they could be doing is 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.150
 possible to visit maikel in the middle of a 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.550
 family dispute interrupts franklin 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.619
 conversing with some women or trevor 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.420
 breaking the law or any other 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.119
 thing that these guys do in their time 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.190
 free how and when you switch between 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.009
 characters when you're not on a mission 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.440
 It depends completely on you in addition 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.080
 each one of the boys has his own 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.300
 missions and secondary jobs there will be 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.490
 times on a mission when you play 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.770
 as a character or as combinations 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.259
 of two of them and sometimes like the three 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.720
 will always be able to change between 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.789
 characters in the middle of the action can 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.410
 play alone as a character during 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.090
 the whole game or hang out with 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.909
 any of them 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.859
 in the open world the characters are 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.170
 destined to live their own lives 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:49.060
 permanent and unpredictable personal 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.950
 so it is understandable that no 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.170
 It is always easy to follow one of them 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.149
 in the great city of saints or the 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.799
 many cities spread over the 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.369
 blaine county at any given time 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.990
 but you will be able to find them 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.700
 after having found them it will be 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.130
 able to hang out with them 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.649
 annoy the people you choose and maybe 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.560
 even assault them but you will not be 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.630
 able to kill them they all have a 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.420
 remarkable resilience and 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.400
 good medical insurance the game is based on 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.319
 play all parts of the stories 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.840
 intertwined with these three characters 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.810
 definitely kill a character 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.970
 main would not make sense however 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.099
 it is possible to find a way to hurt 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.090
 seriously one of the characters and that 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.090
 I ended up in the hospital 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.870
 as in all previous 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.490
 ' grand theft auto' games we include a 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.200
 map of the world to help the 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.780
 players in the navigation of the city 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.600
 in all versions of grand theft 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.270
 auto 5 the game disc will accompany a 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.310
 map with all the details of the world the 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.860
 great change is that as this game has 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.210
 such a large map created a poster 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.460
 double-sided so that the players 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.560
 have all the information you could 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.020
 be necessary to discover and explore 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.700
 the world the flat map in the other 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.960
 editions contains a lot of 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.470
 additional information and secrets in it 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.470
 ah 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.300
 We are working hard to make the 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.100
 special edition and edition of 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.080

 hoping to solve some issues with the 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.590
 customs and have to be resolved 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.240
 before talking to retailers for 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.950
 all those who have doubts about 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.960

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.819
 customizable with a series of improvements 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.650

 we have nothing to say about the 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.370
 possibility of new platforms

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.600
 we are very excited to be able 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.810
 present it at some time in this 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.810
 summer 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.280
 since grand theft auto 'fourth was 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.259
 launched we have sought to integrate the 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.270
 stronger and innovative methods for 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:36.940
 detect and prevent each of our 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.070
 titles we are determined to create a 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.410
 Game place as fair and fun 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.150
 that is possible, there will always be 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.160
 some people who want to do 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.560
 trap but let's do everything 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.900
 possible to stop it we have dedicated 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.970
 a lot of time and effort making a 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.800
 incredible online experience and the 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.800
 Adequate support is part of it 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:01.699
 we hope that players have the 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:04.729
 same game experience on ps3 and 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:07.249
 xbox360 since both games have been 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:09.469
 developed in parallel as in all 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:11.539
 our games we have the confidence of 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:13.969
 commit to guarantee that grand 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:16.490
 Theft auto will look the same regardless of the 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:18.159
 talk we hope that the differences 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.159
 visuals are completely 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:21.159
 insignificant 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.260
 there's nothing to worry about 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:29.810
 that we are not very sure of what 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:33.229
 you're smelling coffee will be available 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:35.770
