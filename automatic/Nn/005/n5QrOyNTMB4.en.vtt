this dryer is that it has two buttons so
one<00:02:50.400> rotates<00:02:50.910> in<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.780> clockwise<00:02:51.810> motion<00:02:52.560> and

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
one rotates in the clockwise motion and

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.670 
one rotates in the clockwise motion and
one<00:02:53.099> rotates<00:02:53.489> counterclockwise<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.140> am

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
one rotates counterclockwise and so I am

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
rotate in the other direction going back

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.960 
rotate in the other direction going back
so<00:03:13.170> I<00:03:13.200> let<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.470> go<00:03:13.680> down<00:03:14.220> one<00:03:14.430> way<00:03:14.579> and<00:03:14.819> then<00:03:14.880> I

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
so I let it go down one way and then I

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.430 
so I let it go down one way and then I
spin<00:03:15.239> it<00:03:15.329> in<00:03:15.389> the<00:03:15.480> opposite<00:03:15.810> direction<00:03:15.930> once<00:03:16.349> I

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
spin it in the opposite direction once I

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.120 
spin it in the opposite direction once I
let<00:03:16.620> go<00:03:16.650> of<00:03:16.920> it<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.599> now<00:03:18.599> I<00:03:18.630> do<00:03:18.930> brush<00:03:19.709> out<00:03:19.950> my

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
let go of it and now I do brush out my

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.750 
let go of it and now I do brush out my
hair<00:03:20.370> with<00:03:20.639> a<00:03:20.910> large<00:03:21.599> wide<00:03:22.200> tooth<00:03:22.470> comb<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:23.040> I

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
hair with a large wide tooth comb and I

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.849 
hair with a large wide tooth comb and I
do<00:03:23.819> this<00:03:24.269> three<00:03:24.870> times<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:25.319> repeat<00:03:25.560> three<00:03:25.829> times

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
do this three times I repeat three times

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.740 
do this three times I repeat three times
so<00:03:26.250> I<00:03:26.280> separate<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.760> into<00:03:26.819> sections<00:03:27.150> again<00:03:27.450> and

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
so I separate it into sections again and

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.720 
so I separate it into sections again and
I<00:03:28.019> found<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.440> three<00:03:28.799> times<00:03:29.010> is<00:03:29.340> like<00:03:29.549> my

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
I found that three times is like my

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.420 
I found that three times is like my
magic<00:03:30.090> number<00:03:30.389> for<00:03:30.419> my<00:03:30.660> blowout<00:03:30.900> if<00:03:31.200> you<00:03:31.769> don't

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
magic number for my blowout if you don't

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.759 
magic number for my blowout if you don't
dry<00:03:32.819> your<00:03:32.849> hair<00:03:33.299> quite<00:03:33.750> as<00:03:33.930> much<00:03:34.079> as<00:03:34.260> i<00:03:34.349> do<00:03:34.410> like

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
dry your hair quite as much as i do like

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.259 
dry your hair quite as much as i do like
eighty<00:03:34.980> percent<00:03:35.160> dry<00:03:35.459> if<00:03:35.579> you<00:03:35.700> did<00:03:35.849> it<00:03:35.940> sixty

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
eighty percent dry if you did it sixty

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.030 
eighty percent dry if you did it sixty
percent<00:03:36.419> dry<00:03:36.810> or<00:03:37.019> fifty<00:03:37.319> percent<00:03:37.620> dry<00:03:37.859> or

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
percent dry or fifty percent dry or

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.830 
percent dry or fifty percent dry or
something<00:03:38.280> around<00:03:38.370> there<00:03:38.639> and<00:03:38.849> finish<00:03:39.480> drying

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
something around there and finish drying

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.120 
something around there and finish drying
it<00:03:40.019> with<00:03:40.169> this<00:03:40.319> brush<00:03:40.500> you<00:03:40.709> probably<00:03:40.980> would

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
it with this brush you probably would

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.190 
it with this brush you probably would
only<00:03:41.280> need<00:03:41.489> to<00:03:41.579> go<00:03:41.730> over<00:03:41.849> it<00:03:42.030> once<00:03:42.599> maybe<00:03:42.989> twice

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
only need to go over it once maybe twice

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.440 
only need to go over it once maybe twice
but<00:03:43.980> because<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.340> dry<00:03:44.549> my<00:03:44.700> hair<00:03:44.849> most<00:03:45.120> of<00:03:45.329> the

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
but because I dry my hair most of the

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.420 
but because I dry my hair most of the
way<00:03:45.599> to<00:03:45.660> give<00:03:46.079> it<00:03:46.200> that<00:03:46.349> curl<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:47.010> that<00:03:47.160> shape

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
way to give it that curl and that shape

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.759 
way to give it that curl and that shape
and<00:03:47.639> that<00:03:47.730> lift<00:03:48.030> that<00:03:48.150> I<00:03:48.209> want<00:03:48.480> it<00:03:48.569> to<00:03:48.630> have<00:03:48.900> I

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
and that lift that I want it to have I

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.589 
and that lift that I want it to have I
go<00:03:50.459> over<00:03:50.639> it<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.790> few<00:03:50.940> times<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.329> it's<00:03:51.450> just

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
go over it a few times and it's just

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.780 
go over it a few times and it's just
faster<00:03:51.840> than<00:03:52.200> me<00:03:52.380> blow<00:03:52.590> drying<00:03:52.859> it<00:03:53.040> with<00:03:53.250> the

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
faster than me blow drying it with the

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.390 
faster than me blow drying it with the
air<00:03:53.970> coming<00:03:54.480> straight<00:03:54.840> out<00:03:54.900> of<00:03:55.049> the<00:03:55.470> iron

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
air coming straight out of the iron

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.089 
air coming straight out of the iron
because<00:03:56.940> it<00:03:57.239> does<00:03:57.480> not<00:03:57.510> blow<00:03:57.989> really<00:03:58.859> really

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
because it does not blow really really

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.220 
because it does not blow really really
hard<00:03:59.280> air<00:03:59.519> it<00:03:59.700> just<00:03:59.910> blows<00:04:00.060> kind<00:04:00.359> of<00:04:00.480> soft<00:04:00.780> warm

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
hard air it just blows kind of soft warm

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.740 
hard air it just blows kind of soft warm
air<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.739> so<00:04:02.669> it's<00:04:02.910> not<00:04:03.180> it's<00:04:03.389> going<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.569> take

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
air and so it's not it's going to take

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.150 
air and so it's not it's going to take
you<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:03.870> long<00:04:04.019> time<00:04:04.230> to<00:04:04.290> dry<00:04:04.500> your<00:04:04.650> head<00:04:04.859> just

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
you a long time to dry your head just

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.349 
you a long time to dry your head just
with<00:04:05.340> that<00:04:05.489> if<00:04:05.700> that's<00:04:05.730> all<00:04:06.030> that<00:04:06.209> you<00:04:06.299> are
