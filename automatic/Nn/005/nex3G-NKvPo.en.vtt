00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:03.659
Hello everybody, there is the date and time.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.000
This is going to be the demonstration

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.960
of the Brother FAX575 fax machine

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.560
It's in my grandma's house over here;

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.520
they actually have telephone service

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.614
in my house we don't.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.960
So now, let's go ahead and send this fax

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.400
to (a) 1-800 test fax (number)

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.704
The side you want to fax will go face down.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.725
Just load it in and enter the number (you want to fax to)

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.960
It is 1-877

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.180
268

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.700
9575

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.480
Now we will hit

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.020
start fax

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.760
[Phone dial tone]

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.220
[Dialing number]

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.940
It's dialing right now--

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.680
just finished dialing.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.891
Now it's scanning.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.920
Sending page 1

00:01:21.704 --> 00:01:23.064
looks like it sent it

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.960
that's good

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.800
and I guess we'll get a fax response back

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.840
some time soon.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.200
See if it will print a transmission (log)

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.660
Prints on the other side;

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.803
so here's the report.

00:02:08.981 --> 00:02:10.821
You can see the date and time

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.880
it only took 41 seconds (to send);

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.509
so that will be it for the test

00:02:15.152 --> 00:02:17.152
Thank you all for watching and

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.520
please check out the other videos on my channel

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.760
A video showing receiving the fax

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.949
will be coming soon.
