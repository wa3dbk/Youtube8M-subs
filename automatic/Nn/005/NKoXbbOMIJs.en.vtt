see when we get up to the quarry is

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.009 
see when we get up to the quarry is
we'll<00:00:39.020> see<00:00:39.230> a<00:00:39.379> real<00:00:39.940> amazing<00:00:40.940> diversity<00:00:41.840> of

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019 
we'll see a real amazing diversity of

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:44.770 
we'll see a real amazing diversity of
body<00:00:42.470> plants<00:00:43.010> so<00:00:43.820> we<00:00:43.940> see<00:00:44.090> creatures<00:00:44.330> that

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
body plants so we see creatures that

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.670 
body plants so we see creatures that
we're<00:00:44.989> predators

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
we're predators

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.189 
we're predators
creatures<00:00:46.430> that<00:00:46.960> would<00:00:47.960> have<00:00:48.080> been

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
creatures that would have been

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
very bottom of the food chain and

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.070 
very bottom of the food chain and
animals<00:00:52.940> with<00:00:53.089> all<00:00:53.210> kinds<00:00:53.480> of<00:00:53.540> defensive

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.850 

a<00:01:06.450> visit<00:01:07.450> to<00:01:07.480> the<00:01:07.630> Burgess<00:01:07.930> Shale<00:01:08.110> is<00:01:08.410> very

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
a visit to the Burgess Shale is very

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.760 
a visit to the Burgess Shale is very
special<00:01:09.490> because<00:01:09.790> you<00:01:10.000> really<00:01:10.330> get<00:01:10.540> to<00:01:10.900> be

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
special because you really get to be

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.930 
special because you really get to be
hands-on<00:01:12.400> with<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.760> rock<00:01:12.940> to<00:01:13.690> step<00:01:14.260> into<00:01:14.940> a

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
hands-on with the rock to step into a

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.680 
hands-on with the rock to step into a
little<00:01:16.330> bit<00:01:16.420> of<00:01:16.450> history<00:01:16.960> and<00:01:17.760> see<00:01:18.760> some

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
little bit of history and see some

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.530 
little bit of history and see some
spectacular<00:01:20.350> fossils<00:01:21.190> and<00:01:21.400> do<00:01:21.820> it<00:01:22.000> in<00:01:22.240> a

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
spectacular fossils and do it in a

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.410 
spectacular fossils and do it in a
fantastic<00:01:23.350> surrounding<00:01:23.979> I<00:01:24.130> mean<00:01:24.310> one<00:01:25.060> of<00:01:25.090> the

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
fantastic surrounding I mean one of the

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.800 
fantastic surrounding I mean one of the
most<00:01:25.720> beautiful<00:01:26.200> spots<00:01:26.260> on<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.650> planet

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.420 

so<00:01:33.080> the<00:01:33.200> mountains<00:01:33.530> are<00:01:33.650> young<00:01:33.830> but<00:01:34.130> falling

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
so the mountains are young but falling

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.150 
so the mountains are young but falling
apart<00:01:34.970> but<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.050> burgess<00:01:36.410> shale<00:01:36.530> fossils<00:01:36.980> are

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
apart but the burgess shale fossils are

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.190 
apart but the burgess shale fossils are
ancient<00:01:37.400> half<00:01:37.880> a<00:01:38.120> billion<00:01:38.330> years<00:01:38.540> old<00:01:39.050> and

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
ancient half a billion years old and

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.469 
ancient half a billion years old and
still<00:01:39.530> perfectly<00:01:40.070> preserved<00:01:40.370> waiting<00:01:41.240> for<00:01:41.420> us

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
still perfectly preserved waiting for us

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.680 
still perfectly preserved waiting for us
to<00:01:41.630> come<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.050> see<00:01:46.000> this<00:01:47.000> is<00:01:47.150> more<00:01:47.360> than<00:01:47.510> what<00:01:47.660> I

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
to come and see this is more than what I

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.320 
to come and see this is more than what I
expected<00:01:47.780> I<00:01:48.470> didn't<00:01:49.010> I<00:01:49.100> didn't<00:01:49.310> really<00:01:49.460> expect

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
expected I didn't I didn't really expect

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.870 
expected I didn't I didn't really expect
that<00:01:50.450> much<00:01:50.720> other<00:01:50.930> than<00:01:51.020> a<00:01:51.200> long<00:01:51.380> hike<00:01:51.650> but<00:01:52.100> has

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
that much other than a long hike but has

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.790 
that much other than a long hike but has
its<00:01:53.210> benefits<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:53.900> it's<00:01:54.380> definitely<00:01:54.590> been

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
its benefits and it's definitely been

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.490 
its benefits and it's definitely been
nice<00:01:54.950> to<00:01:55.160> stop<00:01:55.400> and<00:01:55.670> enjoy<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.660> scenery<00:01:57.140> and

especially to get up here and kind of
look<00:02:00.140> around<00:02:00.350> for<00:02:00.500> fossils<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.040> stuff<00:02:01.220> like

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340
