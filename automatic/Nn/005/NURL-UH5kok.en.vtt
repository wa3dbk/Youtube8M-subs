that<00:01:46.560> shit<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.130> point<00:01:47.430> where<00:01:47.610> it's<00:01:47.729> only

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
that shit to the point where it's only

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.330 
that shit to the point where it's only
at<00:01:48.210> two<00:01:48.570> seconds<00:01:49.079> at<00:01:49.170> best<00:01:49.470> or<00:01:49.740> better<00:01:50.189> yet

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
instead when you do to counter-attack it

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.319
