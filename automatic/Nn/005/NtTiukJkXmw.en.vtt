00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.039 
biggest con in my opinion is the slower
reload<00:01:52.740> time<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.399> cannot<00:01:54.390> get<00:01:54.630> over<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.899> if

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
reload time I cannot get over it if

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.539 
reload time I cannot get over it if
you're<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.439> me<00:01:55.649> if<00:01:55.860> you're<00:01:55.950> an<00:01:56.100> impatient

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
you're like me if you're an impatient

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.569 
you're like me if you're an impatient
bastard<00:01:57.240> like<00:01:57.420> me<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:58.380> very<00:01:58.829> hard<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.369> get

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
bastard like me it is very hard to get

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.670 
bastard like me it is very hard to get
over<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.909> fact<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.299> takes<00:02:00.570> another<00:02:01.409> like

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
over the fact that it takes another like

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.859 
over the fact that it takes another like
quarter<00:02:02.280> second<00:02:02.790> like<00:02:02.939> point<00:02:03.210> two<00:02:03.479> or<00:02:03.630> three

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
quarter second like point two or three

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.630 
quarter second like point two or three
seconds<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.320> get<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.590> other<00:02:04.740> rocket<00:02:05.219> into

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
seconds to get that other rocket into

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.969 
seconds to get that other rocket into
the<00:02:05.759> chamber<00:02:06.240> it's<00:02:07.020> actually<00:02:07.409> another<00:02:07.619> reason

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
the chamber it's actually another reason

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.949 
the chamber it's actually another reason
why<00:02:08.129> it's<00:02:08.340> taken<00:02:08.700> me<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:09.030> long<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.660> get<00:02:09.750> this

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
why it's taken me so long to get this

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.050 
why it's taken me so long to get this
gameplay<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.649> cuz<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.430> just<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.790> get<00:02:11.970> in

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
gameplay is cuz I just I get in

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.880 
gameplay is cuz I just I get in
one-on-one<00:02:12.480> fights<00:02:12.720> with<00:02:12.900> somebody<00:02:13.200> I

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
one-on-one fights with somebody I

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.320 
one-on-one fights with somebody I
burn<00:02:14.040> through<00:02:14.340> all<00:02:14.430> my<00:02:14.550> rockets<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.240> then

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
burn through all my rockets and then

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.199 
burn through all my rockets and then
it's<00:02:15.480> like<00:02:15.630> junk<00:02:16.680> sure<00:02:17.310> Chunkin<00:02:17.819> by<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.000> time

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
it's like junk sure Chunkin by the time

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.370 
it's like junk sure Chunkin by the time
I<00:02:18.240> get<00:02:18.510> one<00:02:18.660> or<00:02:18.810> two<00:02:18.840> back

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
I get one or two back

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.040 
I get one or two back
I'm<00:02:19.440> just<00:02:20.130> instantly<00:02:20.520> dead<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.090> if<00:02:21.750> but<00:02:21.930> if

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
I'm just instantly dead and if but if

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.690 
I'm just instantly dead and if but if
you<00:02:22.170> can<00:02:22.380> handle<00:02:22.709> that<00:02:22.860> if<00:02:23.069> you<00:02:23.220> can<00:02:23.370> handle

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
you can handle that if you can handle

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.760 
you can handle that if you can handle
the<00:02:23.910> little<00:02:24.720> bit<00:02:24.810> lower<00:02:24.959> damage<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:25.650> can

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
the little bit lower damage and you can

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.520 
the little bit lower damage and you can
handle<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.160> reload<00:02:26.550> time<00:02:26.600> it<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.750> definitely

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
handle the reload time it is definitely

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.290 
handle the reload time it is definitely
a<00:02:28.560> rocket<00:02:29.010> launcher<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.550> should<00:02:29.790> look<00:02:29.970> into

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
a rocket launcher you should look into

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.350 
a rocket launcher you should look into
and<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:31.740> could<00:02:31.950> say<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.459> this<00:02:32.580> weapon<00:02:32.970> does

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
and you could say that this weapon does

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.260 
and you could say that this weapon does
not<00:02:33.690> need<00:02:33.930> ammo<00:02:34.560> but<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.459> be<00:02:35.610> totally<00:02:35.790> honest

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
not need ammo but to be totally honest

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
not need ammo but to be totally honest
with<00:02:36.300> you<00:02:36.390> guys<00:02:36.570> I<00:02:36.780> don't<00:02:36.840> think<00:02:36.959> that's<00:02:37.200> an

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
with you guys I don't think that's an

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.470 
with you guys I don't think that's an
issue<00:02:37.380> anyways<00:02:37.860> because<00:02:38.490> how<00:02:39.120> many<00:02:39.270> times

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
issue anyways because how many times

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.390 
issue anyways because how many times
have<00:02:39.630> you<00:02:39.660> had<00:02:39.930> zero<00:02:39.959> rockets<00:02:40.770> in<00:02:40.920> your<00:02:41.070> rocket

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
have you had zero rockets in your rocket

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.430 
have you had zero rockets in your rocket
launcher<00:02:41.430> because<00:02:42.239> running<00:02:42.510> over<00:02:42.840> any<00:02:43.050> weapon

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
launcher because running over any weapon

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.930 
launcher because running over any weapon
or<00:02:43.530> picking<00:02:43.890> up<00:02:43.950> ammo<00:02:44.280> it's<00:02:44.430> really<00:02:44.730> not<00:02:44.880> that

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
or picking up ammo it's really not that

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.020 
or picking up ammo it's really not that
difficult<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.750> stay<00:02:46.220> above<00:02:47.220> like<00:02:47.700> eight<00:02:47.970> or

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
difficult to stay above like eight or

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.240 
difficult to stay above like eight or
nine<00:02:48.330> rockets<00:02:48.989> in<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.140> chamber<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:49.709> I<00:02:49.920> don't

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
nine rockets in the chamber so I don't

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.150 
nine rockets in the chamber so I don't
see<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.520> as<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.670> big<00:02:50.850> issue<00:02:50.970> so<00:02:51.560> now<00:02:52.560> while<00:02:52.890> the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
see that as a big issue so now while the

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.640 
see that as a big issue so now while the
second<00:02:53.790> gameplay<00:02:54.300> plays<00:02:54.600> in<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.200> gameplay

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
second gameplay plays in the gameplay

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.640 
second gameplay plays in the gameplay
plays<00:02:56.190> that's<00:02:56.519> a<00:02:56.700> great<00:02:57.060> word<00:02:57.380> so<00:02:58.380> while<00:02:58.530> these

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
plays that's a great word so while these

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.259 
plays that's a great word so while these
second<00:02:59.040> gameplay<00:02:59.370> is<00:02:59.519> in<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.730> background

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
second gameplay is in the background

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.729 
second gameplay is in the background
there's<00:03:00.540> two<00:03:00.720> gameplays<00:03:01.110> both<00:03:01.380> of<00:03:01.530> them<00:03:01.620> on

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
there's two gameplays both of them on

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.470
