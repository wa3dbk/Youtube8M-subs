00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
we're staying together right now I felt

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.289 
we're staying together right now I felt
like<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.380> was<00:01:13.530> very<00:01:13.880> passive<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.090> first

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
like I was very passive in the first

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.300 
like I was very passive in the first
half

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
half

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.740 
half
that's<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:16.640> reason<00:01:16.880> why<00:01:16.909> coach<00:01:17.210> took<00:01:17.450> me<00:01:17.659> out

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
that's the reason why coach took me out

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.960 
that's the reason why coach took me out
I<00:01:17.990> wasn't<00:01:18.259> really<00:01:18.470> doing<00:01:19.340> anything<00:01:19.640> on<00:01:19.880> the

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
I wasn't really doing anything on the

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.789 
I wasn't really doing anything on the
