really glad that this mod overlooks most

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.759 
really glad that this mod overlooks most
of<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.910> building<00:02:17.269> materials<00:02:17.720> that<00:02:17.810> we<00:02:18.350> use<00:02:18.590> in

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
of the building materials that we use in

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.949 
of the building materials that we use in
our<00:02:18.860> everyday<00:02:19.299> buildings<00:02:20.299> you<00:02:20.480> know<00:02:20.600> like

our everyday buildings you know like
planks<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.970> let's<00:02:22.970> see<00:02:23.180> if<00:02:23.510> we<00:02:23.660> look<00:02:23.810> through

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
planks and let's see if we look through

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.140 
planks and let's see if we look through
here<00:02:24.200> we<00:02:24.349> got<00:02:24.500> wolves<00:02:24.770> wolves<00:02:25.550> doesn't<00:02:25.910> do<00:02:26.000> it

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
here we got wolves wolves doesn't do it

here we got wolves wolves doesn't do it
I<00:02:26.330> want<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:26.780> see<00:02:26.840> if<00:02:26.930> ice<00:02:27.140> does<00:02:27.470> it<00:02:27.620> because

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
I want to see if ice does it because

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
I want to see if ice does it because
that'd<00:02:28.069> be<00:02:28.129> kind<00:02:28.310> of<00:02:28.340> weird

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
that'd be kind of weird

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.560 
that'd be kind of weird
and<00:02:28.970> shouldn't<00:02:29.650> or<00:02:30.650> blocks<00:02:31.640> don't<00:02:31.970> I<00:02:32.300> think

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
and shouldn't or blocks don't I think

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.990 
and shouldn't or blocks don't I think
ORS<00:02:32.930> do<00:02:33.350> though<00:02:33.590> so<00:02:33.830> let's<00:02:34.010> get<00:02:34.460> some<00:02:34.640> diamond

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
ORS do though so let's get some diamond

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.460 
ORS do though so let's get some diamond
door<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:35.270> see<00:02:35.390> how<00:02:35.450> that<00:02:35.660> looks<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.080> maybe<00:02:36.290> in

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
door and see how that looks and maybe in

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.630 
door and see how that looks and maybe in
the<00:02:36.590> Emerald<00:02:36.890> because<00:02:37.190> maybe<00:02:37.370> they<00:02:37.550> forgot

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
the Emerald because maybe they forgot

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.150 
the Emerald because maybe they forgot
the<00:02:37.910> Emerald<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.240> don't<00:02:38.420> know<00:02:38.740> any<00:02:39.740> of<00:02:39.950> just

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
the Emerald I don't know any of just

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.880 
the Emerald I don't know any of just
normal<00:02:40.340> blocks<00:02:40.790> like<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:41.390> so<00:02:41.780> we<00:02:42.260> put<00:02:42.440> down<00:02:42.620> a

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
normal blocks like that so we put down a

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.940 
normal blocks like that so we put down a
jack-o'-lantern<00:02:43.480> it's<00:02:44.480> normal<00:02:44.990> if<00:02:45.410> we<00:02:45.680> put

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
jack-o'-lantern it's normal if we put

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.900 
jack-o'-lantern it's normal if we put
down<00:02:46.070> some<00:02:46.250> ice<00:02:46.810> that<00:02:47.810> happens<00:02:48.320> and<00:02:48.590> so<00:02:49.550> any

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
down some ice that happens and so any

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.480 
down some ice that happens and so any
natural<00:02:50.420> block<00:02:50.930> with<00:02:51.170> this<00:02:51.290> mod<00:02:51.530> kinda

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
natural block with this mod kinda

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.570 
natural block with this mod kinda
conforms<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.660> weird<00:02:54.190> terrain<00:02:55.190> that<00:02:55.460> we

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
conforms to the weird terrain that we

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.120 
conforms to the weird terrain that we
have<00:02:55.760> going<00:02:56.150> on<00:02:56.270> and<00:02:56.680> it's<00:02:57.680> just<00:02:57.800> really

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
the fact that if you have a you know

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.590 
the fact that if you have a you know
fake<00:03:37.370> block<00:03:37.640> you<00:03:37.820> can<00:03:37.970> still<00:03:38.150> build<00:03:38.300> with<00:03:38.510> it

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
fake block you can still build with it

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.320 
fake block you can still build with it
so<00:03:38.810> what's<00:03:39.410> kind<00:03:39.590> of<00:03:39.680> cool<00:03:39.800> is<00:03:39.860> if<00:03:40.160> you<00:03:40.330> dig

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
so what's kind of cool is if you dig

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.300

down<00:03:41.570> yes<00:03:42.080> that<00:03:42.320> is<00:03:42.470> what<00:03:42.620> a<00:03:42.650> hole<00:03:42.920> looks<00:03:43.130> like

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
down yes that is what a hole looks like

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.070 
down yes that is what a hole looks like
in<00:03:43.430> this<00:03:43.520> mod<00:03:43.760> and<00:03:43.940> you<00:03:44.030> placed<00:03:44.270> a<00:03:44.450> fictional

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
in this mod and you placed a fictional

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.540 
in this mod and you placed a fictional
bot<00:03:45.260> or<00:03:45.500> you<00:03:45.620> know<00:03:45.740> like<00:03:45.890> a<00:03:45.920> man-made<00:03:46.280> block

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
bot or you know like a man-made block

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.090 
bot or you know like a man-made block
like<00:03:46.850> cobblestone<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:48.410> ground<00:03:48.650> kind<00:03:48.980> of

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
like cobblestone the ground kind of

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.710 
like cobblestone the ground kind of
rises<00:03:49.640> to<00:03:49.760> meet<00:03:49.910> it<00:03:50.090> and<00:03:50.120> make<00:03:50.420> things<00:03:50.570> look

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
rises to meet it and make things look

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.320 
rises to meet it and make things look
more<00:03:50.840> flush<00:03:51.320> so<00:03:51.650> you<00:03:52.220> dig<00:03:52.370> a<00:03:52.460> hole<00:03:52.490> there<00:03:53.180> you

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
more flush so you dig a hole there you

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.240 
more flush so you dig a hole there you
go<00:03:53.480> so<00:03:53.930> it's<00:03:54.050> pretty<00:03:54.170> cool<00:03:54.500> another<00:03:55.040> cool

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
go so it's pretty cool another cool

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.790 
go so it's pretty cool another cool
thing<00:03:55.490> is<00:03:55.640> it<00:03:55.970> makes<00:03:56.180> cave<00:03:56.510> exploring<00:03:56.960> a<00:03:57.260> lot

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
thing is it makes cave exploring a lot

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.030 
thing is it makes cave exploring a lot
more<00:03:58.390> cave<00:03:59.390> like<00:03:59.690> I<00:03:59.959> mean<00:04:00.380> look<00:04:00.590> at<00:04:00.680> this<00:04:00.830> this

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
more cave like I mean look at this this

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.640 
more cave like I mean look at this this
looks<00:04:01.250> like<00:04:01.490> an<00:04:01.610> actual<00:04:02.000> cave<00:04:02.330> it's<00:04:03.230> kind<00:04:03.530> of

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
looks like an actual cave it's kind of

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.990 
looks like an actual cave it's kind of
weird<00:04:04.220> though<00:04:04.459> I<00:04:04.730> mean<00:04:05.080> the<00:04:06.080> walls<00:04:06.350> are<00:04:07.000> not

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
weird though I mean the walls are not

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.710 
weird though I mean the walls are not
blocks<00:04:08.840> and<00:04:09.230> I<00:04:09.320> can't<00:04:09.709> compute<00:04:10.220> ah<00:04:10.570> and<00:04:11.570> also

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
blocks and I can't compute ah and also

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.930 
blocks and I can't compute ah and also
you<00:04:11.959> can<00:04:12.110> tell<00:04:12.260> that<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:12.890> grass<00:04:13.340> is<00:04:13.610> right<00:04:13.790> up

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
you can tell that the grass is right up

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.260 
you can tell that the grass is right up
here<00:04:14.120> so<00:04:14.300> if<00:04:14.360> we<00:04:14.390> did<00:04:15.080> that<00:04:15.110> yep<00:04:15.910> so<00:04:16.910> that's<00:04:17.120> the

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
here so if we did that yep so that's the

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:20.530 
here so if we did that yep so that's the
thing<00:04:18.520> let's<00:04:19.520> see<00:04:19.700> let's<00:04:19.910> look<00:04:20.000> around<00:04:20.420> a

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
thing let's see let's look around a

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.849 
thing let's see let's look around a
little<00:04:20.570> bit<00:04:20.870> because<00:04:20.989> it's<00:04:21.290> really<00:04:21.470> cool<00:04:21.770> in

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
little bit because it's really cool in

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.470 
little bit because it's really cool in
the<00:04:21.950> fact<00:04:22.100> that<00:04:22.280> in<00:04:23.060> case<00:04:23.210> you<00:04:23.330> haven't

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
the fact that in case you haven't

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.940 
the fact that in case you haven't
noticed<00:04:23.600> there's<00:04:24.050> no<00:04:24.200> blocks<00:04:24.560> for<00:04:24.800> you<00:04:24.860> to

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
noticed there's no blocks for you to

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.800 
noticed there's no blocks for you to
jump<00:04:25.160> up<00:04:25.340> so<00:04:25.580> there's<00:04:25.820> like<00:04:25.910> a<00:04:25.970> little<00:04:26.300> ramp<00:04:26.570> or

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
jump up so there's like a little ramp or

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.650 
jump up so there's like a little ramp or
a<00:04:26.900> slope<00:04:27.680> that<00:04:28.280> you're<00:04:28.520> able<00:04:28.700> to<00:04:28.880> walk<00:04:29.180> across

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
a slope that you're able to walk across

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.710 
a slope that you're able to walk across
and<00:04:30.110> it<00:04:31.010> helps<00:04:31.370> make<00:04:31.490> exploring<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:32.150> little<00:04:32.450> bit

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
and it helps make exploring a little bit

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.540 
and it helps make exploring a little bit
easier<00:04:33.110> you<00:04:33.710> know<00:04:33.800> you<00:04:33.890> can<00:04:34.130> walk<00:04:34.370> without

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
easier you know you can walk without

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.110 
easier you know you can walk without
having<00:04:34.940> to<00:04:35.030> jump

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
having to jump

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.090 
having to jump
nice<00:04:36.330> let's<00:04:37.050> go<00:04:37.229> down<00:04:37.410> over<00:04:37.650> here<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.010> I'll

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
nice let's go down over here and I'll

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.550 
nice let's go down over here and I'll
show<00:04:38.310> you<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:38.580> contrast<00:04:39.000> so<00:04:39.570> if<00:04:39.840> you<00:04:40.290> place

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
show you the contrast so if you place

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.080 
show you the contrast so if you place
like<00:04:40.830> I<00:04:40.949> said<00:04:41.160> earlier<00:04:41.490> if<00:04:41.610> you<00:04:41.699> place<00:04:41.910> a

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
like I said earlier if you place a

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.370 
like I said earlier if you place a
man-made<00:04:42.540> block<00:04:42.870> it<00:04:43.560> kind<00:04:43.889> of<00:04:44.010> evens<00:04:44.550> out<00:04:44.699> the

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
man-made block it kind of evens out the

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.120 
man-made block it kind of evens out the
exterior<00:04:46.380> around<00:04:46.770> here

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
exterior around here

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.890 
exterior around here
you<00:04:47.460> see<00:04:47.639> I<00:04:47.880> tried<00:04:48.300> that<00:04:48.389> with<00:04:48.479> torches

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
you see I tried that with torches

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.490 
you see I tried that with torches
because<00:04:49.020> you<00:04:49.229> can<00:04:49.380> see<00:04:49.500> around<00:04:49.620> here<00:04:49.889> and

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
because you can see around here and

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.140 
because you can see around here and
that's<00:04:52.500> normal<00:04:53.070> minecraft<00:04:53.250> right<00:04:53.669> there<00:04:53.880> yep

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
that's normal minecraft right there yep

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.909 
that's normal minecraft right there yep
that<00:04:54.360> looks<00:04:54.389> definitely<00:04:54.900> pretty<00:04:55.050> normal<00:04:55.440> if

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
that looks definitely pretty normal if

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:57.260 
that looks definitely pretty normal if
you<00:04:56.010> break<00:04:56.250> it<00:04:56.280> though<00:04:56.580> they<00:04:56.850> go<00:04:57.000> back<00:04:57.240> they

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
you break it though they go back they

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.570 
you break it though they go back they
revert<00:04:57.840> to<00:04:58.470> how<00:04:58.740> they<00:04:58.919> were<00:04:58.979> before

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
revert to how they were before

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.070 
revert to how they were before
and<00:05:00.710> it's<00:05:01.710> just<00:05:01.949> it's<00:05:02.310> just<00:05:02.490> so<00:05:02.580> crazy<00:05:03.050> but<00:05:04.050> uh

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
and it's just it's just so crazy but uh

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.020 
and it's just it's just so crazy but uh
yeah<00:05:04.800> that's<00:05:04.949> really<00:05:05.220> good<00:05:05.460> about<00:05:05.699> this<00:05:05.880> mod

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
yeah that's really good about this mod

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.790 
yeah that's really good about this mod

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
it's just a small cosmetic mod for those

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.010 
it's just a small cosmetic mod for those
of<00:05:07.949> you<00:05:08.070> who<00:05:08.370> I<00:05:08.639> don't<00:05:09.210> know<00:05:09.300> want<00:05:09.660> to<00:05:09.750> like

what game is that that's not minecraft
is<00:05:13.919> no<00:05:14.039> blocks<00:05:14.370> I<00:05:14.669> don't<00:05:14.850> see<00:05:14.970> no<00:05:15.090> blocks<00:05:15.419> like

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
is no blocks I don't see no blocks like

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.020 
is no blocks I don't see no blocks like
yeah<00:05:16.440> this<00:05:16.740> is<00:05:16.860> minecraft<00:05:17.070> I<00:05:17.370> just<00:05:17.580> modded<00:05:17.910> it

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
yeah this is minecraft I just modded it

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.779 
yeah this is minecraft I just modded it
or<00:05:18.479> maybe<00:05:18.720> you<00:05:18.870> for<00:05:19.590> some<00:05:19.770> reason<00:05:20.160> don't<00:05:20.460> like

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
or maybe you for some reason don't like

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:23.719 
or maybe you for some reason don't like
blocks<00:05:21.270> in<00:05:21.600> which<00:05:21.780> case<00:05:22.080> I<00:05:22.410> guess<00:05:23.039> this<00:05:23.430> this

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
blocks in which case I guess this this

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.020 
blocks in which case I guess this this
does<00:05:24.000> it<00:05:24.150> for<00:05:24.360> you<00:05:24.510> I<00:05:25.320> could<00:05:26.130> see<00:05:26.400> this<00:05:26.580> if<00:05:26.820> you

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
does it for you I could see this if you

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.879 
does it for you I could see this if you
were<00:05:27.150> like<00:05:27.300> using<00:05:27.690> really<00:05:28.380> really<00:05:28.740> good

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
were like using really really good

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:30.770 
were like using really really good
shaders<00:05:29.340> and<00:05:29.550> you<00:05:29.880> had<00:05:30.030> like<00:05:30.180> a<00:05:30.210> really<00:05:30.570> nice

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
shaders and you had like a really nice

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.930 
shaders and you had like a really nice
realistic<00:05:31.350> build<00:05:31.860> and<00:05:32.160> you're<00:05:32.550> trying<00:05:32.760> to<00:05:32.850> go

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
realistic build and you're trying to go

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.700 
realistic build and you're trying to go
for<00:05:33.090> like<00:05:33.180> a<00:05:33.360> lot<00:05:33.690> of<00:05:33.840> realism<00:05:34.169> that'd<00:05:34.560> be

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
for like a lot of realism that'd be

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.860 
for like a lot of realism that'd be
that'd<00:05:35.039> probably<00:05:35.160> be<00:05:35.430> the<00:05:35.610> best<00:05:35.940> you<00:05:36.840> know

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
that'd probably be the best you know

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.480 
that'd probably be the best you know
kind<00:05:37.470> of<00:05:37.590> thing<00:05:37.740> I<00:05:37.800> could<00:05:37.949> see<00:05:38.070> you<00:05:38.190> doing<00:05:38.220> this

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
kind of thing I could see you doing this

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.020 
kind of thing I could see you doing this
mod<00:05:38.699> for<00:05:39.560> we're<00:05:40.560> in<00:05:40.710> the<00:05:41.010> nether<00:05:41.250> now<00:05:41.520> and<00:05:41.820> I

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030
