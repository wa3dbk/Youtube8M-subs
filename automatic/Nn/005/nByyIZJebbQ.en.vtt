00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.970 

okay<00:00:13.770> yeah<00:00:14.460> very<00:00:15.120> beautiful<00:00:15.570> could<00:00:16.380> we<00:00:16.560> have<00:00:16.770> a

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
okay yeah very beautiful could we have a

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.390 
okay yeah very beautiful could we have a
little<00:00:17.160> bit<00:00:17.460> more<00:00:17.750> hierarchy<00:00:19.040> in<00:00:20.040> the<00:00:20.220> bar

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
little bit more hierarchy in the bar

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.859 
little bit more hierarchy in the bar
yeah

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
yeah

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.460 
yeah
it's<00:00:22.260> beautifully<00:00:23.160> smooth<00:00:23.900> okay<00:00:24.900> but<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.350> think

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
it's beautifully smooth okay but I think

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.800 
it's beautifully smooth okay but I think
we<00:00:25.860> need<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.220> take<00:00:26.640> some<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.029> smoothness

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
we need to take some of the smoothness

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.400 
we need to take some of the smoothness
out<00:00:28.200> and<00:00:29.540> not<00:00:30.540> that<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.810> needs<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:31.110> be<00:00:31.169> broken

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
out and not that it needs to be broken

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.110 
out and not that it needs to be broken
up<00:00:31.740> because<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.310> line<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:32.880> much

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
up because that the line is so much

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.740 
up because that the line is so much
within<00:00:33.480> your<00:00:34.610> space<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:36.270> you're<00:00:36.450> not<00:00:36.600> going

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
within your space that you're not going

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.590 
within your space that you're not going
to<00:00:36.810> lose<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.350> line<00:00:38.000> can<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.090> actually<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.450> do

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
to lose the line can you actually to do

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.160 
to lose the line can you actually to do
that

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
that

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.380 
that
could<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.829> just<00:00:40.980> play<00:00:41.220> the<00:00:41.250> bass<00:00:41.489> for<00:00:42.060> us<00:00:42.149> so

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
could you just play the bass for us so

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:59.300 
could you just play the bass for us so
we<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:42.630> hear<00:00:42.870> it

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.950 

lovely<00:01:01.710> such<00:01:02.710> a<00:01:02.740> kind<00:01:03.130> of<00:01:03.690> what<00:01:04.690> kind<00:01:04.900> of

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
lovely such a kind of what kind of

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.650 
lovely such a kind of what kind of
expression<00:01:05.260> is<00:01:05.620> would<00:01:06.040> you<00:01:06.130> say<00:01:06.340> is<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:07.030> limit

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
expression is would you say is the limit

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.110 
expression is would you say is the limit
the<00:01:07.990> base<00:01:08.170> starts<00:01:08.530> moving<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:11.650> it<00:01:12.120> absolutely

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
the base starts moving in it absolutely

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.150 
the base starts moving in it absolutely
that's<00:01:13.270> exactly<00:01:13.720> what<00:01:13.870> it<00:01:14.020> is<00:01:14.200> really<00:01:14.710> looking

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
that's exactly what it is really looking

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.690 
that's exactly what it is really looking
inside<00:01:16.080> especially<00:01:17.080> that<00:01:17.229> seven<00:01:17.740> that<00:01:18.340> it

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
inside especially that seven that it

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.180 
inside especially that seven that it
creates<00:01:19.150> on<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.600> E<00:01:19.810> flat<00:01:22.830> just<00:01:23.830> play<00:01:24.040> that

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
creates on the E flat just play that

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.890 
creates on the E flat just play that
seven<00:01:24.610> first

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.260 

so<00:01:30.620> only<00:01:30.860> results<00:01:31.460> right<00:01:31.700> at<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:31.970> enter

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
so only results right at the enter

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.660 
so only results right at the enter
there's<00:01:32.480> lots<00:01:32.780> of<00:01:32.960> searching<00:01:33.470> sevens<00:01:34.100> up<00:01:34.310> you

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
there's lots of searching sevens up you

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.370 
there's lots of searching sevens up you
know<00:01:34.790> creates<00:01:35.150> dissonance<00:01:35.690> as<00:01:36.020> don't<00:01:36.260> they

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
know creates dissonance as don't they

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.290 
know creates dissonance as don't they
and<00:01:36.530> and<00:01:36.680> there<00:01:37.430> there's<00:01:37.640> always<00:01:37.790> a<00:01:37.910> lot<00:01:38.180> of

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
and and there there's always a lot of

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.460 
and and there there's always a lot of
tension<00:01:38.600> on<00:01:38.960> those<00:01:39.110> distances<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:41.470> typically

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
tension on those distances and typically

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.280 
tension on those distances and typically
he<00:01:43.130> doesn't<00:01:43.700> resolve<00:01:44.060> it<00:01:44.510> where<00:01:44.900> you<00:01:45.050> think<00:01:45.260> he

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
he doesn't resolve it where you think he

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.230 
he doesn't resolve it where you think he
might<00:01:45.620> he<00:01:46.010> adds<00:01:46.190> another<00:01:46.370> one<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:47.090> then

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
might he adds another one and then

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.390 
might he adds another one and then
resolves<00:01:47.720> only<00:01:48.020> just<00:01:48.410> at<00:01:48.620> the<00:01:48.710> end<00:01:48.890> there's<00:01:49.340> a

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
resolves only just at the end there's a

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.940 
resolves only just at the end there's a
tiny<00:01:49.670> happy<00:01:50.060> ending<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:50.630> then<00:01:51.320> it<00:01:51.500> didn't

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
tiny happy ending and then it didn't

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.850 
tiny happy ending and then it didn't
exactly<00:01:52.820> that's<00:01:53.390> right<00:01:53.720> okay<00:01:54.320> should<00:01:54.680> do<00:01:54.770> it

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
exactly that's right okay should do it

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:08.150 
exactly that's right okay should do it
all<00:01:54.980> together

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.220 

you
