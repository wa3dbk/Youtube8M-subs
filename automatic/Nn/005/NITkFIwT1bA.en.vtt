instead<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:40.980> relying<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:42.210> which<00:00:42.420> we're

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
instead of relying on this which we're

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.389 
instead of relying on this which we're
going<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.750> see<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.020> not<00:00:43.200> helpful<00:00:43.559> at<00:00:43.680> all<00:00:43.800> so

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
going to see is not helpful at all so

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.590 
going to see is not helpful at all so
let's<00:00:44.640> just<00:00:44.850> actually<00:00:45.000> start<00:00:45.300> at<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.420> bottom

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
let's just actually start at the bottom

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.000 
let's just actually start at the bottom
with<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:45.989> worst<00:00:46.230> ones<00:00:46.500> we're<00:00:46.710> just<00:00:46.829> going<00:00:46.950> to

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
with the worst ones we're just going to

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.110 
with the worst ones we're just going to
skim<00:00:47.280> through<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.550> we're<00:00:47.700> going<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.879> go<00:00:47.969> into

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
skim through this we're going to go into

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.560 
skim through this we're going to go into
super<00:00:48.690> detail<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.200> can<00:00:49.320> find<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.489> lot<00:00:51.480> of

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
super detail you can find this a lot of

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.700 
super detail you can find this a lot of
different<00:00:51.600> places<00:00:51.840> i<00:00:52.079> think<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.469> one

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
different places i think this this one

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.580 
different places i think this this one
came<00:00:53.010> from<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.489> 2012's<00:00:54.390> 80<00:00:54.539> i<00:00:54.660> think<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.170> you

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
came from the 2012's 80 i think but you

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.630 
came from the 2012's 80 i think but you
can<00:00:55.710> find<00:00:55.890> them<00:00:56.010> all<00:00:56.070> over<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.340> place<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.579> if

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
can find them all over the place so if

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.740 
can find them all over the place so if
you<00:00:56.699> want<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.910> read<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.120> more<00:00:57.210> detail<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.629> can

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
you want to read it more detail you can

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.130 
you want to read it more detail you can
so<00:00:57.960> first<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.410> zero<00:00:59.600> they<00:01:00.600> just<00:01:00.780> mentioned<00:01:00.899> down

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
so first a zero they just mentioned down

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.810 
so first a zero they just mentioned down
here<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> zero<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.100> if<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.460> write<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
here a zero is if you write in a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.100 
here a zero is if you write in a
different<00:01:03.120> language<00:01:03.210> or<00:01:03.629> if<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.750> write<00:01:03.930> off

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
different language or if you write off

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.310

four<00:03:19.040> so<00:03:19.250> a<00:03:19.280> 3<00:03:19.549> again<00:03:19.790> is<00:03:19.909> the<00:03:20.000> most<00:03:20.180> kind<00:03:20.359> of

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
four so a 3 again is the most kind of

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:21.640 
four so a 3 again is the most kind of
one<00:03:20.540> of<00:03:20.599> the<00:03:20.659> common<00:03:20.959> ones<00:03:21.109> you<00:03:21.229> can<00:03:21.349> see<00:03:21.470> three

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
one of the common ones you can see three

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.710 
one of the common ones you can see three
and<00:03:21.769> four<00:03:21.949> the<00:03:22.129> most<00:03:22.310> common<00:03:22.609> scores<00:03:23.060> that

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
and four the most common scores that

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.960 
and four the most common scores that
I've<00:03:23.870> seen<00:03:26.470> generally<00:03:27.470> you<00:03:28.430> can<00:03:28.489> kind<00:03:28.790> of<00:03:28.849> draw

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
I've seen generally you can kind of draw

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.479 
I've seen generally you can kind of draw
a<00:03:29.060> dividing<00:03:29.599> line<00:03:29.629> between<00:03:30.019> the<00:03:30.919> ones<00:03:31.129> twos

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
a dividing line between the ones twos

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:32.800 
a dividing line between the ones twos
and<00:03:31.639> threes<00:03:31.699> and<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.120> four<00:03:32.299> fives<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:32.720> sixes

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
and threes and the four fives and sixes

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.780 
and threes and the four fives and sixes
the<00:03:33.199> difference<00:03:33.590> in<00:03:33.709> quality<00:03:33.829> is<00:03:34.280> stark<00:03:34.639> I

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
the difference in quality is stark I

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.759 
the difference in quality is stark I
think<00:03:35.030> between<00:03:35.180> bottom<00:03:36.019> half<00:03:36.290> in<00:03:36.409> the<00:03:36.439> top<00:03:36.620> F

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
think between bottom half in the top F

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.619 
think between bottom half in the top F
and<00:03:36.919> in<00:03:37.009> fact<00:03:37.129> one<00:03:37.609> of<00:03:37.639> the<00:03:37.729> ways<00:03:37.879> readers<00:03:38.509> are

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
and in fact one of the ways readers are

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.649 
and in fact one of the ways readers are
taught<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:39.040> grade<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.759> essays<00:03:40.849> is<00:03:41.209> to<00:03:41.389> first

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659 
taught to grade the essays is to first

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.449 
taught to grade the essays is to first
assign<00:03:42.049> it<00:03:42.229> to<00:03:42.259> a<00:03:42.379> top<00:03:42.590> F<00:03:42.769> bottom<00:03:43.069> half<00:03:43.189> score

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
assign it to a top F bottom half score

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.659 
assign it to a top F bottom half score
and<00:03:43.639> then<00:03:43.849> differentiate<00:03:44.239> which<00:03:44.629> within<00:03:45.049> that

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
and then differentiate which within that

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.030 
and then differentiate which within that
so<00:03:46.669> let's<00:03:47.419> go<00:03:47.629> into<00:03:47.659> the<00:03:48.049> four<00:03:48.470> looks<00:03:48.650> like<00:03:48.829> an

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
so let's go into the four looks like an

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.740 
so let's go into the four looks like an

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:19.889 
could get into details but the point is

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:21.350

the rubric to figure out what they want

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.820 
the rubric to figure out what they want
is<00:06:22.950> a<00:06:23.130> waste<00:06:23.310> of<00:06:23.430> time<00:06:23.840> so<00:06:24.840> I've<00:06:25.139> got<00:06:25.470> that<00:06:25.620> one

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
is a waste of time so I've got that one

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:26.839 
is a waste of time so I've got that one
thing<00:06:25.860> we're<00:06:26.070> wasted<00:06:26.310> our<00:06:26.370> time<00:06:26.400> here<00:06:26.639> but<00:06:26.789> the

whole<00:06:26.970> point<00:06:27.000> is<00:06:27.330> to<00:06:27.360> say<00:06:27.599> this<00:06:28.050> is<00:06:28.169> not<00:06:28.200> going

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
whole point is to say this is not going
