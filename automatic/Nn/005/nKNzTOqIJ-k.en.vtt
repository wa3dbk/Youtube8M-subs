00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
this is where and and I mean to come up

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.890 
this is where and and I mean to come up
with<00:04:03.600> these<00:04:03.690> ideas<00:04:03.930> was<00:04:04.460> completely<00:04:05.900> an

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
with these ideas was completely an

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.480 
with these ideas was completely an
amazing<00:04:07.350> thing<00:04:07.560> let's<00:04:07.890> think<00:04:08.040> about<00:04:08.340> you

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
amazing thing let's think about you

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.160 
amazing thing let's think about you
can't<00:04:08.700> just<00:04:08.940> think<00:04:09.210> about<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:09.720> subject<00:04:09.960> the

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
can't just think about the subject the

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.740 
can't just think about the subject the
unconscious<00:04:10.770> mind<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.340> actually<00:04:12.000> create

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
unconscious mind and actually create

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.200 
unconscious mind and actually create
works<00:04:12.990> like<00:04:13.260> that<00:04:13.290> not<00:04:13.680> just<00:04:13.710> anyone<00:04:14.340> can<00:04:14.520> they

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
works like that not just anyone can they

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.210 
works like that not just anyone can they
have<00:04:15.360> to<00:04:15.480> think<00:04:15.690> up<00:04:15.930> ideas<00:04:16.140> and<00:04:16.739> ways<00:04:16.920> in<00:04:16.950> which

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
have to think up ideas and ways in which

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.729 
have to think up ideas and ways in which
to<00:04:17.670> Co<00:04:17.940> it<00:04:18.120> go<00:04:18.270> ahead<00:04:18.390> and<00:04:18.570> create<00:04:19.020> these

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
to Co it go ahead and create these

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.850 
to Co it go ahead and create these
unconscious<00:04:20.370> mind<00:04:20.850> like<00:04:21.090> States<00:04:21.540> so<00:04:21.840> this<00:04:22.680> is

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
unconscious mind like States so this is

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.440 
unconscious mind like States so this is
what<00:04:23.010> they<00:04:23.160> did<00:04:23.220> and<00:04:23.610> one<00:04:24.060> of<00:04:24.180> them<00:04:24.300> was

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
what they did and one of them was

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.360 
what they did and one of them was
automatic<00:04:24.990> writing<00:04:25.380> this<00:04:25.530> is<00:04:25.710> where<00:04:25.920> the

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
automatic writing this is where the

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.130 
automatic writing this is where the
concept<00:04:26.820> is<00:04:27.030> and<00:04:27.270> try<00:04:27.390> to<00:04:27.450> think<00:04:27.690> about<00:04:27.810> this

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
concept is and try to think about this

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.760 
concept is and try to think about this
to<00:04:28.650> turn<00:04:28.950> off<00:04:29.340> the<00:04:30.060> your<00:04:30.750> own<00:04:30.900> willpower<00:04:31.200> and

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
to turn off the your own willpower and

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.129 
to turn off the your own willpower and
ignore<00:04:32.610> all

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
ignore all

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.649 
ignore all
moral<00:04:33.620> code<00:04:33.889> completely<00:04:34.550> and<00:04:34.939> anything<00:04:35.629> that

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:35.659 
moral code completely and anything that

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:37.179 
moral code completely and anything that
you've<00:04:35.840> been<00:04:36.020> taught<00:04:36.379> from<00:04:36.770> a<00:04:36.919> moral

00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:37.189 
you've been taught from a moral

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:40.450 
you've been taught from a moral
perspective<00:04:37.400> and<00:04:38.139> start<00:04:39.139> writing<00:04:39.800> about<00:04:40.219> it

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
perspective and start writing about it

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.839 
perspective and start writing about it
and<00:04:40.669> so<00:04:41.330> essentially<00:04:42.020> all<00:04:42.409> sorts<00:04:42.919> of<00:04:43.039> amazing

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:43.849 
and so essentially all sorts of amazing

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.029 
and so essentially all sorts of amazing
concepts<00:04:44.360> would<00:04:44.509> come<00:04:44.749> out<00:04:44.990> of<00:04:45.050> you<00:04:45.379> and<00:04:45.590> you'd

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 
concepts would come out of you and you'd

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:47.950 
concepts would come out of you and you'd
start<00:04:46.249> writing<00:04:46.759> about<00:04:46.879> things<00:04:47.210> that<00:04:47.360> were

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
start writing about things that were

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.409 
start writing about things that were
taboo<00:04:48.439> or<00:04:48.740> you<00:04:49.490> had<00:04:49.610> never<00:04:49.819> thought<00:04:50.029> of<00:04:50.240> before

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
taboo or you had never thought of before

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.360 
taboo or you had never thought of before
so<00:04:51.139> you've<00:04:51.349> got<00:04:51.439> to<00:04:51.560> really<00:04:51.710> turn<00:04:52.129> off

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
so you've got to really turn off

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.429 
so you've got to really turn off
willpower<00:04:52.969> and<00:04:53.240> just<00:04:53.449> allow<00:04:53.749> it<00:04:53.779> to<00:04:53.930> go<00:04:54.199> and

00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:54.439 
willpower and just allow it to go and

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:57.100 
willpower and just allow it to go and
allow<00:04:54.650> it<00:04:54.710> to<00:04:54.800> flow<00:04:55.129> in<00:04:55.400> a<00:04:55.789> real<00:04:56.110> almost

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
allow it to flow in a real almost

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.689 
allow it to flow in a real almost
trance-like<00:04:57.620> State<00:04:58.069> and<00:04:58.340> some<00:04:58.520> of<00:04:58.639> the

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
trance-like State and some of the

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:01.119 
trance-like State and some of the
artists<00:04:59.330> would<00:04:59.449> actually<00:04:59.870> even<00:05:00.439> do<00:05:00.710> their<00:05:00.949> art

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:01.129 
artists would actually even do their art

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:03.550 
artists would actually even do their art
in<00:05:01.580> a<00:05:01.849> trance-like<00:05:02.330> State<00:05:02.810> and<00:05:03.080> some<00:05:03.259> people

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
in a trance-like State and some people

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.850 
in a trance-like State and some people
say<00:05:03.849> that<00:05:04.879> Salvador<00:05:05.719> Dali<00:05:05.750> for<00:05:06.349> example<00:05:06.740> was

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
say that Salvador Dali for example was

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.879 
say that Salvador Dali for example was
on<00:05:07.009> drugs<00:05:07.250> he<00:05:07.580> said<00:05:07.819> I<00:05:08.000> am<00:05:08.449> the<00:05:08.479> drug<00:05:08.960> one<00:05:09.710> sit

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
on drugs he said I am the drug one sit

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:11.980 
on drugs he said I am the drug one sit
that's<00:05:10.189> a<00:05:10.279> well<00:05:10.400> that<00:05:10.520> was<00:05:10.639> his<00:05:10.759> comment<00:05:10.969> he<00:05:11.569> he

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
that's a well that was his comment he he

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.740 
that's a well that was his comment he he
would<00:05:12.110> also<00:05:12.259> create<00:05:13.539> hallucinogenic<00:05:14.539> type

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
would also create hallucinogenic type

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.899 
would also create hallucinogenic type
scenarios<00:05:15.319> I'll<00:05:15.529> talk<00:05:15.740> about<00:05:15.770> lately<00:05:16.279> later

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:16.909 
scenarios I'll talk about lately later

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:20.080 
scenarios I'll talk about lately later
and<00:05:17.210> he<00:05:17.900> talks<00:05:18.139> about<00:05:18.289> they<00:05:19.250> he<00:05:19.759> would<00:05:19.909> talk

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
and he talks about they he would talk

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.939 
and he talks about they he would talk
about<00:05:20.120> the<00:05:20.479> only<00:05:20.599> difference<00:05:20.779> between<00:05:21.199> mr.

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:21.949 
about the only difference between mr.

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:25.540 
about the only difference between mr.

about<00:05:33.860> them<00:05:34.159> a<00:05:34.310> lot<00:05:34.909> of<00:05:34.939> the<00:05:35.120> works<00:05:35.330> of<00:05:35.569> Dali

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
about them a lot of the works of Dali

about them a lot of the works of Dali
exhibit<00:05:36.560> many<00:05:37.009> different<00:05:37.839> similar<00:05:38.839> concepts

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:39.529 
exhibit many different similar concepts

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:42.159 
exhibit many different similar concepts
in<00:05:39.740> them<00:05:40.009> and<00:05:40.219> they<00:05:40.550> like<00:05:40.759> a<00:05:40.789> code<00:05:41.300> almost<00:05:41.629> in

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
in them and they like a code almost in

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:44.290 
in them and they like a code almost in
some<00:05:42.650> ways<00:05:42.889> is<00:05:43.189> essentially<00:05:43.849> like<00:05:43.969> when<00:05:44.180> you

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
some ways is essentially like when you

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.179 
some ways is essentially like when you
look<00:05:44.479> at<00:05:44.629> all<00:05:44.839> works<00:05:45.169> of<00:05:45.379> the<00:05:45.469> Renaissance

and we will go through a few of them
right<00:06:25.460> here<00:06:25.520> for<00:06:25.789> example<00:06:26.000> as<00:06:26.509> a<00:06:26.569> child

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.110 
but Dali invented a completely new

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.620 
but Dali invented a completely new
medium<00:07:27.740> or<00:07:27.949> style<00:07:28.580> of<00:07:28.729> creation<00:07:29.300> called

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:29.630 
medium or style of creation called

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.529 
medium or style of creation called
paranoiac<00:07:30.410> critical<00:07:31.160> method<00:07:31.550> and<00:07:31.729> this

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:32.539 
paranoiac critical method and this

00:07:32.539 --> 00:07:35.409 
paranoiac critical method and this
paranoid<00:07:33.139> state<00:07:33.500> would<00:07:34.430> often<00:07:34.789> be<00:07:34.910> induced

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:35.419 
paranoid state would often be induced

00:07:35.419 --> 00:07:38.170 
paranoid state would often be induced
and<00:07:35.720> this<00:07:36.410> is<00:07:36.500> how<00:07:36.590> he<00:07:36.650> said<00:07:36.919> when<00:07:37.430> he<00:07:37.460> said<00:07:37.580> the

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:38.180 
and this is how he said when he said the

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.550 
and this is how he said when he said the
only<00:07:38.360> difference<00:07:38.630> between<00:07:38.720> me<00:07:39.020> and<00:07:39.050> a<00:07:39.169> madman

only difference between me and a madman

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.920 
only difference between me and a madman
is<00:07:39.680> I'm<00:07:39.800> not<00:07:40.039> mad<00:07:40.280> the<00:07:41.030> fact<00:07:41.300> was<00:07:41.510> that<00:07:41.539> he

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:41.930 
is I'm not mad the fact was that he

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.820 
is I'm not mad the fact was that he
would<00:07:42.080> create<00:07:42.260> a<00:07:43.389> sharpened<00:07:44.830> understanding

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:45.830 
would create a sharpened understanding

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:49.120 
would create a sharpened understanding
of<00:07:45.949> paranoia<00:07:46.849> and<00:07:47.090> also<00:07:47.870> of<00:07:48.110> the<00:07:48.259> sub<00:07:48.500> the

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:49.130 
of paranoia and also of the sub the

of paranoia and also of the sub the
unconscious<00:07:49.760> realm<00:07:50.060> by<00:07:50.840> actually<00:07:51.500> creating<00:07:52.039> a
