also want to mention it does come with

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.479 
also want to mention it does come with
the<00:00:51.539> AOSP<00:00:52.050> browser<00:00:52.590> instead<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.219> google

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
the AOSP browser instead of google

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.639 
the AOSP browser instead of google
chrome<00:00:53.910> which<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> very<00:00:54.780> fast<00:00:55.140> browsing<00:00:55.440> you

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
chrome which is a very fast browsing you

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.959 
chrome which is a very fast browsing you
won't<00:00:55.800> see<00:00:55.980> chrome<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.399> there<00:00:56.520> obviously<00:00:56.910> you

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
won't see chrome in there obviously you

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.790 
won't see chrome in there obviously you
can<00:00:57.180> get<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.420> from<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.600> Play<00:00:57.780> Store<00:00:57.840> but<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
can get it from the Play Store but the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.560 
can get it from the Play Store but the
AOSP<00:00:59.160> browser<00:00:59.670> is<00:01:00.000> probably<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> best

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
AOSP browser is probably the best

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.330 
AOSP browser is probably the best

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.690 
it rotates and it just looks really cool
I<00:02:42.900> think<00:02:42.990> when<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.470> rotate<00:02:43.800> it<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:44.220> yeah<00:02:44.670> a

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
I think when you rotate it so yeah a

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.750 
I think when you rotate it so yeah a
nice<00:02:44.970> feature<00:02:45.180> there<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.600> have<00:02:45.810> if<00:02:46.560> we<00:02:47.370> rotate

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
nice feature there to have if we rotate

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.210 
nice feature there to have if we rotate
it<00:02:48.060> back<00:02:48.270> now<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.780> just<00:02:49.140> wanted<00:02:49.320> to<00:02:49.380> say<00:02:49.710> a<00:02:50.040> quick

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
it back now I just wanted to say a quick

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.310 
it back now I just wanted to say a quick
thing<00:02:50.580> about<00:02:50.730> benchmarks<00:02:51.390> I'll<00:02:51.690> quickly<00:02:51.930> open

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
thing about benchmarks I'll quickly open

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.050 
thing about benchmarks I'll quickly open
up<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.620> 22<00:02:52.920> right<00:02:53.130> here<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.430> you<00:02:53.490> can<00:02:53.610> see<00:02:53.820> the

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
up and 22 right here and you can see the

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.570 
up and 22 right here and you can see the
score<00:02:54.990> that<00:02:55.200> I<00:02:55.230> got<00:02:55.560> recently<00:02:56.040> with<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.340> not<00:02:56.550> a

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
score that I got recently with it not a

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.420 
score that I got recently with it not a
great<00:02:57.000> score<00:02:57.390> by<00:02:57.540> any<00:02:57.690> means<00:02:57.900> basically

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
great score by any means basically

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.740 
great score by any means basically
17,000<00:02:59.430> but<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.090> just<00:03:00.240> wanted<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.510> show<00:03:00.720> you

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
17,000 but I just wanted to show you

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.810 
17,000 but I just wanted to show you
that<00:03:00.900> even<00:03:01.170> with<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.470> score<00:03:01.740> of<00:03:01.770> 17,000<00:03:02.640> this

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
that even with a score of 17,000 this

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.280 
that even with a score of 17,000 this
just<00:03:03.030> shows<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.270> how<00:03:03.390> much<00:03:03.450> benchmarks<00:03:04.080> don't

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
just shows you how much benchmarks don't

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.830 
just shows you how much benchmarks don't
really<00:03:04.500> mean<00:03:04.680> much<00:03:04.710> this<00:03:05.490> rom<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:06.030> faster<00:03:06.600> than

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
really mean much this rom is faster than

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.440 
really mean much this rom is faster than
a<00:03:07.050> rom<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.650> scores<00:03:08.060> 21,000<00:03:09.060> so<00:03:09.210> it<00:03:09.270> just

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
a rom that scores 21,000 so it just

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.150 
a rom that scores 21,000 so it just
shows<00:03:09.600> you<00:03:09.750> benchmarks<00:03:10.260> on<00:03:10.350> everything<00:03:10.800> you

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
shows you benchmarks on everything you

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.890 
shows you benchmarks on everything you
can<00:03:11.340> of<00:03:11.490> course<00:03:11.520> install<00:03:12.090> custom<00:03:12.240> kernels<00:03:12.810> and

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
can of course install custom kernels and

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.540 
can of course install custom kernels and
different<00:03:13.350> tweaks<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.890> stuff<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.280> get<00:03:14.400> the

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
different tweaks and stuff to get the

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.070 
different tweaks and stuff to get the
score<00:03:14.820> higher<00:03:15.060> if<00:03:15.270> you<00:03:15.420> really<00:03:15.660> want<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:15.900> to

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
score higher if you really want it to

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.650 
score higher if you really want it to
but<00:03:16.680> it's<00:03:16.830> not<00:03:16.980> really<00:03:17.130> needed<00:03:17.520> so<00:03:18.060> yeah<00:03:18.480> it's

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
but it's not really needed so yeah it's

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.600 
but it's not really needed so yeah it's
a<00:03:18.750> very<00:03:18.930> fast<00:03:19.290> clean<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:19.680> simple<00:03:20.040> rom<00:03:20.430> it's

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
a very fast clean and simple rom it's

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.710 
a very fast clean and simple rom it's
going<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.790> be<00:03:20.850> great<00:03:21.000> for<00:03:21.300> people<00:03:21.390> that<00:03:21.690> want

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
going to be great for people that want

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.690 
going to be great for people that want
it<00:03:21.960> very<00:03:21.990> close<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.710> stock<00:03:22.980> google<00:03:23.370> experience

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
it very close to stock google experience

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.000 
it very close to stock google experience
