00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.609
 hello hello hello welcome to the new blog 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.009
 and this time I'm coming to bring you the 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.530
 recipe how to make cinnamon rolex 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.430
 glaze for which we are going to need 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.030
 of the following ingredients 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.470
 400 grams of flour 230 grams of 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.920
 butter without salt at temperature 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.680
 environment 3 quarts milk cup one 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.110
 teaspoon of yeast 3 tablespoons 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.020
 tureens of sugar 1 egg at temperature 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.490
 half a teaspoon of salt and 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.680
 now for the filling of the roles 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.870
 we are going to need 100 grams of sugar 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.940
 1 to 2 tablespoons cinnamon powder 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.160
 depending on the taste we can also 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.600
 include raisins and nuts and for the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.640
 frosting the roles we're going to need 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.720
 approximately 200 grams of sugar 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.610
 glas and a spoonful of milk 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.440
 to start making enough dough 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.990
 turn into a flour bowl together with the 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.210
 other dry ingredients and we mix a 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.150
 little to integrate and then add 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.600
 the milk and half the butter 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.600
 together with the egg 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.430
 and to one side we add the yeast 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.410
 we begin to integrate the ingredients 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.570
 little by little with the spatula until it 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.460
 integrate all the ingredients for 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.460
 then start kneading with your hand 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.150
 the kneading is a fundamental part of 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.040
 any good bread since a good 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.060
 Kneading I'm responsible for a bread is 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.230
 confused 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.180
 we should knead for a while 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.370
 approximately 20 minutes and for a 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.230
 correct kneading we should try to go 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.330
 doubling the dough and not 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.190
 tearing it as we go 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.290
 kneading we can see how the dough 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.000
 It becomes less sticky and more elastic 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.450
 this is due to the development of gluten 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.450
 of the mass 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.039
 already once the dough stops being a 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:52.200
 little sticky we can pass it to the table 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.270
 to be able to work more easily 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.120
 Now you can see in more detail the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.970
 kneading technique 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.520
 it is very important to go whipping the dough 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.820
 against the table to help in the 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.820
 kneading 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.480
 This technique of kneading is very efficient 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.010
 and likewise we should try to ensure that 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.010
 dough does not stay stuck on the table 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.140
 plus 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.220
 we continue to knead for approximately 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.290
 20 minutes and after the time we can 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.270
 observe how the dough has become much 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.270
 more elastic and malleable 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.890
 ah 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.660
 and once we have finished kneading we put it to 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.070
 ferment for one hour to 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.440
 speed up the process just by placing 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.350
 the dough in a bowl to cover it tightly 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.120
 and place it in a warm place I in 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.940
 this case I heated an electric oven to 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.850
 maximum power for two minutes what 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.130
 I turned off and put the dough inside like that with 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.030
 the remaining heat the most fermented dough 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.740
 and faster 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.810
 while the mass is being promoted 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.120
 we can go preparing the mold in this 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.540
 Case used a rectangular mold of 9 x 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.540
 3 inches 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.170
 to which I put a piece in the background 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.830
 angle of siliconized paper this is for 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.750
 prevent them from sticking 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.270
 and so the mold has been ready for 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.630
 place the roles we can observe 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.190
 clearly like the fermented dough and 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.930
 to start forming the roles in 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.180
 flour we give a little the dough where 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.450
 let's go to work and extend the mass 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.989
 to a rectangular shape 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.989
 ah 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.459
 Once the dough is stretched, place the 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.849
 filling which is half of the 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:09.819
 butter already softened the sugar together 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:13.230
 with the cinnamon we scattered uniformly 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.230
 the butter for the dough 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.060
 and then we put the sugar on top 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.920
 mix with the cinnamon in this part it 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.570
 you can add the raisins and the nuts if 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.060
 they want 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.950
 and once already spread evenly the 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.700
 sugar with cinnamon we continue to 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.700
 Roll the dough 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.720
 this is a very important step since 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.340
 it greatly influences the final aspect 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.150
 of the bread so it's very important 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.150
 do it carefully 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:57.150
 Once the dough is rolled up, we continue 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.150
 to cut it into 12 equal pieces 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.240
 once you have cut the flowers of 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:05.930
 cinnamon we put them in a mold 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.930
 neatly 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.729
 then we put them to ferment 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:15.729
 for approximately 45 minutes 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.250
 and finally we put them in a 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.780
 180 degree preheated oven 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.780
 centigrade for 20 minutes 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.819
 now while baking the roles we can 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.949
 make the frosting for it simply 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:34.870
 we mix the icing sugar with a 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:37.330
 spoonful of milk 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:41.250
 After 20 minutes we removed the 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.250
 roles of the oven and we grace 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.639
 ah 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.889
 once discovered by the glaze the 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.509
 we let cool and are ready to 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:54.710
 eat 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:56.449
 thank you very much for watching and remembering
