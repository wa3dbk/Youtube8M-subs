00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
iphone it's actually a little has like a

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.010 
iphone it's actually a little has like a
resistance<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.209> stops<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.810> can't

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
resistance to it so it stops you can't

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.550 
resistance to it so it stops you can't
just<00:02:13.230> fling<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:13.800> all<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.099> way<00:02:15.349> it's<00:02:16.349> kind<00:02:16.470> of

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
just fling it all the way it's kind of

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.110 
just fling it all the way it's kind of
as<00:02:16.680> better<00:02:16.890> control<00:02:17.310> as<00:02:17.520> in<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.730> sense<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.060> you

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
as better control as in a sense of you

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.190 
as better control as in a sense of you
can<00:02:18.300> control<00:02:18.599> it<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.750> little<00:02:18.780> better<00:02:18.989> it's

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
can control it a little better it's

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.130 
can control it a little better it's
easier<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.860> have<00:02:20.670> consistent<00:02:21.270> swipes<00:02:21.510> but

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
easier to have consistent swipes but

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.350
