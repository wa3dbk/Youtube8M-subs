00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.290
 good people, we have received 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.440
 Some complaints from staff speaking 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.759
 What is wrong with unlocking? 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.530
 of the engine 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.299
 the ten year drawing is not 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.980
 unlocking for manual then ends 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.720
 you can not unlock the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.070
 manual I separated a motor here it is 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.680
 exactly with this problem 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.840
 so if you catch it here open the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.320
 hatch and will rotate 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.740
 You can not come here, locked. 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.950
 I remember he was locked up and with 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.020
 he's open here he 's caught 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.610
 this is happening frequently and 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.950
 people discovered here that you can have 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.120
 some causes among them we separate 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.559
 two here 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.629
 the first thing that can be 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.059
 happening there is that these two 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.930
 screws are not fully tightened 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.120
 or these four screws of that other 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.320
 side may also be not completely 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.940
 tight 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.129
 then're the first thing you have to 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.890
 do a review on them get a key 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.290
 philips and see if they really are 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.290
 totally tight that is the case here 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.880
 he was not locking I'm not giving 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.880
 one more screw here on the screws 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:20.570
 here is the same thing a little bit just one 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.320
 A little but I was loose a little bit more 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:28.860
 Let's see if we have already changed it. 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.280
 He unlocked but it's still strange to watch. 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.740
 are at home when in some force you 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.040
 can spin but not right 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.350
 or probably this nail cucumber 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.430
 that is short like what we do 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.430
 to change the nail tire 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.530
 this guy here and the nail 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.630
 This guy here is very 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.930
 employment that is the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.150
 promoter that this is wrong 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:15.020
 O see that it has a certain difference 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.660
 then your people both here 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.430
 you see against the bottom will see that a 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.350
 tone higher than the other 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.690
 This higher is what I'm going to put now 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.880
 that of what was in place 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:34.110
 so I'll put the highest on the hour of 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.840
 fit here has a recommendation time 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.540
 he is like this if you will fit this 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.730
 here it is very difficult you have to 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.430
 tighten and difficult then do the following 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.840
 grab your finger here, tighten it around the building 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.150
 and turn until it unlocks the 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.360
 locked up and I think the fold is in there 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.130
 I'll do it again, this is it. 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.090
 do not enter more than this he has spring 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.850
 he quit 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.400
 Only if I squeeze him in there. 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.080
 here in force and turn the gear 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.780
 After squeezing, I'll do it again. 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.030
 I tightened and rotated gear a little bit 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.130
 He does not go out but looks in there. 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.600
 Why are you stuck? 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.519
 now I come here and put cordioli is 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.820
 much easier to screw 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.820
 she 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.340
 to unlock dinho and there is no more 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:48.319
 that in occupied gaza he gives orders 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:53.060
 caught flat or I left here caught that 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:56.410
 is locked open unlocked perfect 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.410
 That's it, guys, thank you.
