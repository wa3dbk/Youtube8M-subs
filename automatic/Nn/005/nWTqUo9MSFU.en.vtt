for reference I'm at NC 40 by Mac and
this<00:01:36.789> is<00:01:37.149> a<00:01:37.509> perfect<00:01:38.349> match<00:01:38.619> for<00:01:38.859> my<00:01:39.009> skin<00:01:39.399> tone

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:39.639 
this is a perfect match for my skin tone

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:42.929 
this is a perfect match for my skin tone
and<00:01:40.170> what<00:01:41.170> urban<00:01:41.619> decay<00:01:41.920> claim<00:01:42.249> is<00:01:42.490> that<00:01:42.549> it<00:01:42.849> is

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
and what urban decay claim is that it is

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:44.999 
and what urban decay claim is that it is
a<00:01:42.969> weightless<00:01:43.569> ultra<00:01:44.229> definition<00:01:44.709> liquid

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
a weightless ultra definition liquid

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.879 
a weightless ultra definition liquid
makeup<00:01:45.249> it<00:01:46.179> gives<00:01:46.749> a<00:01:46.959> demi<00:01:47.200> matte<00:01:47.439> finish

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:47.889 
makeup it gives a demi matte finish

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:50.190 
makeup it gives a demi matte finish
which<00:01:48.279> it<00:01:48.459> definitely<00:01:48.999> does<00:01:49.240> it<00:01:49.779> kind<00:01:50.109> of

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
which it definitely does it kind of

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.800 
which it definitely does it kind of
blurs<00:01:50.469> imperfections<00:01:50.880> which<00:01:51.880> again<00:01:52.329> I<00:01:52.389> agree

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
blurs imperfections which again I agree

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.989 
blurs imperfections which again I agree
that<00:01:53.169> it<00:01:53.289> does<00:01:53.499> it<00:01:53.799> is<00:01:53.950> a<00:01:53.979> medium<00:01:54.520> to<00:01:54.669> buildable

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:54.999 
that it does it is a medium to buildable

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:59.159 
that it does it is a medium to buildable
coverage<00:01:55.509> foundation<00:01:56.289> so<00:01:56.999> you<00:01:57.999> don't<00:01:58.389> have<00:01:58.810> to

00:01:59.159 --> 00:01:59.169 
coverage foundation so you don't have to

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:01.749 
worry about kind of not getting the kind

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:03.479 
worry about kind of not getting the kind
of<00:02:01.840> coverage<00:02:02.169> that<00:02:02.289> you<00:02:02.409> want<00:02:02.649> if<00:02:03.310> you're

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:03.489 
of coverage that you want if you're

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:04.800 
of coverage that you want if you're
going<00:02:03.729> by<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:03.939> assumption<00:02:04.539> that<00:02:04.569> because

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
going by the assumption that because

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.449 
going by the assumption that because
it's<00:02:05.079> called<00:02:05.319> naked<00:02:05.529> that<00:02:05.889> it's<00:02:06.039> going<00:02:06.219> to<00:02:06.310> be

it's called naked that it's going to be

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.699 
it's called naked that it's going to be
light<00:02:06.639> coverage<00:02:06.999> it's<00:02:07.539> not<00:02:07.899> it's<00:02:08.110> it<00:02:08.349> gives<00:02:08.619> a

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
light coverage it's not it's it gives a

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.130 
light coverage it's not it's it gives a
really<00:02:08.950> good<00:02:09.130> coverage<00:02:09.459> and<00:02:09.729> for<00:02:10.599> me<00:02:10.810> it's

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
really good coverage and for me it's

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.440 
really good coverage and for me it's
more<00:02:11.380> of<00:02:11.440> a<00:02:11.680> summer<00:02:11.920> foundation<00:02:12.210> because<00:02:13.210> as

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
weightless finish like urban decay say

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.960 
weightless finish like urban decay say
to<00:02:35.470> me<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:35.830> feels<00:02:35.980> like<00:02:36.160> I'm<00:02:36.400> not<00:02:36.580> wearing

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
to me it feels like I'm not wearing

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.940 
to me it feels like I'm not wearing
anything<00:02:37.240> on<00:02:37.510> my<00:02:37.720> face<00:02:37.750> I<00:02:38.290> really<00:02:38.590> like<00:02:38.770> the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
anything on my face I really like the

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.280 
anything on my face I really like the
way<00:02:39.070> that<00:02:39.100> it<00:02:39.370> applies<00:02:39.790> what<00:02:40.750> you<00:02:40.870> got<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.140> do

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
way that it applies what you got to do

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.050 
way that it applies what you got to do
with<00:02:41.440> this<00:02:41.590> is<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.220> got<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.460> shake<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:45.060> it

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
with this is you got to shake it and it

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.700 
with this is you got to shake it and it
sounds<00:02:46.450> like<00:02:46.570> one<00:02:46.750> of<00:02:46.840> them<00:02:46.930> graffiti<00:02:47.320> bottles

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
sounds like one of them graffiti bottles

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.460 
sounds like one of them graffiti bottles
so<00:02:48.640> you've<00:02:49.180> got<00:02:49.300> to<00:02:49.420> shake<00:02:49.600> it<00:02:49.810> before<00:02:49.900> you<00:02:50.200> use

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
so you've got to shake it before you use

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.500 
so you've got to shake it before you use
it<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.890> it's<00:02:51.100> got<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:51.280> really<00:02:51.610> nice<00:02:51.850> pump<00:02:52.300> on

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
it and it's got a really nice pump on

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.150 
it and it's got a really nice pump on
the<00:02:52.630> top<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:54.000> here<00:02:55.000> is<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:55.750> little<00:02:56.050> bit<00:02:56.320> you<00:02:56.950> can

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
the top and here is a little bit you can

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.120 
the top and here is a little bit you can
see<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:57.730> is<00:02:57.970> quite<00:02:58.240> runny<00:03:00.390> so<00:03:01.920> you're<00:03:02.920> going<00:03:03.100> to

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
see it is quite runny so you're going to

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.440 
see it is quite runny so you're going to
work<00:03:03.280> quite<00:03:03.580> quickly<00:03:03.760> with<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:04.150> but<00:03:04.360> it

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
work quite quickly with it but it

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.180 
work quite quickly with it but it
doesn't<00:03:04.570> start<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:05.020> dry<00:03:05.260> straightaway<00:03:05.890> it

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
doesn't start to dry straightaway it

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.060 
doesn't start to dry straightaway it
really<00:03:06.700> nicely<00:03:07.000> kind<00:03:07.540> of<00:03:07.630> spreads<00:03:08.080> across<00:03:08.410> the

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
really nicely kind of spreads across the

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.180 
really nicely kind of spreads across the
skin<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:09.750> it<00:03:10.750> doesn't<00:03:10.900> clog<00:03:11.290> up<00:03:11.530> it<00:03:11.920> works

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
skin and it doesn't clog up it works

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.980 
skin and it doesn't clog up it works
really<00:03:12.430> nice<00:03:12.670> with<00:03:12.940> primer<00:03:13.240> underneath<00:03:13.660> I

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
really nice with primer underneath I

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.140 
really nice with primer underneath I
tend<00:03:14.350> to<00:03:14.410> use<00:03:14.470> my<00:03:14.680> benefit<00:03:15.280> Porefessional<00:03:15.460> or

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
tend to use my benefit Porefessional or

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.690 
tend to use my benefit Porefessional or
my<00:03:16.600> maybelline<00:03:17.140> baby<00:03:17.170> skin<00:03:17.500> but<00:03:18.340> as<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.550> can

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
my maybelline baby skin but as you can

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.690 
my maybelline baby skin but as you can
see<00:03:18.760> it<00:03:19.300> smooths<00:03:20.200> out<00:03:20.560> really<00:03:21.010> nicely

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
see it smooths out really nicely

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.460 
see it smooths out really nicely
it<00:03:21.850> doesn't<00:03:22.120> feel<00:03:22.240> sticky<00:03:22.840> or<00:03:22.870> anything<00:03:23.140> like

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
it doesn't feel sticky or anything like

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.670 
it doesn't feel sticky or anything like
that<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:24.310> I'd<00:03:24.460> say<00:03:24.490> it<00:03:24.880> takes<00:03:25.090> about<00:03:25.680> between

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
that and I'd say it takes about between

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.620 
that and I'd say it takes about between
five<00:03:27.040> to<00:03:27.220> 10<00:03:27.400> minutes<00:03:27.730> for<00:03:27.880> it<00:03:28.240> to<00:03:28.360> dry<00:03:28.569> down

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
five to 10 minutes for it to dry down

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.420 
five to 10 minutes for it to dry down
completely<00:03:29.350> depending<00:03:29.770> on<00:03:29.860> how<00:03:30.010> much<00:03:30.130> you've

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
completely depending on how much you've

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.940 
completely depending on how much you've
put<00:03:30.850> on<00:03:31.000> now<00:03:31.510> I<00:03:31.540> put<00:03:31.870> it<00:03:31.960> all<00:03:32.080> over<00:03:32.110> my<00:03:32.470> face<00:03:32.710> and

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
put on now I put it all over my face and

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.720 
put on now I put it all over my face and
then<00:03:33.069> I<00:03:33.580> double<00:03:33.970> up<00:03:34.060> on<00:03:34.240> my<00:03:34.569> cheek<00:03:34.900> area

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
then I double up on my cheek area

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.100 
then I double up on my cheek area
because<00:03:36.730> that's<00:03:37.180> where<00:03:37.450> I<00:03:37.480> tend<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:37.930> have<00:03:38.080> a

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
because that's where I tend to have a

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.080 
because that's where I tend to have a
little<00:03:38.410> bit<00:03:38.530> more<00:03:38.740> scarring<00:03:39.550> then<00:03:39.760> on<00:03:39.970> the

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
little bit more scarring then on the

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.130 
little bit more scarring then on the
rest<00:03:40.240> of<00:03:40.450> my<00:03:40.660> face

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
rest of my face

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
use some block power

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.000 
use some block power
in<00:04:29.560> those<00:04:29.710> areas<00:04:30.010> and<00:04:30.510> it<00:04:31.510> doesn't<00:04:31.870> fade<00:04:32.230> like

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
in those areas and it doesn't fade like

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.340 
in those areas and it doesn't fade like
in<00:04:33.340> a<00:04:33.460> really<00:04:33.700> obvious<00:04:33.910> way<00:04:34.480> it<00:04:34.720> may<00:04:34.870> fade<00:04:35.170> in

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
in a really obvious way it may fade in

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.900 
in a really obvious way it may fade in
certain<00:04:35.680> areas<00:04:36.070> especially<00:04:36.490> if<00:04:36.580> you're<00:04:36.730> like

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
certain areas especially if you're like

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.370 
certain areas especially if you're like
me<00:04:37.150> Nia<00:04:37.360> touching<00:04:37.750> your<00:04:37.870> nose<00:04:38.020> all<00:04:38.230> the<00:04:38.260> time

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
me Nia touching your nose all the time

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.460 
me Nia touching your nose all the time
and<00:04:38.800> touching<00:04:39.310> you<00:04:39.430> this<00:04:39.730> and<00:04:40.030> that<00:04:40.180> and<00:04:40.470> it

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
and touching you this and that and it

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.680 
and touching you this and that and it
tends<00:04:41.740> to<00:04:41.890> just<00:04:42.040> kind<00:04:42.490> of<00:04:42.550> fade<00:04:42.790> in<00:04:42.970> a<00:04:43.060> nice<00:04:43.330> and

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
tends to just kind of fade in a nice and

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.400 
tends to just kind of fade in a nice and
general<00:04:44.080> way<00:04:44.290> so<00:04:44.350> overall<00:04:44.980> I<00:04:45.430> would<00:04:45.490> give<00:04:45.700> this

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
general way so overall I would give this

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.430 
general way so overall I would give this
foundation<00:04:47.410> a<00:04:47.770> 10<00:04:48.670> out<00:04:48.820> of<00:04:48.850> 10<00:04:49.090> I<00:04:49.330> think<00:04:50.020> it's

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
foundation a 10 out of 10 I think it's

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.140 
foundation a 10 out of 10 I think it's
great<00:04:50.740> I<00:04:50.800> think<00:04:51.010> it's<00:04:51.280> a<00:04:51.430> beautiful<00:04:51.880> light

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150

and it comes in loads of different
colors<00:05:01.690> I<00:05:01.840> normally<00:05:02.170> find<00:05:02.440> finding<00:05:03.100> colors

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
colors I normally find finding colors

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.090 
colors I normally find finding colors
for<00:05:04.090> me<00:05:04.210> in<00:05:04.360> foundation<00:05:05.020> quite<00:05:05.440> difficult<00:05:05.710> but

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
for me in foundation quite difficult but

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.520 
for me in foundation quite difficult but
with<00:05:06.280> this<00:05:06.510> but<00:05:07.510> there's<00:05:07.690> very<00:05:07.840> yellow<00:05:08.260> tone

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
with this but there's very yellow tone

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.050 
with this but there's very yellow tone
and<00:05:08.770> then<00:05:08.860> there's<00:05:09.040> pink<00:05:09.340> tone<00:05:09.670> and<00:05:09.940> then

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
and then there's pink tone and then

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.460 
and then there's pink tone and then
there's<00:05:10.240> beige<00:05:10.450> tone<00:05:10.750> so<00:05:10.990> more<00:05:11.170> than<00:05:11.260> likely

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
there's beige tone so more than likely

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.160 
there's beige tone so more than likely
