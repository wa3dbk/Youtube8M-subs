00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
drain in the water because its water

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.859 
drain in the water because its water
soluble<00:01:10.450> and<00:01:11.130> also<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.670> high<00:01:12.940> heat<00:01:13.390> that<00:01:13.750> is

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
pasteurized below the boiling point so

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.469 
pasteurized below the boiling point so
