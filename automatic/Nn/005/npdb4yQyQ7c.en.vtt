00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.320
 exclusively for not counting July 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.690
 cameo and mariana seoane and we saw it 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.760
 they shared with us the filming 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.410
 from the knees videoclip I ask you this 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.970
 it was in coatzacoalcos veracruz and we are going to 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.670
 see everything that happened 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.199
 several occasions of veracruz were the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.789
 perfect frame for recording the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.160
 knees videoclip I ask you of Mariana 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.869
 seoane and julio camejo exclusively for 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.369
 do not tell, we show you an advance 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.899
 of what they filmed in the center of 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.519
 conventions where both singers 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.519
 splurge a passion and sensuality 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.680
 I got to produce this video as 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.110
 bedrooms 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.090
 I proposed the idea the first thing that 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.520
 I said it was going to be very exhausting is going to be 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:09.780
 very physically tired is going to be 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.540
 devastating all that is part of but 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.020
 that's part d 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.110
 from the superficial part of what arrives 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.750
 of the obvious but what is going to 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.110
 intrinsic in it is the ability to 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.540
 we can dance to be able to act 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.760
 a song to be able to sing the song and 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.050
 able to interpret it despite the fatigue and 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.790
 physical exhaustion by the arduous 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.770
 Marian days we do all the time 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.270
 impeccable because although we are 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.280
 high temperatures was not an impediment 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.840
 for khedira the best of himself and endure 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.050
 the past recordings of the three of 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.050
 the morning 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.640
 I believe that everything in life has to 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.770
 to see that you love what you do if you love 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.570
 what do you do ok if you are tired already 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.160
 Sometimes it is not eaten well and everything 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.870
 reveal what it is but there is a 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.060
 special motivation there is not that 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.530
 motivation is that you love your work and 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.150
 show the public what we are 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.070
 doing with so much love then good 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.840
 that's worth the sacrifice 8 in 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.700
 Sometimes a water pipe a car 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.530
 collection more than 35 people from 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.240
 production lighting equipment people 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.680
 of safety and even the bites of 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.480
 insects were just some of the 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.010
 ingredients for this video clip to be 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.510
 will fill with magic and of course also 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.510
 of the talent of that one and camejo 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.390
 the truth is this is an ostentatious but 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.310
 I want to make a video when he had 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.380
 right now the music industry 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.840
 walks at a very bad time evidently 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.880
 almost all artists 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.390
 they produce their things from their bag because 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.970
 because the label does not have a weight 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.400
 so 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.960
 because of that, because you see a video and see 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.860
 the other and you see the other and the other is the 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.600
 another and it's very similar to everything then 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.250
 I wanted to be something different finally the 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.780
 good girl revealed to be very demanding in 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.550
 As regards work, it is very important 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.290
 important for her to deliver to 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.690
 public a quality project which 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.340
 we can enjoy within a month then 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.590
 I am demanding I have to like what 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.090
 I do and above all beyond a 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.220
 perfection because perfection does not 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.600
 there is no but I try to do things 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.390
 how I feel them and when I think there 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.520
 naturalness and flows I think it's fine 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.350
 there is feeling and that has to be 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.350
 truth there is no truth report 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:49.200
 the theme is of marianna truth is a 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:52.440
 cover and camejo is the producer of the video 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.150
 and also acts with her but does not sing the 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.650
 true that is the choirs of man the 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.650
 does another person do not do them 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.280
 leezza leezza you want what good 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:11.100

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:17.190
