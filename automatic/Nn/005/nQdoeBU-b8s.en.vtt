00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.200
 first four months 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.080
 now it's time to learn a lot of leaders 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.580
 strategic as napoleon the alexandre of the source of the great river 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.840

 whole chair that today at all levels 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.090
 people with leadership skills 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.050
 Yes, companies do. 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.270
 the leader 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.270
 always has a set of qualities 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.460
 the power of decision vision of the future 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.050
 and many others 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.600
 it's with that quality 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.530
 if you're going to get into a day-to-day situation 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.570
 are the situations 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.570
 take charge of leaders 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.410
 all 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.290
 Carmen Miranda 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.600
 the word also releasing the leading Englishman who means and in front 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:16.779
 this prominent place in front of the other mg sometimes a lot of fighting 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:20.029
 but there was the sport could be simply mixed 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:22.359
 ahead 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:24.569
 but the concept of leadership 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:25.979
 is much higher 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:29.669
 leadership means also kills the trends are unequal 

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:35.019
 a time nothing against him if he does not assert his ancestry over the 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.329
 orchestra musicians 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.290
 another aspect of leadership 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.149
 this influence 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:46.189
 already noticed how the great idols consecrated by the media and was tiny 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:47.619
 people 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:49.759
 kept in due proportion 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:52.329
 the leader does not have to be an idol 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.169
 will also have to have the power to influence released 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.499
 there is one of the key points of the concept of leadership 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:03.309
 the power of the leader 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:06.370
 can affect the ability to influence people's lives 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.339
 and the events back 

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:12.979
 is a way of exercising power 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:14.509
 a potential loss 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:16.109
 which includes a link 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.509
 a vote of confidence even generated evident 

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:22.359
 it's a different power 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.889
 but there are several other types of power deficiencies 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.559
 any change is that leadership as could be so few people 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.209
 people react with satisfaction 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:41.369
 I know you're a leader. 

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:44.659
 identify with it its purposes 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.979
 delegated to him his representation 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:51.139
 make a psychological contract with the leader 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.239
 in no way shall the parties benefit 

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:58.459
 endorse and support the changes introduced by it 

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:02.529
 the idc factor the ones led and vice versa 

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:07.169
 the leader usually does not struggle easy or physical coercion to get items will have 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:10.169
 priority for family 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.259
 the situation of families 

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:18.359
 an indebted country physically and morally destroyed as the Germany of the 1920s 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.889
 after losing the first war 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:25.580
 presented a perfect picture for the rise of Nazism and the rise of a 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.830
 root 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.949
 he ran-away 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:29.620
 a few clicks 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.620
 the leader that the situation requires
