between this and your CPU one thing of
concern<00:02:31.580> here<00:02:31.610> though<00:02:32.030> about<00:02:32.270> this<00:02:32.510> cooler<00:02:32.840> is

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
concern here though about this cooler is

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.500 
concern here though about this cooler is
the<00:02:33.470> clip<00:02:33.739> design<00:02:34.099> it's<00:02:34.670> poorly<00:02:35.209> designed

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
the clip design it's poorly designed

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
it's easy to get on but it's not easy to

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.370 
it's easy to get on but it's not easy to
remove<00:02:39.700> next<00:02:40.700> let's<00:02:40.940> see<00:02:41.180> how<00:02:41.420> loud<00:02:41.660> this<00:02:42.019> fan

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
to really vary in temperature if you

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.110 
to really vary in temperature if you
might<00:03:29.650> get<00:03:29.829> a<00:03:29.860> 3<00:03:30.250> or<00:03:30.400> 4<00:03:30.700> degrees<00:03:30.909> Celsius

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
might get a 3 or 4 degrees Celsius

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.240 
might get a 3 or 4 degrees Celsius
difference<00:03:31.959> or<00:03:32.140> you<00:03:32.260> might<00:03:32.530> get<00:03:32.739> as<00:03:32.890> much<00:03:33.040> as<00:03:33.220> a

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
difference or you might get as much as a

difference or you might get as much as a
10<00:03:33.640> degree<00:03:34.150> Celsius<00:03:34.540> difference<00:03:35.170> it<00:03:35.470> depends

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
10 degree Celsius difference it depends

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.800 
10 degree Celsius difference it depends
on<00:03:36.310> where<00:03:36.519> the<00:03:36.640> hard<00:03:36.909> drives<00:03:37.209> are<00:03:37.480> what

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
on where the hard drives are what

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.900 
on where the hard drives are what
they're<00:03:37.959> on<00:03:38.049> top<00:03:38.319> of<00:03:38.530> and<00:03:38.680> so<00:03:39.190> on<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:39.489> so<00:03:39.609> forth

they're on top of and so on and so forth

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.170 
they're on top of and so on and so forth
but<00:03:40.329> overall<00:03:40.720> these<00:03:41.560> products<00:03:42.160> offer<00:03:42.430> great
