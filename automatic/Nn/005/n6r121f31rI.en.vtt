00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:09.950
 the processor we have a family of pixel camera 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:13.220
 the phone comes such a brand 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:19.060
 samsung box unlock like 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:22.420
 the original back cover is made under the skin 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:29.020
 Streltsova is his 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:32.509
 capacitive phishychka rear easily removed 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:35.630
 here here is just one micro bag 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:39.489
 sim and memory card respectively 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.489
 speaker digital camera 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.670
 sis such line as in the original 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.860
 also stylized under the skin is not skin 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.480
 wore a zone under the skin then very similar 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.950
 the way the original is also not leather 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.149
 here are a bunch of sensors you can 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:05.590
 enable or disable 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.590
 also as on the original play market 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:14.369
 like or wigs on whether you can flip 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:20.740
 menu don't touch the phone like this 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:25.119
 I see you have the same sensor 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:29.649
 which allows you to do it 5 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:35.729
 desktops can post on them 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:39.689
 its there and that all sorts of anything 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.689
 let's see the indicator antutu 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:49.450
 the dough was not here by zeros so 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.290
 6589 quad core processor 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.870
 screen resolution of 1800mah 1920 rather 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.880
 everything is possibly wrong but so be it 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:03.000

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:05.560
 less RAM 2nd byte we specified 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.780
 112 megapixel camera check in 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.280
 several programs everywhere writes 12 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.470
 megapixels so this is likely 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.040
 the way it is 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:18.040

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.590
 braking the phone like this 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.020
 close so that your phone does not slow down 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.270
 with such a huge screen of course 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:37.720

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:40.590

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.590
 and when it is already in Russian and 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:04:03.840
