point two megapixel DX sensor with no
olp<00:00:42.960> f<00:00:43.230> now<00:00:43.920> if<00:00:43.980> you're<00:00:44.100> asking<00:00:44.340> yourself<00:00:44.730> what

olp f now if you're asking yourself what

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.110 
olp f now if you're asking yourself what
did<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.270> Nikon<00:00:45.629> d70<00:00:46.170> 100<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:47.219> well<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.940> had<00:00:48.090> a

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
did the Nikon d70 100 have well it had a

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.200 
did the Nikon d70 100 have well it had a
twenty<00:00:48.629> four<00:00:48.840> point<00:00:49.110> one<00:00:49.910> megapixel<00:00:50.910> sensor

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
twenty four point one megapixel sensor

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.810 
twenty four point one megapixel sensor
so<00:00:51.360> what's<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.660> difference<00:00:51.989> here<00:00:52.170> point<00:00:53.010> one

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
so what's the difference here point one

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.049 
so what's the difference here point one
megapixel<00:00:54.809> not<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.559> big<00:00:55.920> deal<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.550> much<00:00:56.760> there

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
megapixel not a big deal so much there

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.119 
megapixel not a big deal so much there
it<00:00:57.270> still<00:00:57.660> shoots<00:00:57.960> at<00:00:58.109> six<00:00:58.350> frames<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.770> second

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
it still shoots at six frames a second

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.959 
it still shoots at six frames a second
seven<00:00:59.879> frames<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.359> second<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:01.039> 1.3<00:01:02.039> x<00:01:02.340> crop<00:01:02.730> mode

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
seven frames a second in 1.3 x crop mode

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.479 
seven frames a second in 1.3 x crop mode
so<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.570> crop<00:01:03.840> mode<00:01:04.110> you're<00:01:04.530> getting<00:01:04.799> one<00:01:05.070> extra

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
so in crop mode you're getting one extra

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.370 
so in crop mode you're getting one extra
frame<00:01:05.700> per<00:01:05.909> second<00:01:06.330> now<00:01:06.630> where<00:01:06.810> they<00:01:06.930> did<00:01:07.170> make

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
frame per second now where they did make

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.109 
frame per second now where they did make
a<00:01:07.409> change<00:01:07.740> here<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.400> processor<00:01:08.939> is

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
a change here is that the processor is

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.399 
a change here is that the processor is
30%<00:01:09.570> faster<00:01:10.020> meaning<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.490> will<00:01:11.640> get<00:01:11.820> 18<00:01:12.479> 14

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
30% faster meaning you will get 18 14

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.789 
30% faster meaning you will get 18 14
bit<00:01:13.650> RAW<00:01:13.890> files<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.939> row<00:01:15.180> opposed<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.110> six<00:01:16.530> in

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
bit RAW files in a row opposed to six in

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.929 
bit RAW files in a row opposed to six in
the<00:01:17.250> d70<00:01:17.820> 100<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.810> also<00:01:19.229> will<00:01:19.380> get<00:01:19.530> 100<00:01:20.340> JPEGs

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
the d70 100 you also will get 100 JPEGs

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.880 
the d70 100 you also will get 100 JPEGs
inside<00:01:21.810> don't<00:01:21.960> remember<00:01:22.229> what<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.470> old<00:01:22.500> one

inside don't remember what the old one

was I think was 35 or something but

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.410 
was I think was 35 or something but
you'll<00:01:24.960> get<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> hundred<00:01:25.400> JPEGs<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.820> row<00:01:27.030> now

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420

remember that now on to some of the

so that means that any lens that you put

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.729 
so that means that any lens that you put
on<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.150> there<00:03:00.420> you're<00:03:00.810> going<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:00.989> multiply<00:03:01.409> it

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739

mode<00:03:05.549> at<00:03:05.700> least<00:03:05.849> I<00:03:05.970> think<00:03:06.030> so<00:03:06.239> that's<00:03:06.569> how<00:03:06.720> it

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
mode at least I think so that's how it

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.899 
mode at least I think so that's how it
works<00:03:07.049> but<00:03:07.530> it's<00:03:07.650> magnifying<00:03:08.190> it<00:03:08.340> even<00:03:08.670> more

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
works but it's magnifying it even more

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.849 
works but it's magnifying it even more
but<00:03:09.269> you're<00:03:09.450> still<00:03:09.750> getting<00:03:09.959> 1080<00:03:10.620> at<00:03:10.829> 60

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
but you're still getting 1080 at 60

but you're still getting 1080 at 60
frames<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.639> second<00:03:12.000> so<00:03:12.060> even<00:03:12.420> though<00:03:12.540> you're

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
frames a second so even though you're

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.170 
frames a second so even though you're
using<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:13.049> smaller<00:03:13.319> portion<00:03:13.590> it's<00:03:14.280> still<00:03:14.609> 1080

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
using a smaller portion it's still 1080

you're<00:03:15.690> not<00:03:15.900> losing<00:03:16.290> quality<00:03:16.530> when<00:03:17.159> you<00:03:17.310> do

you're not losing quality when you do

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.699 
you're not losing quality when you do
that<00:03:17.609> it<00:03:17.790> also<00:03:17.909> does<00:03:18.180> 1080<00:03:18.569> at<00:03:18.720> 24<00:03:19.169> thirty<00:03:19.500> and

the normal settings that it does there

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:22.879 
the normal settings that it does there
let's<00:03:22.440> see

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
let's see

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:25.430 
let's see
it<00:03:23.730> has<00:03:23.910> zebra<00:03:24.329> stripes<00:03:24.660> which<00:03:24.900> it<00:03:25.019> hasn't<00:03:25.199> had

outside the ISO and exposure would

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.300 
outside the ISO and exposure would
generally<00:04:02.879> go<00:04:03.329> smooth<00:04:03.900> but<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:04.709> still<00:04:05.040> lock

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
generally go smooth but you still lock

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.759 
generally go smooth but you still lock

thousandth of a second but that is

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.740 
thousandth of a second but that is
full-frame<00:04:26.460> and<00:04:26.669> then<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.150> biggest

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
full-frame and then the biggest

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.150 
full-frame and then the biggest
well<00:04:28.050> before<00:04:28.500> I<00:04:28.530> get<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:28.890> biggest

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
well before I get to the biggest

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.990 
well before I get to the biggest
question<00:04:29.520> it<00:04:29.760> has<00:04:30.360> Wi-Fi<00:04:30.630> plus<00:04:31.490> NFC<00:04:32.490> so<00:04:32.850> if<00:04:32.910> you

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
question it has Wi-Fi plus NFC so if you

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.730 
question it has Wi-Fi plus NFC so if you
don't<00:04:33.150> know<00:04:33.210> what<00:04:33.330> NFC<00:04:33.780> is<00:04:33.930> you<00:04:34.110> basically<00:04:34.500> can

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
don't know what NFC is you basically can

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.590 
don't know what NFC is you basically can
say<00:04:34.950> a<00:04:35.100> lot<00:04:35.280> of<00:04:35.400> Android<00:04:35.670> devices<00:04:36.060> or<00:04:36.330> NFC

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
say a lot of Android devices or NFC

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.910 
say a lot of Android devices or NFC
compatible<00:04:37.200> and<00:04:37.350> so<00:04:37.470> is<00:04:37.560> the<00:04:37.650> new<00:04:37.770> iPhone

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.800 
compatible and so is the new iPhone
where<00:04:38.580> you'll<00:04:38.700> be<00:04:38.790> able<00:04:38.850> to<00:04:39.090> just<00:04:39.300> touch<00:04:39.570> the

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 
world review that we did of that so you

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.680 
world review that we did of that so you
can<00:06:32.250> see<00:06:32.430> if<00:06:32.550> that's<00:06:32.790> a<00:06:32.970> camera<00:06:33.300> for<00:06:33.450> you<00:06:33.540> but

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
can see if that's a camera for you but

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.320 
can see if that's a camera for you but
that<00:06:33.810> is<00:06:34.110> more<00:06:34.530> expensive<00:06:35.010> than<00:06:35.460> this<00:06:36.000> camera

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
that is more expensive than this camera

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.670 
that is more expensive than this camera
so<00:06:36.450> I<00:06:36.479> don't<00:06:36.780> think<00:06:36.960> that<00:06:37.140> this<00:06:37.260> is<00:06:37.470> a<00:06:37.500> direct

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
so I don't think that this is a direct

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.880 
so I don't think that this is a direct
competitor<00:06:38.280> but<00:06:38.940> this<00:06:39.120> is<00:06:39.300> a<00:06:39.330> very<00:06:39.840> very<00:06:40.590> nice
