00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.200
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.270
 from me and I will show you once 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.130
 my dsds donate purpose 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.450
 I have two pictures of the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.340
 beta copied and I like the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.240
 actually pretty good and me too 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.940
 start with a small one 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.800
 size comparison with a clown 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.800
 the one meter 83 big loud wikipedia 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.660
 and the quiet he's at 98 and you see 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.470
 that and small difference in height the poet 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.970
 is a piece higher 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.039
 So actually from the scale 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.619
 the mini figures, I think it's pretty 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:34.200
 fitting and yes then everyone in itself 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.510
 currently a bit around with this 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.649
 I can also have spherical bodies here 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.390
 show again from below 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.570
 He also likes me very much 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.579
 this rippled here and again from 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.530
 above 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.610
 yes yes we say the middle of these antennas 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.890
 I have that with a lego 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.969
 I made that rangefinder 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.129
 down here in this disc with pure 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.129
 that means he is not any 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.219
 how glued or so yes that of landi 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.629
 Doing two dark red photos and that 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.809
 protected that can swing after 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.489
 built above and below and from silver 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.830
 is in the middle it still has one 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.900
 small dark gray gear for one 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.630
 little detail and the run is with 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.950
 a handle not later made then 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.229
 The four-legged friends are all the same 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.759
 Of course, and now I'm one of 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.330
 I like them pretty much, too 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.790
 It's pretty much mechanical 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.409
 down here only at this main pay 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.119
 I call this metallic 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.150
 dark gray about it then we are so small 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.100
 woide names for bracing here 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.200
 then a curve outside and behind 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.850
 a bit of technology then the river 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.170
 The result of a binoculars is yes 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.500
 then we watch from above times times 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.020
 These two dark dealers one side and one 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.340
 I actually have my legs like me 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.939
 find relatively good from the original 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.640
 accepted 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.020
 as it has seen in the picture and 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.750
 yes for the size of the druid like more 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.270
 generally very good 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.049
 I hope you like of course 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.930
 and if so, of course I would 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.969
 look forward to a like or other 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.399
 and I wanted everyone on number 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.740
 Thank you for more than 50,000 video views 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.119
 that's really cool because 50,000 is the one 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.619
 whole lot like me 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.019
 and in any case big thank you 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.670
 for that and then I would say we see 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.670
 hopefully means in the next
