00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
hello here I have rare development flash

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.050 
hello here I have rare development flash
cartridges<00:00:03.659> for<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.110> Nintendo<00:00:04.529> 64<00:00:05.060> they're

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
cartridges for the Nintendo 64 they're

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.360 
cartridges for the Nintendo 64 they're
really<00:00:06.330> used<00:00:06.569> for<00:00:06.839> game<00:00:07.020> development<00:00:07.529> they

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
really used for game development they

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.259 
really used for game development they
are<00:00:08.400> quite<00:00:08.849> different<00:00:09.090> from<00:00:09.769> d<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.269> normal

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
are quite different from d and normal

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.209 
are quite different from d and normal
well<00:00:12.660> these<00:00:13.259> are<00:00:13.410> normal<00:00:13.679> as<00:00:13.740> well<00:00:13.889> but<00:00:14.099> the

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
well these are normal as well but the

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.750 
well these are normal as well but the
normal<00:00:14.639> flash<00:00:15.420> costliness<00:00:15.929> which<00:00:16.730> do<00:00:17.730> not

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
normal flash costliness which do not

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.980 
normal flash costliness which do not
have<00:00:17.940> this<00:00:19.100> PCB<00:00:20.100> sticking<00:00:20.730> out<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.779> top<00:00:21.960> of

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
have this PCB sticking out of the top of

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.340 
have this PCB sticking out of the top of
the<00:00:22.199> cartridge<00:00:23.840> there<00:00:24.840> are<00:00:24.990> quite<00:00:25.199> some

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
the cartridge there are quite some

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.189 
the cartridge there are quite some
different<00:00:26.039> labels<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.849> writings<00:00:27.420> on<00:00:27.900> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
different labels and writings on the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.710 
different labels and writings on the
cartridges<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:29.580> one<00:00:29.820> for<00:00:30.179> instance<00:00:30.510> has

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
cartridges this one for instance has

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.080 
cartridges this one for instance has
conker<00:00:31.590> 64<00:00:32.219> only<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.710> it<00:00:34.710> was<00:00:34.890> made<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.250> 1998

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
conker 64 only and it was made in 1998

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.260 
conker 64 only and it was made in 1998
the<00:00:36.630> actual<00:00:36.960> cartridge<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.890> it's<00:00:38.190> 512<00:00:39.000> mega

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
the actual cartridge and it's 512 mega

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.319 
the actual cartridge and it's 512 mega
bits<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.809> suppose<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.890> did<00:00:41.309> contain<00:00:41.610> conker

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
bits so I suppose it did contain conker

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.819 
bits so I suppose it did contain conker
12<00:00:42.600> tails<00:00:42.870> at<00:00:43.110> one<00:00:43.260> point<00:00:43.700> this<00:00:44.700> one's<00:00:45.059> got

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
12 tails at one point this one's got

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.040 
12 tails at one point this one's got
sort<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.219> element<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.210> picture<00:00:48.780> a

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
sort of a element of the picture a

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.240 
sort of a element of the picture a
photograph<00:00:50.270> sticker<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.539> somebody<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.320> do<00:00:52.949> not

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
photograph sticker of somebody I do not

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.830 
photograph sticker of somebody I do not
quite<00:00:53.670> know<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.360> details<00:00:55.070> on<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:57.030> right<00:00:57.329> we

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
quite know the details on the right we

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.229 
quite know the details on the right we
have<00:00:57.870> two<00:00:58.410> dongles<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.280> certainly<00:00:59.879> they<00:01:00.120> are

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
have two dongles a certainly they are

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.130 
have two dongles a certainly they are
called<00:01:00.800> they<00:01:01.800> are<00:01:02.100> actually<00:01:02.640> indeed<00:01:03.140> CIC

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
called they are actually indeed CIC

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.630 
called they are actually indeed CIC
ships<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:06.260> they<00:01:07.260> I'm<00:01:07.920> not<00:01:08.100> quite<00:01:08.280> sure<00:01:08.310> what

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
ships and they I'm not quite sure what

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.730 
ships and they I'm not quite sure what
exactly<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.150> think<00:01:09.570> they<00:01:09.689> contain<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.260> region

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
exactly I think they contain the region

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.940 
exactly I think they contain the region
lockout<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:12.170> security<00:01:13.170> information<00:01:13.409> and

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
lockout and security information and

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.770 
lockout and security information and
such<00:01:14.750> there's<00:01:15.750> no<00:01:16.820> specific<00:01:17.820> difference

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
such there's no specific difference

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.749 
such there's no specific difference
between<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.500> colours<00:01:19.830> on<00:01:20.009> these<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.520> just

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
between the colours on these it's just

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.460 
between the colours on these it's just
two<00:01:21.150> different<00:01:21.799> CIC<00:01:22.799> chip<00:01:23.280> versions<00:01:24.470> they

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
two different CIC chip versions they

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.440 
two different CIC chip versions they
plug<00:01:25.950> em<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.240> serial<00:01:27.930> ports<00:01:28.350> over<00:01:28.740> there

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
plug em to the serial ports over there

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.969 
plug em to the serial ports over there
and<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.570> try<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.049> make<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> demonstration

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
and we can try to make a demonstration

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.740 
and we can try to make a demonstration
I'm<00:01:32.369> not<00:01:32.520> quite<00:01:32.790> sure<00:01:32.820> if<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.299> could<00:01:33.360> get<00:01:33.600> this

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
I'm not quite sure if I could get this

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.590 
I'm not quite sure if I could get this
working<00:01:34.400> keeper<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.579> say<00:01:35.759> like<00:01:36.000> there<00:01:36.270> and

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
working keeper and say like there and

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.020 
working keeper and say like there and
then<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.960> you're<00:01:37.320> screwed<00:01:37.680> on<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.220> make<00:01:38.880> sure

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
then you you're screwed on I make sure

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.100 
then you you're screwed on I make sure
that<00:01:39.060> stays<00:01:39.570> on<00:01:39.780> there<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.899> all<00:01:42.899> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
that stays on there like so all the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.889 
that stays on there like so all the
cartridges<00:01:43.530> are<00:01:43.890> individually<00:01:44.579> numbered

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
cartridges are individually numbered

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.660 
cartridges are individually numbered
will<00:01:45.899> uh<00:01:45.930> not<00:01:46.170> sure<00:01:46.200> if<00:01:46.740> there's<00:01:47.009> any<00:01:47.430> specific

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
will uh not sure if there's any specific

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.679 
will uh not sure if there's any specific
details<00:01:48.360> as<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:49.049> why<00:01:49.850> this<00:01:50.850> cartridge<00:01:51.420> for

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
details as of why this cartridge for

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.209 
details as of why this cartridge for
example<00:01:52.170> has<00:01:52.380> two<00:01:53.659> outputs<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:56.009> back

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
example has two outputs on the back

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.399 
example has two outputs on the back
whilst<00:01:57.200> 2060<00:01:58.200> for<00:01:58.380> instance<00:01:58.829> only<00:01:58.979> has<00:01:59.250> one

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
whilst 2060 for instance only has one

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.730 
whilst 2060 for instance only has one
here<00:02:01.340> we<00:02:01.490> have<00:02:01.670> a<00:02:01.700> rare<00:02:02.299> flash<00:02:02.689> board<00:02:03.079> version

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
here we have a rare flash board version

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.109 
here we have a rare flash board version
one<00:02:04.509> I'm<00:02:05.509> not<00:02:05.750> quite<00:02:06.049> sure<00:02:06.399> if<00:02:07.399> it<00:02:07.729> is<00:02:07.789> supposed

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
one I'm not quite sure if it is supposed

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.930 
one I'm not quite sure if it is supposed
to<00:02:08.179> look<00:02:08.330> like<00:02:08.390> this<00:02:08.690> but<00:02:08.899> just<00:02:08.929> at<00:02:09.380> PCB<00:02:09.950> but

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
to look like this but just at PCB but

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.410 
to look like this but just at PCB but
I'm<00:02:11.900> pretty<00:02:12.319> sure<00:02:12.560> at<00:02:13.310> one<00:02:13.519> point<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:14.180> was

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
I'm pretty sure at one point it was

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.110 
I'm pretty sure at one point it was
supposed<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:14.810> set<00:02:15.080> inside<00:02:15.530> a<00:02:15.590> cartridge<00:02:16.250> now

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
supposed to set inside a cartridge now

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
supposed to set inside a cartridge now
generally<00:02:17.630> it<00:02:17.720> goes<00:02:17.959> in<00:02:18.200> here<00:02:18.230> on<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:20.140> flash

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
generally it goes in here on the flash

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.530 
generally it goes in here on the flash
cartridge<00:02:21.709> here<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:23.030> reason<00:02:23.209> for<00:02:23.420> that

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
cartridge here and the reason for that

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.949 
cartridge here and the reason for that
is<00:02:23.900> that<00:02:24.319> well<00:02:25.130> I<00:02:25.400> can<00:02:25.670> only<00:02:25.790> assume<00:02:25.940> that<00:02:26.180> the

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
is that well I can only assume that the

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.400 
is that well I can only assume that the
cartridge<00:02:27.440> here<00:02:28.060> only<00:02:29.060> has<00:02:29.330> temporary<00:02:30.019> RAM

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
cartridge here only has temporary RAM

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.900 
cartridge here only has temporary RAM
and<00:02:30.739> side<00:02:31.040> which<00:02:32.440> unlike<00:02:33.440> this<00:02:34.370> cartridge

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
and side which unlike this cartridge

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
and side which unlike this cartridge
that<00:02:34.940> can<00:02:35.269> hold<00:02:36.130> unlimited<00:02:37.130> flash<00:02:37.459> memory

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
that can hold unlimited flash memory

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.539 
that can hold unlimited flash memory
this<00:02:38.930> one<00:02:39.140> cannot<00:02:39.650> I<00:02:39.980> think<00:02:40.400> it's

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
this one cannot I think it's

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.580 
this one cannot I think it's
automatically<00:02:41.030> erases<00:02:41.420> after<00:02:41.989> 10<00:02:42.260> or<00:02:42.410> so

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
automatically erases after 10 or so

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.110 
automatically erases after 10 or so
hours<00:02:43.099> so<00:02:44.030> this<00:02:44.510> little<00:02:45.250> PCB<00:02:46.250> that<00:02:46.580> goes

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
hours so this little PCB that goes

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.860 
hours so this little PCB that goes
inside<00:02:47.299> here<00:02:47.840> is<00:02:48.170> actually<00:02:48.940> like<00:02:49.940> a<00:02:50.150> save<00:02:50.450> card

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
inside here is actually like a save card

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.009 
inside here is actually like a save card
where<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:52.459> game<00:02:52.700> data<00:02:53.000> gets<00:02:53.269> saved<00:02:53.540> too<00:02:53.780> so

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
where the game data gets saved too so

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.309 
where the game data gets saved too so
you<00:02:54.110> can<00:02:54.140> load<00:02:54.500> your<00:02:54.530> file<00:02:55.180> by<00:02:56.180> just<00:02:56.540> rewriting

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
you can load your file by just rewriting

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.830 
you can load your file by just rewriting
the<00:02:57.920> ROM<00:02:58.160> to<00:02:58.459> the<00:02:58.549> cartridge<00:02:59.060> instead<00:02:59.690> of

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
the ROM to the cartridge instead of

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.319 
the ROM to the cartridge instead of
having<00:03:00.709> to<00:03:00.950> replay<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.370> game<00:03:01.459> every<00:03:02.060> time

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
having to replay the game every time

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.130 
having to replay the game every time
this<00:03:03.319> is<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.709> PCB<00:03:04.400> of<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:05.090> flash<00:03:05.480> cartridge

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
this is the PCB of the flash cartridge

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.130 
this is the PCB of the flash cartridge
on<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:07.190> top<00:03:07.430> which<00:03:08.000> was<00:03:08.420> miserable<00:03:08.720> before

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140
