leaf image I'll have a link to this leaf

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.030 
leaf image I'll have a link to this leaf
in<00:00:21.560> the<00:00:21.710> description<00:00:22.690> so<00:00:23.690> go<00:00:23.990> down<00:00:24.350> to<00:00:24.560> toolbox

Lipsy tool now make a circle where you

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:35.080 
Lipsy tool now make a circle where you
want<00:00:33.590> your<00:00:33.710> range<00:00:33.950> up<00:00:34.129> to<00:00:34.160> be<00:00:34.370> placed<00:00:34.700> I'm

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
brush to a fuzzy put it on weight and

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.370 
brush to a fuzzy put it on weight and
make<00:01:57.280> a<00:01:57.310> little<00:01:57.700> dot<00:01:58.299> where<00:02:01.080> you<00:02:02.080> want<00:02:02.259> the

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
make a little dot where you want the

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.539 
make a little dot where you want the
reflection<00:02:02.890> of<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.130> Sun<00:02:03.310> to<00:02:03.520> be<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:05.590> so

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
reflection of the Sun to be so so

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.479 
reflection of the Sun to be so so
basically<00:02:06.970> if<00:02:07.869> you<00:02:08.080> were<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.229> make<00:02:08.380> more<00:02:08.709> you

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
basically if you were to make more you

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.320 
basically if you were to make more you
would<00:02:09.640> want<00:02:09.880> your<00:02:10.560> sign<00:02:11.560> and<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.760> same<00:02:13.000> spot

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
would want your sign and the same spot

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.850 
would want your sign and the same spot
for<00:02:13.569> all<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.900> drops<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.350> make<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.530> good<00:02:15.310> effect

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
it a nice looking raindrop in GIMP

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.520 
it a nice looking raindrop in GIMP
simple<00:02:27.100> effect<00:02:27.370> not<00:02:27.610> hard<00:02:27.880> at<00:02:28.000> all<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.530> if
