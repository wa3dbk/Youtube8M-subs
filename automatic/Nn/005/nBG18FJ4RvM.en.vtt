your<00:02:31.030> body<00:02:31.150> is<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.810> we<00:02:32.200> create<00:02:32.760> yoga<00:02:33.760> from

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
your body is and we create yoga from

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.640 
your body is and we create yoga from
that<00:02:34.120> point<00:02:35.610> what<00:02:36.610> I<00:02:36.640> love<00:02:36.940> about<00:02:37.140> kayaking<00:02:38.140> is

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
that point what I love about kayaking is

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.780 
that point what I love about kayaking is
that<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.880> vessel<00:02:40.450> is<00:02:41.019> shelf<00:02:41.470> was<00:02:42.190> created<00:02:42.670> by

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
that the vessel is shelf was created by

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.170 
that the vessel is shelf was created by
a<00:02:42.819> culture<00:02:43.209> that<00:02:43.540> really<00:02:43.780> understood<00:02:45.120> what<00:02:46.120> it

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
a culture that really understood what it

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.740 
a culture that really understood what it
means<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:46.569> be<00:02:46.690> in<00:02:46.810> balance<00:02:47.110> in<00:02:47.530> nature<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:48.750> so

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
means to be in balance in nature and so

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.229 
means to be in balance in nature and so
just<00:02:50.110> by<00:02:50.319> going<00:02:50.860> over<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.459> anatomy<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.030> a

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239

an<00:03:43.569> opportunity<00:03:43.750> with<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.890> surrounding<00:03:45.579> in

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
an opportunity with the surrounding in

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.840 
an opportunity with the surrounding in
