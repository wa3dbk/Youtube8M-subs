00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hello today I want to show you how 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.040
 in a mature air pressure 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.870
 checked and corrected if necessary 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:14.900
 thus help 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:18.540
 an air-pressure of the trade fair looks like 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.270
 that its the parts then we have one 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.580
 analogue one finds at most 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.310
 gas stations 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.290
 so that you can also check the air pressure 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.559
 correct and the manual of the 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.920
 respective vehicle so first you have to 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:36.329
 Of course, look what is in the manual 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.750
 So much air pressure heard 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:44.809
 I think that was on this mature one 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:49.820
 telling stories in the front is 290 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:56.370
 kpa that means 29 was front and back 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:58.320
 29 tire air pressure braces is cold 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.010
 So that means you're in the cold 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.940
 Condition of tire pressure 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.820
 should check to correct the 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.040
 That's it, now I'm going to this 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.150
 tire check the tire pressure and 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.650
 if necessary correct as first 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.650
 if you take that from a lot of character 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.460
 so now I take that over exam 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.460
 device and sat on sven thiel on it 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:45.850
 was see 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:53.820
 So we have 26 was too little so now 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:02:00.149
 we use this device for air pressure 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.149
 let's put that on the valve 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:13.180
 okay now we can see here 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:21.060
 So here's 26 easy 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:24.070
 press here and the air pressure slowly 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.800
 so we have a bit for example 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:31.810
 you can have done too much here then you can 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.430
 Press down so easily let off again 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:41.010
 then you can restore the air pressure 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:44.620
 let off now we have 29 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.519
 That's it, then you take that one 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.420
 cap 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:58.620
 a band back down the body 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:03:01.139
 on it again and that was one too 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.689
 A little tip to finish with the cars 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:07.230
 is located in the tank cover 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:09.000
 Cover the tire pressure most of the time 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.650
 one for the respective tire 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.629
 needed there you can read that or 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.120
 also of course in the manual of the 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.700
 respective author 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.980
 Another tip is that you 0 1 bar 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.139
 more on it than by the manufacturers 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:30.510
 stated 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:32.459
 It saves a little fuel so that 's it 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.760
 for today, have fun and see you next 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.760
 times
