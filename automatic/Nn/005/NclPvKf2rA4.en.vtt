00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
1600 on nuke which is well most people

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:51.819 
1600 on nuke which is well most people
would<00:00:50.420> agree<00:00:50.510> probably<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:51.079> weakest<00:00:51.410> map<00:00:51.590> for

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
would agree probably the weakest map for

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.380 
would agree probably the weakest map for
coal<00:00:52.160> I<00:00:52.190> mean<00:00:52.399> how'd<00:00:52.700> you<00:00:52.820> guys<00:00:52.910> end<00:00:53.030> up<00:00:53.210> on

coal I mean how'd you guys end up on

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.139 
coal I mean how'd you guys end up on
nuke<00:00:53.629> though<00:00:53.920> actually<00:00:54.920> Sean<00:00:55.399> walked<00:00:55.670> out<00:00:55.879> and

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
nuke though actually Sean walked out and

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.340 
nuke though actually Sean walked out and
I<00:00:56.780> was<00:00:56.960> up<00:00:57.140> for<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:57.520> vetoes<00:00:58.520> so<00:00:59.120> I<00:00:59.570> took<00:00:59.960> it<00:01:00.260> in

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
I was up for the vetoes so I took it in

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.889 
I was up for the vetoes so I took it in
my<00:01:00.469> own<00:01:00.500> hands<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:01.219> I<00:01:01.820> thought<00:01:02.480> you<00:01:02.660> know<00:01:02.690> what

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
my own hands and I thought you know what

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.119 
my own hands and I thought you know what
we<00:01:03.140> haven't<00:01:03.350> really<00:01:03.440> played<00:01:03.620> nuke<00:01:03.800> in<00:01:03.920> a<00:01:03.980> while

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
we haven't really played nuke in a while

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.529 
we haven't really played nuke in a while
let's<00:01:04.399> just<00:01:04.550> kind<00:01:04.670> of<00:01:04.789> warm<00:01:05.059> up<00:01:05.180> on<00:01:05.300> it<00:01:05.390> just<00:01:05.479> in

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:05.539 
let's just kind of warm up on it just in

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:08.740 
let's just kind of warm up on it just in
case<00:01:05.630> you<00:01:05.810> have<00:01:05.899> to<00:01:05.990> play<00:01:06.080> it<00:01:06.170> again<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:07.750> 16

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
case you have to play it again and 16

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.870 
case you have to play it again and 16
owed<00:01:08.869> them<00:01:09.050> so<00:01:09.289> obviously<00:01:10.250> maybe<00:01:10.580> we're<00:01:10.760> not

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
owed them so obviously maybe we're not

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.730 
owed them so obviously maybe we're not
as<00:01:10.939> bad<00:01:11.150> as<00:01:11.240> we<00:01:11.330> thought<00:01:11.479> yeah<00:01:12.350> definitely

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
as bad as we thought yeah definitely

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.380 
as bad as we thought yeah definitely
getting<00:01:13.010> some<00:01:13.189> good<00:01:13.340> warm<00:01:13.549> up<00:01:13.670> there<00:01:13.939> on<00:01:14.150> nuke
