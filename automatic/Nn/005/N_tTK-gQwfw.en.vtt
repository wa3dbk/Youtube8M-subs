but I looked on Eva Notty bae i looked

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.550 
but I looked on Eva Notty bae i looked
on<00:00:24.220> wikipedia<00:00:24.939> and<00:00:25.180> they<00:00:25.689> already<00:00:25.960> have<00:00:26.290> one

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
on wikipedia and they already have one

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.109 
on wikipedia and they already have one
of<00:00:26.710> the<00:00:26.829> matches<00:00:27.790> as<00:00:28.180> a<00:00:28.210> list<00:00:29.520> listed<00:00:30.520> as<00:00:30.669> they

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
of the matches as a list listed as they

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.760 
of the matches as a list listed as they
only<00:00:31.270> have<00:00:31.480> one<00:00:31.660> match<00:00:31.869> and<00:00:32.079> it's<00:00:32.259> this<00:00:32.470> one

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
only have one match and it's this one

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.240 
only have one match and it's this one
and<00:00:32.950> I<00:00:32.980> think<00:00:33.280> it<00:00:33.399> will<00:00:33.610> be<00:00:33.780> thing<00:00:34.780> it<00:00:35.770> will<00:00:36.040> be

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
and I think it will be thing it will be

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.070 
and I think it will be thing it will be
confirmed<00:00:36.730> I<00:00:37.030> don't<00:00:37.390> know<00:00:37.570> if<00:00:37.720> it<00:00:37.840> will<00:00:38.020> be

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
confirmed I don't know if it will be

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.650 
confirmed I don't know if it will be
next<00:00:38.560> raw<00:00:38.980> it<00:00:39.580> will<00:00:39.700> probably<00:00:39.940> be<00:00:40.120> like<00:00:40.450> the

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
next raw it will probably be like the

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.570 
next raw it will probably be like the
Brock<00:00:40.930> Lesnar<00:00:41.410> thing<00:00:41.680> where<00:00:41.890> they<00:00:42.010> waited<00:00:42.400> to

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
Brock Lesnar thing where they waited to

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.470 
Brock Lesnar thing where they waited to
like<00:00:42.760> the<00:00:43.030> last<00:00:44.010> or<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.310> second<00:00:45.760> last<00:00:45.970> episode

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
like the last or the second last episode

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.570 
like the last or the second last episode
of<00:00:46.510> raw<00:00:46.780> before<00:00:47.050> the<00:00:47.560> actual<00:00:47.860> pay-per-view

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:48.580 
of raw before the actual pay-per-view

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.150 
of raw before the actual pay-per-view
for<00:00:49.120> him<00:00:49.210> to<00:00:49.330> actually<00:00:49.390> say<00:00:49.810> yes<00:00:50.170> but<00:00:50.560> I<00:00:50.740> kinda

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
for him to actually say yes but I kinda

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.260 
for him to actually say yes but I kinda
knew<00:00:51.310> it<00:00:51.370> was<00:00:51.460> going<00:00:51.580> to<00:00:51.670> happen<00:00:51.820> because<00:00:52.120> they

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
knew it was going to happen because they

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.600 
knew it was going to happen because they
had<00:00:52.420> him<00:00:52.570> on<00:00:52.660> the<00:00:52.720> post<00:00:53.560> of<00:00:53.830> SummerSlam<00:00:55.140> so

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
had him on the post of SummerSlam so

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.270 
had him on the post of SummerSlam so
yeah<00:00:57.610> I<00:00:57.940> think<00:00:58.329> CM<00:00:59.110> Punk<00:00:59.440> will<00:00:59.710> probably<00:01:00.070> win

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
yeah I think CM Punk will probably win

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.170 
yeah I think CM Punk will probably win
this<00:01:00.460> one<00:01:02.010> mostly<00:01:03.010> because<00:01:03.220> they're<00:01:04.059> gonna

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
this one mostly because they're gonna

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.060 
this one mostly because they're gonna
try<00:01:04.570> I<00:01:04.600> think<00:01:04.839> there<00:01:05.199> they<00:01:05.619> are<00:01:05.650> actually

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
try I think there they are actually

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.969 
try I think there they are actually
going<00:01:06.220> to<00:01:06.310> try<00:01:06.579> make<00:01:07.420> him<00:01:07.720> look<00:01:08.259> like<00:01:08.320> he<00:01:08.859> is

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
going to try make him look like he is

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.349 
going to try make him look like he is
