00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.619

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.480
 He wanted to create a relaxed atmosphere and 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.899
 fun during a local tournament 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.230
 basketball is worth a relaxed atmosphere 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:02.019
 relaxed and fun but how nice that 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:05.300

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.650

 Moroccan radio if I do not get confused and good 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.570

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:30.140
 to make a hidden camera prank and 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.620
