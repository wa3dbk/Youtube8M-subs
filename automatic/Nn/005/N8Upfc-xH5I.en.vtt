00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 Hi, people warned that to make one more 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.629
 basic test and I think I'll be today 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.900
 Is this from here? 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:14.160
 daniks she is systematic flash 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.369

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.320
 zezinho for you and I'll do both 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.869
 together today to protest the two 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.000
 work together as a couple had this 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.820
 battle her talk she is and flip 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.609
 video oil up to water- based high 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.800
 coverage is recognized as the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.920
 mate is the basis that every person 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.180
 mysterious or in life that is the basis of 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.430
 So there's no time in your life. 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.920
 composition is enriched with minerals 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.840
 which is good for the skin and matte effect 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.300
 Sorry for listening 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.399
 noise fan thing we had here 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.410
 and you can not record without a fan or 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.510
 almost all closed and also asked 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.820
 apologies for the noise of bombs times 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.539
 Because that joão, I have to accept 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.550
 that 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.550
 but finally let's start the basic test 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.960
 she has a good consistency is liquid 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.510
 but she is not much the guard left the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:15.030
 neighborhood has lots of guard the beige color line 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.280
 I bought in did not see something fancy that is 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.689
 a foreign online store was delayed 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.330
 four months to arrive and I 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.710
 asked how to choose the right tone 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.650
 For me because you were so sure of my 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.540
 skin is I tried to put the single monitor 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.000
 my my computer in 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.079
 the default setting you have of things and 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.090
 kissing is not not to change too many colors 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.340
 of the base that appears on the screen 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.810
 I have tried to review this base and the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.939
 bloggers to compare my skin tone 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.490
 with her skin tone and my skin tone 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.229
 is usually the average then asked 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.729
 a little further away 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.740
 because you preferred the clearer base 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.479
 corrects autocom dust than a base 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.890
 very dark you edit 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.860
 So I caught up with the people. 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.320
 Usually in medium beige thomson 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:03.119
 goal of kissed the centers and also or 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.560
 I would do it in cinelandia. 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.489
 was expected more strongly to the category 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.009
 to be able to not miss too much 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.250
 so I'll come here not to like 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.250
 O 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.790
 I like to look like half the face 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.790
 first comes the difference 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.239
 a thin layer and I apply with a 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.239
 brush like that 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.390
 if you prefer you can avoid with a 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.800
 good start but I do not like never saw 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.980
 respecting a step in my 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.840
 hand and I 'm always winning by bringing the 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.570
 pipe of peace between the ear 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.150
 and here for the neck not to stay 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:59.230
 marked by there I speak softly in the goal 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:04.360
 not to be marked type here in bar 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:06.100
 that do not have opium base apply a 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.490
 layer'll just give it to you to see how 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.470
 which is only one year on an annual basis 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.590
 in my eye that's what he's most in Rome 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.600
 I have dark circles under my eyes and here's more. 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.270
 one round the rest my face 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.130
 marketing spines and only resumes now 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.420
 another outlet but now apply 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.200
 on the whole face then apply a little 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.200
 more base 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.829
 remember, not always the base of the team 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.989
 Is the root of hair not to be marked 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.310
 are you using base and such? 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.379
 even with the base is exactly the type of 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.799
 skin takes through the hair 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:45.769
 the two sides corrected is not met 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:51.109
 our coverage going out on the street so 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:52.670
 use concealer does not come out of her bed is 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:55.220
 much harder than me here 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.920
 not real but here does not have a bit of 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.629
 olheira here is a little routed has 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.480
 some spots that did not go out 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.230
 example is I have a signal is by 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.060
 on here 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.530
 in the end here but they are signs that I 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.489
 I do not shoot when I'm going to mark it for me. 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.620
 it's perfect 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.799
 What do you think of this base I fell in love with? 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.319
 I love you, I care, I put it here. 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.599
 Because it's a very good base for me. 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.340
 pretty copper, you can wear it during the day. 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:20.720
 a thin layer throughout the night making 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.620
 the thickest layer built in 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.259
 layers 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.669
 She runs the skin very well, it's effect. 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:27.860
 mate what is great for those who have skin 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.810
 oil does not have oil and water based 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.180
 so for those who have really oily skin 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.220
 recommends this base here I loved what 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.830
 seems and compared to the feet that 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.599
 I had here in Brazil in this style 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.510
 only problem is the site's fault 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:43.580
 international comes in 4 it took four 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.770
 months to arrive but I do not have 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.180
 partnership with the store I paid the product 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.400
 paid freight has nothing to do with 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.050
 store is under secrecy because the flávio I 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.760
 I bought a product arrived so it is 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.830
 reliable and because the prices
