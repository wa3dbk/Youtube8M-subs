00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 this is airport teuge December 8 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.899
 made mark of a bow goes here 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.189
 his fatal jump and it would be such a beautiful 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.650
 jump because the Netherlands was 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.990
 completely white that day, Mark left 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.519
 from the national paracenter teuge of the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.250
 boogaard jumped in his year and a half 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.470
 membership about 150 jumps he was 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.310
 so you regularly but nobody knew him 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:27.539
 really good but i know of seeing and 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.730
 of a short chat but mark was one 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.679
 friendly yet very introverted person 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.600
 how the accident could happen is one 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.579
 puzzle the parachute and the reserve 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.649
 parachute are not open and also in 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.170
 third security did not work 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.149
 one still has a third chance just like that 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.770
 saying that its automatic opening 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.870
 it seems that he did not fire either 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.010
 and that automatically open that opens the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.870
 parachute 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.430
 If the jump itself does not do that 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.219
 is an electronic device that 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.489
 a minimum height drain so that 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.050
 the parachutes his life is saved 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.270
 that market had such an automatic 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.859
 open well all jumpers have to 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.809
 here with it there is no system that 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.000
 records whether paratroopers will be back 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.280
 but the social ones arrive at the airport 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.950
 control, on the other hand, is very large 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.799
 if something stands out then we are anyway 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.570
 A what we do we also order taco then 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.659
 take action so apparently you 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.549
 any kind of that we think when you 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.439
 something is not going well what he wants is 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.520
 a task of the master and the lory 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.590
 multiple 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.049
 to say where we have large entrance 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.740
 make jump on line that was alone and 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.930
 actually arrange everything alone so 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.400
 he didn't have any fellow players though 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.549
 jumpers who sat at minus plane 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.500
 but not that together with him the joy 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.000
 the beautiful spring shared the jump 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.500
 weather also seems to be contributing to the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.149
 long time between being 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.680
 body and the accident 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.470
 it was cold so few people come 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.850
 outside and the farmer did not come to his field 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.979
 research is still being done into how 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.860
 The accident could happen that he didn't 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.960
 once noted that is of course sad 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.149
 that is painful and we are through that 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.509
 Shocked are couples walking on world 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.509
 shocked
