00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:11.300
 space la where you need water and calcium 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:16.880
 bureau us find out the reasons 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.880
 sanctuary and metal 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:01:39.450
 let's go home to all hi dear 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.369
 friends with you, Sergey, and welcome 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.119
 on the penultimate mission in gta san 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.520
 andreas 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.950
 well then we have already declared ourselves bada groove 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.259
 straight again on horseback but water caesar with his 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.509
 gang of aztec hair things are not very 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.079
 the fact is that his area was captured 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.909
 vagasi 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.189
 and his gang can't resist them 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.130
 because in Caesar's gang for now three 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.880
 human is one of them rolled up well 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.649
 vagos certainly whole 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.270
 so corolla agreed to help 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.969
 retake gap area which 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.590
 called el corona for one we must 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.450
 still grab our two guys in 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.519
 as an aid, although we ourselves 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.500
 coped with Caesar and his people 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.540
 in general, I think in the room how to hire 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.790
 people just strangers met 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.920
 and click jim or russian pays you don't 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.989
 understand what jamie is and what is 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.519
 most importantly our people are very afraid of explosions and 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.709
 if maternity blow up some machine 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.360
 for example, there is a chance that someone from 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.970
 our two blockheads jump out not 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.680
 will have to look for a new groove street in 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:46.590
 general now we are going to the thread station 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:46.590
 this is where the Caesar people are waiting for us 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.560
 victory or death 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.290
 Well, in our case, of course, victory is 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.920
 obviously we get any weapons in my 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.139
 the case is m4 and go knead vagos 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.810
 there is a lot here therefore for us in this 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.549
 missions will give plenty to shoot and if 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.519
 don't worry about caesar and his 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.859
 guys like them should not kill themselves 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.870
 stand up for himself here dude cattle, even 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.910
 not afraid to run on an armed gas 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.370
 so everything is fine better 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.380
 worry about yourself but our guys 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.359
 street groove can easily kill because 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.519
 They do not shoot but just walks 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.650
 near us but sometimes just climb under 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.480
 sight so if you can you can 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.670
 the killers themselves nobody grieve for them 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.500
 there will be a wax like cargo 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.989
 tricep but there is one difference 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.329
 the vagos give signs of life starts by 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.579
 us shoot and indeed if we compare 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:01.090
 groupings vagos and ballas are balas 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:02.769
 much stronger yeah how do you see you 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.900
 they are very weak we just want them 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.340
 deliver but balances can fight back 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.230
 and even take down all the armor 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.910
 This I seriously Well and now so 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.800
 fill the time until next 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.110
 video I will tell you what to do 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.420
 to open the final mission you need 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.310
 will just win 70 percent 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.230
 enemy territory ie we must 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.870
 we will unleash a war and endure three 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.210
 the waves are all as usual but grab so 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.120
 the way you need areas so 10 exactly what 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.340
 take about an hour of play can be conquered 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.770
 Of course, not all territories, of course, not all 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.260
 until you call 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.720
 sweet here are the things guys by the way 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.030
 see on the right the house is on fire why are they 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.700
 set fire to the house if they themselves live here before 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.740
 not clear well however they all live here 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.930
 not long left here is just the last 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.760
 vagos is dead and now we run lane where 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.760
 will be held next skirmish 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.130
 it turns out one truth if he could 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.220
 enjoy it would be really 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.110
 god in general another skirmish with 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.820
 hair and getting closer and closer 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.920
 come to the house of Caesar 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.460
 where will be something like a boss in this 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.560
 mission vag with grenade launcher oh hell heather 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.840
 shoot I just noticed this one 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.290
 which was rolled up but by the way 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.150
 is to blame 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:37.419
 Why was rolled ahead run 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:40.050
 when we are in the shelter with guns but not 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:40.050
 understandably 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:55.160
 nothing from all the cracks climb well 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.960
 but we have no special choice 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.150
 we must protect the wounded heyzer 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.120
 Caesar and indeed the whole team from 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.639
 vagos of course shoots at someone 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.500
 you are wigging a dork firing let's 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:07.639
 who only take in groove Street also 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.370

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.710

 they are from all cracks climb pancake also 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.180

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.630
 and there and wok with a grenade launcher on the roof 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.100
 home Caesar and worth it you need to take out 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.070
 first of all i think you understand 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:43.050
 Why then and then you wear ordinary 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:47.340
 slaves of ordinary va-gasov and all you have 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:52.340

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.340
