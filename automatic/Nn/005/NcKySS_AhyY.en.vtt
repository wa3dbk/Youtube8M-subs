00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.750
 how are I doing very well thanks for 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.700
 ask you are you worried about 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.019
 so much for me I really feel hear 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.359
 is a recipe that you will like a lot 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.400
 it's not as much as a recipe for a 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.500
 saucer but rather it is a decoration 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.109
 to eat ice cream but my father is 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.140
 because it will be with more of circulating 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.699
 for inside and is very father is very 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.140
 easy to do also then that 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.519
 outbreak will cost them quite the 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.010
 ingredients and they will be wondering 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.170
 why do I have balloons in my hand because 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.060
 this is the main ingredient a 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.250
 balloon not to eat the mandilones 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:44.020
 but yes to shape the mold 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.020
 stay with a chocolate 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.630
 and then sometimes a recipe like 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.700
 always quick easy and more than anything 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.570
 super original first of all we have 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.570
 our chocolate bar 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.610
 hours 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.229
 i 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.700
 I recommend that it was not done with the 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.289
 how much can I lose? 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.070
 stop all hands and most 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.070
 pretty disgusting 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.860
 and leave a good time 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.910
 Y 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.370
 Well , we already have chocolate well 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.770
 region and then now what we have 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.330
 what to do is that by grabbing a balloon 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.260
 size that you create can be 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.260
 tiny 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.450
 does not put into action 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.520
 Sweep well down the sides 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.959
 since they fit very well down they put it 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.090
 on a paper 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.640
 It is preferable if they have side papers 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.709
 I got it papers I'm using from 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.750
 these as road filters we saw 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.340
 well you already have a balloon for the layer of 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.440
 chocolate traits on waxed paper 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.030
 or the 2003 coffee maker title already difficult 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.760
 what they have to do now is 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.349
 sell it to the fridge and wait like a 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.819
 The same time is two hours and this girl 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.470
 where it is certainly much to me 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.390
 chocolate since they waited a good 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.980
 for a while and then have what they have ready 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.599
 what to do is good to hear 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.700
 and after his they will see what they have left 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.690
 inside stuck to the others with a lot 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.690
 careful not liking 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.230
 ready for you it's not that easy anymore 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.880
 it was seen that stops over the ice cream 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.680
 the truth to me this recipe I like 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.270
 a lot because it 's like it picks up a 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.610
 couple someone to eat ice cream and star 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.650
 kevin knight presenter and well this was 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.209
