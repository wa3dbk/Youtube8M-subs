have<00:06:45.770> to<00:06:45.949> work<00:06:46.130> toward<00:06:46.430> it<00:06:46.520> but<00:06:46.729> I<00:06:46.789> really<00:06:46.909> like

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:47.599 
have to work toward it but I really like

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:49.779 
have to work toward it but I really like
the<00:06:47.840> spatial<00:06:48.770> configuration<00:06:49.310> right<00:06:49.610> now

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:49.789 
the spatial configuration right now

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:53.740 
the spatial configuration right now
because<00:06:50.180> I<00:06:50.479> just<00:06:50.990> have<00:06:51.349> so<00:06:51.740> much<00:06:51.949> so<00:06:52.699> much<00:06:52.750> I

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.750 
because I just have so much so much I

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.869 
because I just have so much so much I
space<00:06:54.759> so<00:06:55.759> I<00:06:56.469> think<00:06:57.469> this<00:06:57.560> is<00:06:57.710> what<00:06:57.919> this<00:06:58.819> is

00:06:58.869 --> 00:06:58.879 
space so I think this is what this is

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:00.279 
space so I think this is what this is
how<00:06:59.120> it<00:06:59.270> should<00:06:59.449> have<00:06:59.509> been<00:06:59.719> the<00:06:59.990> camera

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:00.289 
how it should have been the camera

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:02.439 
how it should have been the camera
should<00:07:00.440> have<00:07:00.560> been<00:07:00.710> designed<00:07:01.069> like<00:07:01.490> really

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:02.449 
should have been designed like really

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:11.170 
should have been designed like really
