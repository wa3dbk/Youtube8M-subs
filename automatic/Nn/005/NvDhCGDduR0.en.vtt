00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.410
 and so hello everyone with you again i'm kiril and 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.969
 Now I will show you how 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:17.000
 understate the car 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:21.170
 toy for this we need 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.430
 screwdriver 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:34.579
 hand machine the most important thing 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.579
 and thinking chapter all let's begin 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.940
 so start take screwdriver remove the bottom 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.140
 i choose the first time 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.950
 and I have a car 2115 shalt 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.549
 Fifteen and I like her them much 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.020
 easier 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:25.310
 understate here and so we have but here 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:33.430
 aldu but here they are wheels so well everything is usually 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:36.430
 I start I remove the divider here I remove 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.430
 a motor 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.650
 shoot it very easy if you find out 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:56.100
 how is Ryazan 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:02:05.680
 but I take you down I do it a little 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:09.429
 in a strange way, that is, my 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:14.920
 to tame the axis a little it will allow 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:19.390
 we lower the lower car first 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:23.980
 ring removed motor disassembled remove 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:29.220
 second all here we have our axis ready here 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.220
 you see here we dress the wheels 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:43.739
 but what we did we have 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:47.349
 ready axle here it is the front rear so 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.910
 let's try to put it on the car and plaster 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.590
 as far as we will be cut off for 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.879
 just to break in 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:02.200
 Of course little such country images and 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:06.220
 do nothing bad here as it 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:16.870
 need quite a bit about 2 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:23.110
 millimeter even the next three we dress 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:28.690
 Salon we have to cut here and I 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.230
 Marker mark where I will cut in order 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.200
 to 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.200
 the wheels failed 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.079
 it turns out such awkward movements 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.889
 now 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.099
 so I set out for myself where I will cut 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.940
 everything 

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:33.250
 I will cut the space for these people for axes 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:39.490
 and it will be much easier for me to understate 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:42.000
 I'll be right back so I'll do it 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.000
 few strokes 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:49.310
 that's how i would come and i cut the place 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.979
 under the axis 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:57.949
 that will allow there to understate our car with 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:04.580
 using these slots our axes 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:14.120
 fail here but we have one minus 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:20.680
 the fact that it began it is wider than the body 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:21.860
 cars here and the wheels will rest our 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.479
 body 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:33.680
 boiling it is very noticeable to see the bite 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:35.889
 fell 2 no well, we'll fix in 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.389
 This will help us our pliers 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:42.639
 remove one wheel on my top 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:48.620
 enough and shorten the nail paste 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:51.099
 one end of the axis in such a place our 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.099
 pliers
