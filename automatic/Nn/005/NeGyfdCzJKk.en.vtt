00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
look at the settings on the camera for

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.730 
look at the settings on the camera for
example<00:01:53.250> on<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.090> light<00:01:54.270> setting<00:01:54.750> they<00:01:55.530> have

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
example on the light setting they have

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.980 
example on the light setting they have
like<00:01:56.189> on<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:56.490> one<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.850> have<00:01:57.000> an<00:01:57.119> auto<00:01:57.390> add<00:01:57.780> a

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
like on this one you have an auto add a

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.679 
like on this one you have an auto add a
light<00:01:58.340> tungsten<00:01:59.340> fluorescent<00:01:59.969> or<00:02:00.119> open<00:02:00.450> shade

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
light tungsten fluorescent or open shade

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.109 
light tungsten fluorescent or open shade
now<00:02:01.350> since<00:02:01.710> I'm<00:02:01.829> using<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.219> tungsten<00:02:02.430> lamp<00:02:02.909> I

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
now since I'm using a tungsten lamp I

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.690 
now since I'm using a tungsten lamp I
usually<00:02:03.869> use<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.439> tungsten<00:02:04.680> setting<00:02:05.310> but<00:02:05.670> I

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
usually use the tungsten setting but I

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.310 
usually use the tungsten setting but I
also<00:02:05.880> offset<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.659> with<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:07.049> fluorescent

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
also offset it with the fluorescent

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.889 
also offset it with the fluorescent
lighting<00:02:07.920> sometimes<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.090> works<00:02:09.270> sometimes<00:02:09.390> it

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
lighting sometimes it works sometimes it

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.270 
lighting sometimes it works sometimes it
doesn't<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:10.500> have<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.860> play<00:02:11.039> with<00:02:11.250> it

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
doesn't you just have to play with it

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.130 
doesn't you just have to play with it
just<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.730> little<00:02:11.879> bit

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
just a little bit

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.350 
just a little bit
so<00:02:13.590> what<00:02:13.740> I'll<00:02:13.860> do<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.340> I'll<00:02:14.520> turn<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:14.880> on<00:02:15.120> and

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
so what I'll do is I'll turn this on and

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.750 
so what I'll do is I'll turn this on and
this<00:02:15.780> on<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:16.320> hold<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.280> right<00:02:17.400> above<00:02:17.640> the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
this on and hold it right above the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:30.430 
this on and hold it right above the
flower<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.300> show<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.570> how<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.780> do<00:02:18.900> this

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.530 

and<00:02:30.830> that<00:02:31.100> actually<00:02:31.550> makes<00:02:31.790> for<00:02:31.880> a<00:02:32.060> very<00:02:32.330> good

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
and that actually makes for a very good

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.000 
and that actually makes for a very good
picture<00:02:32.810> you<00:02:33.170> can't<00:02:33.410> see<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:33.770> on<00:02:33.890> the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
picture you can't see it on the

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.760 
picture you can't see it on the
viewfinder<00:02:34.250> but<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.570> actually<00:02:36.230> makes<00:02:36.440> for<00:02:36.590> a

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
viewfinder but it actually makes for a

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.430 
viewfinder but it actually makes for a
very<00:02:36.830> very<00:02:37.430> good<00:02:38.030> picture<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:39.020> other<00:02:39.170> thing

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
very very good picture the other thing

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.860 
very very good picture the other thing
you<00:02:39.680> want<00:02:39.800> to<00:02:39.980> do<00:02:40.100> too<00:02:40.340> is<00:02:40.690> change<00:02:41.690> your

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
you want to do too is change your

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.110 
you want to do too is change your
setting<00:02:42.230> around<00:02:42.350> make<00:02:43.310> sure<00:02:43.490> that<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:43.940> can

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
setting around make sure that you can

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.990 
setting around make sure that you can
get<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.720> flower<00:02:44.960> in<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.350> entire<00:02:45.710> shot<00:02:46.160> I<00:02:46.490> try

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
not to get any of the background if I

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.300 
not to get any of the background if I
can<00:02:49.120> sometimes<00:02:50.120> it's<00:02:50.600> unavoidable<00:02:51.020> but<00:02:51.950> you

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
can sometimes it's unavoidable but you

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.730 
can sometimes it's unavoidable but you
know<00:02:52.460> what<00:02:52.670> for<00:02:52.970> a<00:02:53.030> good<00:02:53.270> flower<00:02:53.480> picture<00:02:54.080> you

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.800 
know what for a good flower picture you
can<00:02:54.890> always<00:02:55.220> take<00:02:55.730> it<00:02:55.880> out<00:02:56.000> with<00:02:56.330> you<00:02:56.720> know

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810

photo programs or anything else like
that<00:02:58.760> so<00:02:59.090> let's<00:02:59.300> try<00:02:59.450> this<00:02:59.510> again<00:02:59.690> oh<00:03:03.790> that's<00:03:04.790> a

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
that so let's try this again oh that's a

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.000 
that so let's try this again oh that's a
beautiful<00:03:05.180> shot<00:03:05.470> get<00:03:06.470> another<00:03:06.740> one<00:03:07.010> here<00:03:09.010> and

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
beautiful shot get another one here and

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.850 
beautiful shot get another one here and
also<00:03:10.340> you<00:03:10.400> can<00:03:10.610> try<00:03:10.820> it<00:03:10.880> with<00:03:11.030> just<00:03:11.860> the

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
also you can try it with just the

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:20.020 
also you can try it with just the
tungsten<00:03:13.100> light<00:03:18.100> and<00:03:19.100> you<00:03:19.370> can<00:03:19.520> also<00:03:19.670> try<00:03:20.000> to

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
tungsten light and you can also try to

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:27.010 
tungsten light and you can also try to
adjust<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:21.080> fluorescent<00:03:21.650> light<00:03:25.660> of<00:03:26.660> course<00:03:26.870> I

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
adjust the fluorescent light of course I

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.390 
adjust the fluorescent light of course I
didn't<00:03:27.230> have<00:03:27.350> the<00:03:27.470> fluorescent<00:03:27.950> light<00:03:28.070> on<00:03:28.250> at

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:37.440 
didn't have the fluorescent light on at
that<00:03:28.550> point<00:03:28.760> so<00:03:29.000> let's<00:03:29.210> try<00:03:29.420> this

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.910
