all as you guys can see over here I've

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.400 
all as you guys can see over here I've
got<00:00:39.980> my<00:00:40.280> main<00:00:40.850> layer<00:00:41.090> again<00:00:41.480> capture<00:00:42.110> what

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
got my main layer again capture what

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.200 
got my main layer again capture what
what<00:00:42.590> what<00:00:42.800> I<00:00:43.010> want<00:00:43.220> to<00:00:43.309> rename<00:00:43.610> that<00:00:43.820> quickly

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
what what I want to rename that quickly

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.689 
what what I want to rename that quickly
to<00:00:44.360> original<00:00:45.050> and<00:00:45.260> keep<00:00:45.800> it<00:00:45.949> over<00:00:46.220> original

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
to original and keep it over original

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.090 
to original and keep it over original
and<00:00:46.910> then<00:00:47.540> we're<00:00:47.750> going<00:00:47.900> to<00:00:47.989> make<00:00:48.230> a<00:00:48.290> duplicate

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
and then we're going to make a duplicate

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.180 
and then we're going to make a duplicate
come<00:00:49.400> on<00:00:49.550> Jay<00:00:49.879> and<00:00:50.090> also<00:00:50.659> rasterize<00:00:51.320> that<00:00:51.650> so

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
come on Jay and also rasterize that so

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.009 
come on Jay and also rasterize that so
we're<00:00:52.339> going<00:00:52.430> to<00:00:52.489> press<00:00:52.729> right<00:00:53.360> click<00:00:53.390> on<00:00:53.809> here

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
we're going to press right click on here

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.079 
we're going to press right click on here
and<00:00:54.080> also<00:00:54.620> say<00:00:54.769> rasterize<00:00:55.339> and<00:00:55.670> we're<00:00:55.909> going

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
and also say rasterize and we're going

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.360 
and also say rasterize and we're going
to<00:00:56.150> write<00:00:56.449> the<00:00:56.690> retouch<00:00:57.680> so<00:00:57.949> this<00:00:58.129> is<00:00:58.250> our

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
to write the retouch so this is our

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.689 
to write the retouch so this is our
retouching<00:00:59.030> layer<00:00:59.210> again<00:01:00.040> okay<00:01:01.040> and<00:01:01.250> then

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
retouching layer again okay and then

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.310 
retouching layer again okay and then
next<00:01:01.909> step<00:01:02.150> that<00:01:02.180> we're<00:01:02.449> going<00:01:02.479> to<00:01:02.750> do<00:01:02.930> or<00:01:03.170> why

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
next step that we're going to do or why

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.990 
next step that we're going to do or why
we<00:01:03.500> actually<00:01:03.739> doing<00:01:03.860> this<00:01:04.100> is<00:01:04.280> again<00:01:04.549> to<00:01:04.760> just

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
we actually doing this is again to just

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.390 
we actually doing this is again to just
fall<00:01:05.239> back<00:01:05.269> if<00:01:05.750> we<00:01:05.990> need<00:01:06.170> to<00:01:06.770> fall<00:01:06.979> back<00:01:07.190> onto

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
fall back if we need to fall back onto

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.250 
fall back if we need to fall back onto
our<00:01:07.580> original<00:01:08.120> layer<00:01:08.240> okay<00:01:08.780> select<00:01:09.110> your

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
our original layer okay select your

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.170 
our original layer okay select your
retouch<00:01:09.590> layer<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:10.100> next<00:01:10.729> step<00:01:10.880> we're<00:01:11.060> going

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
retouch layer and next step we're going

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.149 
retouch layer and next step we're going
to<00:01:11.299> do<00:01:11.600> two<00:01:11.869> adjustment<00:01:12.500> layers<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:12.830> we're

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
to do two adjustment layers and we're

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.520 
to do two adjustment layers and we're
going<00:01:13.340> to<00:01:13.400> create<00:01:13.760> a<00:01:13.940> channel<00:01:14.450> mixer<00:01:15.080> so<00:01:15.409> I'm

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
going to create a channel mixer so I'm

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.740 
going to create a channel mixer so I'm
going<00:01:15.680> to<00:01:15.770> click<00:01:15.920> on<00:01:16.010> here<00:01:16.250> and<00:01:16.310> create<00:01:16.790> a<00:01:17.000> once

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
going to click on here and create a once

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.260 
going to click on here and create a once
of<00:01:18.080> adjustment<00:01:18.890> layer<00:01:19.070> with<00:01:19.369> just<00:01:19.400> a<00:01:19.820> channel

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
of adjustment layer with just a channel

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.510 
of adjustment layer with just a channel
mixer<00:01:20.750> and<00:01:20.930> then<00:01:21.530> I'm<00:01:21.680> going<00:01:21.860> to<00:01:21.920> go<00:01:22.040> over<00:01:22.070> here

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
mixer and then I'm going to go over here

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.580 
mixer and then I'm going to go over here
to<00:01:22.579> say<00:01:22.969> monochrome<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:23.780> I'm<00:01:23.990> going<00:01:24.200> to<00:01:24.320> tick

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
to say monochrome and I'm going to tick

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.670 
to say monochrome and I'm going to tick
that<00:01:24.799> so<00:01:25.219> we<00:01:25.399> get<00:01:25.549> a<00:01:25.579> monochrome<00:01:26.299> image<00:01:26.689> now

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
that so we get a monochrome image now

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.550 
that so we get a monochrome image now
what<00:01:27.920> I<00:01:27.950> wanted<00:01:28.219> to<00:01:28.399> do<00:01:28.609> is<00:01:28.850> also<00:01:29.479> do<00:01:29.659> a<00:01:29.899> two

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
what I wanted to do is also do a two

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.109 
what I wanted to do is also do a two
more<00:01:30.890> of<00:01:31.039> those<00:01:31.250> layers<00:01:31.579> so<00:01:31.850> I'm<00:01:31.909> going<00:01:32.090> to

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
more of those layers so I'm going to

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.880 
more of those layers so I'm going to
press<00:01:32.329> come<00:01:32.539> on<00:01:32.689> J<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.079> duplicate<00:01:33.649> that<00:01:33.829> layer

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
press come on J to duplicate that layer

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.370 
press come on J to duplicate that layer
and<00:01:34.310> another<00:01:34.939> one<00:01:35.240> I'm<00:01:35.570> first<00:01:35.960> of<00:01:36.170> all<00:01:36.320> going

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
and another one I'm first of all going

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.590 
and another one I'm first of all going
to<00:01:36.740> switch<00:01:37.429> off<00:01:37.579> all<00:01:37.789> of<00:01:37.939> these<00:01:38.119> other<00:01:38.329> layers

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
to switch off all of these other layers

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.480 
to switch off all of these other layers
down<00:01:38.899> here<00:01:39.200> we<00:01:39.619> will<00:01:39.740> work<00:01:39.770> with<00:01:40.159> them<00:01:40.310> in<00:01:40.429> a

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
down here we will work with them in a

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.730 
down here we will work with them in a
little<00:01:40.640> bit<00:01:40.850> okay<00:01:41.689> go<00:01:41.899> back<00:01:42.109> to<00:01:42.289> our<00:01:42.500> first

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
little bit okay go back to our first

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.370 
little bit okay go back to our first
channel<00:01:43.219> mixer<00:01:43.579> layer<00:01:43.880> here<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:44.450> first<00:01:45.170> step

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
channel mixer layer here and first step

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.810 
channel mixer layer here and first step
that<00:01:45.409> we're<00:01:45.740> actually<00:01:45.890> going<00:01:46.130> to<00:01:46.280> do<00:01:46.429> is<00:01:46.609> just

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
that we're actually going to do is just

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.149 
that we're actually going to do is just
desaturate<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.990> skin<00:01:48.259> a<00:01:48.289> little<00:01:48.530> bit<00:01:48.649> so<00:01:49.009> I'm

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
desaturate the skin a little bit so I'm

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.739 
desaturate the skin a little bit so I'm
not<00:01:49.340> going<00:01:49.549> to<00:01:49.670> play<00:01:49.909> too<00:01:49.969> much<00:01:50.329> with<00:01:50.390> our

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:50.749 
not going to play too much with our

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:53.050 
not going to play too much with our
adjustments<00:01:51.320> over<00:01:51.499> here<00:01:51.740> I'm<00:01:52.009> basically<00:01:52.729> just

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
adjustments over here I'm basically just

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.599 
adjustments over here I'm basically just
going<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.450> take<00:01:53.659> my<00:01:53.840> opacity<00:01:54.140> down<00:01:54.679> here<00:01:55.100> to

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
going to take my opacity down here to

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:58.749 
going to take my opacity down here to
say<00:01:55.909> around<00:01:56.450> 15<00:01:57.350> to<00:01:57.710> 20<00:01:58.009> percent<00:01:58.189> somewhere

going to go over here to our second

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.740 
going to go over here to our second
channel<00:02:13.490> mixer<00:02:13.790> layer<00:02:13.970> select<00:02:14.540> that<00:02:14.720> again

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750

next step we're going to do is just take

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.690 
next step we're going to do is just take
the<00:02:20.300> blending<00:02:20.810> options<00:02:21.200> of<00:02:21.380> this<00:02:21.590> layer<00:02:21.860> to

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
the blending options of this layer to

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.880 
the blending options of this layer to
screening<00:02:23.330> okay<00:02:23.840> all<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.170> way<00:02:24.200> down<00:02:24.470> here<00:02:24.710> to

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
opacity down a little bit say up to 30%

opacity down a little bit say up to 30%
see<00:02:47.480> what<00:02:47.660> it<00:02:47.750> gives<00:02:47.960> us<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.350> very<00:02:48.890> dull<00:02:49.250> looking

it a little bit more and give it a
little<00:03:02.390> bit<00:03:02.540> more<00:03:02.750> contrast<00:03:03.470> so<00:03:04.190> that's<00:03:04.460> we're

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
little bit more contrast so that's we're

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.550 
little bit more contrast so that's we're
going<00:03:04.820> to<00:03:05.000> do<00:03:05.180> with<00:03:05.330> our<00:03:05.540> last<00:03:05.840> Channel<00:03:06.410> makes

again<00:03:09.350> and<00:03:09.530> also<00:03:10.190> under<00:03:10.610> our<00:03:10.640> blending

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
again and also under our blending

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.450 
again and also under our blending
options<00:03:11.480> we're<00:03:11.840> just<00:03:12.050> going<00:03:12.260> to<00:03:12.320> select<00:03:12.590> soft

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
little bit more and also going to go

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.720 
little bit more and also going to go
back<00:03:35.840> to<00:03:36.020> my<00:03:36.140> opacity<00:03:36.410> down<00:03:37.040> here<00:03:37.340> and<00:03:37.520> just

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
back to my opacity down here and just

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.490 
back to my opacity down here and just
take<00:03:37.940> that<00:03:38.120> down<00:03:38.420> a<00:03:38.450> little<00:03:38.570> bit<00:03:38.810> see<00:03:39.470> what

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
take that down a little bit see what

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.380 
take that down a little bit see what
that<00:03:39.830> gives<00:03:40.010> us<00:03:40.220> it's<00:03:40.489> not<00:03:40.820> going<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.270> be

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
that gives us it's not going to be

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.949 
that gives us it's not going to be
better<00:03:41.780> at<00:03:42.020> all<00:03:42.170> just<00:03:42.560> a<00:03:42.680> little<00:03:42.800> bit<00:03:43.010> maybe

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
better at all just a little bit maybe

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.080 
better at all just a little bit maybe
okay<00:03:44.959> little<00:03:45.230> bit<00:03:45.320> say<00:03:45.560> up<00:03:45.709> to<00:03:45.770> fifth<00:03:46.550> 85

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
okay little bit say up to fifth 85

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.180 
okay little bit say up to fifth 85
percent<00:03:47.630> that's<00:03:48.170> good<00:03:48.500> to<00:03:48.650> me<00:03:48.800> and<00:03:48.890> just<00:03:49.070> going

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
percent that's good to me and just going

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.460 
percent that's good to me and just going
to<00:03:49.280> blend<00:03:49.520> off<00:03:49.790> my<00:03:50.030> second<00:03:50.930> layer<00:03:51.020> here<00:03:51.320> my

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
to blend off my second layer here my

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.110 
to blend off my second layer here my
channel<00:03:51.830> mixer<00:03:52.160> maybe<00:03:52.370> it<00:03:52.520> was<00:03:52.670> a<00:03:52.700> little<00:03:52.940> bit

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
channel mixer maybe it was a little bit

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.580 
channel mixer maybe it was a little bit
too<00:03:53.360> bright<00:03:53.540> so<00:03:53.660> we're<00:03:53.989> going<00:03:54.080> to<00:03:54.170> take<00:03:54.440> it

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
too bright so we're going to take it

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.670 
too bright so we're going to take it
down<00:03:54.770> to<00:03:54.980> say<00:03:55.310> 30%<00:03:55.730> over<00:03:56.390> here<00:03:56.660> and<00:03:56.840> also<00:03:57.380> back

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
down to say 30% over here and also back

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.400 
down to say 30% over here and also back
to<00:03:57.920> channels<00:03:58.400> constant<00:03:59.330> again<00:03:59.630> and<00:03:59.870> we're

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
to channels constant again and we're

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.840 
to channels constant again and we're
going<00:04:00.530> to<00:04:00.620> brighten<00:04:01.100> this<00:04:01.190> a<00:04:01.250> little<00:04:01.459> bit<00:04:01.640> so

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
going to brighten this a little bit so

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.550 
going to brighten this a little bit so
we<00:04:01.970> obviously<00:04:02.269> have<00:04:02.690> to<00:04:02.870> play<00:04:03.110> a<00:04:03.140> little<00:04:03.350> bit

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
we obviously have to play a little bit

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.430 
we obviously have to play a little bit
until<00:04:04.250> we<00:04:04.280> have<00:04:04.550> it<00:04:04.700> perfect<00:04:05.300> last<00:04:06.170> step<00:04:06.410> that

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
until we have it perfect last step that

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.990 
until we have it perfect last step that
I'm<00:04:06.620> going<00:04:06.769> to<00:04:06.830> do<00:04:07.040> is<00:04:07.160> just<00:04:07.400> select<00:04:07.550> all<00:04:07.970> of

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
I'm going to do is just select all of

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.850 
I'm going to do is just select all of
these<00:04:08.269> layers<00:04:08.510> down<00:04:08.810> here<00:04:09.080> our<00:04:09.320> channel<00:04:09.709> makes

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
these layers down here our channel makes

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.979 
these layers down here our channel makes
us<00:04:10.040> press<00:04:10.370> come<00:04:10.610> on<00:04:10.730> G<00:04:11.030> again<00:04:11.269> put<00:04:11.810> that

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
us press come on G again put that

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.990 
us press come on G again put that
together<00:04:12.230> in<00:04:12.590> a<00:04:12.680> group<00:04:12.890> and<00:04:13.100> just<00:04:13.130> right<00:04:13.790> this

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
together in a group and just right this

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.990 
together in a group and just right this
skin<00:04:14.540> okay<00:04:15.290> then<00:04:16.160> we're<00:04:16.310> going<00:04:16.430> to<00:04:16.519> blend<00:04:16.730> that

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
skin okay then we're going to blend that

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.479 
skin okay then we're going to blend that
off<00:04:17.269> to<00:04:17.510> just<00:04:17.720> see<00:04:17.870> our<00:04:18.019> before<00:04:18.200> and<00:04:18.680> after

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
off to just see our before and after

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.030 
off to just see our before and after
before<00:04:20.269> and<00:04:20.810> after

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
before and after

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.370 
before and after
so<00:04:22.190> with<00:04:22.370> this<00:04:22.520> with<00:04:23.000> these<00:04:23.210> few<00:04:23.600> steps<00:04:23.660> we

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
so with this with these few steps we

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.800 
so with this with these few steps we
already<00:04:24.650> brighten<00:04:25.100> the<00:04:25.220> skin<00:04:25.490> and<00:04:25.730> just<00:04:26.510> made

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
already brighten the skin and just made

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.560 
already brighten the skin and just made
a<00:04:27.020> purely<00:04:27.350> white<00:04:27.980> effect<00:04:28.430> obviously<00:04:28.790> this<00:04:29.360> is

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
a purely white effect obviously this is

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.540 
a purely white effect obviously this is
a<00:04:29.600> bit<00:04:29.840> strong<00:04:30.200> still<00:04:30.530> so<00:04:30.770> my<00:04:30.950> last<00:04:31.190> step<00:04:31.400> would

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
a bit strong still so my last step would

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.230 
a bit strong still so my last step would
be<00:04:31.610> over<00:04:32.000> here

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
be over here

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.170 
be over here
opacity<00:04:32.600> again<00:04:33.380> turn<00:04:34.070> my<00:04:34.340> opacity<00:04:34.910> down<00:04:35.120> a

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
opacity again turn my opacity down a

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.390 
opacity again turn my opacity down a
little<00:04:35.360> bit<00:04:35.570> say<00:04:35.870> again<00:04:36.140> to<00:04:36.320> 80%<00:04:37.010> somewhere

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
little bit say again to 80% somewhere

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.110 
little bit say again to 80% somewhere
around<00:04:37.490> there

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
around there

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.029 
around there
and<00:04:38.210> I'm<00:04:38.690> pretty<00:04:38.900> happy<00:04:39.020> with<00:04:39.440> that<00:04:39.680> effect

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
and I'm pretty happy with that effect

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:41.710 
and I'm pretty happy with that effect
already<00:04:40.310> I<00:04:40.520> would<00:04:40.700> most<00:04:41.240> probably<00:04:41.570> do<00:04:41.690> a

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
already I would most probably do a

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.560 
already I would most probably do a
master<00:04:42.169> layer<00:04:42.320> now<00:04:42.560> and<00:04:42.740> then<00:04:43.310> continue<00:04:44.240> again

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
master layer now and then continue again

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.760 
master layer now and then continue again
with<00:04:44.990> if<00:04:45.200> you
