non-european customers it's certainly
not<00:01:24.150> cheap<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.840> feel<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.650> actually<00:01:25.950> a

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
not cheap I feel that this is actually a

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.710 
not cheap I feel that this is actually a
reasonable<00:01:26.790> price<00:01:27.000> for<00:01:27.030> something<00:01:27.390> made<00:01:27.689> by

reasonable price for something made by

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.630 
reasonable price for something made by

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
hand of this size though the kicker

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.429 
hand of this size though the kicker
that'll<00:01:29.970> make<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.180> harder<00:01:30.750> for<00:01:30.780> international

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
that'll make it harder for international
