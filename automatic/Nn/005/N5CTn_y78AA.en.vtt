00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:03.789
 That's not my problem 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.290
 biden carlos sierra 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.499
 3 

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:11.499
 it's already closed how long will they run out of water 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:14.219
 we will work on the pipes all day 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.650
 and to the building information, that is not my responsibility 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.650
 the news and three ties are supposed to 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:27.389
 with 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.939
 4 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.370
 not yet 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.269
 so he concluded 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:39.490
 my trainer 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.210
 that's how they want a fire out there do not worry alice cooper 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.390
 9 the truth 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.630
 paschal 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.739
 the jewelry is not burning private banks 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.530
 and that seems appropriate and with that someone should pay it before it's more 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.590
 big 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.320
 they go paying all the rockies 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.870
 When it's my responsibility, they pay me to mark well, it's not my 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.020
 responsibility 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.020
 any type of sanction in deputies 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.420
 number one 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.720
 workshop 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:28.320
 the world no no no also with a goal with a 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.530
 the truth reason we have not decided anything simple all of them pointed out that this 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.750
 is a problem of what it is disconnected from the water and the design of the 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.180
 building I'm very worried 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.190
 it's very good, it's small but it's growing 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.940
 the one who expects me here I am responsible I think the solution 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.510
 is here 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.060
 Jakarta yielded this and with the future and first it seems to be very simple because 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.780
 here they go to the firemen 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.100
 I am not authorized to request external services that is your obligation 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.219
 I heard everything I did this week is put out fires 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.709
 where is 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.889
 on the east side of the building 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.379
 with this corresponds to production is their problem 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.489
 I think I should read again this report pointed out lópez 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:24.219
 this summer the presentation tour by 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:27.670
 is still almost 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.240
 and that also I think we should meet right now to discuss it 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.239
 I'm very busy now because we are one of these days so we can 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.009
 chat 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:40.980
 I think we should talk about this great system that you have fun doors 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.359
 the boyacense 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.639
 we only have moment that happened ayubí 7 your side of the building that is 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:51.180
 located in the water but do not worry it has occurred to you something that maybe you can 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.189
 serve you 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:53.669
 despite the other way around 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:57.389
 jacques fire inspections when I came here everything is so important 

00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:02.949
 it is small also accused formally are striving for themselves gerardo the 

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:06.629
 entity fire the building not competing with your work 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:09.269
 carmen santodomingo 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.969
 It is essential to judge 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:13.969
 10 4 I'm worried 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:19.979
 eye eye 

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:25.919
 after 60 years of age 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:29.469
 this context the proposed document 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:35.599
 distinguish what happens 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.499
 you are planning chief maybe you can help me is to say clear of what 

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:43.789
 it's about that fire in the building and they disconnected water I did not 

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:47.899
 it seems that it is something very serious but he opted that you think that this is 

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:50.899
 serve to settle it 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:57.639
 dad dad dad this is too simple is a joke true world 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.959
 yes no you do not realize that the solution is much more complicated than 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:06.289
 because he had four productions to leave planning and for me that 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:09.779
 I'm better actress when you're doing your job 

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:14.009
 we would face this problem we have planned everything a little better everything very 

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.220
 all right 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.220
 being so now I'm at fault 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:22.069
 they tease us after all the state 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:25.629
 let's start the meeting 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:28.719
 they do not think to do something it's sad that it's increasing 

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:33.499
 Mr. President, I have a function that will be presented to the Council. 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.199
 so let's see what it is about 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.289
 this is not possible to get busy solving them 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:49.680
 President Ben Ali 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.979
 hernandez why are we here 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:57.219
 it's going to be hard to say they can not this time it will be to put out the fire 

00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:01.859
 who let in these people do not see that we are in a meeting today 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.509
 everything was done 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:08.699
 do not blame us they saw it having solved it when it was just a 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:13.490
 small fire who abstained in today's vote 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:18.210
 every time 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.210
 the miranda state 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:26.680
 the 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.680
 the 

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:34.939
 there is a mobile 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.400
 the 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:51.379
 that is to say this is a milestone in this appointment 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:53.230
 it means that it does not happen to us 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.039
 the ball of the census 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.039
 with the victory over responsibility 

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:01.259
 I do not know either 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:03.889
 and yes efe 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:05.539

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:08.539
 until the moment to have a vision a bit the situation 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:12.460
 around him 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.100
 this week they will become martyrs after noon 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.760
 is not the time to determine the Friday's two shields become 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.770
 ruler 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.770
 stressed 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:32.629
 one 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:35.629
 m 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.719
 the rise 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:42.719
 josé manuel blecua 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:56.659
 again gil anyway 

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:07.319
 one 

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:09.039
