but later not just let us kind of get

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.809 
but later not just let us kind of get
our<00:02:58.049> creativity<00:02:58.530> flow<00:02:58.980> in<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.400> do<00:02:59.640> some

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
our creativity flow in and do some

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.309 
our creativity flow in and do some
things<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.150> you're<00:03:00.390> not<00:03:00.480> normally<00:03:00.959> used<00:03:01.200> to

things that you're not normally used to

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.530 
things that you're not normally used to
and<00:03:01.680> then<00:03:01.799> spin<00:03:02.160> them<00:03:02.310> up<00:03:02.459> in<00:03:02.610> unique<00:03:02.910> ways<00:03:02.940> and

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
and then spin them up in unique ways and

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.569 
and then spin them up in unique ways and
combine<00:03:03.840> things<00:03:04.079> in<00:03:04.379> ways<00:03:04.980> that<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.220> haven't

just<00:05:06.240> went<00:05:06.540> along<00:05:06.600> and<00:05:07.020> then<00:05:07.590> there<00:05:08.070> is<00:05:08.280> combat

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
just went along and then there is combat

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.550 
just went along and then there is combat
training<00:05:09.270> which<00:05:09.810> allows<00:05:10.110> you<00:05:10.320> to<00:05:10.410> get
