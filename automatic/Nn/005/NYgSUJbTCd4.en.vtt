enjoy<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.860> fact<00:02:40.099> that<00:02:40.220> I<00:02:40.730> just<00:02:41.180> didn't<00:02:41.420> get

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
enjoy the fact that I just didn't get

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.449 
enjoy the fact that I just didn't get
good<00:02:42.079> feedback<00:02:42.379> on<00:02:42.739> my<00:02:42.860> hands<00:02:43.069> you<00:02:43.190> know<00:02:43.310> when

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
good feedback on my hands you know when

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.220 
good feedback on my hands you know when
you're<00:02:43.549> staring<00:02:43.760> into<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.180> corner<00:02:44.569> but<00:02:44.989> when

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
you're staring into the corner but when

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.839 
you're staring into the corner but when
you<00:02:45.319> do<00:02:45.500> turn<00:02:45.709> in<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.040> car<00:02:46.250> turns<00:02:46.489> to<00:02:46.700> you

leaned<00:02:47.030> into<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.599> corner<00:02:47.930> like<00:02:48.019> a<00:02:48.079> motorbike

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
leaned into the corner like a motorbike

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.520 
leaned into the corner like a motorbike
was<00:02:49.340> a<00:02:49.370> weird<00:02:49.609> feeling<00:02:49.849> but<00:02:50.750> something<00:02:51.409> to
