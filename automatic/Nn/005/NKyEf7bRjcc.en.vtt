00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.519
 millions 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.280

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.280
 toretto I did not hide 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.120

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.630
 well coordinated were made with a 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.630
 military convoy 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.370

 It has not been but you will help me catch 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.879

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.890

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.890

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.260
 team 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.510
 because he smells oil to see that follows 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.070
 wavering and you burst to the face you have 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.620
 the best team in the world in front of your 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.890
 nose 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.840
 give them a reason to stay our 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.000
 objective is good show the commander of 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.250
 special operations 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.530
 for years he has done work in europe 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.770
 but the most recent ones have gone up 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.770
 level 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.469

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:31.240
 close to lety and you'll have to show and we 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.240
 you will get total pardon 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.360
 I can not promise that that's the deal 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.360
 take it or leave 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.430

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.289
 had seen this is the code by which 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.479
 this rule makes you predictable because in 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.090
 our predictable work means 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.390

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.650
 The leti we met may not exist 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.640
 it looks back to the family 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.640
