00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.010
 for another 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.010
 tasso 

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:12.729
 how to stimulate the bonds by referring to the students and consider succeeding in the 

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:15.559
 studies subject for educator markus merk 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.710
 What are you doing now? 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.659
 but is that the older parents in the room 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:26.669
 I think it's too extreme in the extreme for example parents are overly strict 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:28.939
 colleagues put a rule is huge 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.680
 here is the father who when the son takes the vimeiro already takes a fight 

00:00:33.249 --> 00:00:36.089
 then the tc recess go very wrong 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:40.129
 and also unlike when he sees a lot of will never time the child notebook 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.759
 do not know if he's doing well at school does not have the slightest idea we've had one 

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:46.120
 case in a large free and 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.120
 Queiroz parents went to get the radar bulletin 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.170
 July night in the middle of the year's goal and then he said yes to her daughter 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.830
 he studies here he just did not study she went every day from the parents 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.420
 they left there in front 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.549
 she went to the mall she studied absolutely nothing because the parents never 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.710
 accompaniment of these extremes I am extremely complicated can not 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.920
 too much to charge children too - those pubs 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.690
 that you do the task and such you need to keep track of 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.579
 under the look of a notebook that's okay 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.060
 because they usually 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.670
 at the time they were less and less demanding with themselves, I think 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.440
 this injury 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.740
 but that young man 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.689
 You will see then you will see that there was an exercise there was no 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.710
 way the sentences are too short 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.140
 to answer 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.140
 so this kind of thing does not work 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.010
 by exchanges 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.010
 You know I'm sure that such a goal 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.990
 what is your opinion dinho sousa a very serious trio and has parents who by 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.729
 example 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.210
 I promised my son 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.360
 you will win a videogame I leave is an axillary way through a very park 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.250
 beautiful if you will win something very important 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.510
 if you pass the year 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.640
 in the head of a child time is not common for us adults then the piece 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.850
 sesi at the end of the year earn this at the end of the year I will study everyone study now 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.340
 he arrives at the end of the year may have to prove what works in that case 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.670
 worked daily monitoring 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.740
 and do not let the end of the year stop 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.730
 moreover the end-of-year promise imagines for example if the child is going to 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.499
 to win a super video game and showing up last 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:26.689
 then she will have to do a math test the way I did before I went 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.290
 keep udine's club 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.019
 It's a bit of pressure. 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.249
 if coloring the moment children do not need pressure 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.639
 now another sign that suddenly that folder galÃ© that child that never 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.409
 I was counting on what happens in the school of the sea 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.879
 She was not for cards. She wants to stay here. 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.420
 Sometimes it's not just ours. 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.190
 we pick up the son at school is the hospital to drive and talk about the inter 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.569
 go to school, what child wants to talk to his father? 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.870
 looking at the traffic and the signs on it does not make sense so this is the 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.250
 time to be there directing this moment of helping profil account what 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.510
 happened to you there when you get home that way, include yourself as 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.990
 who was there in the lg school already heard to share and now the eye poet 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.120
 in the eye there is different 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.069
 he has asked to give a better answer instead of with it was 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.569
 found school in a result 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.090
 in addition, they also collaborate with the parents so that this approach 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.639
 with children and even guarantees the success that everyone wants to see 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:31.939
 I think the sale and the integrity of the wounded is a more frank conversation. 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:33.499
 open 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:37.289
 also talk about our school time of the difficulties that we had 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.940
 at first it takes a habit 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.260
 act of studying referee of leiria 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.049

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.219
