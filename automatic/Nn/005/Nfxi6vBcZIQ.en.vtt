which can make it a little cumbersome
especially<00:02:03.719> when<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.439> sit<00:02:04.619> down<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:05.070> know<00:02:05.189> it

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
especially when you sit down you know it

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.920 
especially when you sit down you know it
will<00:02:05.369> dig<00:02:05.640> into<00:02:05.820> your<00:02:06.000> hip<00:02:06.329> or<00:02:06.570> anything<00:02:06.899> like

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
will dig into your hip or anything like

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.550 
will dig into your hip or anything like
that<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.469> this<00:02:07.619> one's<00:02:07.829> perfect<00:02:08.420> another

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
that so this one's perfect another

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.229 
that so this one's perfect another
reason<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:11.069> great<00:02:11.340> for<00:02:11.370> women<00:02:11.819> is<00:02:12.000> that

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
reason this is great for women is that

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:12.830 
reason this is great for women is that
it<00:02:12.420> is

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
it is

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.250 
it is
light<00:02:13.019> weight<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:14.040> mean<00:02:14.519> incredibly<00:02:15.239> it's<00:02:15.959> only

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
light weight I mean incredibly it's only

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.160 
light weight I mean incredibly it's only
about<00:02:16.410> 2.5<00:02:17.010> ounces<00:02:17.640> which<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.569> super<00:02:18.840> light

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
about 2.5 ounces which is super light

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.550 
about 2.5 ounces which is super light
and<00:02:19.200> partially<00:02:20.129> in<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:21.120> fact<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:22.080> FRN

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
and partially in the fact that the FRN

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.540 
and partially in the fact that the FRN
handle<00:02:22.920> really<00:02:24.080> gets<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.170> weight<00:02:25.470> down

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
handle really gets that weight down

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.339 
handle really gets that weight down
another<00:02:26.550> thing<00:02:26.879> is<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.180> skeletonized<00:02:27.840> liners

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
another thing is the skeletonized liners

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.470 
another thing is the skeletonized liners
I<00:02:28.680> don't<00:02:28.830> know<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:29.670> can<00:02:29.819> see<00:02:30.060> them<00:02:30.239> too

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
I don't know so you can see them too

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.259 
I don't know so you can see them too
well<00:02:30.690> but<00:02:31.459> spyderco<00:02:32.459> is<00:02:32.640> does<00:02:32.879> a<00:02:32.910> pretty<00:02:33.150> good

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269

job<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:34.140> skeletonizing<00:02:34.980> their<00:02:35.280> liners<00:02:35.670> which

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
job of skeletonizing their liners which

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.460 
job of skeletonizing their liners which
makes<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.299> knife<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.599> lot<00:02:37.280> lighter<00:02:39.260> one<00:02:40.260> thing

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470

realize<00:03:35.870> but<00:03:36.870> I'm<00:03:37.290> sure<00:03:37.590> they<00:03:38.130> did<00:03:38.340> that<00:03:38.489> on

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
realize but I'm sure they did that on

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.460 
realize but I'm sure they did that on
purpose<00:03:38.639> because<00:03:39.239> not<00:03:39.720> just<00:03:39.989> to<00:03:40.170> put<00:03:40.319> their

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
purpose because not just to put their

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.030 
purpose because not just to put their
name<00:03:40.620> on<00:03:40.739> it<00:03:40.889> but<00:03:41.130> when<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:41.910> look<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:43.109> pocket

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
name on it but when you look the pocket

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.039 
name on it but when you look the pocket
clip<00:03:45.560> sits<00:03:46.560> right<00:03:46.950> on<00:03:47.010> top<00:03:47.220> of<00:03:47.730> that<00:03:47.970> logo<00:03:48.599> on

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.080 
clip sits right on top of that logo on
both<00:03:49.470> sides<00:03:49.739> obviously<00:03:50.430> so<00:03:50.639> that<00:03:50.790> you<00:03:50.910> can

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
both sides obviously so that you can

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.220 
both sides obviously so that you can
move<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:51.419> to<00:03:52.489> any<00:03:53.489> position<00:03:53.810> but<00:03:54.810> when<00:03:55.079> that

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
move it to any position but when that

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.159

usually you know about $54 or so is how

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.900 
usually you know about $54 or so is how
much<00:06:57.030> it<00:06:57.210> runs<00:06:57.889> if<00:06:58.889> you<00:06:59.310> wanted<00:06:59.550> a<00:06:59.610> harder

00:06:59.900 --> 00:06:59.910 
much it runs if you wanted a harder

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.210

steal they do have the CDP 189 steel
that's<00:07:05.220> going<00:07:05.550> to<00:07:05.610> be<00:07:05.699> a<00:07:05.729> little<00:07:05.940> bit<00:07:06.090> more

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.210 
that's going to be a little bit more

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.350 
that's going to be a little bit more
expensive<00:07:06.449> but<00:07:06.690> I<00:07:06.960> mean<00:07:07.289> if<00:07:07.830> you<00:07:08.729> get<00:07:08.880> the<00:07:09.060> CDP

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.420 
expensive but I mean if you get the CDP
still<00:07:09.780> you<00:07:10.409> won't<00:07:10.620> ever<00:07:10.800> need<00:07:11.009> any<00:07:11.220> other
