as<00:00:00.240> you<00:00:00.390> see<00:00:00.599> here<00:00:00.960> you<00:00:01.199> have<00:00:01.560> the<00:00:02.159> Sigma<00:00:02.970> on

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
as you see here you have the Sigma on

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.230 
as you see here you have the Sigma on
one<00:00:03.300> side<00:00:03.540> and<00:00:03.810> Nikon<00:00:04.259> on<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.830> other<00:00:05.240> both

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
one side and Nikon on the other both

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.660 
one side and Nikon on the other both
lenses<00:00:06.899> I<00:00:07.020> found<00:00:07.259> out<00:00:07.440> aren't<00:00:07.799> power<00:00:08.130> focal

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
lenses I found out aren't power focal

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.360 
lenses I found out aren't power focal
which<00:00:09.150> I'm<00:00:09.389> really<00:00:09.660> disappointed<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:10.380> the

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
which I'm really disappointed that the

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.860 
which I'm really disappointed that the
Nikon<00:00:11.790> isn't<00:00:12.120> because<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:12.480> was<00:00:12.599> really

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
Nikon isn't because I was really

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.189 
Nikon isn't because I was really
expecting<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.530> Nikon<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.330> be<00:00:15.330> part<00:00:15.630> focal<00:00:16.020> in

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
expecting the Nikon to be part focal in

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.580 
expecting the Nikon to be part focal in
terms<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.740> image<00:00:17.070> quality<00:00:17.250> between<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.060> two

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
terms of image quality between the two

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.800 
terms of image quality between the two
with<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.619> LA<00:00:19.949> 7200<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:20.939> makes<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.660> lot

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
with the LA 7200 it makes it a lot

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.429 
with the LA 7200 it makes it a lot
softer<00:00:22.140> but<00:00:22.880> even<00:00:23.880> without<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.330> LA<00:00:24.539> 7200<00:00:25.320> on

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
softer but even without the LA 7200 on

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.490 
softer but even without the LA 7200 on
the<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.220> Sigma<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.699> actually<00:00:27.090> sharper<00:00:27.599> wide

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
the the Sigma is actually sharper wide

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.380 
the the Sigma is actually sharper wide
open<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.130> I'm<00:00:29.250> talking<00:00:29.580> about<00:00:29.640> wide<00:00:30.000> open

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
open and I'm talking about wide open

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.569 
open and I'm talking about wide open
with<00:00:30.510> both<00:00:30.750> lenses<00:00:31.019> because<00:00:31.500> you're<00:00:32.309> shooting

with both lenses because you're shooting

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.490 
with both lenses because you're shooting
anamorphic<00:00:33.420> you're<00:00:33.600> going<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.050> want<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.320> get

anamorphic you're going to want to get

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.840 
anamorphic you're going to want to get
the<00:00:34.680> flares<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.340> you're<00:00:35.430> going<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.610> want<00:00:35.790> to

the flares and you're going to want to
get<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.120> bokeh<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:37.079> when<00:00:37.950> I'm<00:00:38.070> doing<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.120> quick

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
get the bokeh so when I'm doing a quick

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.000 
get the bokeh so when I'm doing a quick
review<00:00:39.719> like<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.170> I'm<00:00:40.379> shooting<00:00:40.710> with<00:00:40.739> them

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
review like this I'm shooting with them

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.220 
review like this I'm shooting with them
both<00:00:41.219> wide<00:00:41.489> open<00:00:41.879> wide<00:00:42.149> open<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.840> Sigma<00:00:43.170> is

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
both wide open wide open the Sigma is

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.010 
both wide open wide open the Sigma is
actually<00:00:43.530> much<00:00:43.860> sharper<00:00:44.219> at<00:00:44.520> 17<00:00:45.059> but<00:00:45.390> much

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
actually much sharper at 17 but much

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.549 
actually much sharper at 17 but much
blurrier<00:00:46.350> at<00:00:46.770> 35<00:00:47.340> now<00:00:48.059> at<00:00:48.210> 35<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.989> stays<00:00:49.289> open

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
blurrier at 35 now at 35 this stays open

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.049 
blurrier at 35 now at 35 this stays open
at<00:00:49.829> 2.8<00:00:50.340> where<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.120> for<00:00:52.550> but<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.910> can

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
at 2.8 where this is it for but you can

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.560 
at 2.8 where this is it for but you can
tell<00:00:54.270> even<00:00:54.539> at<00:00:54.989> 2.8<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.910> it's<00:00:57.390> definitely

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
tell even at 2.8 it's it's definitely

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.189 
tell even at 2.8 it's it's definitely
sharper<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:59.270> I've<00:01:00.270> had<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.629> Sigma<00:01:00.960> for<00:01:01.170> a

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
sharper so I've had this Sigma for a

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.569 
sharper so I've had this Sigma for a
while<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.620> you've<00:01:01.770> seen<00:01:01.949> other<00:01:02.070> videos<00:01:02.160> with

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
while and you've seen other videos with

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.719 
while and you've seen other videos with
it<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.850> Nikon<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.510> haven't<00:01:03.899> but<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:05.460> not

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
it the Nikon I haven't but it's not

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.280 
it the Nikon I haven't but it's not
something<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.360> would<00:01:06.479> recommend<00:01:06.869> for<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
something that I would recommend for the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.260 
something that I would recommend for the
LA<00:01:07.500> 7200<00:01:08.280> unless<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.880> find<00:01:09.060> one<00:01:09.240> that's

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
LA 7200 unless you find one that's

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.210 
LA 7200 unless you find one that's
parfocal<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.260> don't<00:01:10.500> really<00:01:10.680> see<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> point

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
parfocal I don't really see the point

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.609 
parfocal I don't really see the point
over<00:01:11.490> something<00:01:12.360> where<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.140> something

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
over something where this is something

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.859 
over something where this is something
that's<00:01:13.740> about<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.070> thousand<00:01:14.700> dollars<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.600> does

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
that's about a thousand dollars it does

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.230 
that's about a thousand dollars it does
have<00:01:16.020> nice<00:01:16.200> construction<00:01:16.920> something<00:01:17.880> like

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
have nice construction something like

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.090 
have nice construction something like
this<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.630> can<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:18.869> picked<00:01:19.080> up<00:01:19.229> use<00:01:19.530> for<00:01:19.890> about

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
this it can be picked up use for about

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.770 
this it can be picked up use for about
150<00:01:20.700> dollars<00:01:21.530> will<00:01:22.530> work<00:01:22.710> better<00:01:22.950> for<00:01:23.340> you

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
150 dollars will work better for you

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.020 
150 dollars will work better for you
with<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> LA<00:01:25.080> 7200<00:01:25.890> now<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.640> does<00:01:26.820> have

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
with the LA 7200 now this does have

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.780 
with the LA 7200 now this does have
terrible<00:01:27.479> mechanics<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.680> can<00:01:28.860> probably<00:01:29.490> hear

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
terrible mechanics you can probably hear

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.789 
terrible mechanics you can probably hear
the<00:01:30.030> awful<00:01:30.540> focusing<00:01:31.079> noise<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.530> has<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> short

the awful focusing noise and has a short
throw<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:33.180> Nikon<00:01:33.509> goes<00:01:33.720> for<00:01:34.020> about<00:01:34.189> $1000

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
throw the Nikon goes for about $1000

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.219 
throw the Nikon goes for about $1000
used<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:35.670> goes<00:01:35.880> for<00:01:36.060> about<00:01:36.150> 150<00:01:36.930> used

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
Canon 7d through a gh 2 but I really

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.770 
Canon 7d through a gh 2 but I really
really<00:02:08.310> unimpressed<00:02:08.789> with<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.209> performance

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
really unimpressed with the performance

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.930 
really unimpressed with the performance
of<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.050> Nikon<00:02:10.410> lens<00:02:10.709> at<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.730> LA<00:02:11.940> 7200

this<00:02:13.090> focal<00:02:13.510> angle<00:02:13.810> it's<00:02:14.410> actually<00:02:14.860> worse

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
this focal angle it's actually worse

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.970 
this focal angle it's actually worse
than<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.490> Sigma<00:02:16.360> so<00:02:16.740> hopefully<00:02:17.740> I'll<00:02:17.860> get

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
than the Sigma so hopefully I'll get

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.530 
than the Sigma so hopefully I'll get
some<00:02:18.160> other<00:02:18.280> lenses<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.940> test<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.420> compare

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
some other lenses to test and compare

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.870 
some other lenses to test and compare
and<00:02:20.050> we<00:02:20.200> can<00:02:20.350> find<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.710> ultimate<00:02:20.860> lens<00:02:21.400> for

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
and we can find the ultimate lens for

and we can find the ultimate lens for
