as I have to to get around like all the
corners<00:02:20.520> this<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:20.820> probably<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.300> more

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
corners this is probably a more

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.050 
corners this is probably a more
complicated<00:02:22.530> like<00:02:23.010> applique<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.910> big

Dyke stitch because there are so many
little<00:02:26.040> twists<00:02:26.520> and<00:02:26.670> turns<00:02:26.850> but<00:02:27.360> it's<00:02:28.320> you

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
little twists and turns but it's you

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.020

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
can't really screw it up and that's the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.880 
can't really screw it up and that's the
great<00:02:30.270> thing<00:02:31.040> about<00:02:32.900> handmade<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.710> no

looking pretty good my husband actually

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.970 
looking pretty good my husband actually
gave<00:03:10.180> me<00:03:10.330> I<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.780> idea<00:03:11.049> he<00:03:11.290> found<00:03:11.530> something<00:03:11.799> he

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
gave me I the idea he found something he

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.070 
gave me I the idea he found something he
fly<00:03:12.340> fishes<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.060> like<00:03:13.420> does<00:03:13.720> like<00:03:13.900> other

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
I'm just going to UM basically you know

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.460

so<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:49.700> button<00:04:49.970> on<00:04:51.970> to<00:04:52.970> the<00:04:53.060> applique<00:04:53.540> so

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
so the button on to the applique so

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.090 
so the button on to the applique so
let's<00:04:55.070> see<00:04:56.290> this<00:04:57.290> is<00:04:57.440> great<00:04:57.590> because<00:04:57.770> like<00:04:58.010> it

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
let's see this is great because like it

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.760 
let's see this is great because like it
doesn't<00:04:58.370> have<00:04:58.520> to<00:04:58.640> be<00:04:58.670> absolutely<00:04:59.210> perfect

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.469 

and<00:05:05.039> then<00:05:05.460> I<00:05:05.550> can<00:05:05.729> just<00:05:05.759> like<00:05:06.030> line<00:05:06.210> up<00:05:06.360> the

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
and then I can just like line up the

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.790 
and then I can just like line up the
buttonholes<00:05:06.690> and<00:05:08.180> just<00:05:09.180> stitch<00:05:09.419> it<00:05:09.599> a<00:05:10.169> couple

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
buttonholes and just stitch it a couple

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.270 
buttonholes and just stitch it a couple
times<00:05:10.919> and<00:05:11.340> because<00:05:11.610> it<00:05:11.789> has<00:05:12.030> buttons<00:05:12.419> on<00:05:12.720> it

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
times and because it has buttons on it

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.260 
times and because it has buttons on it
this<00:05:14.280> would<00:05:14.460> be<00:05:14.490> something<00:05:14.729> that<00:05:14.940> you<00:05:15.180> would

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
this would be something that you would

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.260 
this would be something that you would
want<00:05:15.300> only<00:05:15.900> do<00:05:16.080> on<00:05:16.379> kids<00:05:17.280> clothes<00:05:17.580> over<00:05:18.120> the

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
want only do on kids clothes over the

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.059 
want only do on kids clothes over the
age<00:05:18.419> of<00:05:18.599> 23<00:05:18.750> because<00:05:19.289> buttons<00:05:19.710> would<00:05:19.919> be<00:05:20.039> a

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:20.069 
age of 23 because buttons would be a

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:22.520 
age of 23 because buttons would be a
choking<00:05:20.490> hazard<00:05:20.520> for<00:05:20.909> someone<00:05:21.569> younger<00:05:22.319> than

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
choking hazard for someone younger than

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.469 
choking hazard for someone younger than
