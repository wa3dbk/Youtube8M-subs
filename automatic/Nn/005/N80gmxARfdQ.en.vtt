00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:03.599
 Hello and welcome to another poker channel comparison test 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.730
 Here we take a look at three doors eye-catcher and that is that 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.370
 Devices of this know the Pixma IP Xiwen break guide the four NATO 

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:15.149
 here the Epson Stylus open 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:18.390
 b 1104 around the two course Euro 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.900
 and here the HP 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.189
 Hoffest current break leading to a 50 euros 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.569
 all prices gouf op et so Fowler retail price of the manufacturer 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.119
 Street prices can be around 20 percent cheaper 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.510
 the devices can all print up to about a3 + format that again 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.200
 bigger than the standard medium to a 3-format looks nice here 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 that's a terrific 3 in print and this is a RA 3+ print too can Klose 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.850
 "One sees 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.319
 there is a lot more 

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:53.470
 On it 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.069
 and who needs photos or prints posters 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:59.069
 he will be happy about the desire more space 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.519
 normal bicycles all three devices 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.560
 Percent can also usually print only Andrei and not this 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.550
 about format 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.620
 that can only 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.710
 the Tim Bucher was already on the cheapest models 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.420
 although the devices 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.950
 can print up to twice as large as Barth 4 printers are the devices 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.960
 Fortunately, not twice as big as you need on your desk 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.820
 about 20 to 30 centimeters in width 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.010
 more room 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.540
 You can see that in the picture here 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.540
 but impression on the next to a group of four 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.860
 the Canon Pixma League seven thousand had really big paper cassette there 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.609
 fit 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:45.300
 up to 250 sheets of plain paper leg 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.810
 here in the paper tray now also paint shaft for ten sheets 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.150
 plain paper 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.909
 who wants to print photo paper or other coated paper 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.289
 he had to use his team in Peru 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.289
 for Johnsen's peaceful and normal papers 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.400
 know coated on 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.049
 all paper was from down here with one like that 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:04.950
 Klier Inc 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.820
 Liquid from this tank 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.500
 So want to know the Allied holds on plain paper again a bit 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.749
 increase 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:16.689
 Paper cassette here at the best 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:21.189
 there are up here as fit up to 120 sheets of plain paper or pure 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:22.310
 correspondingly less 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.049
 photo paper 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.519
 on the HP, the paper cassette below the printer is attached 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.340
 fit up to one hundred percent smooth 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.049
 were formal papers 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.599
 or less 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.519
 photo paper 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.079
 is still equipped with Naldo blob unit that can do the paper 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.499
 Automatically turn on the printer so that the mouse can print on both sides 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.759
 Bedu Black's unit is missing from the models here 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:51.479
 Percent can be limited by stopping the papers by hand 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.590
 know is still equipped with a network interface 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.840
 same as the HP 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.700
 the two models can be integrated as well as the network during the Epson 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.370
 here only usb interface has so only local to the PC 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.379
 connect 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.369
 All three devices work with ink cartridges 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:11.639
 you know five pieces here 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:16.359
 a black cartridge for text printing a black cartridge for photo printing 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:20.059
 and the three primary colors to their agent and money 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:23.889
 as additional consumables Fizi wrestles this Kylie Enk for the 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.889
 Coating of which one sometimes paper pages 

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:29.569
 the ink in the cartridges 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:30.709
 is Big Men 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.329
 also at heart 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.599
 Epson also has the three primary colors as their agent and money 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.979
 two identical black cartridges 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:43.169
 why Epson's not in a patron tank 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.129
 grabs 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.439
 could not answer us manufacturer 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:49.369
 DAPD 

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:53.189
 at HP for that too the three basic colors it for magenta and yellow and 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.029
 a black tank 

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:56.460
 the difference too 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.259
 know 

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:59.430
 and Epson is that 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.629
 in the HP 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.980
 in the HP cartridges percent EDA advises back so he is not a pigment ink 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.149
 that can be on photo paper 

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:11.309
 give better brilliant pressure Ã¶vp 

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:14.359
 does not have to be that depends always strongly on the respective could and of 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:15.079
 Paper off 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.889
 you can see the results here with us 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.889
 on the pages of print quality 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.800
 Another important aspect to look for is the smeared firmness 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.389
 Knowing the two you can clearly see how much the text smears when you put it 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.389
 marked with a lighthouse Acker the HP is not quite so 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.909
 bad but it also smeared significantly 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:39.969
 only the Epson can really produce solid prints here 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:43.409
 nothing blurs when you pass with a luminous man Khadr reason 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:46.270
 patented caring 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.580
 their pigments literally clawed into the paper 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.740
 So there you can 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.419
 also rub firm over it 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.419
 or go over there with water and smeared nothing 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.670
 a peculiarity of both is still shaking the printhead 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.050
 he does that with him 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.389
 the community that can be found here with the Parkhotel 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:06.860
 but do not settle 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.729
 and always upset are uneven 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.319
 are distributed in the carrier liquid 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:16.279
 that can work properly it gets loud the whole desk can become empty 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:19.449
 Shops closed so hard 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:21.759
 the power claim but glad now pressure 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:22.969
 to Hamburg 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:25.879
 or if he just has nothing to do 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:29.949
 other aspects such as the printing tempo the printing costs the print quality 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:35.250
 the operation on the device the technical data or our entire measurement results 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.610
 read here on the pages of Druckerchannel 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.960
 and if they still have questions
