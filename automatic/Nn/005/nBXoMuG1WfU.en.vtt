00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 welcome guys back with another video of 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.899
 hack italy 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.290
 well today we will see comment on the memory 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.349
 of a microsd or a usb pen drive 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.260
 up to 16 gb 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:18.270
 the link of the program I will put it in 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.670
 description so let's go to our 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.750
 browser 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:28.910
 I already insert links where I put the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:33.590
 program the program is called sd data 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.590
 let's go to download and download it 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:59.960
 we extract it once extracted 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:03.260
 we perform as an administrator followed 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.949
 as an administrator otherwise program 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.949
 do not work 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.619
 this is our program then 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.970
 let's start and go to see ours 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.970
 usb is 4 gb 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.149
 come on we've seen I'll show you 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.550
 you need to see the unit where the 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:31.069
 our pen drive in this case is merged 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:33.860
 f so let's go look for him in here 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:37.880
 automatic says we can increase them 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:41.360
 8 giga because ours is 4 we go to 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.819
 check here 8gb and we do with a person 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:49.009
 or he or she will take a little time and 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:51.200
 will rename our pendrive as never before 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.229
 date 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.439
 we expect the process to end 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.469
 I pause and I'll see you at trial 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:03.619
 over 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:06.259
 here is process completed successfully 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:10.519
 so let's go to close let's go up 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:14.269
 computer to see that our pen 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:18.109
 drive increased to seven gp and 44 hours 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:24.700
 we repeat our procedure for 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:24.700
 increase it 16 gb or better almost 16 gb 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.329
 in selecting our unit again 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.489
 and you will tell us we can increase it to 16 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.150
 giga because our time is 7 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.290
 we always do complex now 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.859
 we await the end of the proceeding of 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:49.819
 procedure and I don't know why 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:56.459
 he told me this is ok 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:58.349
 It is carrying out the operation of this 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.670
 time we wait for everything I show you 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.670
 the completion of the operation 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.030
 he wanted to add that unlike 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.920
 other videos of other guys who say 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.230
 that it is possible to increase 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.570
 I want to say that it is possible 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.870
 increase it but not physically there 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:28.360
 they really are an increase in space 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.460
 and virtually because the pen drive is 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.370
 will always remain 4 gb 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:36.490
 however then not only could I use for 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.980
 make jokes to do to do 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:44.260
 see that the pen pen drive of four 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.130
 you brought it to 16 gb and this one from here 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.500
 me unlike 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.690
 I want to be precise I want to say that 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.380
 the pendrive the space increases 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:57.150
 physically not really puts in now 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:03.510
 pause from expect the old ladies 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.510
 that ends the process we wait 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.140
 let's see if we can complete it 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.140
 the operation 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.500
 I recommend I wanted to add 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:31.530
 subscribe to my channel for that 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.780
 I will insert many but many other videos 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.990
 this at the moment is the third video here 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.970
 here we have successfully completed 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.210
 let's close our program 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.430
 we really open and see how the 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.000
 our pen drive space is 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:52.289
 become 4gb point eight of course 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:58.350
 well you can rename it as 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:05:01.800
 favorite in this case I write usb is 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:06.780
 however consider that once the 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.910
 form call it we format the pendrive la 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:16.349
 pendrive will return to its space 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:18.900
 original we format capacity 3.72 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:21.840
 gigabyte formatting completed e 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.840
 returned to the original space 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.190
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.050
 subscribe to my channel a goodbye 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.050
