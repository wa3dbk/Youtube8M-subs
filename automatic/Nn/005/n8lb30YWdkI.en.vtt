hey<00:00:03.970> guys<00:00:04.240> Oh<00:00:06.090> so<00:00:07.090> since<00:00:07.720> we<00:00:07.870> last<00:00:08.080> talked

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
hey guys Oh so since we last talked

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.240 
hey guys Oh so since we last talked
we've<00:00:09.849> done<00:00:10.030> a<00:00:10.059> few<00:00:10.269> things<00:00:10.350> we've<00:00:11.350> sanded<00:00:12.070> the

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.250 
we've done a few things we've sanded the

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.080 
we've done a few things we've sanded the
NIC<00:00:12.460> and<00:00:13.890> the<00:00:14.890> linseed<00:00:15.310> oil<00:00:15.550> is<00:00:15.820> still

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
NIC and the linseed oil is still

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.499 
NIC and the linseed oil is still
cheering<00:00:16.750> on<00:00:17.320> the<00:00:17.500> neck<00:00:17.740> so<00:00:18.340> before<00:00:19.119> we<00:00:19.300> poke

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:19.509 
cheering on the neck so before we poke

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:21.179 
cheering on the neck so before we poke
any<00:00:19.720> holes<00:00:19.779> in<00:00:20.169> that<00:00:20.349> for<00:00:20.560> the<00:00:20.619> tuning<00:00:20.949> pegs

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
any holes in that for the tuning pegs

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:22.470 
any holes in that for the tuning pegs
we're<00:00:21.400> just<00:00:21.550> gonna<00:00:21.669> let<00:00:21.910> it<00:00:22.029> keep<00:00:22.150> cheering

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
we're just gonna let it keep cheering

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.870 
we're just gonna let it keep cheering
for<00:00:22.839> a<00:00:22.900> while<00:00:23.109> so<00:00:23.949> instead<00:00:24.249> we're<00:00:24.490> gonna<00:00:24.609> work

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
for a while so instead we're gonna work

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:32.040 
for a while so instead we're gonna work
today<00:00:25.089> on<00:00:25.449> the<00:00:25.779> case<00:00:28.829> yeah<00:00:29.829> yep<00:00:30.460> the<00:00:31.300> linseed

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
today on the case yeah yep the linseed

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.350 
today on the case yeah yep the linseed
oil<00:00:32.140> still<00:00:32.590> a<00:00:32.619> little<00:00:32.710> bit<00:00:32.890> soft<00:00:33.130> so<00:00:33.430> we're

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
oil still a little bit soft so we're

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.480 
oil still a little bit soft so we're
doing<00:00:35.230> this<00:00:35.380> and<00:00:35.770> as<00:00:36.220> an<00:00:36.340> update<00:00:36.640> here<00:00:37.060> we

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:38.490 
doing this and as an update here we

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.010 
doing this and as an update here we
cleaned<00:00:39.490> up<00:00:39.670> the<00:00:40.150> sound<00:00:40.420> hole

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
cleaned up the sound hole

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.840 
cleaned up the sound hole
I<00:00:41.050> used<00:00:41.830> the<00:00:41.980> razor<00:00:42.160> and<00:00:42.370> cut<00:00:43.030> in<00:00:44.400> the<00:00:45.400> angled

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
I used the razor and cut in the angled

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.010 
I used the razor and cut in the angled
bits<00:00:46.030> and<00:00:46.390> I<00:00:46.810> removed<00:00:47.080> all<00:00:47.320> of<00:00:47.380> the<00:00:49.020> stickers

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
bits and I removed all of the stickers

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.450 
bits and I removed all of the stickers
that<00:00:50.350> said<00:00:50.590> things<00:00:51.550> like<00:00:51.760> natural<00:00:52.750> and<00:00:53.560> cancer

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
that said things like natural and cancer

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.070 
that said things like natural and cancer
will<00:00:54.670> kill<00:00:54.880> you<00:00:55.150> and<00:00:55.420> it'll<00:00:55.630> kill<00:00:55.780> everyone

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
will kill you and it'll kill everyone

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.430 
will kill you and it'll kill everyone
near<00:00:56.470> you<00:00:56.710> and<00:00:57.070> yeah<00:00:57.820> yeah<00:00:58.630> that<00:00:59.080> doesn't<00:00:59.380> need

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
near you and yeah yeah that doesn't need

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.990 
near you and yeah yeah that doesn't need
to<00:00:59.500> be<00:00:59.590> on<00:00:59.740> a<00:00:59.770> guitar<00:00:59.950> I<00:01:00.370> don't<00:01:00.700> think<00:01:00.880> the

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
to be on a guitar I don't think the

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.819 
to be on a guitar I don't think the
guitar<00:01:01.329> is<00:01:01.540> a<00:01:01.570> hazardous<00:01:02.290> for<00:01:02.530> your<00:01:02.650> health

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
guitar is a hazardous for your health

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.940 
guitar is a hazardous for your health
yeah<00:01:03.250> um<00:01:03.790> I<00:01:04.360> did<00:01:04.839> leave<00:01:05.049> you<00:01:05.409> know<00:01:05.740> the

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
yeah um I did leave you know the

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.630 
yeah um I did leave you know the
attractive<00:01:06.430> stickers<00:01:06.790> on<00:01:06.939> there<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:09.159> what

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
attractive stickers on there so what

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.160 
attractive stickers on there so what
we're<00:01:09.790> gonna<00:01:09.850> be<00:01:10.090> doing<00:01:10.120> here<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:13.170> installing

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
we're gonna be doing here is installing

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.030 
we're gonna be doing here is installing
the<00:01:14.470> pickup<00:01:15.420> piezoelectric<00:01:16.420> pickup<00:01:17.260> and

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
the pickup piezoelectric pickup and

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.000 
the pickup piezoelectric pickup and
piezo<00:01:18.820> crystals<00:01:19.450> are<00:01:19.810> type<00:01:20.229> of<00:01:20.350> material<00:01:20.800> that

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
piezo crystals are type of material that

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.510 
piezo crystals are type of material that
when<00:01:21.280> pressed<00:01:22.180> or<00:01:22.510> when<00:01:22.780> flexed<00:01:23.380> generate<00:01:24.340> an

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
when pressed or when flexed generate an

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.790 
when pressed or when flexed generate an
electric<00:01:24.940> current<00:01:25.120> and<00:01:25.870> that<00:01:26.380> electric

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
electric current and that electric

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.649 
electric current and that electric
current<00:01:26.950> goes<00:01:27.430> through<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:28.090> positive<00:01:28.540> and

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
current goes through the positive and

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.140 
current goes through the positive and
the<00:01:28.690> negative<00:01:28.750> of<00:01:29.409> those<00:01:29.650> two<00:01:30.150> sandwich

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
the negative of those two sandwich

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.660 
the negative of those two sandwich
metals<00:01:31.540> I<00:01:31.720> guess<00:01:31.900> you<00:01:32.049> could<00:01:32.200> call<00:01:32.670> through

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
metals I guess you could call through

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.670 
metals I guess you could call through
those<00:01:33.850> wires<00:01:34.180> to<00:01:34.780> our<00:01:35.020> amplifier<00:01:35.590> yeah<00:01:36.490> the

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
those wires to our amplifier yeah the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.880 
those wires to our amplifier yeah the
crystals<00:01:38.680> flex<00:01:39.010> there's<00:01:39.850> dissimilar<00:01:40.479> metals

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.770 

one<00:01:44.890> comes<00:01:45.130> out<00:01:45.280> one<00:01:45.460> wire<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:46.240> opposite

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
one comes out one wire the opposite

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.359 
one comes out one wire the opposite
polarity<00:01:46.990> comes<00:01:47.380> out<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.680> other<00:01:47.770> wire<00:01:48.040> and

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
polarity comes out the other wire and

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:49.770 
polarity comes out the other wire and
they<00:01:48.490> do<00:01:48.549> me<00:01:49.090> me<00:01:49.150> me<00:01:49.420> me<00:01:49.570> me

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
they do me me me me me

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.010 
they do me me me me me
all<00:01:50.619> right<00:01:50.770> through<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.640> amplifier<00:01:52.210> and<00:01:52.540> then

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
all right through the amplifier and then

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.170 
all right through the amplifier and then
the<00:01:53.260> amplifier<00:01:53.590> is<00:01:53.860> like<00:01:54.040> wow<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:55.810> great<00:01:55.930> yes

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
the amplifier is like wow it's great yes

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.039 
the amplifier is like wow it's great yes
what's<00:01:58.180> that<00:01:58.360> sound<00:01:58.540> again

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
what's that sound again

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.149 
what's that sound again
I'm<00:01:59.200> not<00:01:59.500> doing<00:02:01.020> okay<00:02:02.020> so<00:02:02.590> we<00:02:02.740> have<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:02.979> glue

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
I'm not doing okay so we have to glue

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.330 
I'm not doing okay so we have to glue
this<00:02:03.340> down<00:02:04.170> we're<00:02:05.170> going<00:02:05.260> to<00:02:05.350> use<00:02:05.500> and<00:02:05.890> we<00:02:06.040> have

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
this down we're going to use and we have

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.059 
this down we're going to use and we have
to<00:02:06.640> get<00:02:06.939> we<00:02:07.270> go<00:02:07.479> and<00:02:07.689> we<00:02:08.319> have<00:02:08.349> to<00:02:09.539> solder<00:02:10.539> the

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
to get we go and we have to solder the

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.820 
to get we go and we have to solder the
wire<00:02:12.069> just<00:02:12.430> drill<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:12.760> hole<00:02:13.030> for<00:02:13.300> this<00:02:13.830> quarter

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
wire just drill a hole for this quarter

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.680 
wire just drill a hole for this quarter
inch<00:02:14.950> jack

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.720 
inch jack
shiny<00:02:17.550> yes<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:20.560> be<00:02:20.680> mounted<00:02:21.010> on<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.220> top<00:02:21.400> here

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
shiny yes to be mounted on the top here

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.400 
shiny yes to be mounted on the top here
and<00:02:21.850> then<00:02:21.940> we'll<00:02:22.120> solder<00:02:22.390> up<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:23.050> thing<00:02:23.260> we're

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
and then we'll solder up the thing we're

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.900 
and then we'll solder up the thing we're
gonna<00:02:23.500> do<00:02:23.710> most<00:02:23.920> of<00:02:24.010> this<00:02:24.100> off-camera<00:02:24.340> but

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
gonna do most of this off-camera but

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.430 
gonna do most of this off-camera but
we'll<00:02:25.060> let<00:02:25.180> you<00:02:25.360> guys<00:02:25.540> watch<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:26.050> soldering

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
we'll let you guys watch the soldering

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.210 
we'll let you guys watch the soldering
and<00:02:27.280> then<00:02:27.970> we'll<00:02:28.170> give<00:02:29.170> me<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.320> update<00:02:29.890> after

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
and then we'll give me a update after

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.890 
and then we'll give me a update after
we're<00:02:30.490> done<00:02:30.580> cool

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
we're done cool

00:02:31.900 --> 00:03:29.089 
we're done cool
all<00:02:32.650> right<00:02:32.770> we're<00:02:32.950> going<00:02:33.070> to<00:02:33.100> get<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.370> that

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:35.949 

success

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:48.759 

success<00:03:38.890> that's<00:03:39.890> pretty<00:03:41.140> cool<00:03:47.709> okay<00:03:48.709> so

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
success that's pretty cool okay so

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.660 
success that's pretty cool okay so
here's<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.310> finished<00:03:49.810> bit<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:52.280> just<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.549> let

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
here's the finished bit and just to let

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:53.979 
here's the finished bit and just to let
you<00:03:52.730> know<00:03:52.909> how<00:03:53.030> he<00:03:53.090> did<00:03:53.599> it

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
you know how he did it

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.330 
you know how he did it
we<00:03:54.409> got<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.920> brad<00:03:55.340> point<00:03:55.609> tip<00:03:56.439> put<00:03:57.439> tape<00:03:57.680> on<00:03:58.010> the

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
we got a brad point tip put tape on the

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.459 
we got a brad point tip put tape on the
box<00:03:58.549> where<00:03:58.849> we<00:03:58.879> wanted<00:03:59.299> the<00:03:59.389> hole<00:03:59.569> to<00:03:59.719> be<00:03:59.870> for

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:00.469 
box where we wanted the hole to be for

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:03.789 
box where we wanted the hole to be for
the<00:04:00.590> jack<00:04:00.879> then<00:04:01.879> drilled<00:04:02.239> down<00:04:02.599> from<00:04:03.439> the<00:04:03.560> top

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
the jack then drilled down from the top

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.190 
the jack then drilled down from the top
down<00:04:04.099> that's<00:04:05.030> because<00:04:05.239> on<00:04:05.359> the<00:04:05.389> other<00:04:05.569> side<00:04:05.870> of

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
down that's because on the other side of

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.490 
down that's because on the other side of
the<00:04:06.650> Brad<00:04:06.829> point<00:04:07.159> or<00:04:07.519> on<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:07.909> wood<00:04:08.230> it<00:04:09.230> can<00:04:09.379> get

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
the Brad point or on the wood it can get

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.050 
the Brad point or on the wood it can get
kind<00:04:09.769> of<00:04:09.829> torn<00:04:10.099> up<00:04:10.250> and<00:04:10.459> so<00:04:10.700> we<00:04:10.819> didn't<00:04:11.000> want

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
kind of torn up and so we didn't want

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.629 
kind of torn up and so we didn't want
that<00:04:11.209> to<00:04:11.329> happen<00:04:11.510> on<00:04:11.989> the<00:04:12.189> face<00:04:13.189> that<00:04:13.370> showed

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639 
that to happen on the face that showed

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:17.860 
that to happen on the face that showed
it<00:04:15.280> blew<00:04:16.280> out<00:04:16.310> a<00:04:16.489> little<00:04:16.699> bit<00:04:16.910> on<00:04:17.509> the<00:04:17.720> back

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
it blew out a little bit on the back

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:28.270 
it blew out a little bit on the back
side<00:04:23.380> we<00:04:24.380> just<00:04:24.560> put<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:25.690> and<00:04:26.800> wood<00:04:27.800> glued<00:04:28.070> the

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
side we just put the and wood glued the

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.810 
side we just put the and wood glued the
piezo<00:04:29.169> and<00:04:30.169> this<00:04:30.440> piece<00:04:30.919> is<00:04:31.160> glued<00:04:31.490> right

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
piezo and this piece is glued right

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.060 
piezo and this piece is glued right
under<00:04:32.690> where<00:04:32.900> the<00:04:32.930> bridge<00:04:33.259> is<00:04:33.410> going<00:04:33.530> to<00:04:33.710> be<00:04:33.830> so

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
under where the bridge is going to be so

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.120 
under where the bridge is going to be so
that<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:35.240> greatest<00:04:35.479> amount<00:04:35.750> amount<00:04:36.380> of<00:04:36.740> sound

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
that the greatest amount amount of sound

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.800 
that the greatest amount amount of sound
transduction<00:04:37.849> will<00:04:38.539> occur<00:04:40.449> very<00:04:41.449> short

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
transduction will occur very short

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.870 
transduction will occur very short
signal<00:04:42.229> path<00:04:42.440> between<00:04:42.800> the<00:04:43.070> vibration<00:04:43.699> of<00:04:43.789> the

to<00:04:46.909> your<00:04:47.360> shielded<00:04:47.870> jack<00:04:48.139> and<00:04:49.039> one<00:04:49.460> more<00:04:49.610> thing

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
to your shielded jack and one more thing

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.279 
to your shielded jack and one more thing
to<00:04:49.940> keep<00:04:50.090> in<00:04:50.240> mind<00:04:50.300> when<00:04:50.720> you're<00:04:50.840> doing<00:04:51.050> this

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289 
to keep in mind when you're doing this

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:53.490 
to keep in mind when you're doing this
is<00:04:51.500> that<00:04:51.680> you<00:04:51.830> don't<00:04:51.979> want<00:04:52.130> your<00:04:52.250> jack<00:04:52.550> to

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
is that you don't want your jack to

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.279 
is that you don't want your jack to
interfere<00:04:54.500> with<00:04:54.650> the<00:04:54.770> brazing<00:04:55.190> so<00:04:55.970> be<00:04:56.900> careful

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
interfere with the brazing so be careful

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:59.790 
interfere with the brazing so be careful
you<00:04:58.250> gotta<00:04:58.400> put<00:04:58.610> it<00:04:58.699> in<00:04:58.760> the<00:04:58.849> right<00:04:58.970> spot<00:04:59.210> yep

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
you gotta put it in the right spot yep

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.310 
you gotta put it in the right spot yep
and<00:05:00.800> you<00:05:01.280> can<00:05:01.520> change<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.270> balance<00:05:02.479> on<00:05:03.020> how

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
and you can change the balance on how

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.610 
and you can change the balance on how
loud<00:05:03.620> the<00:05:04.159> different<00:05:04.550> tones<00:05:04.820> are<00:05:05.620> according

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
loud the different tones are according

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.379 
loud the different tones are according
to<00:05:06.740> where<00:05:06.889> you<00:05:07.039> put<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:07.340> piezo<00:05:07.610> if<00:05:07.940> you<00:05:08.060> put<00:05:08.300> it

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
to where you put the piezo if you put it

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.990 
to where you put the piezo if you put it
on<00:05:08.479> the<00:05:08.630> base<00:05:08.810> side<00:05:09.139> more<00:05:09.639> you're<00:05:10.639> gonna<00:05:10.729> get

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
on the base side more you're gonna get

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.649 
on the base side more you're gonna get
lower<00:05:11.330> frequency<00:05:12.729> amplify<00:05:13.729> if<00:05:14.030> you<00:05:14.210> put<00:05:14.419> it<00:05:14.509> on

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:14.659 
lower frequency amplify if you put it on

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:16.659 
lower frequency amplify if you put it on
the<00:05:14.870> high<00:05:15.349> side<00:05:15.650> more<00:05:15.979> you're<00:05:16.190> gonna<00:05:16.310> get<00:05:16.550> the

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
the high side more you're gonna get the

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:19.149 
the high side more you're gonna get the
higher<00:05:16.849> frequencies<00:05:17.630> at<00:05:17.840> amplified<00:05:18.530> more<00:05:18.740> so

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:19.159 
higher frequencies at amplified more so

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:21.969 
higher frequencies at amplified more so
make<00:05:19.340> sense<00:05:19.550> so<00:05:20.330> you<00:05:20.389> can<00:05:20.690> dial<00:05:21.320> in<00:05:21.500> where<00:05:21.800> you

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
make sense so you can dial in where you

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.249 
make sense so you can dial in where you
want<00:05:22.220> it<00:05:22.400> I've<00:05:23.360> built<00:05:23.690> enough<00:05:23.990> of<00:05:24.110> these<00:05:24.199> to

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:24.259 
want it I've built enough of these to

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:26.170 
want it I've built enough of these to
know<00:05:24.470> that<00:05:24.740> I<00:05:24.770> want<00:05:25.099> this<00:05:25.280> one<00:05:25.460> right<00:05:25.490> in<00:05:26.150> the
