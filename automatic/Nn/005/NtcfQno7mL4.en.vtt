00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.660
 since the beginning of the week 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.830
 there the Herta world Eberts 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.480
 Class or group but I also have Roger Peter Laggner for useless 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.150
 Rotzfrech protest balked 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.310
 pierre-michel glass of soda is there 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.960
 a scorer must be the man in front of the Leverkusen but would us 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.960
 it was very hard at this time 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.980
 the Berlin experiments that it is now up again 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.570
 Ronny Lindemann the two winners in the duel 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.570
 then werber would have thought games 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.320
 Come on 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.780
 that will also shoot with the goal 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.940
 Rafael and SUV 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.930
 sometimes put 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.110
 Lustenberger are 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.140
 and Davos is just two steps away 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.380
 the prerequisite is 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.600
 a double strike back to the 2 pause stand it seems to be back 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.780
 Smooth spices clean and that has also up to the Berlin coaching bank 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.510
 prompt 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.510
 the second half began free-running Euro Kapitza 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.930
 the load there almost turned off the utilities 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.560
 but he does that 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.560
 the atlas so we full throttle 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.520
 he will both is 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.620
 but you send everyone in the wrong direction 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.460
 and who knows 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.990
 Zurich as necessary 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.250
 Scorer I like that too 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.390
 Briggs Everts 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.710
 what else will happen before OsnabrÃ¼ck 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.010
 Fegert 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.390
 the long ball on substitute Paul II 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.500
 and from that grow 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.500
 first in the 2 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.340
 the Berlin keeper is not undisputed by the press and the public 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.460
 in the last instance, it's Ballack with Hertha 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.550
 which is about on the left side 8 force 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:13.849
 you hear waiting for a clear case 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.249
 let go 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:19.249
 that leads to wanting to 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:27.089
 Great preparation 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:30.089
 Arthur l here against Nicky Adler 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:34.159
 Town Hall after this gate in the internal duel 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.059
 with 13 hits again in front 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:39.699
 The Berliners close only centimeters before the finish line 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:42.879
 which share has convinced again 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:43.480
 diverse
