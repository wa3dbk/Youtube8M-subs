moving<00:00:06.990> on<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.319> roll<00:00:07.589> axis<00:00:07.890> there<00:00:08.460> are

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
moving on to the roll axis there are

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.220 
moving on to the roll axis there are
three<00:00:09.000> things<00:00:09.179> you<00:00:09.330> need<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.570> consider<00:00:09.750> in

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
three things you need to consider in

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.620 
three things you need to consider in
balancing<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.860> roll<00:00:11.040> axis<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:12.150> first<00:00:12.389> thing

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
balancing the roll axis the first thing

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.690 
balancing the roll axis the first thing
is<00:00:12.660> where<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.469> camera<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:13.889> mounted<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.580> the

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
is where the camera is mounted on the

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.820 
is where the camera is mounted on the
camera<00:00:15.030> plate<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.900> can<00:00:16.049> move<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.590> camera

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
camera plate you can move the camera

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.120 
camera plate you can move the camera
left<00:00:17.310> or<00:00:17.550> right<00:00:17.730> depending<00:00:18.420> on<00:00:18.960> which<00:00:19.740> slot

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
left or right depending on which slot

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.040 
left or right depending on which slot
that<00:00:20.369> you're<00:00:20.520> selecting<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.510> bottom<00:00:21.840> here

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
that you're selecting on the bottom here

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.740 
that you're selecting on the bottom here
and<00:00:22.430> this<00:00:23.430> will<00:00:23.640> roughly<00:00:24.000> balance<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.570> roll

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
and this will roughly balance the roll

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.990 
and this will roughly balance the roll
axis<00:00:24.960> but<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.890> fine-tune<00:00:26.430> any<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.939> those

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
axis but to fine-tune any of those

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.529 
axis but to fine-tune any of those
adjustments<00:00:27.949> you<00:00:28.949> can<00:00:28.980> loosen<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.000> screws<00:00:30.300> in

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
adjustments you can loosen the screws in

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.380 
adjustments you can loosen the screws in
the<00:00:30.630> back<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.369> actually<00:00:32.369> slide<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.149> roll<00:00:33.360> bar

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
the back and actually slide the roll bar

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.709 
the back and actually slide the roll bar
side<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.140> side<00:00:34.820> so<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:36.149> will<00:00:36.300> help<00:00:36.450> achieve

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
side to side so this will help achieve

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.380 
side to side so this will help achieve
perfect<00:00:37.320> center<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.800> gravity<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.340> then<00:00:39.239> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
perfect center of gravity and then the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.950 
perfect center of gravity and then the
third<00:00:39.600> thing<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:40.879> moving<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.180> camera<00:00:42.420> up<00:00:42.690> and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
third thing is moving the camera up and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.090 
third thing is moving the camera up and
down<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.399> bar<00:00:44.700> will<00:00:45.000> will<00:00:45.899> roll<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.500> you

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
down so this bar will will roll and you

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.610 
down so this bar will will roll and you
can<00:00:47.250> slide<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.760> up<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.090> down<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.629> achieve<00:00:49.260> a

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
can slide that up and down to achieve a

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.619 
can slide that up and down to achieve a
perfect<00:00:49.829> balance<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.579> when<00:00:51.210> your<00:00:51.329> camera<00:00:51.600> is

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
perfect balance and when your camera is

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.600 
perfect balance and when your camera is
perfectly<00:00:52.079> balanced<00:00:52.620> you'll<00:00:53.100> be<00:00:53.280> able<00:00:53.399> to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
perfectly balanced you'll be able to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.970 
perfectly balanced you'll be able to
place<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.000> roll<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.539> any<00:00:54.870> given<00:00:55.110> position<00:00:55.770> and

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
place the roll in any given position and

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.510 
place the roll in any given position and
it<00:00:56.940> will<00:00:57.090> hold<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.420> balance<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.140> right<00:00:58.350> now

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
it will hold that balance so right now

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.209 
it will hold that balance so right now
it's<00:00:59.520> out<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.760> balance<00:01:00.859> we're<00:01:01.859> going<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.070> begin

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
it's out of balance we're going to begin

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.939 
it's out of balance we're going to begin
by<00:01:02.910> loosening<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.750> screws<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.439> back<00:01:04.470> and

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
by loosening the screws in the back and

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.130 
by loosening the screws in the back and
I'm<00:01:05.790> only<00:01:06.000> going<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.330> loosen<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> top<00:01:06.900> two

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
I'm only going to loosen the top two

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.859 
I'm only going to loosen the top two
screws<00:01:07.400> because<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.820> opens<00:01:09.210> up<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.479> clamps

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
screws because that opens up the clamps

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.320 
screws because that opens up the clamps
just<00:01:10.140> enough<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:11.040> slide<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.700> bar<00:01:11.850> back<00:01:12.090> and

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
just enough to slide the bar back and

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.359 
just enough to slide the bar back and
forth<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.780> we're<00:01:13.200> going<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.409> slide<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.950> until

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
forth and we're going to slide it until

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.109 
forth and we're going to slide it until
the<00:01:14.700> camera<00:01:15.090> rests<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.960> level<00:01:16.350> position<00:01:17.119> so

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
the camera rests in a level position so

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.520 
the camera rests in a level position so
grab<00:01:18.600> your<00:01:18.810> wrench<00:01:19.880> and<00:01:20.880> loosen<00:01:21.259> the<00:01:22.259> screws

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
grab your wrench and loosen the screws

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.499 
grab your wrench and loosen the screws
in<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.710> back<00:01:22.740> when<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.729> loosen<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.180> screws

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
in the back when you loosen the screws

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.990 
in the back when you loosen the screws
you<00:01:25.380> want<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:26.009> put<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.250> hand<00:01:26.520> underneath<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
you want to put a hand underneath the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.270 
you want to put a hand underneath the
camera<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:28.380> will<00:01:28.560> prevent<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.070> camera

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
camera and this will prevent the camera

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.060 
camera and this will prevent the camera
from<00:01:29.460> falling<00:01:30.180> down<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:31.140> hold<00:01:31.560> your<00:01:31.650> camera<00:01:31.860> in

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
from falling down so hold your camera in

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.319 
from falling down so hold your camera in
place<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.579> then<00:01:33.360> loosen<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.840> screws<00:01:34.909> so<00:01:35.909> with

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
place and then loosen the screws so with

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.319 
place and then loosen the screws so with
the<00:01:36.479> screws<00:01:36.780> loosened<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:38.490> can<00:01:38.640> slide<00:01:39.000> this

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
the screws loosened you can slide this

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.679 
the screws loosened you can slide this
back<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.290> forth<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.890> since<00:01:41.460> there<00:01:42.270> was<00:01:42.450> more

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
back and forth and since there was more

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.780 
back and forth and since there was more
weight<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.320> side<00:01:43.590> we<00:01:44.280> want<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.579> push<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
weight on this side we want to push the

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.700 
weight on this side we want to push the
weight<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.420> other<00:01:45.570> side<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.560> can

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
weight to the other side so you can

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.260 
weight to the other side so you can
pinch<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.880> right<00:01:48.060> here<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:49.759> slide<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.790> down<00:01:51.090> to

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
pinch it right here and slide it down to

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.310 
pinch it right here and slide it down to
the<00:01:51.390> other<00:01:51.479> side<00:01:53.630> so<00:01:54.630> now<00:01:54.750> we'll<00:01:54.899> tighten<00:01:55.229> it

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
the other side so now we'll tighten it

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:07.060 
the other side so now we'll tighten it
up<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.649> we'll<00:01:56.540> check<00:01:57.540> our<00:01:57.719> balance<00:01:57.869> again

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.120 

so<00:02:08.070> now<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.490> looks<00:02:08.610> like<00:02:09.380> we<00:02:10.380> found<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.860> center

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
so now it looks like we found the center

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.560 
so now it looks like we found the center
of<00:02:11.160> gravity<00:02:12.290> because<00:02:13.290> it's<00:02:14.270> staying<00:02:15.270> right<00:02:15.450> in

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
of gravity because it's staying right in

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.780 
of gravity because it's staying right in
the<00:02:15.630> middle<00:02:15.810> but<00:02:16.650> if<00:02:16.770> we<00:02:16.920> pull<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.250> off<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.610> one

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
the middle but if we pull it off to one

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.440 
the middle but if we pull it off to one
side<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:18.960> let<00:02:19.170> go<00:02:19.550> it<00:02:20.550> bounces<00:02:21.030> back<00:02:21.060> to

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
side and you let go it bounces back to

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.020 
side and you let go it bounces back to
Center<00:02:21.780> pretty<00:02:22.020> quickly<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:22.590> we<00:02:23.460> still<00:02:23.790> don't

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
Center pretty quickly so we still don't

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.180 
Center pretty quickly so we still don't
have<00:02:24.290> perfect<00:02:25.290> balance<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:26.750> this<00:02:27.750> is<00:02:27.900> because

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
have perfect balance and this is because

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.250 
have perfect balance and this is because
this<00:02:29.190> tilt<00:02:29.820> motor<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:30.360> actually<00:02:30.810> lower<00:02:31.020> than

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
this tilt motor is actually lower than

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.230 
this tilt motor is actually lower than
the<00:02:31.410> rolled<00:02:31.650> motor<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:32.490> now<00:02:32.730> what<00:02:32.880> we<00:02:33.000> have<00:02:33.030> to

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
the rolled motor so now what we have to

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.990 
the rolled motor so now what we have to
do<00:02:33.390> is<00:02:33.420> raise<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:35.070> tilt<00:02:35.340> motor<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.820> the

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
do is raise the tilt motor and the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.260 
do is raise the tilt motor and the
camera<00:02:36.360> will<00:02:36.540> raise<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.110> up<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.760> tilt

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
camera will raise it up so that the tilt

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.330 
camera will raise it up so that the tilt
and<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.930> role<00:02:40.170> are<00:02:40.500> in<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.800> same<00:02:40.980> plane<00:02:43.340> so

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
and the role are in the same plane so

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.970 
and the role are in the same plane so
loosen<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.880> same<00:02:45.060> screws<00:02:45.420> in<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.690> back<00:02:48.980> and

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
loosen the same screws in the back and

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.850 
loosen the same screws in the back and
now<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:50.970> can<00:02:51.209> see<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:52.230> can<00:02:52.350> raise<00:02:52.620> and

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
now you can see that you can raise and

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.210 
now you can see that you can raise and
lower<00:02:52.920> this<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:54.800> elevate<00:02:55.800> it<00:02:57.290> so<00:02:58.290> these<00:02:58.770> motors

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
lower this so elevate it so these motors

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.940 
lower this so elevate it so these motors
are<00:02:59.250> in<00:02:59.640> line<00:03:00.080> you<00:03:01.080> won't<00:03:01.290> know<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.709> first

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
are in line you won't know the first

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.699 
are in line you won't know the first
time<00:03:02.220> but<00:03:02.720> go<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:04.050> position<00:03:04.230> where<00:03:04.620> you

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
time but go to the position where you

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.009 
time but go to the position where you
think<00:03:04.950> they<00:03:05.130> are<00:03:05.190> in<00:03:05.310> line<00:03:05.490> and<00:03:05.959> tighten<00:03:06.959> it

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
think they are in line and tighten it

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:17.509 
think they are in line and tighten it
down<00:03:11.660> and<00:03:13.459> now<00:03:14.459> check<00:03:14.760> your<00:03:14.880> balance<00:03:15.000> again<00:03:16.519> so

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
down and now check your balance again so

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.240 
down and now check your balance again so
now<00:03:17.670> if<00:03:17.820> I<00:03:17.910> move<00:03:18.300> it<00:03:18.420> off<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.780> side<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.320> let

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
now if I move it off to the side and let

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.090 
now if I move it off to the side and let
go<00:03:21.380> it<00:03:22.380> goes<00:03:22.650> back<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.370> level<00:03:24.150> slower<00:03:24.870> so<00:03:25.800> we're

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
go it goes back to level slower so we're

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.370 
go it goes back to level slower so we're
getting<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.400> little<00:03:26.519> bit<00:03:26.760> more<00:03:26.910> balanced<00:03:27.420> but

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
getting a little bit more balanced but

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.250 
getting a little bit more balanced but
it<00:03:28.590> still<00:03:28.830> doesn't<00:03:28.950> hold<00:03:29.280> that<00:03:29.459> position<00:03:30.260> so

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
it still doesn't hold that position so

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.470 
it still doesn't hold that position so
this<00:03:31.500> means<00:03:31.680> we<00:03:31.860> just<00:03:31.890> need<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.400> raise<00:03:33.239> that<00:03:33.420> up

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
this means we just need to raise that up

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:40.580 
this means we just need to raise that up
a<00:03:33.690> little<00:03:33.810> bit<00:03:34.019> higher<00:03:39.140> once<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.260> cameras<00:03:40.560> a

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
a little bit higher once the cameras a

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.930 
a little bit higher once the cameras a
little<00:03:40.830> bit<00:03:40.920> higher<00:03:41.130> we'll<00:03:41.580> lock<00:03:41.820> that<00:03:42.000> down

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
little bit higher we'll lock that down

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:52.400 
little bit higher we'll lock that down
and<00:03:44.989> test<00:03:45.989> it<00:03:46.170> out<00:03:46.260> again

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.510 

so<00:03:53.410> now<00:03:53.560> it<00:03:53.739> looks<00:03:53.830> like<00:03:54.069> the<00:03:54.190> role<00:03:54.370> is

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
so now it looks like the role is

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.580 
so now it looks like the role is
balanced<00:03:55.000> because<00:03:55.540> we<00:03:55.810> can<00:03:55.930> put<00:03:56.140> it<00:03:56.230> in<00:03:56.410> any

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
balanced because we can put it in any

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.770 
balanced because we can put it in any
position<00:03:56.950> and<00:03:57.959> it<00:03:58.959> will<00:03:59.110> hold<00:04:00.330> so<00:04:01.330> this<00:04:01.569> just

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
position and it will hold so this just

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.420 
position and it will hold so this just
means<00:04:02.020> that<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.380> motor<00:04:02.620> isn't<00:04:02.980> going<00:04:03.220> to<00:04:03.280> have

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
means that the motor isn't going to have

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.580 
means that the motor isn't going to have
to<00:04:03.580> work<00:04:03.760> as<00:04:03.970> hard<00:04:04.000> for<00:04:04.810> balancing<00:04:05.260> the<00:04:05.410> roll

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
to work as hard for balancing the roll

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.190 
to work as hard for balancing the roll
axis<00:04:06.510> so<00:04:07.510> with<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:08.230> roll<00:04:09.130> axis<00:04:10.050> balanced<00:04:11.050> we

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
axis so with the roll axis balanced we

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.580 
axis so with the roll axis balanced we
can<00:04:11.349> move<00:04:11.620> on<00:04:11.800> to<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.069> pan<00:04:12.220> axis
