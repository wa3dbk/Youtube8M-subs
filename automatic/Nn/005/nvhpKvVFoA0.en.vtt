that this is the FN FAL dogs with every

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.080 
that this is the FN FAL dogs with every
gun<00:02:00.630> show<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.979> think<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.549> already<00:02:02.670> said<00:02:02.939> that

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
gun show and I think I already said that

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.600 
gun show and I think I already said that
but<00:02:03.240> um<00:02:03.740> this<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:04.890> like<00:02:05.040> one<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.399> first

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
but um this is like one of the first

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.940 
but um this is like one of the first
matches<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.240> day<00:02:06.469> my<00:02:07.469> aim<00:02:07.619> was<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.860> little

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
matches of the day my aim was a little

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.430 
matches of the day my aim was a little
off<00:02:08.280> as<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.910> can<00:02:09.060> see<00:02:09.330> i<00:02:09.539> think<00:02:09.989> i<00:02:10.080> missed<00:02:10.349> that

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
off as you can see i think i missed that

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.740 
off as you can see i think i missed that
grenade<00:02:10.979> through<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.030> window<00:02:12.360> or<00:02:12.599> something

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
grenade through the window or something

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.670 
grenade through the window or something
I<00:02:13.080> don't<00:02:13.140> know

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
I don't know

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.670 
I don't know
but<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.370> am<00:02:14.549> using<00:02:14.909> a<00:02:15.209> warlord<00:02:15.870> with<00:02:16.049> extended

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
but I am using a warlord with extended

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.130 
but I am using a warlord with extended
mags<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:17.189> the<00:02:17.310> red<00:02:17.519> dot<00:02:17.760> sight<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.780> reason

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
mags and the red dot sight the reason

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.599 
mags and the red dot sight the reason
why<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:19.290> use<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.739> red<00:02:19.890> dot<00:02:20.069> sight<00:02:20.280> i<00:02:20.310> don't

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
why I use the red dot sight i don't

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.039 
why I use the red dot sight i don't
really<00:02:20.730> like<00:02:20.879> the<00:02:21.180> iron<00:02:21.329> sights<00:02:21.659> and<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:21.930> has<00:02:22.019> a

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
really like the iron sights and it has a

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.869 
really like the iron sights and it has a
little<00:02:22.290> bit<00:02:22.439> of<00:02:22.500> recoil<00:02:22.920> so<00:02:23.219> i<00:02:23.250> think<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.700> red

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
little bit of recoil so i think the red

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.839 
little bit of recoil so i think the red
dot<00:02:24.060> sight<00:02:24.299> helps<00:02:24.540> me<00:02:24.689> out<00:02:24.719> there<00:02:25.519> but<00:02:26.519> you

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
dot sight helps me out there but you

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.309 
dot sight helps me out there but you
know<00:02:26.939> I<00:02:26.969> think<00:02:27.299> the<00:02:27.450> recoil<00:02:27.930> is<00:02:28.079> more

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
know I think the recoil is more

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.929 
know I think the recoil is more
controllable<00:02:28.829> when<00:02:29.099> using<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.519> wii<00:02:29.640> remote

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
controllable when using the wii remote

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.050 
controllable when using the wii remote
which<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.269> why<00:02:30.450> i<00:02:30.480> chose<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.409> use<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.709> here

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
which is why i chose to use it here

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.309 
which is why i chose to use it here
because<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.389> classic<00:02:33.780> controller<00:02:33.840> would

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
because the classic controller would

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.530 
because the classic controller would
just<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:35.430> know<00:02:35.459> it<00:02:35.609> gets<00:02:35.760> too<00:02:35.909> difficult<00:02:36.090> with

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
just you know it gets too difficult with

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.899 
just you know it gets too difficult with
the<00:02:36.629> recoil<00:02:37.019> and<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.829> know<00:02:37.950> i<00:02:38.340> really<00:02:38.639> like

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
the recoil and you know i really like

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.520 
the recoil and you know i really like
this<00:02:39.060> gun<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:39.450> only<00:02:39.719> thing<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:40.139> throws<00:02:40.349> me

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
this gun the only thing that throws me

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.640 
this gun the only thing that throws me
off<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.920> only<00:02:41.129> reason<00:02:41.459> why<00:02:41.549> i<00:02:41.609> prefer<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:42.180> I

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
off the only reason why i prefer it I

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.830 
off the only reason why i prefer it I
don't<00:02:43.650> prefer<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.099> over<00:02:44.219> the<00:02:44.430> m14<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.720> know

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
don't prefer it over the m14 you know

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.770 
don't prefer it over the m14 you know
how<00:02:46.200> big<00:02:46.349> a<00:02:46.409> fan<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.709> am<00:02:46.829> over<00:02:47.129> the<00:02:47.220> m14<00:02:47.780> well

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
how big a fan I am over the m14 well

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.300 
how big a fan I am over the m14 well
this<00:02:48.930> gun<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.409> think<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.739> has<00:02:49.859> a<00:02:49.889> little<00:02:50.129> bit

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
this gun I think it has a little bit

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.220 
this gun I think it has a little bit
more<00:02:50.459> recoil<00:02:50.879> and<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.209> can<00:02:51.359> put<00:02:51.540> an<00:02:51.629> M<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.750> grip

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
more recoil and you can put an M a grip

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.899 
more recoil and you can put an M a grip
on<00:02:52.349> the<00:02:52.470> m14<00:02:52.980> I'm<00:02:53.099> not<00:02:53.250> sure<00:02:53.400> if<00:02:53.489> you<00:02:53.579> can<00:02:53.609> put<00:02:53.879> a

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
on the m14 I'm not sure if you can put a

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.179 
on the m14 I'm not sure if you can put a
grip<00:02:54.120> on<00:02:54.209> here<00:02:54.419> I<00:02:54.450> don't<00:02:54.689> think<00:02:54.870> so<00:02:55.079> i'm<00:02:55.319> not

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
grip on here I don't think so i'm not

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.309 
grip on here I don't think so i'm not
sure<00:02:56.430> but<00:02:56.459> i<00:02:56.760> just<00:02:57.030> prefer<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.450> m14<00:02:57.959> over<00:02:58.200> this

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
sure but i just prefer the m14 over this

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.429 
sure but i just prefer the m14 over this
gun<00:02:59.299> but<00:03:00.299> you<00:03:00.569> know<00:03:00.689> it's<00:03:00.900> it's<00:03:01.109> kind<00:03:01.349> of

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
gun but you know it's it's kind of

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.740 
gun but you know it's it's kind of
stupid<00:03:01.680> look<00:03:02.189> at<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.400> spawn<00:03:02.669> great<00:03:03.480> spawn

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
stupid look at that spawn great spawn

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.500 
stupid look at that spawn great spawn

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
but you know the thing that kind of gets

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
me confuses they have guns like this

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.539 
me confuses they have guns like this
which<00:03:12.060> basically<00:03:12.510> one<00:03:13.019> in<00:03:13.200> every<00:03:13.319> 300<00:03:14.219> people

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
which basically one in every 300 people

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.199 
which basically one in every 300 people
you'll<00:03:14.700> see<00:03:14.909> using<00:03:15.359> it<00:03:16.159> you<00:03:17.159> know<00:03:17.280> if<00:03:17.609> you're

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
you'll see using it you know if you're

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.399 
you'll see using it you know if you're
going<00:03:18.299> to<00:03:18.389> make<00:03:18.479> gun<00:03:18.720> like<00:03:18.870> this<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:19.290> know

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
going to make gun like this you know

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.680 
going to make gun like this you know
obviously<00:03:19.560> people<00:03:19.949> already<00:03:20.579> are<00:03:21.030> not<00:03:21.479> a<00:03:21.510> big

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
obviously people already are not a big

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.390 
obviously people already are not a big
fan<00:03:21.840> of<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:22.079> because<00:03:22.109> the<00:03:22.379> semi-automatic<00:03:22.889> i

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
fan of it because the semi-automatic i

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.550 
fan of it because the semi-automatic i
think<00:03:24.030> that<00:03:24.209> you<00:03:24.449> have<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.930> make<00:03:25.139> this<00:03:25.349> gun

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
think that you have to make this gun

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.129 
think that you have to make this gun
have<00:03:25.859> let<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:26.819> lot<00:03:26.970> less<00:03:27.389> recoil<00:03:27.659> if<00:03:28.019> you're

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
have let a lot less recoil if you're

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:29.629 
have let a lot less recoil if you're
going<00:03:28.229> to<00:03:28.290> better<00:03:28.769> balance<00:03:29.189> out<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.340> game<00:03:29.609> i

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
going to better balance out the game i

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.520 
going to better balance out the game i
think<00:03:30.000> like<00:03:30.359> you<00:03:30.810> know<00:03:30.900> what<00:03:31.019> i<00:03:31.049> mean<00:03:31.169> like<00:03:31.379> if

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
think like you know what i mean like if

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.069 
think like you know what i mean like if
you're<00:03:31.709> going<00:03:31.829> to<00:03:31.889> make<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.549> gun<00:03:33.449> like<00:03:33.810> the

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
you're going to make a gun like the

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.309 
you're going to make a gun like the
famas<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:34.979> all<00:03:35.189> that<00:03:35.489> are<00:03:35.519> so<00:03:35.790> easy<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.120> use

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
famas and all that are so easy to use

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.349 
famas and all that are so easy to use
but<00:03:37.319> then<00:03:37.500> have<00:03:37.680> this<00:03:37.889> gun<00:03:38.099> and<00:03:38.400> make<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.120> semi

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
but then have this gun and make it semi

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:40.909 
but then have this gun and make it semi
automatic<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:39.989> have<00:03:40.109> a<00:03:40.139> huge<00:03:40.560> amount<00:03:40.709> of

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
automatic and have a huge amount of

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.770 
automatic and have a huge amount of
recoil<00:03:41.159> just<00:03:42.150> doesn't<00:03:42.419> really<00:03:42.540> make<00:03:42.720> sense

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
recoil just doesn't really make sense

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.439 
recoil just doesn't really make sense
when<00:03:43.620> balancing<00:03:44.129> out<00:03:44.280> items<00:03:44.699> and<00:03:44.939> in<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.239> game

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:45.449 
when balancing out items and in the game

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:47.960 
when balancing out items and in the game
so<00:03:46.139> i<00:03:46.169> think<00:03:46.489> what<00:03:47.489> they<00:03:47.669> should<00:03:47.849> have<00:03:47.879> done

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
so i think what they should have done

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.210 
so i think what they should have done
instead<00:03:48.269> was<00:03:48.689> either<00:03:48.989> give<00:03:49.409> the<00:03:49.560> famas<00:03:49.919> or<00:03:50.129> the

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
instead was either give the famas or the

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.719 
instead was either give the famas or the
auger<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.970> recoil<00:03:51.359> that<00:03:51.479> this<00:03:51.659> gun<00:03:51.870> has<00:03:51.900> or

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:52.729 
auger the recoil that this gun has or

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:55.460 
auger the recoil that this gun has or
make<00:03:53.729> this<00:03:53.879> gun<00:03:54.060> have<00:03:54.299> like<00:03:54.810> no<00:03:55.109> recoil

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
make this gun have like no recoil

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.129 
make this gun have like no recoil
whatsoever<00:03:56.209> just<00:03:57.209> my<00:03:57.329> thoughts<00:03:57.599> would<00:03:57.930> help

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
whatsoever just my thoughts would help

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:59.420 
whatsoever just my thoughts would help
balance<00:03:58.439> out<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.650> gate<00:03:58.949> with<00:03:59.099> the<00:03:59.220> game<00:03:59.400> and

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
balance out the gate with the game and

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.089 
balance out the gate with the game and
the<00:03:59.639> gun<00:03:59.849> better<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:00.419> hopefully<00:04:01.409> you<00:04:01.979> know

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
the gun better and hopefully you know

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.249 
the gun better and hopefully you know
maybe<00:04:02.759> more<00:04:03.209> people<00:04:03.359> would<00:04:03.599> have<00:04:03.750> used<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:04.139> if

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:04.259 
maybe more people would have used it if

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:07.129 
maybe more people would have used it if
that<00:04:04.470> if<00:04:04.979> that<00:04:05.040> was<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.459> case<00:04:05.489> but<00:04:05.970> uh<00:04:06.139> who

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
that if that was the case but uh who

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.999 
that if that was the case but uh who
knows<00:04:07.349> who<00:04:07.620> knows<00:04:07.650> by<00:04:08.009> now<00:04:08.959> anyway<00:04:09.959> this<00:04:10.799> gun
