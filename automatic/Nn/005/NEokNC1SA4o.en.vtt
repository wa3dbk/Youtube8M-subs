What did you see?

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.917
Story by Nandini Nayar

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.250
“So,” asked Amma,

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.917
“What did you see

00:00:16.917 --> 00:00:18.083
at the zoo?”

00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:21.250
“Nothing!” said Meera.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.083
“What!” said Amma.

00:00:24.083 --> 00:00:25.333
“Didn’t you see the monkeys jump?”

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:26.583
“Didn’t you see the monkeys jump?”

00:00:26.583 --> 00:00:29.833
“LIKE THIS?”

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:38.750
“No!” said Meera.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.083
“Did you hear a lion roar? LIKE THIS?”

00:00:40.083 --> 00:00:45.500
“Did you hear a lion roar? LIKE THIS?”

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:56.333
“No, no!” said Meera.

00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.917
“You must have seen an elephant,

00:00:57.917 --> 00:01:01.667
swaying its trunk?

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:05.917
This way, that way? LIKE THIS?”

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.750
“N…n…o,” said Meera.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.417
“A giraffe

00:01:13.417 --> 00:01:15.167
with a long neck,

00:01:15.167 --> 00:01:16.250
eating leaves

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.250
from a tall tree?

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.250
LIKE THIS?”

00:01:22.917 --> 00:01:26.000
“Long neck? No.”

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.833
“A peacock dancing?

00:01:27.833 --> 00:01:31.583
LIKE THIS?”

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.250
“No.”

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.583
“A crocodile yawning?

00:01:43.583 --> 00:01:46.750
LIKE THIS?”

00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:56.750
“No, Amma!”

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.250
“You went to the zoo today

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.917
and saw no animals?”

00:02:01.917 --> 00:02:03.500
Amma asked.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.583
“We didn’t go today, Amma!

00:02:06.583 --> 00:02:07.917
We’re going tomorrow!”

00:02:07.917 --> 00:02:11.583
“Tomorrow?” said Meera’s Amma…

00:02:11.583 --> 00:02:14.833
and flopped to the ground like a bear...
