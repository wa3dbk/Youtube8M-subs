00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
review of the earth wings super glider

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.379 
review of the earth wings super glider
this<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.690> five<00:00:09.960> fly<00:00:10.290> not<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.710> floor<00:00:11.389> I've

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
this is the five fly not the floor I've

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.240 
this is the five fly not the floor I've
written<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.780> four<00:00:12.990> ply<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.950> have<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.219> say

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
written the four ply and I have to say

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.560 
written the four ply and I have to say
that<00:00:14.700> this<00:00:14.849> one<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.590> much<00:00:16.590> better<00:00:17.270> by<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.300> long

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
that this one is much better by a long

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.170 
that this one is much better by a long
shot<00:00:18.600> just<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.590> extra<00:00:20.039> added<00:00:20.369> stiffness<00:00:21.000> to

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
shot just the extra added stiffness to

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.000 
shot just the extra added stiffness to
it<00:00:21.330> I'm<00:00:21.570> about<00:00:21.810> let's<00:00:22.080> say<00:00:22.970> 590<00:00:24.859> that's<00:00:25.859> my

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
it I'm about let's say 590 that's my

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.540 
it I'm about let's say 590 that's my
it's<00:00:26.490> my<00:00:26.580> height<00:00:29.150> 150<00:00:30.150> pounds<00:00:30.750> 5<00:00:31.710> 950<00:00:32.399> pounds

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
it's my height 150 pounds 5 950 pounds

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.940 
it's my height 150 pounds 5 950 pounds
so<00:00:34.040> this<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.190> great<00:00:36.079> see<00:00:37.079> if<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.260> can<00:00:37.410> see<00:00:37.860> how

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
so this is great see if you can see how

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.150 
so this is great see if you can see how
much<00:00:38.070> stickers<00:00:38.780> it's<00:00:39.780> definitely<00:00:40.160> bit

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
much stickers it's definitely bit

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.330 
much stickers it's definitely bit
beefier<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:43.010> I<00:00:45.559> would<00:00:46.559> be<00:00:46.680> riding<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.129> was

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
beefier and I would be riding it was

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.040 
beefier and I would be riding it was
raining<00:00:47.760> right<00:00:47.850> now<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.620> kind<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.680> sucks<00:00:51.050> but

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
raining right now and kind of sucks but

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.680 
raining right now and kind of sucks but
yeah<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.500> lot<00:00:52.649> stiffer<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:54.469> the<00:00:55.469> four<00:00:55.680> ply

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
yeah it's a lot stiffer and the four ply

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.119 
yeah it's a lot stiffer and the four ply
it's<00:00:57.690> more<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> dampening<00:00:58.410> flex<00:00:58.710> instead<00:00:59.039> of

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
it's more of a dampening flex instead of

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.580 
it's more of a dampening flex instead of
like<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.460> know<00:00:59.489> sloppy<00:01:00.390> flex<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:01.170> mean<00:01:01.440> other

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
like you know sloppy flex I mean other

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.410 
like you know sloppy flex I mean other
ones<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:01.920> really<00:01:01.980> sloppy<00:01:02.370> but<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.180> was

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
ones that really sloppy but it was

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.509 
ones that really sloppy but it was
definitely<00:01:03.660> noticeable<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:05.220> one<00:01:05.430> is

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
definitely noticeable this one is

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.260 
definitely noticeable this one is
significantly<00:01:06.180> less<00:01:06.600> flex<00:01:08.000> despite<00:01:09.000> their

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
significantly less flex despite their

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.609 
significantly less flex despite their
only<00:01:09.450> being<00:01:09.659> one<00:01:09.960> ply<00:01:10.140> difference<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:13.200> rest

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
only being one ply difference the rest

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.440 
only being one ply difference the rest
of<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.799> specs<00:01:14.100> are<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.280> same<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.299> look

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
of the specs are the same so I just look

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.810 
of the specs are the same so I just look
that<00:01:15.600> up<00:01:15.659> don't<00:01:16.439> be<00:01:16.530> lazy<00:01:16.740> it's<00:01:17.369> not<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.640> hard

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
that up don't be lazy it's not that hard

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.690 
that up don't be lazy it's not that hard
takes<00:01:18.210> like<00:01:18.330> two<00:01:18.509> seconds<00:01:19.340> once<00:01:20.340> your<00:01:20.460> slow

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
takes like two seconds once your slow

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.370 
takes like two seconds once your slow
internet<00:01:20.729> then<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.570> kind<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.840> sucks<00:01:22.049> with<00:01:22.290> me

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
internet then it's kind of sucks with me

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.679 
internet then it's kind of sucks with me

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
plate of a gunmetal and it fills nicely

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:55.249 
plate of a gunmetal and it fills nicely
to<00:01:48.270> me<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.540> have<00:01:51.290> think<00:01:52.290> it's<00:01:52.470> an<00:01:52.829> ADEA<00:01:54.259> blood

black venom bushing is on top uh I got

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.270 
black venom bushing is on top uh I got
bones<00:02:03.420> reds<00:02:03.750> bearings<00:02:04.320> which<00:02:04.710> are<00:02:04.979> kind<00:02:05.189> of

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
bones reds bearings which are kind of

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.950 
bones reds bearings which are kind of
dirty<00:02:05.490> right<00:02:05.729> now<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:06.119> they<00:02:06.210> suck<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.689> spin

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
airs better but bones reds bearings and

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.480 
airs better but bones reds bearings and

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
yeah I think I covered the basics of the

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.270 
yeah I think I covered the basics of the
board<00:02:31.150> it's<00:02:31.510> pretty<00:02:31.780> nice<00:02:32.070> thinking<00:02:33.070> about

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
board it's pretty nice thinking about

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.450 
board it's pretty nice thinking about
getting<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.810> four<00:02:35.080> ply<00:02:35.290> fireflies<00:02:36.010> go<00:02:36.310> ahead

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
getting the four ply fireflies go ahead

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.970 
getting the four ply fireflies go ahead
get<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.670> Firefly<00:02:37.120> too<00:02:37.450> much<00:02:37.600> better<00:02:37.980> you

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
get the Firefly too much better you

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.350 
get the Firefly too much better you
won't<00:02:39.160> regret<00:02:39.310> it<00:02:39.520> especially<00:02:39.940> if<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.210> want

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
won't regret it especially if you want
