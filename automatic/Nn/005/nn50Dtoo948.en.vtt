 Hi everyone, I think Marcelo 09 and today 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.850
 presenting to you as 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.710
 to increase minecraft ram memory 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.640
 to do a tutorial is presenting in the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.740
 mec 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.850
 but it also works for both the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.850
 windows and computer 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:39.530
 so come on, obviously you will have 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.399
 to have installed minecraft 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.440
 you're probably going to have to have 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:49.800
 installed minecraft pre medic laut eu 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.829
 I taught and dreamed tutorial is in the channel 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.020
 if you want to get it right 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:01.620
 I also do not think I said if it will open 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:06.150
 normally on the home screen and will 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:12.960
 select setup uncertain pisteiro 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:21.000
 default will create an egg can put the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:23.759
 rain more more beauty and here I go 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.880
 copy the pure minecraft you only want 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.630
 does not need any logic since the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.090
 mother craft pure 1.445 in configuration 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.400
 most popular here because I wanted 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.920
 give the name you want 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:43.920
 from there you will select 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.229
 advance and what? 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.960
 This is the page of the agency you are going to 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.689
 put into memory the amount of 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.880
 memory that will cause reminding you that the 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:59.460
 amount of memory it can only be one 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:01.409
 multiple of 1024 or 1512 which is the 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.380
 way the computer separates memory 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:09.569
 new your working 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.520
 then 24 in a shot means 24 means 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.310
 a wrong genius on your computer 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.860

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.170
 cute litters that left great with 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.560
 good graphic there is needed if 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:30.890
 using this to get better leaves the game 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.890
 but went without lake 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:40.230

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:12.140
 check out 4,096 of ram for a kindergarten 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.140
