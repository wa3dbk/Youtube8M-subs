 make the realized to the perseo cover 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.410
 something that stands out at first sight is that 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.500
 where you are going to insert your cell phone is a 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.360
 soft silicon is a soft silicon that 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.420
 it's something that I love because 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.209
 personally when I put covers of 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.310
 rigid silicone came to feel that up 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.310
 It can damage the iphone but good yo 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.280
 I have a skin I'm going to see if you do not touch me 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.599
 remove it in this type of covers is very 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.000

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.540
 there then we put the rest out 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.350

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.460
 comfort 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.530

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.340

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.050
 repeat for comfort when it comes to take 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.620

 the company since they were telling me 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.080
