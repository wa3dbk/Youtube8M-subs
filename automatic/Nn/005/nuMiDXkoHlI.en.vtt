00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.890
 salute as always johnny and the day of 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.619
 Today I will be teaching you how to 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.500
 install the minecraft minion mod in your 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.029
 most recent version of course in the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.580
 description of the video I will be 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.680
 leaving all the information about 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.629
 this mod and obviously the links of 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.239
 download that they are going to be in the first place 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:39.269
 the minecraft force and the second 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.100
 obviously the mod's first thing 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.470
 we are going to do to proceed with the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.500
 installation is to execute our 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.690
 installer del force verify that it is 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.510
 palomean to the option to install client 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.790
 and give in accepting with this as it 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.070
 they would download the bookstores and then 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.110
 I would appear this little 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.420
 poster that says complete where then 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.089
 tells me that obviously the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.739
 installation of force correctly that 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.960
 let's do now you can give it accept 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.640
 and run our minecraft because 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.590
 we have to see what 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.260
 executed or has been installed better said 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.229
 well our force and that generates a 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.260
 folder that is very important for the 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.180
 installation of the mod being here what 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.490
 what we are going to see is that we have a new 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.440
 profile called force how can we 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.610
 check it here says ready to play 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.409
 minecraft 1.7 point 10 force 10 point 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.750
 13.2 point 12 30 which is the version 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.180
 current I'm using we're going to 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.460
 give play to enter my gr of a 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.020
 good time when we are in this part 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.479
 we will be able to notice now I have 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.970
 a new button called mods we enter 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.149
 in it and we have the three files that 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.970
 they install at the time then obviously of 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.310
 to install minecraft force 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.470
 once corroborated this I have checked 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.390
 that everything is correct we could leave 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.000
 of the game and what we are going to do now 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.090
 is to enter the route of our 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 minecraft with the combination of keys 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.239
 windows + r will open this small 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.660
 little window where we are going to write 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:15.329
 app data percentage and again 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.670
 percentage we give in accepting takes us 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:19.650
 to this other window where 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.019
 we will enter the folder that says 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.570
 point minecraft here inside then 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.420
 we will look for a new folder that 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.519
 called mods how are you doing here and 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.680
 it's completely empty we want it 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:35.040
 now it 's unzipping our file 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.510
 of the mod that is in winrar and once 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.150
 have generated the folder as they are 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.640
 seeing here we will see that here we have 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.100
 another folder called mods but inside 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.100
 she would be the two files that 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.440
 are necessary for the operation 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.650
 right obviously we are going to simply 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.430
 move this to our masters folder 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.070
 this part and what we would do to close this 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.410
 window will be of this other and run 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.200
 again our minecraft for of 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.579
 this way now I do see that everything is 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.670
 right with the way it has been 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.590
 installed everything 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.410
 of course being in this part 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.780
 obviously we would have to verify that 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.390
 we are in the correct profile of forge and 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.310
 give it play very well now let's 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.830
 enter the mods section and here 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.680
 within let's see what we have 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.340
 we just installed the atomics strike 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.410
 update check and the mission is mod 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.819
 let's give it ready to concentrate a 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.489
 world that I already have here to be able 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.900
 show them a little bit about what 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.390
 what is this mod 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.850
 let's press e and here we go to 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:45.990
 look for what would be a wand 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:49.350
 so our minimum appear this 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.100
 it's called the master being with just 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.980
 right click 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.650
 we can make 4 of these appear 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.530
 minions that are here that are going to be what 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:04.090
 to order them we want to cut trees 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:06.310
 make a tunnel or do this digging towards 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.310
 down to obviously explore 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.920
 much better to note that these 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.510
 minimums will appear with every five 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.100
 levels that we have in the 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.989
 I 've made it appear like that because 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.330
 obviously I'm creative 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.550
 remember that more information about 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.340

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:27.520
