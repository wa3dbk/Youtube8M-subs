00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
 all right 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.460
 welcome today we will draw a character 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.950
 raising your arms in such a way that 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.320
 cuffs look very large by 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.840
 find yourself in the foreground to this you 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.630
 we will call foreshortening or in this case fists 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.150
 strive to draw this character 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.640
 we started drawing in a normal way is 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.770
 say with the arms below this already what 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.930
 we have seen in previous classes since 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.840
 basic forms up to more complex like 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.239
 appears on the screen and in the description 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.590
 but it is not too much to review 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.350
 we will draw a line and we will divide it 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.210
 in half and then each half the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.010
 we divide again by half of such 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.649
 so we get a line with four 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.079
 sections it is important to mark that in the 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.969
 third section will be the navel in the 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.429
 second the chest and in the first section 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.589
 we will draw the head as the 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:55.170
 We began to draw as usual to 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:56.579
 from a circle remember that in 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.920
 previous classes we have drawn the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.950
 head in front in both manga style 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.630
 Realistic and corpulent American type 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.180
 with the same width of the head 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.700
 we draw the neck we draw a line 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.320
 horizontal under the neck we draw it 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.570
 as wide as we want it to look 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.580
 body from the ends of the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.950
 line we draw the body becoming 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.979
 slender to the waist the lines that 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.420
 we draw are slightly curved 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.550
 we will mark a dotted line above the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.370
 Navel point and another dotted line 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.350
 below the navel between these two lines 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.660
 dotted lines we draw two lines that are 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.780
 the tires or technically known 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.820
 as obliques under these lines of the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.380
 oblique we draw two inclined lines 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.690
 which are the iliac crests of the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.940
 which we have previously discussed and 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.460
 join with a v- shaped line that 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.660
 arrives until the fourth division starting 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.580
 of the beginning of the iliac crests 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.259
 we draw the hips that become a 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.420
 little wide as they approach the 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.700
 legs 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.500
 we make the body a little wider 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.900
 the arm that we draw it lightly 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.640
 curved by joining the arm to the body we notice 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.320
 that this touches the body at a height 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.759
 under the chest 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.100
 then we draw the other arm 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.830
 looking for the whole picture to be left 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.569
 well symmetrical we draw the trapeze 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.450
 slightly inclined and hands by 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.610
 under the fourth division observe that 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.350
 the inner part of the hand is the one that 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.120
 bulky as we name them with lines 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.980
 parallel 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.319
 we begin to detail this body in 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.209
 black color we do it quickly 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.920
 because we have really seen before with 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.319
 detail as we said in the second 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.090
 section we draw the chest and shoulders 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.970
 they end at the same height as the chest 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.400
 we draw the letter shape and inverted 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.280
 under the chest and there we will draw the 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.920
 abdominal muscles at the height of 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.310
 navel we draw an abdominal muscle and 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.190
 up this other muscle this line 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.829
 is a muscle known as dorsal and 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.620
 under this one we draw the times that 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:54.290
 connect to the ribs these have the 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.700
 shape that appears on the right we draw 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.799
 the arms which we saw them 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.440
 previously as it appears on the screen and 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.840
 in the description the forearm has a 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.690
 curved shape in general the principle is 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.359
 wider simulated in this ellipse and 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.510
 then draw thinner we draw 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:13.489
 the other arm observes as the part 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.109
 External arm has a stepped shape 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.569
 as we mark it with the small 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.349
 arrows and we trace the forearm as 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.989
 before we did it 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.760
 in this way we draw the base body 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.109
 that we will use to draw the fists in 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.609
 foreshortening 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.260
 maybe you feel like we're going something fast 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.810
 but remember that these topics the books 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.140
 before starting with very basic figures 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.940
 until you reach the most complex 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.730
 now we will continue with the steps more 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.760
 important we draw the most clavicles 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.920
 lifted from the usual 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.599
 these little points are the place where 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.000
 originally it was the end of the 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.680
 clavicles at the ends of the 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.150
 clavicles we draw some lines 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.780
 dotted that will be the arms 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.370
 these are shorter than the normal arm 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.860
 observe in green as we draw the 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.709
 normal length of this section and you can 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.720
 see that it is longer we trace 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.549
 your forearms and you can see that too 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.970
 They are shorter than the normal forearm 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.590
 that again we mark in green 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.260
 but when we draw the fist we do not draw 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.030
 gigantic like three times as big 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.069
 that the normal fist 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.549
 This is one of the most important steps 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:21.150
 in this drawing and likewise we draw the 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.650
 another very big fist 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.840
 about the end of the clavicles 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.360
 we draw some curved lines that will be 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.900
 the shoulders and these lines are the 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.270
 trapeze a little raised 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.400
 at the end of the shoulder we begin to trace 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.889
 a line that goes to the chest but 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.900
 that is drawn above the chest the 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.490
 chest rises because of the arm that 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.880
 when rising takes with him 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.009
 various muscles again we will draw 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.860
 in curved form the external part of the 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:50.930
 forearm as marked by the arrow and what 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.430
 we will draw first wide in the form of 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.770
 ellipse 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.090
 and then thin following the form 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.280
 curve 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.280
 and we do the same with the other arm 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.200
 and we draw the arms trying that the 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.090
 shoulder see above we complete the 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.660
 external part of the body and we observe 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.600
 that a new curve is drawn 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.900
 marked by a small arrow and this 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.460
 another arrow marks the dorsal muscle 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.460
 up to this point we have drawn the most 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.710
 important we draw in the fists four 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.540
 divisions that will be the fingers remember 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.040
 that the fist drawing we saw in a 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.040
 previous class as it appears on the screen 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:34.070
 and in the description under the divisions 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.620
 of the fingers we trace the thumb and 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.990
 we draw the palm and the second phalange 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.180
 of each finger 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.970
 what we mark are the shoulders and 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.740
 we differentiate from the clavicles these 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.410
 muscles that we draw now are the 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.270
 chest muscles which they love 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.260
 direct upwards as marked by 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.540
 little arrows 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.150
 in the video that follows this we will talk 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.620
 of the muscles of this figure you can 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.290
 see in the link that appears on the screen 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.880
 and in the description of this video I do not 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.560
 we do here because the video would be very 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.960
 long and we would leave a little of the subject 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.139
 of them or 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.110
 this one that we draw here is the biceps and 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:14.400
 this line the triceps muscle 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.259
 we begin to draw muscles inside 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.990
 the arms and we give this drawing by 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:21.569
 finished we only remark the muscles 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.610
 of the body the cerrato the muscles 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:26.099
 sit-ups and all kinds of details 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.590
 these figures start to be a little 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:31.080
 more complex where you wait if you do not 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.639
 they look good at first you need 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.699
 of patience and practice but with 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:37.169
 record any drawing is possible 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:39.900
 we trace the hair in a very basic way 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:43.060
 and we painted the whole gray figure 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.830
 to give a metallic effect 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.380
 as is common in this type of drawings 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.870
 we begin to place white glitters and 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.820
 then black shadows from the side 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.310
 left of the body 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:57.220
 we trace on the chest a red ornament that 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:59.440
 break with the predominant gray color in 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.270
 the computer with a lot of patience 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.730
 we give very detailed color to our 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.410
 drawing the color can take some 

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:08.350
 hours but here we summarize in some 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:10.660
 seconds the color we will explain it in your 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:13.440
 moment what is important for now is the 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:15.060
 drawing of the figure that we explained before 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.430
 we hope this class will be useful 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.050
 do not stop sharing those kinds of 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:21.300
 drawing to those who like this subject 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.280
 like it if you liked the class and 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:27.380
 subscribe to us is very helpful and 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.380
 motivation until next time 

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.940
 all right
