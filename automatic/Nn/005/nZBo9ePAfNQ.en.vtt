00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.679
 hello and welcome with this 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.320
 video I turn again to the 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.900
 guitars beginner 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.900
 It should be about how to get one 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.670
 Chord sequence developed for this purpose 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.630
 I have an example of chord progression 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:29.240
 it consists of two clocks c 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:34.469
 two keys a minor two keys d minor 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:37.800
 2 tactics d major one bar e minor now 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:41.190
 even half tactical to the all and g major 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:46.140
 and statements another two contacts c 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.989
 The very first step is natural 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.340
 that i have the handles to these chords 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.460
 memorize symbols 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.860
 the first is quite a lot of work 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.079
 but that pays off because in almost 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.629
 every song has the same grips again 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.890
 happen and it just does not exist 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.129
 many handles for the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.080
 Song accompaniment is not needed 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.670
 so that in each song now complete 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.110
 new chords have to learn but the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.180
 repeat again and again 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.490
 So we assume you have now 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.650
 memorized and know the chords 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.860
 the handles then the next step 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.130
 to be able to access them quickly to 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.950
 example c dur our first chord i 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.900
 would now try cdu as fast as 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.820
 possible to grab I control 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.080
 always if it was right in the meeting 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.060
 I'll strike once 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.510
 It is also important to learn that one 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.190
 at c major only five pages I play 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.550
 beat here with a soft plectrum 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.410
 to only five pages 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.750
 that sounds good then I take the accord 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.140
 Back away relax the hand and reach out 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.140
 new again 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.500
 Take it away again 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.149
 I do that first with every chord 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.149
 so also with a minor 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.380
 and so on with all the actors 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.170
 i am now taking the chord 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.690
 change of song before in our 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.270
 example is the first chord change 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.010
 from c major to minor 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.650
 But now I do not take my fingers 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.130
 away but I try on the 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.790
 shortest way from c major c minor to 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.160
 reach 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.230
 there can even be two in this case 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.500
 The first two remain finger-lying 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.239
 I just have to turn the ring finger of 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.190
 c major to a minor and I do that then 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.460
 well so i hit cdu once 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.580
 again 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.280
 then possible Switch to a shock 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.140
 I to a minor 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.360
 play the accord once and again 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.360
 back only between two chords 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.690
 if that works well, I'll take it 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.510
 next change before that would be in ours 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.510
 case of a minor after the all 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.530
 So you see, I avoid big ones 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.200
 Do not move your fingers first 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.110
 high from fingerboard but every finger 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.099
 goes on the shortest way to his new 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.750
 position 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:29.360
 i always stay i always keep that 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.360
 side contact switch in accord 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.260
 Of course, that works fast for me 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.200
 because I have been for many years 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.730
 games of these chords have patience that 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.190
 you'll get there just as fast soon 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.040
 So that would be with every chord now 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.440
 to practice change so the next one would be 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.430
 then from the all to g major then from gd 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.709
 minor and so on only when I'm all 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.760
 chord change of a song for sure 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:01.510
 I start to master everything in the world 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.970
 to practice rhythm our example is im 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:08.329
 four-four clock so I do the following 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:11.709
 Hit every chord once that is 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:14.450
 my thought 1 and I count to 4 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:17.989
 at the accord repetitions so if one 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.930
 chord two clocks I play 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.789
 the second time then we again 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.680
 have only one example here 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:26.330
 a half tactical chord changes that 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.360
 is the all to go 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.400
 I would have to remember demo will be quite 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.310
 normally played on the one but go 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.199
 on the three and the same day still have 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:46.680
 I therefore less time for the change 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:49.610
 I feel it before 12 34 42 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.610
 34 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:05:08.900
 41 23 47 23 41 23 47 hours 2 3 4 1 2340 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:17.479
 23424 22 34 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:23.320
 34 that's pretty nice 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.530
 demanding but we want the song 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.690
 yes , constantly playing in the rhythm so 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.210
 we also have to practice that when you do that 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.190
 You can still play safely 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.260
 consider a rhythm in which you think 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:41.040
 suggests you use it every day 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:48.510
 for example 1 2 and 3 and 4 and 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:49.860
 played off on down on that's just 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.400
 an example of the good rhythm 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:57.560
 four-four clock, I play games as 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:00.450
 Fist rule 1234 always with discounts the 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:06.449
 Ties between them with strokes so 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:09.490
 again one two and three and four 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:13.360
 I will do that again with everyone 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:16.979
 chord and I lead in every clock 1 1 2 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.979
 and 3 and 4 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.740
 hmm 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.070
 so i can already do a song 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.170
 Accompany this I think it sounds 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:55.090
 quite good, I have now partially the 

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:57.520
 thumbs up, that's because 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.260
 that in the chords over four 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.470
 or five pages only to be played 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:04.420
 unwanted pages with your thumb 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.710
 Dyes heaviest is natural 

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.620
 again the one with the half tactical one 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.000
 Change to all too guido the day is 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.390
 Hard because of that I would in individual 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.210
 to practice 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:20.700
 I hold your mind in my stroke 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:20.700
 Scheme 12 and 31 

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:28.460
 as soon as i have a problem with the game 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.770
 I try to circle that and 

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:33.080
 if possible a very small exercise me 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:35.270
 if we are an individual 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.790
 then I have a hard time 

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:40.160
 First only this single clock and 

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:42.410
 then later if it works well I can 

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.420
 put the small parts together again 

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.640
 to a whole piece that would be mine 

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.750
 herangehensweise if I too 

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.420
 accompany 

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:53.050
 Have fun trying and practicing until 

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.050
 next time
