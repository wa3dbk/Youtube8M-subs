motorcycle people need to spread the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:33.830 
motorcycle people need to spread the
word<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.000> little<00:01:33.210> bit<00:01:33.330> about<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.630> kind<00:01:33.810> of

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
word a little bit about that kind of

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.570 
word a little bit about that kind of
stuff<00:01:33.900> unfortunately<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:35.190> lot<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.340> people

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
stuff unfortunately a lot of people

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.370 
stuff unfortunately a lot of people
think<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.060> riding<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.750> motorcycle<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.229> just

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
think that riding a motorcycle is just

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.749 
think that riding a motorcycle is just
like<00:01:37.470> driving<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.830> car<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.220> it's<00:01:38.369> completely

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
like driving a car and it's completely

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.430 
like driving a car and it's completely
different<00:01:39.180> there's<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.840> much<00:01:39.990> more<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.259> need

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
different there's so much more you need

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.080 
different there's so much more you need
to<00:01:40.530> be<00:01:40.619> when<00:01:40.800> you're<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> bike<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.610> car<00:01:41.880> I

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
to be when you're on a bike in a car I

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.290 
to be when you're on a bike in a car I
think<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.690> there<00:01:42.869> should<00:01:42.899> be<00:01:43.080> some

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
think that there should be some

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.149 
think that there should be some
communication<00:01:45.300> about<00:01:46.110> training<00:01:46.770> and

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
communication about training and

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.760 
communication about training and
actually<00:01:47.970> doing<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.659> there<00:01:49.020> are<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.140> lot<00:01:49.380> of

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
actually doing it there are a lot of

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.020 
actually doing it there are a lot of
people<00:01:50.190> who

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
people who

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.390 
people who
you<00:01:53.030> know<00:01:53.150> a<00:01:53.180> lot<00:01:53.540> of<00:01:53.570> it<00:01:53.810> is<00:01:54.080> brighter<00:01:54.710> air<00:01:55.010> so

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
you know a lot of it is brighter air so

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.300 
you know a lot of it is brighter air so
if<00:01:55.790> we<00:01:56.120> get<00:01:56.660> word<00:01:57.200> out<00:01:57.410> that<00:01:57.680> there<00:01:57.830> are<00:01:57.860> more

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
if we get word out that there are more

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.430 
if we get word out that there are more
classes<00:01:59.150> and<00:01:59.180> training<00:01:59.570> courses<00:01:59.930> and<00:02:00.260> stuff

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
classes and training courses and stuff

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.010 
classes and training courses and stuff
out<00:02:00.650> there<00:02:00.830> I<00:02:00.890> think<00:02:01.250> a<00:02:01.340> lot<00:02:01.520> more<00:02:01.729> people

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
out there I think a lot more people

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.180 
out there I think a lot more people
would<00:02:03.020> be<00:02:03.200> involved<00:02:03.470> in<00:02:03.740> it<00:02:03.860> part<00:02:04.040> of<00:02:04.100> the

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
would be involved in it part of the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.100 
would be involved in it part of the
whole<00:02:04.310> thing<00:02:04.340> is<00:02:04.520> you<00:02:04.880> know<00:02:05.300> if<00:02:05.720> you<00:02:05.930> don't

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
whole thing is you know if you don't

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.060 
whole thing is you know if you don't
learn<00:02:06.260> one<00:02:06.590> way<00:02:06.740> you're<00:02:06.860> going<00:02:06.979> to<00:02:07.010> learn

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
learn one way you're going to learn

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.550 
learn one way you're going to learn
another<00:02:07.370> so<00:02:07.729> which<00:02:08.179> comes<00:02:08.509> down<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:08.959> thinking

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
another so which comes down to thinking

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.410 
another so which comes down to thinking
for<00:02:09.649> yourself<00:02:10.039> and<00:02:10.280> being<00:02:10.429> responsible<00:02:10.940> I

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
for yourself and being responsible I

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.990 
for yourself and being responsible I
would<00:02:12.290> say<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:12.470> lot<00:02:12.680> of<00:02:12.709> problems<00:02:13.550> people<00:02:13.730> get

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
would say a lot of problems people get

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.480 
would say a lot of problems people get
is<00:02:14.180> maybe<00:02:14.840> having<00:02:15.740> a<00:02:15.890> couple<00:02:16.160> beers<00:02:16.340> and

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
is maybe having a couple beers and

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.699 
is maybe having a couple beers and
drivin<00:02:16.820> ridin<00:02:17.390> takes<00:02:17.810> so<00:02:18.050> many<00:02:18.170> different

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
drivin ridin takes so many different

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.880 
drivin ridin takes so many different
skills<00:02:19.490> and<00:02:19.880> balances<00:02:20.750> a<00:02:20.780> big<00:02:21.080> part<00:02:21.350> of<00:02:21.410> it<00:02:21.560> and

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
skills and balances a big part of it and

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.340 
skills and balances a big part of it and
I<00:02:22.330> just<00:02:23.330> think<00:02:23.420> it's<00:02:23.600> crazy<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:23.930> drink<00:02:24.200> and

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
I just think it's crazy to drink and

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.970 
I just think it's crazy to drink and
ride

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.160 

I'm<00:02:31.849> concerned<00:02:32.269> about<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:32.629> people<00:02:32.810> getting

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
I'm concerned about it people getting

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.449 
I'm concerned about it people getting
hurt<00:02:33.319> at<00:02:33.409> the<00:02:33.470> event<00:02:33.650> all<00:02:33.769> the<00:02:33.800> time<00:02:34.040> but<00:02:34.340> I

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
hurt at the event all the time but I

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.119 
hurt at the event all the time but I
think<00:02:34.580> people<00:02:34.970> are<00:02:35.260> responsible<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.530> lot<00:02:36.920> for

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
think people are responsible a lot for

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:38.440 
think people are responsible a lot for
themselves<00:02:37.459> that<00:02:37.790> show<00:02:38.030> up<00:02:38.120> to<00:02:38.150> this<00:02:38.330> event

themselves that show up to this event

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.780 
themselves that show up to this event
it's<00:02:39.200> kind<00:02:39.379> of<00:02:39.409> designed<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:40.040> start<00:02:40.400> early<00:02:40.700> and

in trouble most of all I would say we

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.119 
in trouble most of all I would say we

wouldn't want to see anyone getting hurt

and it would make us feel terrible the

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.900 
and it would make us feel terrible the
key<00:03:06.319> is<00:03:06.440> that<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.739> partying<00:03:07.190> is<00:03:07.310> incidental

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910
