there so basically just go talk about us

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.069 
there so basically just go talk about us
again<00:03:09.849> for<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.239> actual<00:03:10.510> coordinates<00:03:10.989> you

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
again for the actual coordinates you

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:12.210 
again for the actual coordinates you
don't<00:03:11.260> know<00:03:11.379> because<00:03:11.500> that<00:03:11.709> version<00:03:11.920> does

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
don't know because that version does

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.069 
don't know because that version does
give<00:03:12.430> you<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.549> xxx<00:03:13.000> anonymous<00:03:13.629> coordinates

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
give you the xxx anonymous coordinates

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.660 
give you the xxx anonymous coordinates
and<00:03:14.290> so<00:03:14.319> you're<00:03:14.859> gonna<00:03:14.950> really<00:03:15.220> gonna<00:03:15.400> be<00:03:15.519> like

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
and so you're gonna really gonna be like

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.130 
and so you're gonna really gonna be like
what<00:03:15.879> and<00:03:16.150> so<00:03:16.329> basically<00:03:16.629> after<00:03:16.810> that<00:03:16.959> he

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
what and so basically after that he

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
need to go is that coordinate retro set

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.020 
need to go is that coordinate retro set
which<00:03:47.950> is<00:03:48.069> basically<00:03:48.250> up<00:03:48.430> here<00:03:48.609> by<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.790> rock

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
which is basically up here by the rock

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.080 
which is basically up here by the rock
the<00:03:49.269> rock<00:03:49.450> is<00:03:49.629> very<00:03:49.660> this<00:03:50.519> yeah<00:03:51.519> the<00:03:51.760> sink

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
the rock is very this yeah the sink

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.360 
the rock is very this yeah the sink
distinguishing<00:03:52.780> spot<00:03:53.079> to<00:03:53.410> this<00:03:53.500> key<00:03:53.739> area<00:03:53.980> and

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
distinguishing spot to this key area and

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.800 
distinguishing spot to this key area and
you<00:03:54.519> can<00:03:54.669> bump<00:03:54.970> in<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.180> walls<00:03:55.359> to<00:03:55.540> find<00:03:55.569> your

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
you can bump in the walls to find your

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:56.879 
you can bump in the walls to find your
way<00:03:55.900> there's<00:03:56.260> kind<00:03:56.410> of<00:03:56.470> like<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:56.620> blind<00:03:56.769> person

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
way there's kind of like a blind person

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:58.559 
way there's kind of like a blind person
you<00:03:57.489> know<00:03:57.549> fill<00:03:57.849> your<00:03:58.000> way<00:03:58.090> around<00:03:58.209> and

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
you know fill your way around and

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.629 
you know fill your way around and
basically<00:03:59.290> I<00:03:59.319> have<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.620> do<00:03:59.680> is<00:04:00.010> do<00:04:00.280> this<00:04:00.400> get

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
basically I have to do is do this get

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.970 
basically I have to do is do this get
there<00:04:00.849> and<00:04:01.060> you<00:04:01.389> can<00:04:01.629> I<00:04:01.870> guess<00:04:02.079> approach<00:04:02.739> the

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
there and you can I guess approach the

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.770 
there and you can I guess approach the
island<00:04:03.129> somewhat<00:04:03.849> and<00:04:04.000> attack<00:04:04.239> the<00:04:04.419> mobs<00:04:04.629> from

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
island somewhat and attack the mobs from

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.159 
island somewhat and attack the mobs from
there

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:05.169 
there

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:07.650 
there
but<00:04:05.530> I<00:04:05.560> wouldn't<00:04:05.859> accesed<00:04:06.699> actually<00:04:07.359> luring

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
but I wouldn't accesed actually luring

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.349 
but I wouldn't accesed actually luring
from<00:04:07.930> it<00:04:08.079> cuz<00:04:08.230> it's<00:04:08.349> not<00:04:08.530> that<00:04:08.829> good<00:04:09.069> I<00:04:09.160> guess

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
from it cuz it's not that good I guess

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.670 
from it cuz it's not that good I guess
