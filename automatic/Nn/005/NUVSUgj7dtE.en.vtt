00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
through my wardrobe I realized that my

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.700 
through my wardrobe I realized that my
water<00:03:31.790> actually<00:03:32.060> consists<00:03:32.600> of<00:03:32.660> about<00:03:33.290> seven

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
water actually consists of about seven

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.110 
water actually consists of about seven
hundred<00:03:33.830> and<00:03:34.070> twenty-two<00:03:34.310> dress<00:03:34.670> it's<00:03:34.880> black

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
hundred and twenty-two dress it's black

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.550 
hundred and twenty-two dress it's black
dresses<00:03:35.420> I've<00:03:35.720> just<00:03:35.870> got<00:03:35.990> so<00:03:36.170> many<00:03:36.320> things

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
dresses I've just got so many things

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.350

exactly<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:37.430> same<00:03:37.610> I'm<00:03:37.790> sure<00:03:37.910> everybody<00:03:38.330> does

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
exactly the same I'm sure everybody does
