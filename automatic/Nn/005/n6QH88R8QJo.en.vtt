first people say fosters can be
expensive<00:02:23.370> but<00:02:23.880> I<00:02:24.000> will<00:02:24.210> say<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.660> opposite

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
expensive but I will say the opposite

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.680 
expensive but I will say the opposite
way<00:02:25.230> it's<00:02:25.760> cheaper<00:02:26.760> because<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:27.240> don't<00:02:27.450> wear

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
way it's cheaper because you don't wear

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.810 
way it's cheaper because you don't wear
out<00:02:27.720> stuff<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.500> mean<00:02:28.680> if<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:29.340> leave<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.700> engine

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
out stuff I mean if you leave the engine

out stuff I mean if you leave the engine
and<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.240> check<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.720> oil<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:31.650> will<00:02:31.710> last

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
and you check the oil it will last

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.180 
and you check the oil it will last
forever<00:02:32.250> when<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.240> 11<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.930> 14<00:02:34.560> year<00:02:34.890> olds

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
gonna race a four-stroke anyway so it's

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.570 
gonna race a four-stroke anyway so it's
much<00:02:40.380> better<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.740> they<00:02:40.950> learn<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.370> on<00:02:41.460> a

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580
