one right here biggest this is no this
is<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.460> premise<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:24.269> Vegas<00:00:24.600> spread<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.650> the

is the premise the Vegas spread to the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.980 
is the premise the Vegas spread to the
diuretic<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.580> diaphragm<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.240> if<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.810> look

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
diuretic to the diaphragm so if you look

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.810 
diuretic to the diaphragm so if you look
here<00:00:28.199> here's<00:00:28.470> your<00:00:28.650> Vegas<00:00:28.980> coming<00:00:29.340> down<00:00:29.519> and

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
that's coming down right to there that's

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.130 
that's coming down right to there that's
phrenic<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.250> then<00:00:35.850> we<00:00:36.059> look<00:00:36.239> at<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.570> one<00:00:36.840> we

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
phrenic and then we look at this one we

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.290 
phrenic and then we look at this one we
trace<00:00:37.380> up<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.340> coming<00:00:38.640> out<00:00:38.760> off<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
trace up this is coming out off of the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.970 
trace up this is coming out off of the
plexus<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:39.960> that's<00:00:40.170> phrenic<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.640> phrenic

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
plexus so that's phrenic so phrenic

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.180 
plexus so that's phrenic so phrenic
vegas<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.450> side<00:00:45.840> we<00:00:46.200> have<00:00:46.469> Vegas<00:00:47.070> so

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
the side here that's phrenic right there

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.790 
the side here that's phrenic right there
and<00:01:00.539> they're<00:01:00.690> phrenic<00:01:01.050> actually<00:01:01.379> kind<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.649> got

and they're phrenic actually kind of got

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.359 
and they're phrenic actually kind of got
wrapped<00:01:02.070> up<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.460> around<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:03.530> friend<00:01:04.530> who

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the Vegas and the phrenic look if it's

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.870 
the Vegas and the phrenic look if it's
coming<00:01:12.960> from<00:01:13.110> up<00:01:13.799> along<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.310> neck<00:01:14.490> reason

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
coming from up along the neck reason

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.630 
coming from up along the neck reason
right<00:01:15.060> along<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.390> common<00:01:15.720> carotid<00:01:16.049> region

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
right along the common carotid region

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.980 
right along the common carotid region
that<00:01:17.640> has<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.939> be<00:01:17.970> Vegas<00:01:18.360> because<00:01:18.479> Vegas<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:18.960> a

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
that has to be Vegas because Vegas is a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.420 
that has to be Vegas because Vegas is a
cranial<00:01:19.409> nerve<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:19.710> that's<00:01:19.890> coming<00:01:20.189> from<00:01:20.220> off

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
cranial nerve so that's coming from off

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.560 
cranial nerve so that's coming from off
of<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.640> head<00:01:20.790> phrenic<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.810> also<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.939> spine<00:01:23.939> of

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
of the head phrenic is also the spine of

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.749 
of the head phrenic is also the spine of
the<00:01:24.630> cervical<00:01:25.470> plexus<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.369> it's<00:01:26.549> going<00:01:26.700> to

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
the cervical plexus so it's going to

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.179 
the cervical plexus so it's going to
come<00:01:26.939> out<00:01:27.000> kind<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.509> round<00:01:27.689> here<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.229> go<00:01:29.130> to

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
come out kind of round here and go to

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.520 
come out kind of round here and go to
the<00:01:29.310> diaphragm<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.299> these<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.200> this

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the diaphragm so in these in the in this

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.160 
the diaphragm so in these in the in this
area<00:01:32.009> right<00:01:32.189> here<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:33.090> only<00:01:33.360> two<00:01:33.570> things<00:01:33.810> that

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
area right here the only two things that

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.410 
area right here the only two things that
would<00:01:34.860> be<00:01:34.979> tagged<00:01:35.250> somewhere<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:35.880> here<00:01:36.180> would

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
would be tagged somewhere in here would

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.260 
would be tagged somewhere in here would
be<00:01:36.450> vegas<00:01:37.049> or<00:01:37.290> phrenic<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.189> if<00:01:38.670> what<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:39.000> tag

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
be vegas or phrenic and if what we tag

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.030 
be vegas or phrenic and if what we tag
you<00:01:39.479> seek<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.930> going<00:01:40.170> up<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.500> head<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.890> has

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
you seek is going up to the head it has
