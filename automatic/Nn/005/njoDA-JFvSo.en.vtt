and<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.640> moving<00:01:07.120> water<00:01:08.280> will<00:01:09.280> then<00:01:09.310> look<00:01:09.640> like

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
and the moving water will then look like

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.100 
and the moving water will then look like
this<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:11.470> main<00:01:11.620> problem<00:01:12.040> is<00:01:12.190> with<00:01:12.700> lights

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
this the main problem is with lights

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.219 
this the main problem is with lights
when<00:01:14.110> you<00:01:14.200> have<00:01:14.380> so<00:01:14.740> long<00:01:14.979> exposures<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:16.229> even

on nighttime you're gonna burn your
pictures<00:01:19.930> and<00:01:20.619> lights<00:01:21.280> will<00:01:21.610> take<00:01:22.330> over<00:01:22.570> the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
pictures and lights will take over the

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.660 
pictures and lights will take over the
whole<00:01:23.710> thing<00:01:24.210> giving<00:01:25.210> you<00:01:25.360> just<00:01:25.570> a<00:01:26.310> crappy<00:01:27.310> and

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
too much overexposed picture most

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.580 
too much overexposed picture most
photographers<00:01:32.729> will<00:01:33.729> avoid<00:01:34.000> this<00:01:34.240> problem<00:01:35.140> by

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
photographers will avoid this problem by

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.880 
photographers will avoid this problem by
using<00:01:35.619> a<00:01:35.979> neutral<00:01:36.729> density<00:01:36.759> filter<00:01:37.890> applied

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
using a neutral density filter applied

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.609 
using a neutral density filter applied
on<00:01:39.130> their<00:01:39.670> lenses<00:01:40.090> and<00:01:40.300> these<00:01:41.259> kind<00:01:41.530> of

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
on their lenses and these kind of

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.639 
on their lenses and these kind of
filters<00:01:42.450> will<00:01:43.450> lower<00:01:43.660> down<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:44.170> quantity<00:01:44.380> of

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
filters will lower down the quantity of

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.609 
filters will lower down the quantity of
light<00:01:44.860> being<00:01:45.729> impressed<00:01:46.210> on<00:01:47.200> their<00:01:47.440> pictures

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
light being impressed on their pictures

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.410 
light being impressed on their pictures
even<00:01:48.520> up<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:49.000> 9<00:01:49.510> or<00:01:49.720> 10<00:01:50.140> stops<00:01:50.500> I<00:01:51.210> guess<00:01:52.210> this

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
even up to 9 or 10 stops I guess this

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.370 
even up to 9 or 10 stops I guess this
picture<00:01:52.900> in<00:01:53.350> particular<00:01:54.040> was<00:01:54.700> taking<00:01:55.380> was

taken using empty 110 filter which is
kind<00:02:02.200> of<00:02:02.290> expensive<00:02:02.560> for<00:02:03.370> example<00:02:04.350> 67

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
kind of expensive for example 67

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.000 
kind of expensive for example 67
millimeters<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.760> 110<00:02:07.510> filter<00:02:07.930> may<00:02:08.769> cost

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010 
millimeters and the 110 filter may cost

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.820

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
because I'm not that much into landscape

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.440 
because I'm not that much into landscape
photography<00:02:17.560> so<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.370> wouldn't<00:02:18.910> use<00:02:19.030> it<00:02:19.060> that

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
photography so I wouldn't use it that

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
in this case I used the UV filter I had

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:50.250 
in this case I used the UV filter I had
and<00:02:45.299> I've<00:02:46.299> never<00:02:46.720> used<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:47.140> before<00:02:49.080> what<00:02:50.080> we're
