00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.510
 home three-dimensional objects print 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.990
 is no future vision anymore 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:14.759
 the approximately 1700 euro expensive 3d printer 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.460
 makerbot replicator 2 makes it possible 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.470
 Template for printing is a 3d model 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.789
 such models are available on the web 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.560
 chosen model will be in the 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.109
 included makerbot software 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.009
 adjusted about the size and the 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.070
 print quality 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:33.490
 then transfer it via usb or sd 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.040
 Card to 3d printer after heating up 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.260
 the printhead becomes the object layer 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.330
 for layer of thin plastic threads 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.880
 applied 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.830
 is printed with paella plastic the 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.140
 from a coil like a wire in the 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.740
 printhead and heated there 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.440
 becomes 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.780
 after application, the solidifies 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.390
 plastic then quickly here again 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.630
 recording with the thermal imaging camera 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.480
 kilograms of printing costs 37 euros 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.190
 Although there are several colors objects 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.150
 but always only one color 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.450
 to be printed 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:11.399
 a smaller object like this chain is 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.399
 finished in about a quarter of an hour 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.710
 on the cup the makerbot has 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.810
 printed for about twelve hours 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.790
 Material costs around four euros for 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.580
 Hot drinks are such objects 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.200
 Of course not suitable 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.540
 Users should be aware of many misprints 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.040
 adjust the quote was in the test 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.409
 about 50 percent 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.840
 not always the plastic replenishment works 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.030
 so that gaps in the objects arise 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.820
 The base plate must be very strong before printing 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.590
 to be aligned exactly thinner objects 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.110
 can also be difficult of the 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.179
 remove the plate without damaging it 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.130
 for patient bastler the 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.200
 makerbot be interesting today 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.880
 until such devices in every household 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.330
 but still some pass away 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.330
 years
