00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
on the video so the first thing you

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.660 
well but I think I can just go just
hinge<00:01:25.229> off<00:01:25.470> nice<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.490> simple<00:01:31.430> take<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.579> out

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
way it goes put that down there and just

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.630 
way it goes put that down there and just
take<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.290> out<00:01:55.500> back<00:01:55.770> tonight<00:01:56.130> there's<00:01:56.579> a

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
take this out back tonight there's a

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.090 
take this out back tonight there's a
little<00:01:56.790> flap<00:01:57.180> under<00:01:57.509> here<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.860> peel

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
little flap under here you have to peel

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.940 
little flap under here you have to peel
away

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.340 

as<00:02:04.950> far<00:02:05.220> as<00:02:05.250> i<00:02:05.400> know<00:02:05.670> from<00:02:06.510> looking<00:02:06.690> at<00:02:06.990> them

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
as far as i know from looking at them

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.480 
as far as i know from looking at them
John's<00:02:07.830> video<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.930> think<00:02:09.930> that<00:02:10.890> you're<00:02:11.130> just<00:02:11.160> a

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
John's video I think that you're just a

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.180 
John's video I think that you're just a
son<00:02:11.820> here<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.270> think<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.200> what<00:02:13.350> you<00:02:13.440> get<00:02:13.710> is<00:02:14.040> the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
son here I think of what you get is the

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.550 
son here I think of what you get is the
batteries<00:02:14.940> actually<00:02:15.270> inside<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:16.260> that's<00:02:16.410> one

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
batteries actually inside so that's one

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.900 
batteries actually inside so that's one
of<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.710> ways<00:02:16.800> that<00:02:16.950> reduce<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.370> packaging<00:02:17.790> is

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
of the ways that reduce the packaging is

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.720 
of the ways that reduce the packaging is
actually<00:02:18.180> by<00:02:18.300> pre-packing<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:20.070> bow<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.580> so

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
actually by pre-packing the bow is so

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.090 
actually by pre-packing the bow is so
you<00:02:20.820> can<00:02:20.940> turn<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.210> mouse<00:02:21.300> on<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:22.830> can<00:02:22.980> turn

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
you can turn the mouse on you can turn

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.680 
you can turn the mouse on you can turn
myself<00:02:23.370> for<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.820> little<00:02:23.970> switch<00:02:24.270> there<00:02:24.510> you

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
myself for that little switch there you

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.800 
myself for that little switch there you
can<00:02:24.810> see<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:25.040> there's<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.250> new<00:02:26.510> laser<00:02:27.510> as

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
can see that there's a new laser as

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.630 
can see that there's a new laser as
opposed<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.170> optic<00:02:28.530> which<00:02:29.100> is<00:02:29.250> kind<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:29.460> much

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
opposed to optic which is kind of much

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.120 
opposed to optic which is kind of much
more<00:02:29.790> precise<00:02:30.120> analyze<00:02:30.450> it's<00:02:30.630> used<00:02:30.840> more

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
more precise analyze it's used more

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.740 
more precise analyze it's used more
materials<00:02:32.130> as<00:02:32.280> your<00:02:32.460> mouse<00:02:32.610> pad<00:02:32.880> well<00:02:33.540> if<00:02:33.630> you

actually flick this done because should

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:45.740 
actually flick this done because should

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
pretty cool I believe in review of this

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.090 
pretty cool I believe in review of this
mouse<00:03:38.700> I'm<00:03:39.120> kind<00:03:39.480> of<00:03:39.540> seeing<00:03:39.780> what<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:40.620> profile

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
mouse I'm kind of seeing what a profile

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.160 
mouse I'm kind of seeing what a profile
makes<00:03:41.280> in<00:03:41.459> your<00:03:41.640> hand<00:03:41.880> how<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.600> actual<00:03:42.930> touch

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
makes in your hand how the actual touch

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.320 
makes in your hand how the actual touch
surface<00:03:43.530> works<00:03:43.709> which<00:03:43.950> gestures<00:03:44.430> you're<00:03:45.090> able

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
surface works which gestures you're able

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.360 
surface works which gestures you're able
to<00:03:45.420> use<00:03:45.540> which<00:03:45.690> ones<00:03:45.900> Iran<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:46.350> that<00:03:47.220> will<00:03:47.310> be

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
to use which ones Iran and that will be

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.680 
to use which ones Iran and that will be
on<00:03:47.489> probably<00:03:47.850> in<00:03:47.910> about<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.090> week<00:03:48.269> or<00:03:48.390> so<00:03:48.540> when

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
on probably in about a week or so when

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:49.970 
on probably in about a week or so when
I've<00:03:48.780> had<00:03:48.870> enough<00:03:48.989> time<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.290> actually<00:03:49.500> use<00:03:49.800> it

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
I've had enough time to actually use it

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.440 
I've had enough time to actually use it
and<00:03:50.280> it'll<00:03:50.550> be<00:03:50.670> interesting<00:03:50.820> to<00:03:50.970> see<00:03:51.090> how

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
and it'll be interesting to see how

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.420 
and it'll be interesting to see how
often<00:03:51.930> we<00:03:51.989> use<00:03:52.019> the<00:03:52.290> mouse<00:03:52.470> because<00:03:53.190> the

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
often we use the mouse because the

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.210 
often we use the mouse because the
actual<00:03:53.700> laptop<00:03:53.880> itself<00:03:54.330> has<00:03:54.570> a<00:03:54.600> trackpad<00:03:55.220> so

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
actual laptop itself has a trackpad so

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.770 
actual laptop itself has a trackpad so
obviously<00:03:56.940> with<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.150> added<00:03:57.390> benefit<00:03:57.750> of

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
obviously with the added benefit of

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.840 
obviously with the added benefit of
having<00:03:57.930> more<00:03:58.769> to<00:03:59.040> multi<00:03:59.280> touch<00:03:59.430> surfaces

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
having more to multi touch surfaces

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.310 
having more to multi touch surfaces
we'll<00:04:00.239> see<00:04:00.420> how<00:04:00.450> that<00:04:00.600> actually<00:04:00.870> works<00:04:01.140> out

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
we'll see how that actually works out

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.570 
we'll see how that actually works out
thanks<00:04:01.980> for<00:04:02.070> watching<00:04:02.100> take<00:04:02.850> care<00:04:03.000> bye<00:04:03.540> bye
