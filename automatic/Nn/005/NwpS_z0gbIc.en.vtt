what to do with myself

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.929 
what to do with myself
it<00:01:32.369> was<00:01:32.759> just<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.360> bad<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:34.380> pretty<00:01:35.369> much<00:01:35.520> when

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
it was just so bad so pretty much when

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.969 
it was just so bad so pretty much when
people<00:01:36.299> get<00:01:36.420> piercings<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.560> piercing

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
people get piercings and the piercing

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.679 
people get piercings and the piercing
fully<00:01:38.220> heals<00:01:38.579> that's<00:01:39.180> usually<00:01:39.540> when<00:01:39.659> people

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
fully heals that's usually when people

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.240 
fully heals that's usually when people
think<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.259> they're<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.770> clear<00:01:41.100> as<00:01:41.220> far

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250

little solution I took a bunch of q-tips

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.410 
little solution I took a bunch of q-tips
because<00:04:47.100> when<00:04:47.370> you're<00:04:47.520> cleaning<00:04:47.820> a<00:04:47.970> piercing

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
because when you're cleaning a piercing

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.540 
because when you're cleaning a piercing
you<00:04:48.930> do<00:04:49.110> not<00:04:49.290> want<00:04:49.560> to<00:04:49.620> use<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:49.890> same<00:04:50.100> q-tip

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
you do not want to use the same q-tip

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.340 
you do not want to use the same q-tip
over<00:04:50.790> and<00:04:50.910> over<00:04:51.060> again<00:04:51.150> so<00:04:51.720> I<00:04:51.750> grabbed<00:04:52.110> a<00:04:52.200> bunch

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
over and over again so I grabbed a bunch

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.230 
over and over again so I grabbed a bunch
of<00:04:52.500> little<00:04:52.650> q-tips<00:04:53.160> which<00:04:53.610> just<00:04:53.880> look<00:04:54.090> you

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
of little q-tips which just look you

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.210 
of little q-tips which just look you
know<00:04:54.360> like<00:04:54.660> this<00:04:54.870> like<00:04:55.050> a<00:04:55.080> q-tip<00:04:55.380> and<00:04:55.800> then

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
know like this like a q-tip and then

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.430 
know like this like a q-tip and then
what<00:04:56.340> I<00:04:56.370> did<00:04:56.490> is<00:04:56.670> I<00:04:56.850> got<00:04:56.880> in<00:04:57.240> there<00:04:57.480> you<00:04:58.290> know<00:04:58.410> I

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
what I did is I got in there you know I

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.350 
what I did is I got in there you know I
got<00:04:58.650> it<00:04:58.770> nice<00:04:58.890> and<00:04:58.950> what<00:04:59.340> and<00:04:59.730> then<00:05:00.090> what<00:05:00.210> I<00:05:00.240> did

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
got it nice and what and then what I did

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.290 
got it nice and what and then what I did
is<00:05:00.750> I<00:05:00.930> cleaned<00:05:01.490> kind<00:05:02.490> of<00:05:02.550> like<00:05:02.760> going<00:05:03.030> in<00:05:03.150> like

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
is I cleaned kind of like going in like

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.780 
is I cleaned kind of like going in like
little<00:05:03.510> circular<00:05:03.810> motions<00:05:04.430> around<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:05.550> top

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
little circular motions around the top

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.090 
little circular motions around the top
then<00:05:06.390> I<00:05:06.420> would<00:05:06.660> switch<00:05:07.020> sides<00:05:07.350> go<00:05:07.740> to<00:05:07.830> this

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
then I would switch sides go to this

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.790 
then I would switch sides go to this
clean<00:05:08.430> side<00:05:08.730> you<00:05:09.450> know<00:05:09.570> get<00:05:09.990> it<00:05:10.110> wet<00:05:10.260> again<00:05:10.530> and

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
clean side you know get it wet again and

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.860 
clean side you know get it wet again and
then<00:05:11.130> I<00:05:11.190> would<00:05:11.400> take<00:05:11.640> my<00:05:11.820> ear<00:05:12.030> very<00:05:12.240> carefully

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
then I would take my ear very carefully

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.870 
then I would take my ear very carefully
kind<00:05:13.530> of<00:05:13.590> go<00:05:13.680> like<00:05:13.710> this<00:05:14.070> and<00:05:14.370> just<00:05:14.400> go<00:05:14.610> around

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
kind of go like this and just go around

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.820 
kind of go like this and just go around
I<00:05:15.330> do<00:05:15.600> have<00:05:16.110> a<00:05:16.380> little<00:05:16.770> bit<00:05:16.950> of<00:05:17.220> um<00:05:17.760> and

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
I do have a little bit of um and

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.080 
I do have a little bit of um and
especially<00:05:19.830> in<00:05:20.130> the<00:05:20.220> back<00:05:20.430> it<00:05:20.730> is<00:05:20.760> still<00:05:21.060> a

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
especially in the back it is still a

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.520 
especially in the back it is still a
little<00:05:21.300> bit<00:05:21.510> tender<00:05:21.720> so<00:05:22.020> I'm<00:05:22.080> just<00:05:22.260> trying<00:05:22.410> to

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
little bit tender so I'm just trying to

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.830 
little bit tender so I'm just trying to
be<00:05:22.650> really<00:05:22.920> careful<00:05:23.090> still<00:05:24.090> wandering<00:05:24.630> this

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
be really careful still wandering this

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.720 
be really careful still wandering this
video<00:05:25.110> but<00:05:25.620> pretty<00:05:25.860> much<00:05:25.920> what<00:05:26.070> I<00:05:26.310> did<00:05:26.490> is<00:05:26.640> I

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
video but pretty much what I did is I

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.670 
video but pretty much what I did is I
just<00:05:27.000> cleaned<00:05:27.330> the<00:05:27.750> back<00:05:27.930> of<00:05:28.140> it<00:05:28.230> really<00:05:28.410> well

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
just cleaned the back of it really well

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.410 
just cleaned the back of it really well
as<00:05:28.860> well<00:05:29.040> then<00:05:29.490> I<00:05:29.520> would<00:05:29.730> throw<00:05:29.880> the<00:05:30.060> keys<00:05:30.240> away

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
as well then I would throw the keys away

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.060 
as well then I would throw the keys away
you<00:05:30.870> definitely<00:05:31.320> do<00:05:31.470> not<00:05:31.500> want<00:05:31.620> to<00:05:31.800> use<00:05:31.920> the

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
you definitely do not want to use the

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.820 
you definitely do not want to use the
same<00:05:32.280> q-tip<00:05:32.700> over<00:05:33.360> and<00:05:33.480> over<00:05:33.660> so<00:05:34.260> after<00:05:34.560> I<00:05:34.590> did

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
same q-tip over and over so after I did

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.130 
same q-tip over and over so after I did
that<00:05:34.860> what<00:05:35.580> I<00:05:35.610> did<00:05:35.880> is<00:05:35.970> I<00:05:36.060> created<00:05:36.120> my<00:05:36.630> sea<00:05:36.870> salt

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
that what I did is I created my sea salt

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.470 
that what I did is I created my sea salt

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
salt pace for keloids I noticed

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.110 
salt pace for keloids I noticed
piercings<00:05:46.740> pretty<00:05:47.460> much<00:05:47.610> what<00:05:47.760> I<00:05:47.820> did<00:05:47.910> is<00:05:47.970> I

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
piercings pretty much what I did is I

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.240 
piercings pretty much what I did is I
just<00:05:48.150> took<00:05:48.360> sea<00:05:48.630> salt<00:05:48.870> on<00:05:48.960> a<00:05:49.020> spoon<00:05:49.320> took<00:05:50.040> some

just took sea salt on a spoon took some

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.220 
just took sea salt on a spoon took some
water<00:05:50.490> and<00:05:50.760> I<00:05:50.820> made<00:05:51.000> like<00:05:51.180> a<00:05:51.330> little<00:05:51.570> paste<00:05:51.870> and

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.230 
water and I made like a little paste and

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:53.750 
water and I made like a little paste and
when<00:05:52.380> I<00:05:52.410> did<00:05:52.620> is<00:05:52.710> I<00:05:52.830> took<00:05:52.890> that<00:05:53.220> pace<00:05:53.430> and<00:05:53.700> I

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
when I did is I took that pace and I

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.640 
when I did is I took that pace and I
applied<00:05:54.060> it<00:05:54.240> to<00:05:54.270> the<00:05:54.450> back<00:05:54.660> of<00:05:54.960> my<00:05:54.990> piercing

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
applied it to the back of my piercing

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.340 
applied it to the back of my piercing
which<00:05:56.160> is<00:05:56.340> where<00:05:56.730> it<00:05:56.880> hurt<00:05:57.090> the<00:05:57.270> most<00:05:57.300> so<00:05:58.170> yeah

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
which is where it hurt the most so yeah

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.320 
which is where it hurt the most so yeah
that's<00:05:58.620> where<00:05:58.830> I<00:05:58.890> applied<00:05:59.520> it<00:05:59.730> and<00:05:59.850> I<00:05:59.910> left<00:06:00.150> it

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
that's where I applied it and I left it

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.040 
that's where I applied it and I left it
on<00:06:00.390> for<00:06:00.450> maybe<00:06:01.140> 20<00:06:02.040> minutes<00:06:02.160> I<00:06:02.780> rinsed<00:06:03.780> it<00:06:03.870> off

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
on for maybe 20 minutes I rinsed it off

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.500 
on for maybe 20 minutes I rinsed it off
and<00:06:04.380> then<00:06:04.530> this<00:06:05.430> probably<00:06:05.790> seems<00:06:06.000> like<00:06:06.210> a<00:06:06.240> lot

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
and then this probably seems like a lot

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.540 
and then this probably seems like a lot
