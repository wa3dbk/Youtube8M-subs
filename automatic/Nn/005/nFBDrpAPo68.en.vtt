at three inches and this is a four by
four<00:00:57.539> box<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:59.480> you<00:01:00.480> have<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.809> go<00:01:00.930> three<00:01:01.559> inches

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
four box so you have to go three inches

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.280 
four box so you have to go three inches
for<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.489> scoring<00:01:02.910> by<00:01:03.059> four<00:01:03.359> inches<00:01:03.719> by<00:01:03.989> three

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
for the scoring by four inches by three

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.190 
for the scoring by four inches by three
inches<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.890> that's<00:01:05.100> ten<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.630> piece<00:01:06.990> of

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
inches and that's ten so this piece of

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.960 
inches and that's ten so this piece of
paper<00:01:08.119> you<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.150> see<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.869> ten<00:01:10.650> by<00:01:10.860> ten<00:01:11.189> then

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
paper you can see it is ten by ten then

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.690 
paper you can see it is ten by ten then
I<00:01:12.090> scored<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.630> at<00:01:12.750> three<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.439> all<00:01:13.860> sides<00:01:14.280> and

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
I scored it at three on all sides and

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.010 
I scored it at three on all sides and
that<00:01:15.390> would<00:01:15.540> make<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.930> three<00:01:16.350> inches<00:01:16.530> high<00:01:16.979> and

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
that would make it three inches high and

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.200 
that would make it three inches high and
then<00:01:19.020> it'd<00:01:19.439> be<00:01:19.560> four<00:01:19.830> by<00:01:19.979> four<00:01:20.189> before<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.030> so

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
then it'd be four by four before and so

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.630 
then it'd be four by four before and so
what<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.479> do<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.630> make<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.110> box<00:01:22.460> is<00:01:23.990> you<00:01:25.640> get

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
what you do to make this box is you get

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.100 
what you do to make this box is you get
a<00:01:26.670> piece<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:27.030> paper<00:01:27.150> ten<00:01:27.570> by<00:01:27.750> ten<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:29.960> score<00:01:30.960> it

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
a piece of paper ten by ten and score it

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.999 
a piece of paper ten by ten and score it
on<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.670> sides<00:01:32.970> by<00:01:33.390> three<00:01:33.780> on<00:01:34.020> each<00:01:34.350> side<00:01:34.710> and

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
on the sides by three on each side and

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.690 
on the sides by three on each side and
then<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.970> cut<00:01:36.210> these<00:01:36.420> two<00:01:36.689> ends<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.579> go

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
then you cut these two ends and you go

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.580 
then you cut these two ends and you go
like<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.450> how<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.720> always<00:01:39.810> make

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
like this and this is how I always make

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.749 
like this and this is how I always make
a<00:01:40.619> box<00:01:40.890> after<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:43.070> fold<00:01:44.070> these<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.310> really

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
a box after you fold these in really

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:45.980 
a box after you fold these in really
good<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.479> these<00:01:45.600> are<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.780> two

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
good this is that these are the two

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.700 
good this is that these are the two
sides<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.470> adhere<00:01:47.329> okay<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.780> then<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.560> make

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
sides you adhere okay and then to make

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.870 
sides you adhere okay and then to make
the<00:01:49.890> lid<00:01:51.049> it's<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> little<00:01:52.320> bit<00:01:52.439> trickier<00:01:53.040> this

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the lid it's a little bit trickier this

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.850 
the lid it's a little bit trickier this
lid<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.630> four<00:01:55.409> inches<00:01:55.829> by<00:01:56.040> 1/8<00:01:56.810> inch<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.320> four

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
lid is four inches by 1/8 inch and four

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.609 
lid is four inches by 1/8 inch and four
inches<00:01:59.070> by<00:01:59.250> 1/8<00:01:59.790> inch<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.079> fits<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.500> there

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
inches by 1/8 inch so it fits on there

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.179 
inches by 1/8 inch so it fits on there
perfectly<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.280> could<00:02:02.399> also<00:02:02.549> do<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.820> by<00:02:02.939> 1/16

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
perfectly you could also do it by 1/16

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.100 
perfectly you could also do it by 1/16
but<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.219> find<00:02:05.520> 1/8<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.090> really<00:02:06.390> well<00:02:06.570> works

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
but I find 1/8 is really well works

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.080 
but I find 1/8 is really well works
really<00:02:07.290> well<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.099> then<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.280> only<00:02:08.610> score

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
really well and I and then I only score

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.630 
really well and I and then I only score
it<00:02:09.209> about<00:02:09.479> an<00:02:09.629> inch<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:10.379> think<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.770> did<00:02:10.920> 3/4<00:02:11.520> an

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
it about an inch I think I did 3/4 an

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.400 
it about an inch I think I did 3/4 an
inch<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.780> this<00:02:12.930> makes<00:02:13.140> a

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
inch so this makes a

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.710 
inch so this makes a
little<00:02:13.560> bit<00:02:13.710> harder<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:14.220> have<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.400> go<00:02:14.720> 3/4

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
little bit harder you have to go 3/4

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.150 
little bit harder you have to go 3/4
inch<00:02:15.990> +<00:02:16.740> 4<00:02:17.070> +<00:02:17.220> 8<00:02:17.370> +<00:02:17.760> 3/4<00:02:18.600> inch<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.260> then<00:02:19.890> that's

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
inch + 4 + 8 + 3/4 inch and then that's

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.970 
inch + 4 + 8 + 3/4 inch and then that's
how<00:02:20.370> big<00:02:20.520> your<00:02:20.670> piece<00:02:20.820> of<00:02:21.000> paper<00:02:21.180> is<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.980> then

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
how big your piece of paper is and then

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.720 
how big your piece of paper is and then
you<00:02:23.130> score<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.640> at<00:02:24.140> 3/4<00:02:25.140> on<00:02:25.260> each<00:02:25.380> side<00:02:25.710> make<00:02:26.700> a

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
you score it at 3/4 on each side make a

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.130 
you score it at 3/4 on each side make a
little<00:02:27.030> box<00:02:27.210> and<00:02:27.450> I<00:02:27.570> did<00:02:27.780> it

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
little box and I did it

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.680 
little box and I did it
in<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.980> orange<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:29.700> then<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.090> did<00:02:30.270> it<00:02:30.390> in<00:02:30.510> this

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
in the orange and then I did it in this

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.090 
in the orange and then I did it in this
black<00:02:31.110> paper<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:31.910> this<00:02:32.990> was<00:02:33.990> a<00:02:34.020> white<00:02:34.350> box<00:02:34.620> and

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
black paper and this was a white box and

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.660 
black paper and this was a white box and
then<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.670> just<00:02:35.910> cut<00:02:36.210> cut<00:02:36.840> this<00:02:37.020> a<00:02:37.490> little<00:02:38.490> less

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
then I just cut cut this a little less

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.550 
then I just cut cut this a little less
than<00:02:38.970> 3<00:02:39.300> so<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.540> could<00:02:39.780> have<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:39.930> little<00:02:40.140> border

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
than 3 so I could have a little border

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.370 
than 3 so I could have a little border
at<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.740> bottom<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.400> then<00:02:42.210> I<00:02:42.300> just<00:02:42.510> adhered

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
at the bottom and then I just adhered

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.500 
at the bottom and then I just adhered
that<00:02:43.470> around<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:43.980> sides<00:02:44.250> then<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.240> tied<00:02:45.480> it

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
that around the sides then I tied it

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.030 
that around the sides then I tied it
with<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:45.750> bow<00:02:46.020> and<00:02:46.350> then<00:02:47.040> this<00:02:47.190> top<00:02:47.490> part<00:02:47.790> I

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
with a bow and then this top part I

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.310 
with a bow and then this top part I
folded<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:51.000> piece<00:02:51.210> of<00:02:51.390> orange<00:02:51.600> paper<00:02:51.840> in<00:02:52.110> half

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
folded the piece of orange paper in half

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.160 
folded the piece of orange paper in half
and<00:02:52.620> then<00:02:53.490> I<00:02:53.580> punched<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.570> punched<00:02:54.960> it

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
and then I punched it and I punched it

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.910 
and then I punched it and I punched it
right<00:02:55.910> like<00:02:56.910> this<00:02:57.110> so<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:58.140> could<00:02:58.290> make<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:58.740> into

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
right like this so I could make it into

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.560 
right like this so I could make it into
a<00:02:59.070> card<00:02:59.340> so<00:02:59.520> yeah<00:02:59.640> there's<00:02:59.820> a<00:02:59.880> tiny<00:03:00.240> bit<00:03:00.420> of

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
a card so yeah there's a tiny bit of

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.020 
a card so yeah there's a tiny bit of
that<00:03:00.660> fold<00:03:01.110> at<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.500> top<00:03:01.710> I<00:03:02.010> think<00:03:02.580> I<00:03:02.670> even<00:03:02.700> got

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
that fold at the top I think I even got

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.060 
that fold at the top I think I even got
a<00:03:03.060> tiny<00:03:03.450> tiny<00:03:03.810> tiny<00:03:04.080> bit<00:03:04.820> of<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.900> orange<00:03:07.830> at

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
a tiny tiny tiny bit of the orange at

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.330 
a tiny tiny tiny bit of the orange at
the<00:03:08.160> top<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:09.000> like<00:03:09.150> that<00:03:09.830> then<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:10.920> can<00:03:10.950> punch

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
the top so like that then you can punch

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.830 
the top so like that then you can punch
it<00:03:11.580> it's<00:03:11.880> a<00:03:11.940> little<00:03:12.000> bit<00:03:12.120> hard<00:03:12.420> because<00:03:12.570> it's

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
it it's a little bit hard because it's

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.710 
it it's a little bit hard because it's
folded<00:03:13.350> so<00:03:13.530> you're<00:03:13.650> doing<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.250> same

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
folded so you're doing to it the same

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.020 
folded so you're doing to it the same
then<00:03:15.720> after<00:03:15.960> you<00:03:16.050> punch<00:03:16.320> it<00:03:16.670> it<00:03:17.670> looks<00:03:17.850> like

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
then after you punch it it looks like

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.560 
then after you punch it it looks like
that

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
that

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.310 
that
and<00:03:18.720> then<00:03:19.320> I<00:03:19.410> just<00:03:20.750> punched<00:03:21.750> two<00:03:21.900> little<00:03:22.140> holes

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
and then I just punched two little holes

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.440 
and then I just punched two little holes
in<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.650> top<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:25.730> punched<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.850> black<00:03:27.120> out

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
in the top and I punched the black out

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.660 
in the top and I punched the black out
of<00:03:28.190> 1<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.400> 3/4<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.270> then<00:03:31.110> after<00:03:31.830> I<00:03:31.860> stamped<00:03:32.250> my

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
of 1 and 3/4 and then after I stamped my

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.630 
of 1 and 3/4 and then after I stamped my
image<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.420> I<00:03:33.750> punched<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.410> out<00:03:34.470> of<00:03:34.650> 1<00:03:34.860> and<00:03:35.100> 3/8

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
image I I punched it out of 1 and 3/8

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.880 
image I I punched it out of 1 and 3/8
and<00:03:35.940> that's<00:03:36.930> how<00:03:37.110> you<00:03:37.170> get<00:03:37.350> that<00:03:37.560> cute<00:03:37.800> little
