00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.810
 all right 

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.620
 Y 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.220
 all right 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.220
 okay 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.340
 here 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.340
 all right 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.840
 greetings and welcome my name is 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.440
 raquel this is the design in which we go 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.600
 to be working now let's start I'll 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.340
 to be of showing them this art in a 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.380
 nail cuts as you can see by comparison 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.750
 with a long nail as it is the scale of 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.760
 a short nail first I started by applying 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.790
 a glaze in red on the whole 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.520
 nail and I'm using this in style 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.980
 which is called as well as I'm working 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.840
 in a short nail I will make the design 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.330
 of leopard coming to the side 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.460
 then it's basically what you can 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.850
 do with a short nail and nothing else 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.950
 fill it with the beige color to this 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.530
 side and that's where the 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.809
 leopard pattern now nothing else I'm going to 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.770
 start painting the spots 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.149
 leopard 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.149
 on the side of the nail 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.400
 and in certain areas in the corners 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:15.300
 I'm going to outline with the black color nothing 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.070
 more detailing the leopard spots 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.290
 and they could also use any 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.080
 color that you would like as a base 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.630
 it should not be red now in between 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.750
 I'm going to do nothing more spots in color 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.930
 black a thing like that is that everything is due 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.180
 make a smaller scale 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.970
 followed by this I will be dividing 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.660
 the red color of beige with a 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.640
 gold-colored line with glitters 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.190
 using acrylic paint for this 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.740
 now it's time to paint a little flower 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.860
 and I'm making each petal in the shape of 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.260
 almond and this little flower is going to be 5 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.940
 petals could also make it 6 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.390
 petals but remember that as it is a 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.220
 short nail becomes smaller towards 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.860
 above the flower coming to the side 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.440
 I'm going to paint a little flower with 3 petals 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.590
 and these petals are even more 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.650
 little ones now in the area below 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.600
 the flower I will paint another flower 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:16.570
 little girl with 3 petals and underneath 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.480
 little flower I will paint 4 dots 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.550
 using a small pointer in the center 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.530
 I'm going to put more of the gold-colored glitters 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.900
 that are applied opaque but dry 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.030
 bright and that's all nothing more 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.920
 Apply your shine coat as they could 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.110
 see if they have short nails they can do 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.090

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.370
 Long nail work well for your nails
