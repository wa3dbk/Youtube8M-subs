something and just because paid

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.649 
something and just because paid
applications<00:01:53.729> are<00:01:53.939> better<00:01:54.180> doesn't<00:01:54.509> mean

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
applications are better doesn't mean

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.060 
applications are better doesn't mean
that<00:01:56.060> this<00:01:57.060> game<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.390> bad<00:01:57.719> if<00:01:58.020> you're<00:01:58.560> looking

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
that this game is bad if you're looking

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.219 
that this game is bad if you're looking

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
if you're comparing it to hate

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.749 
if you're comparing it to hate
implications<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.920> course<00:02:02.159> it's<00:02:02.340> not<00:02:02.369> disc

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
implications of course it's not disc

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.999 
implications of course it's not disc
that<00:02:03.119> good<00:02:03.390> but<00:02:04.200> if<00:02:04.350> you're<00:02:04.469> comparing<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:04.979> to

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
that good but if you're comparing it to

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.800 
that good but if you're comparing it to
other<00:02:05.130> free<00:02:05.549> applications<00:02:06.030> it's<00:02:06.180> not<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.479> bad

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
other free applications it's not a bad

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.650 
other free applications it's not a bad

and<00:02:22.930> test<00:02:23.050> it<00:02:23.170> out<00:02:23.290> as<00:02:23.590> it's<00:02:23.830> free<00:02:24.220> if<00:02:24.600> it

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
and test it out as it's free if it

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.809 
and test it out as it's free if it
should<00:02:25.959> cost<00:02:26.200> something<00:02:26.440> what<00:02:26.709> I'm<00:02:27.520> not<00:02:27.670> sure

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
should cost something what I'm not sure

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.360 
should cost something what I'm not sure
guys<00:02:28.360> I'm<00:02:28.630> if<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.440> should<00:02:29.560> cost<00:02:29.920> something<00:02:30.160> I

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
guys I'm if it should cost something I

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.559 
guys I'm if it should cost something I
would<00:02:30.489> give<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:30.730> out<00:02:30.819> one<00:02:31.120> out<00:02:31.150> of<00:02:31.420> five

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
would give it out one out of five

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.970 
would give it out one out of five
because<00:02:31.959> it's<00:02:32.110> just<00:02:32.220> horrible<00:02:33.220> for<00:02:34.000> money

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
because it's just horrible for money

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.140 
because it's just horrible for money
because<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.340> paid<00:02:36.550> apps<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:36.940> a<00:02:36.970> few

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
because the paid apps and a few

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.170 
because the paid apps and a few
applications<00:02:38.100> clearly<00:02:39.100> have<00:02:39.370> many

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
applications clearly have many

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.100 
applications clearly have many
differences<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:41.520> I<00:02:42.520> would<00:02:43.330> prefer<00:02:43.569> paid

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
differences and I would prefer paid

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.660 
differences and I would prefer paid
application<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.800> this<00:02:44.920> of<00:02:45.040> course<00:02:45.069> because

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
application to this of course because

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.470 
application to this of course because
the<00:02:46.510> quality<00:02:46.660> is<00:02:46.900> just<00:02:47.200> better<00:02:48.090> but<00:02:49.090> well<00:02:49.300> you
