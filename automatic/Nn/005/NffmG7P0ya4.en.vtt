00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.610
 hi friends from youtube les bains ya 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:09.299
 a few tricks of minecraft because 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.789
 dedicate and perfect let's go to 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:15.139
 minecraft directly and I'm going to 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:15.139
 teach this 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.170
 Well this is the first trick that 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:25.510
 they call the flying ones this is simply 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.510
 easy quick and simple 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:34.260
 the joke is that those flying aunts 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:39.289
 as females I put one 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.289
 and we're going to take it off we put flowers 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.320
 Y 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.210
 perfect 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.800
 ah 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.220
 Y 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.380
 and as you can see here are the tracks 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.250
 I will also teach you 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.280
 something that can also be carried out 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:25.690
 well we can grab an allianz or 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:29.360
 you can just take it good 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.340
 this is also would work also with 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.050
 the flying sails we do the same 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:41.990
 procedure and it is a design that would be 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:44.590
 the design for my house and for this 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.600
 call the secret door 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.600
 as you can see here 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:58.570
 As you can see we passed like this trick 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:04.440
 so easy, this trick is so easy 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.440
 It's so simple, we're not going to do it 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.560
 or we are going to remove it because we are going to 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.209
 put a box on it that has two 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:17.990
 and the last trick will be to grab two 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:20.810
 pigs that are big and a carrot 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.480
 the joke is that as you can not 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.850
 feed on android then we're going to 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.250
 put only the pig like that and they will see 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.750
 what brings out hearts and also like that for 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:37.310
 that do not have a child as you can see 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:40.070
 here he had a son as you can see that 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.989
 It also works with cows but nothing 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.989
 more in the casualties 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.230
 works with straw 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.980
 where is 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.890
 with them 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:36.230
 and good
