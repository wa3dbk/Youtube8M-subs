00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.639
 hello to all of you guys like maris chi vi 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.829
 speak and today we are who with the review 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:15.849
 of a wireless gaming mouse product 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:18.060
 by for hicks the mx 3200 the only mouse from 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.529
 wireless home gaming for hicks 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.810
 since wireless costs a bit more 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.679
 compared to other mice produced by da 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.400
 their 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:29.800
 the price is 55 euros price that is not 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.839
 so exaggerated given that with the mo 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.580
 a base is provided that works from 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:37.780
 receiver for the signal that sends the 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.280
 mouse and also by charger if desired 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.590
 we can also attach the cable to the 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.300
 mouse if by chance it is not loaded 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.150
 enough and we need urgently 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.890
 to use it 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.600
 here there is also a system that 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.150
 he holds his head to prevent it from happening 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.220
 belly deadlifts use it 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.040
 the base is rather compact compared to 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:00.370
 other solutions on the market ed 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.740
 even a nice design the mouse is 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.750
 quite light and unfortunately not there 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.350
 we are going to adjust the weight is seen 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.750
 the price would have been nice to have it on 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.140
 body is symmetrical so it's okay either 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.030
 for right- handed who is left-handed looking at the 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.130
 mouse laterally we notice that it is not 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.140
 so high 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.130
 unfortunately the side parts are not 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.110
 rubber coated 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.200
 which I think would improve the 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.260
 stability and grip on the left side 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.500
 we find four additional buttons with 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:36.310
 a rather unusual shape and seem 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.470
 quite well reachable in the part 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.650
 higher we find the two classic clicks 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.890
 left and right is a linen art 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:48.580
 then there are three more fluid ones 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.040
 one buttons to increase the dpi one by 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.340
 decrease them and the other to turn on and 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.040
 turn off the mouse illumination 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.650
 let's move on to the bottom here 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.840
 we find the two contacts through i 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.670
 which will be attached to the base for the 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.810
 recharge 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.479
 then we find two laser sensors 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.520
 the first is a normal three-mulled matchmaker 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.590
 reds that can be used in the 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.020
 energy saving mode for 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.110
 make the battery last longer 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.020
 the second one is the gaming one 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:26.900
 a very precise sensor that goes 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:28.640
 from 90 to 5,040 dpa we find more above it 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.610
 switch to set the mode of 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:36.019
 Energy-saving charging is 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.630
 the gaming driver is the driver 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:41.239
 supplied with the mouse is very simple 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.850
 too much though the main things 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.160
 we can set all we can 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.260
 program all the buttons separately 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.349
 those to settle for pm for the 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.099
 brightness so five out of eight are 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.420
 programmable 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:57.260
 then we can adjust the various levels of 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.900
 pil 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.900
 the frequency and the various speeds 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.470
 trying it on different videogames you are 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.900
 revealed quite precise almost like 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.359
 a wire mouse and it's also pretty 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.600
 comfortable even though I'm more used to 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:17.030
 higher mice and I prefer them being 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.459
 that I have large enough second hands 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.380
 me those are a little more comfortable ones 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.360
 higher that allow us better 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.460
 hold then 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.800
 it is a subjective datum go from person to 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.240
 person the 4 side buttons 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.250
 strangely, they are easily 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.560
 reachable at first sight does not 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.180
 they seemed but once used for 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.080
 a few days you realize that in 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.930
 I'm actually in a good position 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.270
 let's see the final considerations 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.390
 how good are we 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:51.390
 base that is not very bulky e 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:55.020
 works both the battery charger that it is from 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:59.490
 320 tore then we have a good sensor that 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:03.330
 it goes from 90 to 5,040 dpa we also have a 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:06.180
 beautiful design of both the mouse and the base 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.920
 we also have an internal battery thing 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.080
 very important because in most 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.060
 part of wireless mice 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.790
 there is no internal battery 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.350
 those you buy separately that up 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.980
 rechargeable or classic ones 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:24.030
 duracell those four avon I have not well 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:27.810
 present as like the series this 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.550
 unfortunately involves an additional expense 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.090
 however, there are also some aspects 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.370
 negative 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.740
 the quality of the material mat is not 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.050
 just the best 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:41.340
 the software for the configuration is 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:45.390
 can be improved offers few things and is not 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.900
 very intuitive then there is no system 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.790
 of weight regulation 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.640
 in conclusion it is a wireless mouse 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.190
 quite good although there are others 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.850
 good alternatives on the market of course 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:03.440
 spending more at around â‚¬ 15 more 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.970
 there is the logitech of 602 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.950
 in my opinion it deserves recognition 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.020
 to the best design for the design really 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:14.010
 nice to see that from the mouse an effect 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:16.380
 metallic i hope this review there 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.210
 both liked and was useful 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.190
 been so remember to leave me 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.090
 like is a comment on what you think 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.460
 of this mouse 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.460
 we'll see you in the next video
