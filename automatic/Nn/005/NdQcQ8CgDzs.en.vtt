well<00:03:51.970> I<00:03:52.359> believe<00:03:53.879> it<00:03:54.879> all<00:03:55.150> goes<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.840> same

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
well I believe it all goes the same

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.759 
well I believe it all goes the same
whether<00:03:56.859> we<00:03:57.160> are<00:03:57.340> training<00:03:58.090> horses<00:03:58.769> training

running a company running an army or
running<00:04:07.030> the<00:04:07.180> country<00:04:07.389> it's<00:04:07.989> all<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.650> same

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
running the country it's all the same

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:12.409 
running the country it's all the same
principle<00:04:09.579> and<00:04:10.120> I<00:04:10.239> believe<00:04:10.629> love<00:04:11.260> and

add<00:04:16.630> to<00:04:16.900> that<00:04:17.049> exercise<00:04:17.910> exercise<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:19.180> horse

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
add to that exercise exercise the horse

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.810 
add to that exercise exercise the horse
needs<00:04:19.780> and<00:04:20.079> have<00:04:20.199> exercise<00:04:20.829> and<00:04:21.160> children

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
and consistency and exercise I think we

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.290 
and consistency and exercise I think we
can<00:04:28.510> build<00:04:28.690> it<00:04:28.840> all<00:04:28.960> a<00:04:28.990> man<00:04:29.910> one<00:04:30.910> of<00:04:30.940> the<00:04:31.150> other

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
can build it all a man one of the other

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.659 
can build it all a man one of the other
