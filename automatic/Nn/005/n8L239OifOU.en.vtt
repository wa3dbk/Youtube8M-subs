00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
I've been geocaching for a while now and

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.220 
I've been geocaching for a while now and
I<00:00:16.289> was<00:00:17.250> starting<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.580> get<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.789> little<00:00:17.940> bit<00:00:18.240> bored

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
I was starting to get a little bit bored

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.320 
I was starting to get a little bit bored
of<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.590> same<00:00:19.619> predictable<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.699> know<00:00:20.970> lunch

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
of the same predictable you know lunch

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.820 
of the same predictable you know lunch
boxes<00:00:21.900> with<00:00:22.199> log<00:00:22.500> books<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.480> and<00:00:24.650> things<00:00:25.650> are

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
boxes with log books and and things are

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.380 
boxes with log books and and things are
stuck<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.160> actually<00:00:26.310> thought<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.060> would

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
stuck so I actually thought that I would

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.889 
stuck so I actually thought that I would
make<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:28.220> geocache<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:31.250> this<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:33.390> bought

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
make a geocache and this is it I bought

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.229 
make a geocache and this is it I bought
this<00:00:34.079> on<00:00:34.260> eBay<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:35.309> doesn't<00:00:35.670> it's<00:00:35.850> not<00:00:35.940> labeled

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
this on eBay it doesn't it's not labeled

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.430 
this on eBay it doesn't it's not labeled
as<00:00:38.180> specifically<00:00:39.180> for<00:00:39.570> geocaching<00:00:39.840> it's

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
as specifically for geocaching it's

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.510 
as specifically for geocaching it's
described<00:00:40.950> as<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.280> children's<00:00:42.180> magic<00:00:42.690> box<00:00:43.520> but

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
described as a children's magic box but

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.490 
described as a children's magic box but
I<00:00:44.550> actually<00:00:44.700> thought<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.809> would<00:00:45.960> be<00:00:46.170> an

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
I actually thought that it would be an

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.010 
I actually thought that it would be an
interesting<00:00:47.460> hide<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.360> because<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.780> its

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
interesting hide and because of its

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.479 
interesting hide and because of its
color<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:50.399> fact<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.730> looks<00:00:50.879> like<00:00:51.059> wood<00:00:52.489> it

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
color and the fact it looks like wood it

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.010 
color and the fact it looks like wood it
would<00:00:53.610> be<00:00:53.730> quite<00:00:53.940> easy<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.270> hide<00:00:54.539> as<00:00:54.780> well<00:00:55.399> so

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
would be quite easy to hide as well so

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.180 
would be quite easy to hide as well so
yeah<00:00:58.020> just<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.559> front<00:00:58.800> there<00:00:58.980> I've<00:00:59.160> just

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
box now just here if you pull this just

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.249 
box now just here if you pull this just
quite<00:01:46.740> easily<00:01:46.950> comes<00:01:47.460> out<00:01:47.990> there's<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.110> little

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
quite easily comes out there's a little

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.810 
quite easily comes out there's a little
draw<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.009> think<00:01:50.280> you've<00:01:50.399> got<00:01:50.579> it

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
draw and you think you've got it

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.740 
draw and you think you've got it
actually<00:01:51.360> inside<00:01:52.520> it<00:01:53.520> says<00:01:53.820> not<00:01:54.090> quite<00:01:54.390> try

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
actually inside it says not quite try

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.190 
actually inside it says not quite try
again<00:01:55.729> so<00:01:56.750> you<00:01:57.750> put<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.049> back<00:01:58.229> and<00:02:00.200> further

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
again so you put it back and further

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.590 
again so you put it back and further
along<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:02.460> might<00:02:02.610> be<00:02:02.790> starting<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.420> pull

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
along you might be starting to pull

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.950 
along you might be starting to pull
other<00:02:03.780> pit<00:02:04.170> bits<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.670> here<00:02:05.969> there<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.930> a

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
other pit bits and just here there is a

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.380 
other pit bits and just here there is a
little<00:02:07.259> secret<00:02:07.680> panel<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.700> comes<00:02:08.970> out<00:02:09.179> like

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
little secret panel it comes out like

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.090 
little secret panel it comes out like
that<00:02:10.250> this<00:02:11.250> still<00:02:11.550> doesn't<00:02:11.760> do<00:02:12.000> anything

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
that this still doesn't do anything

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.670 
that this still doesn't do anything
you<00:02:13.460> still<00:02:13.760> can't<00:02:14.030> open<00:02:14.450> anything<00:02:14.690> nothing

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
you still can't open anything nothing

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.340 
you still can't open anything nothing
comes<00:02:15.890> apart<00:02:16.510> but<00:02:17.510> if<00:02:17.660> you<00:02:17.780> take<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:18.110> door<00:02:18.320> out

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
comes apart but if you take the door out

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.830 
comes apart but if you take the door out
again<00:02:18.830> with<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.220> you<00:02:19.940> can<00:02:20.090> actually<00:02:20.270> see<00:02:20.510> in

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
again with it you can actually see in

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.840 
again with it you can actually see in
there<00:02:21.580> there's<00:02:22.580> another<00:02:22.670> compartment<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:24.850> if

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
there there's another compartment and if

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.650 
there there's another compartment and if
you<00:02:26.000> just<00:02:26.210> go<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.720> end<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:28.240> just<00:02:29.240> pull

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
you just go to the end and just pull

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.880

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
easily by myself so I guess I'm just
