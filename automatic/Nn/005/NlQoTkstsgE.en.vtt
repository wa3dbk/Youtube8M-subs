00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.120

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.500
 a broad team manner 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.570
 the initiatives 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.950
 the thing that hurts me the most 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.310

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.520
 know that evening tonight 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.820
 and therefore 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.880
 sometimes lucidity 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.880
 I left space 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.190
 wide winch hours

 girls physical energies 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.820

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.820
 engine valve torments 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.350
 this time he 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.220
 because the first place we were 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.340
 the senator 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.990
 wrong text 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.990
 robin leaked 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.570
 pro - subjected too well look for a place in the starbucks 

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:12.049
 and then we went upstairs 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.159
 that is 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:17.159
 a good defense we have updated the defenses 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:23.399
 do-it-yourself 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:26.399
 change a little pregnant 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:30.449

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.449
 looking for high tide of belen I had to go there 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:37.099

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:44.429
 also today the main 3 lug 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.269
 fair way to lengthen the stock 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.159
 bpm 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.159
 dedicated mission is 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:12.559

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:15.559

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.879
 sportpiacenza 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.419
 extremely thin question 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.079
 that 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.079
 in these twelve meters that separate 

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:50.839
 I believe it is 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:53.839
 nurses all together with us 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.649

 capozucca referral 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.059
 really find it upside down 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:08.089
 maybe he is alone 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:11.089
 i'm not happy 30 

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:13.329
 We will play 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.329
 not just v 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.669
 all the rest 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.669
 and we need 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.389
 makeup physiotherapy 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.879

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:28.599
 we must do if you can't 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:31.599
 the game gets boring 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:33.889
 I believe that 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.430
 certainly 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.490
 if my players get the feeling 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.009
 that they are paid 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.009
 I will do something else but they have always shown me 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.830
 human lindos do it 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:55.509
 I tried to explain what the motivations are 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.309
 board 

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:19.550

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:26.759

 subito.it the real name's exoso of patty farchetto in the woods make it feasible. 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.499
 the real for the national average 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:41.969
 because in such a difficult game 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:45.449
 like any other, they got screwed for the shrew 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.449
 olivetti away at pitbull ball 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:52.879
