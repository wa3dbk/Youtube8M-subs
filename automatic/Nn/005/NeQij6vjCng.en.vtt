00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:15.250
 I'm doing really really well have 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.369
 hardly any problems with the knee so from 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.700
 healing process is all great and can 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.890
 I really be happy and 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.540
 That's why I'm actually doing very well 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.210
 with me was the front cruciate ligament 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.910
 torn both ministers were touched 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.640
 and inside tape and yes especially the 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.640
 At least perceive in the beginning 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.949
 problematic because it makes me six to 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.020
 had seven weeks back and then 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.210
 always a time that is not quite so 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.580
 easy and easy on 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.620
 relies on many people because you 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.620
 not really independent 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.940
 yes, so right after the op, it is the 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.790
 first 12 weeks are not quite 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.770
 so easy because that knee there too 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.690
 especially pain is the pain 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.950
 Minister Mann is very active in the movements 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.960
 limited and yes it was in the sense 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.850
 pretty easy for me because I'm in the 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.409
 time at home was with me 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.770
 family with my parents the me 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.450
 next to have supplied all around and 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.250
 have supported and my siblings 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.159
 even then I'm actually 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.159
 come back to Munich especially 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.429
 because of physiotherapy and was there though 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.470
 I also very well taken care of my wg and 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:38.720
 yes the girls were always there for you 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.750
 one had also by bavaria if one 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.350
 Something needed you were there in 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.350
 very good hands 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.220
 so in the beginning it was actually 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.740
 just so that i never move casually 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.869
 have to give on the bike and so on 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.850
 few stable exercises but you can just 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.350
 since not doing so much, especially 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:10.500
 because of the ministers you have to be very 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:12.990
 Be careful and then from the 89th 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.580
 week about I do not quite remember 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.890
 exactly 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.850
 You just catch up someday 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.560
 more with muscle building cycling that 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.810
 Knee fell by moving a lot 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.370
 physiotherapy and you do it 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.110
 upper body experience almost everything possible 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.640
 and then it just a good feeling 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.050
 if you just do sports again 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.019
 I can because I think so 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.209
 also the worst in the first weeks 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:41.090
 to be unable to do anything and before 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.940
 All in all an athlete it is easy 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.950
 It is not that difficult and so on 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.440
 time it just goes away then 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.030
 because you're simply be his again 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.310
 training has its regular schedule 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.220
 and that's just fine then next 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.900
 I'm so slow now 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.730
 I am looking forward to it 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.420
 of course, already on one 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.420
 next step 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.540
 I actually did it myself 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.210
 Goal set or goal I want 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.130
 not call me I said that 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.100
 I presumably so in january again 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.380
 get in with the team that is 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.890
 then about nine months just nine months 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.590
 And yes, the cruciate ligament needs above all else 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.940
 his time to heal and I want that 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.850
 give it to him and just want to be careful 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.840
 I wonder again and yes you do 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.080
 just have to look like that 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.540
 healing process continues to work so in 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.550
 the second half I have before again with 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.670
 the team then on the place too 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.670
 stand
