the permanent installation on the box

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.700 
the permanent installation on the box
yet<00:00:09.090> I<00:00:09.330> found<00:00:09.870> it<00:00:10.080> hook<00:00:10.230> four<00:00:10.410> here<00:00:10.530> on<00:00:10.620> the

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
yet I found it hook four here on the

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.490 
yet I found it hook four here on the
side<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:10.920> my<00:00:11.130> wall<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.700> hung<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:12.380> where<00:00:13.380> we

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
side of my wall and I hung it where we

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.379 
side of my wall and I hung it where we
have<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.679> plan<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.309> drill<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:14.940> couple<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.330> holes

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
have a plan to drill a couple of holes

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.689 
have a plan to drill a couple of holes
and<00:00:15.809> secure<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.289> little<00:00:16.410> bit<00:00:16.590> better<00:00:16.740> but<00:00:17.580> it

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
and secure it a little bit better but it

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.640 
and secure it a little bit better but it
is<00:00:17.730> hooked<00:00:18.029> up<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.359> it's<00:00:18.449> running<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.560> you

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
is hooked up and it's running and you

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.950 
is hooked up and it's running and you
can<00:00:19.710> see<00:00:20.270> hopefully<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.390> can<00:00:21.510> see<00:00:21.750> the

dollars all returned to the writing

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.370 
dollars all returned to the writing
which<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:23.970> supposed<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.390> release<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.930> maximum

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
which is supposed to release the maximum

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.870 
which is supposed to release the maximum
amount<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.740> ions<00:00:25.859> into<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.310> water<00:00:26.550> according

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
amount of ions into the water according

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.540 
amount of ions into the water according
to<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.180> instructions<00:00:27.740> Wow<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.279> green

got to keep it going but I haven't
adjusted<00:00:38.489> my<00:00:38.879> pH<00:00:39.270> yet<00:00:39.590> so<00:00:40.590> I'm<00:00:41.010> really<00:00:41.280> I'm

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
adjusted my pH yet so I'm really I'm

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.130 
adjusted my pH yet so I'm really I'm
just<00:00:41.460> turning<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.149> just<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.750> see<00:00:42.899> if

just turning it on just to see if
everything's<00:00:43.530> connected<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.100> working<00:00:44.160> so

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
everything's connected and working so

everything's connected and working so
you<00:00:44.550> see<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.879> white<00:00:45.090> lead<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.989> white<00:00:46.230> lead

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
you see that white lead and white lead

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.990 
you see that white lead and white lead
is<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> lead<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.160> comes<00:00:47.340> all<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.610> way<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.730> got

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
is the lead that comes all the way I got

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.310 
is the lead that comes all the way I got
a<00:00:48.030> hook<00:00:48.239> behind<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.629> filter<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.140> comes

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
a hook behind the filter and it comes

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.100 
a hook behind the filter and it comes
back<00:00:49.469> out<00:00:49.649> over<00:00:49.860> here<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.329> connected<00:00:51.870> to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
back out over here and this connected to

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.090 
back out over here and this connected to
this<00:00:52.399> red<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.579> black

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.810 

rather

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.579 

that's<00:01:00.179> where<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.359> wire<00:01:00.539> comes<00:01:00.570> out<00:01:01.190> murder

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.270 

electrum<00:01:05.600> so<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.780> hooked<00:01:06.990> up<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:07.829> this

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
electrum so this hooked up it's on this

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.029 
electrum so this hooked up it's on this
running<00:01:08.960> this<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.140> really<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> very<00:01:10.799> simple

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:11.039 
running this is really a very simple

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:12.800 
running this is really a very simple
process<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:12.119> made<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.420> little<00:01:12.570> bit<00:01:12.719> more

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
process we made it a little bit more

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.330 
process we made it a little bit more
difficult<00:01:13.289> because<00:01:13.439> we<00:01:13.829> didn't<00:01:14.069> easily

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
difficult because we didn't easily

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.800 
difficult because we didn't easily
submit<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.789> first<00:01:15.000> time<00:01:16.130> other<00:01:17.130> than<00:01:17.369> that

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
submit the first time other than that

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.999 
submit the first time other than that
we're<00:01:18.810> going<00:01:18.899> to<00:01:18.990> just<00:01:19.170> secure<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.590> box<00:01:19.859> a

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
we're going to just secure this box a

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.889 
we're going to just secure this box a
little<00:01:20.100> bit<00:01:20.250> better<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.509> little<00:01:21.750> bit

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
little bit better it's a little bit

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.319 
little bit better it's a little bit
flimsy<00:01:22.350> right<00:01:22.530> now<00:01:22.679> but<00:01:23.039> gives<00:01:23.759> us<00:01:23.909> an<00:01:24.060> idea

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
flimsy right now but gives us an idea

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.980 
flimsy right now but gives us an idea
where<00:01:24.539> we<00:01:24.569> want<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.840> put<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:26.810> where<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.899> is

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
where we want to put it and where it is

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.539 
where we want to put it and where it is
in<00:01:28.020> conjunction<00:01:28.409> with<00:01:28.799> everything<00:01:29.219> else<00:01:29.399> out

just<00:02:04.479> a<00:02:04.690> matter<00:02:04.840> now<00:02:04.960> of<00:02:05.110> putting<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:05.650> more

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
just a matter now of putting a more

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.199 
just a matter now of putting a more
secure<00:02:06.810> permanent<00:02:07.979> mounting<00:02:08.979> on<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.399> wall

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
secure permanent mounting on the wall

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.920 
secure permanent mounting on the wall
bracket<00:02:10.720> it's<00:02:11.470> hanging<00:02:11.709> by<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.459> hook<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.900> it

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
bracket it's hanging by a hook so it

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.180 
bracket it's hanging by a hook so it
really<00:02:14.290> doesn't<00:02:14.440> it's<00:02:14.620> not<00:02:14.680> secured<00:02:15.070> at<00:02:15.160> the

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
really doesn't it's not secured at the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.520 
really doesn't it's not secured at the
bottom<00:02:15.580> I<00:02:15.959> don't<00:02:16.959> feel<00:02:17.110> like<00:02:17.200> it's<00:02:17.380> going<00:02:17.500> to

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
bottom I don't feel like it's going to

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.580 
bottom I don't feel like it's going to
come<00:02:17.770> off<00:02:18.060> but<00:02:19.060> at<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.540> same<00:02:19.690> time<00:02:19.900> I'd<00:02:20.350> rather

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
come off but at the same time I'd rather

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.870 
come off but at the same time I'd rather
it<00:02:20.770> be<00:02:20.800> a<00:02:20.920> little<00:02:21.100> bit<00:02:21.190> more<00:02:21.340> flush<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:21.820> a

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
it be a little bit more flush and a

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.449 
it be a little bit more flush and a
little<00:02:22.060> bit<00:02:22.150> more<00:02:22.360> secure<00:02:23.260> other<00:02:24.250> than<00:02:24.370> that

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
little bit more secure other than that

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.120 
little bit more secure other than that
man<00:02:24.640> we're<00:02:24.850> good<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.060> go
