00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:17.180
 prepare to improve and serve ours 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:19.500

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.279
 at the Valentine's Day the drink but 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.869
 served in a complete martini cup 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.820
 mornings that as usual we will go to 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:37.100
 cool with a few cubes of 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:37.100
 ice and with a chicken coop 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.079
 we place the way that does not give us 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.079
 nuisance 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.760
 the technique we will use for 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.640
 to prepare them is that of the shaker screams 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.430
 same we used for him 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:00.750
 315 will serve yours is an album 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:05.309
 the necessary to prepare it is the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.729
 following cocoa liquor gene cream of 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.700
 syrup milk of the work to decorate it 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.619
 red sugar and raspberries 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.360
 now the technique of extreme scecs 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.800
 plans to fill up our rebates 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.040
 ice almost to gold in this one 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.040
 way 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.340
 done that the ingredients will go to 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.740
 canteen poured into it 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.119
 we will start from the cocoa liqueur that 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.770
 we will pour a quantity of one ounce 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.030
 so a dad is out in this one 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.399
 way 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:50.100
 bubble sold the fork will follow an ounce 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.679
 ii gene therefore always a little paul forum 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.869
 that we will pay in this way 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:02:01.670
 bubble three four after which we will pour 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.670
 in does not taste like cream 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.179
 by force of raspberry syrup 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:23.849
 so we will close everything with ours 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:31.590
 place done that we will ask 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:37.620
 energetically for 10 15 seconds per well 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:41.159
 we open our place so we recover 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.670
 our martini comments and we create it 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.670
 of its content 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:51.870
 in this way and now we will go to 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.700
 decorate the burgundy with an envelope of 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.239
 red sugar 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:02.989
 in this way we believe a slice of 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.989
 lime and we dance the village of the blanket 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.330
 so 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.190
 we recover the red sugar 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.280
 we turn our martini blanket upside down e 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.780
 let's make sure that the sugar 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.350
 adhere to the edge of the cup 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.350
 in this way 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.970
 perfect we put the sugar 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.180
 we resume our post and pay 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.260
 the contribution of the forest inside 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.500
 of the cup and brand in such a way that 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.010
 the ice does not fall inside with 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.010
 this way 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.300
 let's look at everything with a raspberry 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.440

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.860
