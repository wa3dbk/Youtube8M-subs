do plan on getting more just because I

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.620 
do plan on getting more just because I
knew<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.130> shadows<00:01:20.549> are<00:01:20.700> very<00:01:21.000> affordable

knew I shadows are very affordable
they're<00:01:22.200> only<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.530> think<00:01:22.770> six<00:01:23.189> dollars<00:01:23.580> for

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
they're only I think six dollars for

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.990 
they're only I think six dollars for
just<00:01:24.060> one<00:01:24.210> pan<00:01:24.479> but<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.439> come<00:01:25.770> like<00:01:26.700> they<00:01:26.820> have

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
just one pan but you come like they have

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.480 
just one pan but you come like they have
their<00:01:27.150> own<00:01:27.180> pallets<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.680> just<00:01:28.710> prefer<00:01:29.100> z

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
their own pallets to but I just prefer z

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.910 
their own pallets to but I just prefer z
pallo<00:01:29.700> just<00:01:30.060> because<00:01:30.299> it's<00:01:30.479> smaller<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.020> um

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
pallo just because it's smaller and um

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.920 
pallo just because it's smaller and um
you<00:01:32.790> know<00:01:32.850> just<00:01:33.060> more<00:01:33.240> convenient<00:01:33.540> for<00:01:33.810> me
