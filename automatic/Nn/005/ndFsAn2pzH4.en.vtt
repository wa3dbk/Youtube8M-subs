00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.650
 then too was the 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.429
 hahahahaha 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:20.429
 9 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:26.029
 clear 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.089
 just made pictures 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:32.089
 a friend of him made a shocking discovery 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.620
 gross how do we solve this 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.730
 spray program 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.940
 right on 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:37.830
 it will be back again 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.829
 the three parking garages 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.829
 the guaranteed 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.730
 there is clear 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.490
 worked 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.490
 it is a challenge 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.430
 some things can never be done here the services themselves can be adjusted 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.700
 of canal 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.530
 so ladies are trained for selection 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.950
 shortly thereafter 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.870
 it cannot be otherwise 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.450
 and of course the girls are brushing, although sometimes until then zemz 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.650
 I think the Galgenwaard 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.290
 stay at home 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.290
 after the earth his illness drops a little 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.560
 could be better 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.370
 but because it is anyway 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.620
 blows fc zwolle 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.620
 I expected 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.939
 the baker drivers his brother saint jacobs we just have to get used to it 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.939
 a drink these will be balls problems 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.210
 first two games 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.210
 read more 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.520
 they don't get there 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.700
 you have another step further 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.750
 but I do have it bit by bit 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.520
 peter andre 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.819
 dwm 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.819
 not only in the Netherlands but I have a bit there 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.449
 maria heather 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:19.479
 according to justice those films 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:22.479
 what is trackbacken 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:28.749
 conclusion more to fit the birth defects secretly on her 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:32.599
 trying to find out the deathbed is currently a priority for the teams 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:33.919
 number one 

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:36.049
 I don't know where I live in a house on the bell 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.040
 so loathed knowing 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.509
 Nintendo for its not pronounced 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:42.259
 it all quite what it is 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:44.449
 the illegal version 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:47.449
 what did you do on it 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:55.909
 some races break north 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.310
 but of course you all devices come 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.659
 I think I was killed by my grandparents 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.889
 that is very special to do 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:07.530
 firstly i have an explanation for all sides i also see with this 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:10.959
 brailsford nicely done why that is 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.819
 the glasses cost more than 300 euros from importing the sheet via cameras from the 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.819
 nos that via china north iraq and so it still opens 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:23.639
 after the hard blows 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:27.180
 and meanwhile we let ladies unsuspecting continue 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:31.979
 Los Angeles 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:34.979
 in July 2007 

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:40.999
 magnificent 

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:43.999
 what to let 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:50.059
 9 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:54.469
 some distraction 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.519
 a room 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.519
 hey why 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.959
 We expect 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.990
 9 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.419
 some distraction 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.249
 a room 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:45.349
 welcome back to the jupiler league 2007 from egypt the teams are getting ready 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.169
 for the first race on the Red Sea 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.750
 And you are only a true British Bradley Wiggins Euro if you are all professional 

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:54.749
 has collected 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:59.360
 from that time the first letter takes place 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.810
 bam conducts the first stevenshof to pay fine for the first day 300,000 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.610
 people who used to 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.319
 all teams are together and the tension increases with the participants 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:11.300
 what will it be a week long 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.099
 trio consists of the recent through the cia and how important your navigation is 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:18.900
 of course a bit of a proposal on the table to 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.490
 trained once 9 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.289
 but you go the senseo 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.680
 100 km per hour 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.830
 four days without training 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.059
 how do you do that 

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:32.839
 well i think i have a little bit around asking other teams how that works 

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:36.749
 and I only see the big ones own their own company on Sundays 

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:40.319
 there is a bit of my specialties like with the three points 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:44.509
 the loot is nothing but a month earlier broad lines it is rarely 7 billion 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:49.110
 worth the dollar we have properly prepared the boat is important 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.310
 good if you can't hold the time anywhere in the world 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.210
 participants in the volvo in trouble 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.539
 and after a good night's sleep collecting the top three sourcing into the Red Sea are the 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:05.430
 participants were ready for the first race 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.430
 although 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:12.939
 works for the time being 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:16.669
 shortly before sober colors 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.300
 noted the distribution of the most prominent it would be buyers of the Netherlands 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.410
 10 sandwich that writes the morning a bit clearer some more experience and 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.839
 I know so I think we really 

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:35.379
 with his return when in need and that has but then of course I will 

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:36.919
 a fact 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:38.129
 we cannot ignore it 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:41.439
 what have youngsters agreed on tactics 

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:44.550
 that is very difficult, very difficult to say now, better off 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:47.949
 we currently have to be a success 

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:50.189
 Meanwhile Jan Jan Hogyen known 

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:53.490
 instructions for use from 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.830
 we have much less worth the economical win of today means that one 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.590
 Increased chance of chance is greater that you go out before just fishing 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.590
 yes we will delete message itself 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.029
 but a bit of a turnover is standard 

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:13.499
 we are hurled in all directions 2 when grasping from the side 

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:15.909
 stand out there sometimes seems to have stood still 

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:21.770
 so the driver's license of a canteen a nice go I think I think for sure 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.009
 it was very intense 

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:25.349
 the earthquake that happened today 

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:27.389
 and we do that to the Egyptians 

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:29.029
 medium size 

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:32.159
 if your own say also a song that is half an hour think this 

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:35.439
 not the case for you have prepared 

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:37.960
 and now actually 

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.259
 especially mentally 

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:42.150
 I tried to save the proposals how intense it is 

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.990
 ultimately seen unknown images and I have you and you get true 

00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:51.539
 but very flat water so that is not comparable first I said I go there 

00:07:51.539 --> 00:07:53.629
 just a list of my own I have taken out
