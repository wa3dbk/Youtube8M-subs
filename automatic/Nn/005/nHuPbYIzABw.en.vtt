00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:20.610
 video tutorial and today at the request of a 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.610
 my friend, I'm going to show you how 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:30.140
 they raised a game for xbox 360 of 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:33.379
 lte 2.0 to the lt 3.0 ok that we are going to 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.060
 need very important in old age x 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:40.320
 360 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.320
 leave in the description of the video 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.550
 the most current version is also the 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.420
 I'll leave in the description of the video and 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:53.269
 when you have installed 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.269
 you can not open them and I have it 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.410
 you can see the two programs that already 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:08.100
 here I have we will appreciate what is the 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.420
 barÃ§a and del 2 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.780
 then when we have the game 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.780
 is ready 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.820
 mx 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:27.359
 I'm going to a lot of attention to this has to 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.359
 select this select this 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:40.900
 and this is something very important on 26 2.0 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:44.500
 3 obviously 3.0 and then they will see and 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:47.560
 here where to write to add if not 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.980
 they are being exist I do not know is not 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.120
 valid something like this is not valid when they have 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.120
 all this already 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.370
 with the options that I left here 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.370
 selected from the game 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.040
 now 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.220
 we go 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.040
 OK 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.790
 look for it 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.790
 the night 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.519
 7 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:48.610
 we take off the use of the game 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.610
 in the case of 360 clones 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.440
 very important they also have must of 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:59.810
 have internet connection I do not have 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.810
 because we moved calahonda 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.760
 the water gives us that 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:18.680
 in which will start the files 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.680
 obviously because I do not have internet 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.900
 running 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.230
 all of this is installed 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.850
 will disappear yellow or green lines 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.650
 what do you mean it's fine and then 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.650
 just ahead to finish 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.830
 to automatically close the cmd in 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.150
 Internet 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.150
 true 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.460
 know that 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.540
 they will have the game marched will take 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.480
 about 10 o 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.599
 yes like ten of five to ten five to 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.150
 ten minutes or so but when 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.420
 have that happen to open the lemon 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.420
 board 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:18.880
 we are not going to change anything 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:22.720
 here we will leave it in writing raid 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.990
 in the break level we will leave as you calculate 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.870
 the optimum we will not put the line of 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.610
 code that in some comes to us if it 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.590
 they want so I'm going to put it but in my 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:38.220
 case I'll leave it here because I already patch it 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.220
 with the bird gx ok when they have that 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.720
 once again 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.430
 we go 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.900
 recommendation to burn 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.340
 do not 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:04.990
 when you who regulated for the xbox 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.990
 the archives will come for the first 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.460
 the iso that brings the game and a small 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:22.050
 as I tell you a kind of 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.600
 he made me that makes me open the program 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:30.360
 automatically and add it but 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.360
 there are times when they do not work 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.890
 do not burn in the game that is this 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.939
 by opening this automatically that but 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:47.639
 sometimes it does not work so 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:50.789
 we will choose in action to start more 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:53.280
 here we are going to open we have the disk of 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:57.199
 double layer here do not worry about this 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:01.729
 problem not that is totally normal 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:08.029
 we remove vertical and here what we are going to 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:08.029
 2.4 we do not give you we invented the disk 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:22.260
 it will be a small one where we will choose the 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:24.370
 second where it says truncate then 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.400
 it will automatically start burning 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:30.130
 Normal the game when it finishes then 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.770
 leave it inside the tray about 5 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:36.660
 minutes since the disk will be very 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:39.660
 hot and if they take it out and move it 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.660
 physically 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.340
