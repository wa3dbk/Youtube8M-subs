00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
the inside of the carcass and you'll see

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.400 
the inside of the carcass and you'll see
it's<00:00:59.910> easier<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.359> put<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.660> stuff<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.020> if<00:01:01.289> you

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
it's easier to put that stuff in if you

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.569 
it's easier to put that stuff in if you
kind<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.649> put<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.890> chicken<00:01:02.190> up<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.520> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
kind of put the chicken up in the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.939 
kind of put the chicken up in the
beginning<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:03.030> will<00:01:03.120> hold<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.449> for<00:01:03.480> you

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
beginning it will hold it for you

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.469 
beginning it will hold it for you
and<00:01:04.949> then<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> lemon<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.670> really<00:01:06.000> recommend

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
and then the lemon I really recommend

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.149 
and then the lemon I really recommend
because<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:06.900> permeates<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.650> whole<00:01:07.860> chicken

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
because it permeates the whole chicken

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.679 
because it permeates the whole chicken
as<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.580> cooks<00:01:08.760> really<00:01:09.000> yummy

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
as it cooks really yummy

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.450 
as it cooks really yummy
that's<00:01:10.170> about<00:01:10.380> half<00:01:10.680> way<00:01:10.920> done<00:01:11.070> with<00:01:11.130> cooking

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
that's about half way done with cooking

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.590 
that's about half way done with cooking
and<00:01:11.760> you'll<00:01:11.850> see<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.210> even<00:01:12.479> though<00:01:12.570> I

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
and you'll see that even though I

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.990 
and you'll see that even though I
haven't<00:01:12.930> added<00:01:13.229> any<00:01:13.560> liquid<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.640> chicken

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
haven't added any liquid to the chicken

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.230 
haven't added any liquid to the chicken
it<00:01:15.210> makes<00:01:15.659> its<00:01:15.840> own<00:01:15.930> liquid<00:01:16.700> then<00:01:17.700> afterward

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
it makes its own liquid then afterward

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.789 
it makes its own liquid then afterward
I'll<00:01:18.299> take<00:01:18.479> one<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.900> chickens<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.530> just

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
I'll take one of the chickens and just

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.190 
I'll take one of the chickens and just
