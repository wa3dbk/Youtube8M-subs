00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.480
 Hello, I have my beauty today 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.370
 my favorite of the last time for you 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.660
 first favorite would be a couple driving this 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.519
 I already have a short time in mine 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.950
 Show makeup shows and that 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.869
 this is the chanel chance and blame 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.509
 I have a video this summer 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.000
 uploaded that was the mouse left in 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.369
 summer day where i mentioned i find 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.840
 that's a typical spree as well 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.820
 smells and then has me one 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.190
 The spectator wrote that I did 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.290
 let's have a chance or smell of 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.120
 chanel and that 's the same smell 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.310
 would and i think she is right so 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.900
 it is not one hundred percent the same 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.660
 places but it is definitely one 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.370
 very similar direction there was 15 percent 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.780
 discount during the glamor shopping week 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.340
 on a few fans and then I have 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.390
 slammed and since then I use 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.640
 really every day 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.670
 it is a very fresh fragrance so rather 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.770
 light and flowery and tender but me 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.239
 somehow my perforce is wearing the whole thing 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.860
 year so when I smell a bit 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.670
 good find then the cares 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.260
 all year round 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.540
 That's why I have the lately 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.939
 really liked favorite number 2 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.500
 the last time would be a duo and that 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.369
 this brush along with this 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.170
 foundation 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.729
 These are two products that are too 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.290
 individually, I think it's really good 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.210
 Together I can find them in combination 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.580
 even better, and that is once the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.640
 video technology expert facebooks i have 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.930
 by lobby cosmetics the shop 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.780
 I link in the infobox 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.729
 I ordered that and that is 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.770
 really an insanely good foundation 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.260
 industry so that's the best of me 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.479
 have the boston very soft but still 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.020
 relatively firm the order succeeds 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.090
 totally streak-free and even and 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.350
 yes I love that so that is one 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.180
 not so long 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.820
 Bafin broke into her 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.950
 lengthy and you can really with that 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.049
 work really well and I carry 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.030
 just so lately the rimmel 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.409
 wake me up foundation on that i have 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.450
 now shown a few times 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.119
 i like that i totally like that 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.460
 totally healthy and shiny and fresh 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.890
 The opacity is very high 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.600
 I what I in of the love 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.049
 I like the dayton very much 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.549
 strong cover and although this is 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:10.989
 you do not look glued over 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.500
 but I think that's natural 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.210
 I agree 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.160
 and I love the next one very much 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.410
 favorite would be a concealer and indeed the 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.270
 Bursch was hertie mix concealer in the 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.130
 color blatant medium 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.900
 I have my intervall trip 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.370
 from abroad I do not know where 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.350
 You can sometimes get Germany 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.230
 in any case at budni in the north 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.670
 but if you do not come there then 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.350
 I'm looking for something and looking forward to the 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.690
 infobox have job find ideas before 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.370
 can order and yes I love the 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.640
 concealer so much because he is very opaque 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.100
 is and because he is not so shiny 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.070
 So I use that around my eyes and 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.330
 I'm the slightly dehydrated and me 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.820
 I like that very much 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.650
 so other liquid concealers are included 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.930
 Me under the eyes never works 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.120
 because they are so wet and sticky and 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.040
 were slippery and then mine 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.600
 mascara has always deposed or she 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.430
 slipped away or how are 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.739
 that's not the case here 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.270
 the case because he is relatively dull 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.000
 So I do not need it 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.100
 wear powder on but the talk and 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.989
 also so relatively dull and thereby 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.250
 do not slip soli mascara sit down 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.630
 not off he does not sit in the 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.280
 so I am really 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.140
 convinced of the concept 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.500
 Another option would be the revision 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.030
 lip Balm of nothing you can also in 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.590
 I got mine 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.450
 France bought but I have it too 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.239
 already seen in Germany at Kaufhof 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.280
 or so and yes I love this club 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.380
 bathing since I saw each other now 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.040
 that too is as said and honey 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.320
 bal 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.060
 but I do not think he's after honey 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.299
 but it smells very fruity very much 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.799
 lemony text texture very firm but on 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.720
 the lips with the very tender and 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.760
 smooth can be applied beautifully 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.680
 and the care really really 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.600
 really good so I always wear it 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.769
 in the evening before going to bed and on 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.989
 next morning, my lips are whole 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.820
 soft and delicate and that's a very nice one too 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.190
 great favorite of the last time the 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.720
 last two favorites would be two 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.670
 I will then offer you my products 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.040
 last hall showed in my the 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.610
 This is once a body shop hall 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:10.430
 a body scrub from the show awesome 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.690
 The smell is just so divine 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.270
 I already have it in the last video 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.070
 said it smells strongly of total 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.799
 Of course you have to like chocolate 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.600
 it smells very very heavy but me 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.480
 personally, I'm totally comfortable straight 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.370
 now around the season and what I too 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.340
 like very much to be cheap the 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.780
 caring effect actually so my 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.240
 Skin is after the shower when I am 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.090
 used very soft and supple 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.910
 and the fragrance keeps the skin for a long time 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.040
 I was so long I can really 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.830
 highly recommend and the last favorite 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.540
 that would be the crazy crossing serum I have 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.270
 Show you my last episode 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.790
 that it's just comparable to one 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.730
 hail makes the hair supple 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.870
 and shining and settle down like that 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.060
 bit around the hair 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.730
 but it is not that complaining 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.770
 So it is much easier and there 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.360
 Therefore, I also find skin more pleasant 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.150
 I will not finish my hair 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.070
 leaves healthy and shiny especially 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.390
 convincing that the smell is so right 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.760
 maybe even if you both body 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:14.090
 shop side that smells so pleasantly fresh 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.160
 and even in the cock it stays long as 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.780
 her hairy so pleasant 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.400
 this is really a big favorite 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.860
 the last time so that was now 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.419
 my beauty favorites in november 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.550
 or at the beginning of december 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.229
 I hope you liked it writes 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.169
 me once in the comments what euro 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:31.160
 favorites were in the last time 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.810
 and if she still feels like it now 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.610
 see more video then link 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.070
 I'll give you the yard and me here 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.960
 I spoke in the body shop 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.120
 have bought things and a few more 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.000
 other things or you look mine 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.860
 last video that were 5 lipsticks 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.610
 in all price ranges for the colder 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.930
 season 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.090
 I would be glad if you one 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.300
 and then she gets 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.300
 madness
