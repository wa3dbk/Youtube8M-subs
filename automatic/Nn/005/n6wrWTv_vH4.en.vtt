certain<00:04:49.039> type<00:04:49.310> of<00:04:49.340> trains<00:04:49.819> mana<00:04:50.659> rails<00:04:50.900> and

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
certain type of trains mana rails and

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.730 
certain type of trains mana rails and
more<00:04:51.289> cities<00:04:51.590> and<00:04:52.069> more<00:04:52.639> efficient<00:04:53.120> subways

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
more cities and more efficient subways

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.439

hopefully<00:04:54.740> these<00:04:55.039> small<00:04:55.460> innovations<00:04:56.150> will

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
hopefully these small innovations will

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.080 
hopefully these small innovations will
lead<00:04:56.599> up<00:04:56.719> to<00:04:56.750> a<00:04:56.960> giant<00:04:57.699> invention<00:04:58.699> like<00:04:58.909> the

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
lead up to a giant invention like the

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.689 
lead up to a giant invention like the
fall<00:04:59.360> from<00:04:59.719> Total<00:05:00.050> Recall<00:05:00.310> for<00:05:01.310> those<00:05:01.430> of<00:05:01.580> you

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
fall from Total Recall for those of you

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.429 
fall from Total Recall for those of you
who<00:05:01.849> don't<00:05:02.060> know<00:05:02.210> the<00:05:02.659> fall<00:05:02.900> is<00:05:03.080> a<00:05:03.110> tunnel

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:03.439 
who don't know the fall is a tunnel

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:04.839 
who don't know the fall is a tunnel
board<00:05:03.830> through<00:05:04.099> the<00:05:04.129> center<00:05:04.520> of<00:05:04.610> the<00:05:04.789> earth

Australia<00:05:10.389> basically<00:05:11.389> it's<00:05:12.080> from<00:05:12.349> a<00:05:12.469> movie

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
Australia basically it's from a movie

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.559 
Australia basically it's from a movie
and<00:05:12.830> it's<00:05:13.129> a<00:05:13.219> giant<00:05:13.460> train<00:05:13.909> that<00:05:14.150> goes<00:05:14.300> through

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:14.569 
and it's a giant train that goes through

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:17.540

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
distant future and may not even be

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.570 
distant future and may not even be
completely<00:05:22.090> possible<00:05:22.590> however<00:05:23.590> its<00:05:24.190> dreams

completely possible however its dreams

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.550 
completely possible however its dreams
like<00:05:24.850> these<00:05:25.120> that<00:05:25.480> help<00:05:25.660> us<00:05:25.840> shape<00:05:26.080> the<00:05:26.350> new

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
like these that help us shape the new

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
inventions and I can't wait to see what

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:36.810 
inventions and I can't wait to see what
comes<00:05:28.870> next
