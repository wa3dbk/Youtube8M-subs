00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.849 
they do and they do um team kills is
probably<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:35.459> second<00:03:35.849> biggest<00:03:36.049> problem<00:03:37.049> with

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
probably the second biggest problem with

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.470 
probably the second biggest problem with
this<00:03:37.950> type<00:03:38.099> of<00:03:38.160> game<00:03:38.400> some<00:03:38.760> I<00:03:39.090> mean<00:03:39.359> obviously

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
this type of game some I mean obviously

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.110 
this type of game some I mean obviously
thus<00:03:39.989> gets<00:03:40.380> off<00:03:40.620> not<00:03:41.010> playing<00:03:41.310> hard<00:03:41.459> for<00:03:41.819> but

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
thus gets off not playing hard for but

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.890 
thus gets off not playing hard for but
just<00:03:42.959> thought<00:03:43.139> i<00:03:43.200> would<00:03:43.319> mention<00:03:43.500> it<00:03:43.950> now<00:03:44.130> um

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
just thought i would mention it now um

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.050 
just thought i would mention it now um
you<00:03:45.900> do<00:03:46.139> get<00:03:46.470> this<00:03:46.980> is<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.250> type<00:03:47.459> of<00:03:47.489> game<00:03:47.790> play

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
you do get this is the type of game play

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.960 
you do get this is the type of game play
the<00:03:49.049> type<00:03:49.260> of<00:03:49.290> map<00:03:49.709> and<00:03:50.099> the<00:03:50.310> settings<00:03:50.760> where

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
the type of map and the settings where

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.339 
the type of map and the settings where
you<00:03:51.060> would<00:03:51.180> actually<00:03:51.209> see<00:03:51.540> you<00:03:52.049> know<00:03:52.079> those

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
you would actually see you know those

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.339 
you would actually see you know those
call<00:03:53.130> duty<00:03:53.370> scores<00:03:53.760> like<00:03:54.150> for<00:03:54.329> example<00:03:54.419> 40<00:03:55.230> and

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
call duty scores like for example 40 and

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.129 
call duty scores like for example 40 and
three<00:03:55.769> you<00:03:56.280> know<00:03:56.370> kill<00:03:57.060> death<00:03:57.269> ratio<00:03:57.389> this<00:03:57.959> is

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
three you know kill death ratio this is

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.490 
three you know kill death ratio this is
this<00:03:58.560> is<00:03:58.769> probably<00:03:59.099> where<00:03:59.459> they<00:03:59.700> did<00:03:59.940> it<00:04:00.060> and

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
this is probably where they did it and

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.900 
this is probably where they did it and
then<00:04:01.500> i<00:04:01.620> gotta<00:04:01.799> say<00:04:02.010> when<00:04:02.190> you<00:04:02.310> do<00:04:02.459> get<00:04:02.639> those

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
then i gotta say when you do get those

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.659 
then i gotta say when you do get those
it's<00:04:03.510> actually<00:04:04.049> pretty<00:04:04.290> nice<00:04:04.530> but<00:04:04.950> you<00:04:05.130> never

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
it's actually pretty nice but you never

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.930 
it's actually pretty nice but you never
get<00:04:05.940> those<00:04:06.260> so<00:04:07.340> but<00:04:08.340> here<00:04:08.489> I'm<00:04:08.669> going<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:08.849> go

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
get those so but here I'm going to go

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.640 
get those so but here I'm going to go
ahead<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.209> show<00:04:09.359> you<00:04:09.389> guys<00:04:09.630> just<00:04:09.989> a<00:04:10.200> little

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
ahead and show you guys just a little

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.069 
ahead and show you guys just a little
bit<00:04:10.739> of<00:04:10.829> the<00:04:10.919> difference<00:04:11.430> here<00:04:12.120> we<00:04:12.780> have<00:04:12.900> some

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
bit of the difference here we have some

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.670 
bit of the difference here we have some
footage<00:04:13.319> of<00:04:13.889> me<00:04:14.549> playing<00:04:14.880> on<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.480> UH<00:04:15.810> normal<00:04:16.410> I

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
footage of me playing on the UH normal I

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.680 
footage of me playing on the UH normal I
normal<00:04:17.489> server<00:04:17.760> as<00:04:17.970> you<00:04:18.090> would<00:04:18.209> see<00:04:18.389> them<00:04:18.570> on

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
normal server as you would see them on

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.930 
normal server as you would see them on
the<00:04:18.780> consoles<00:04:19.260> on<00:04:19.469> the<00:04:19.650> same<00:04:19.859> map<00:04:20.159> that<00:04:20.729> you

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
the consoles on the same map that you

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.029 
the consoles on the same map that you
can<00:04:21.120> tell<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.570> difference<00:04:21.810> is<00:04:22.289> that<00:04:22.320> how<00:04:22.979> many

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
can tell the difference is that how many

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.140 
can tell the difference is that how many
players<00:04:23.430> nicely

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
players nicely

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.420 
players nicely
you<00:04:24.570> can<00:04:24.720> actually<00:04:24.870> roam<00:04:25.320> free<00:04:25.770> on<00:04:26.009> the<00:04:26.220> map

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
you can actually roam free on the map

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.980 
you can actually roam free on the map
without<00:04:26.639> getting<00:04:27.120> you<00:04:27.270> know<00:04:27.389> grant<00:04:27.660> launch

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
without getting you know grant launch

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.040 
without getting you know grant launch
that<00:04:28.320> you<00:04:28.889> can<00:04:29.190> actually<00:04:29.400> no<00:04:29.729> actually<00:04:30.050> move

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
that you can actually no actually move

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.510 
that you can actually no actually move
forward<00:04:31.530> in<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:31.770> map<00:04:31.949> which<00:04:32.160> is<00:04:32.280> a<00:04:32.310> big

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
forward in the map which is a big

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.090 
forward in the map which is a big
problem<00:04:33.020> with<00:04:34.020> this<00:04:34.199> Maps<00:04:34.500> when<00:04:34.740> playing<00:04:34.919> with

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
problem with this Maps when playing with

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.610 
problem with this Maps when playing with
64<00:04:35.490> players<00:04:35.759> that<00:04:36.060> you're<00:04:36.210> actually<00:04:36.620> the

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
64 players that you're actually the

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.070 
64 players that you're actually the
defense<00:04:38.100> is<00:04:38.250> actually<00:04:38.430> so<00:04:38.940> strong<00:04:39.360> you<00:04:39.870> never

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
defense is actually so strong you never

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.810 
defense is actually so strong you never
really<00:04:40.410> get<00:04:40.530> to<00:04:40.590> move<00:04:40.979> just<00:04:41.280> simply<00:04:41.729> because

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
really get to move just simply because

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.430 
really get to move just simply because
you<00:04:42.000> just<00:04:42.270> can't<00:04:42.360> move<00:04:42.990> through<00:04:43.289> hallways

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
you just can't move through hallways

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.400 
you just can't move through hallways
Richard<00:04:43.979> you're<00:04:44.250> dead<00:04:44.580> it's<00:04:45.330> it<00:04:45.720> does<00:04:45.960> become

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
Richard you're dead it's it does become

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.999 
Richard you're dead it's it does become
a<00:04:46.440> little<00:04:47.250> bit<00:04:47.370> of<00:04:47.400> a<00:04:47.520> problem<00:04:48.229> but<00:04:49.229> finally

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
a little bit of a problem but finally

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.219 
a little bit of a problem but finally
I'm<00:04:50.220> just<00:04:51.090> here<00:04:51.270> just<00:04:51.419> a<00:04:51.539> little<00:04:51.570> nice<00:04:51.900> kills

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
I'm just here just a little nice kills

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.180 
I'm just here just a little nice kills

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
actually do here but all in all though I

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.450 
actually do here but all in all though I
you<00:05:00.840> know<00:05:00.930> I<00:05:00.960> just<00:05:01.199> wanted<00:05:01.470> to<00:05:01.500> to<00:05:02.280> make<00:05:02.400> a

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
you know I just wanted to to make a

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.000 
you know I just wanted to to make a
point<00:05:02.729> here<00:05:02.880> and<00:05:03.270> just<00:05:03.449> say<00:05:03.660> I<00:05:03.690> guess<00:05:04.440> Express

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
point here and just say I guess Express

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.730 
point here and just say I guess Express
with<00:05:05.729> a<00:05:05.760> video<00:05:06.150> just<00:05:06.240> what<00:05:07.199> the<00:05:07.410> dice

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
with a video just what the dice

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.960 
with a video just what the dice
developers<00:05:08.600> mentioned<00:05:09.600> in<00:05:09.780> their<00:05:09.960> interview

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
developers mentioned in their interview

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.790 
developers mentioned in their interview
about<00:05:11.970> why<00:05:12.300> they<00:05:12.720> didn't<00:05:12.900> actually<00:05:13.050> go<00:05:13.440> for

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
about why they didn't actually go for

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.279 
about why they didn't actually go for
that<00:05:13.949> 64<00:05:14.520> player<00:05:14.729> limit<00:05:15.180> on<00:05:15.270> the<00:05:15.419> consoles<00:05:15.960> and

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
that 64 player limit on the consoles and

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.909 
that 64 player limit on the consoles and
the<00:05:16.440> 128<00:05:17.250> player<00:05:18.030> limit<00:05:18.479> cap<00:05:18.690> on<00:05:18.960> the<00:05:19.050> pc<00:05:19.530> it

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
the 128 player limit cap on the pc it

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.270 
the 128 player limit cap on the pc it
does<00:05:20.220> become<00:05:20.669> problematic<00:05:21.150> and<00:05:21.479> I<00:05:22.009> i<00:05:23.009> guess

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
does become problematic and I i guess

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.650 
does become problematic and I i guess
you<00:05:23.400> can<00:05:23.550> imagine<00:05:23.820> how<00:05:24.180> it<00:05:24.270> would<00:05:24.360> be<00:05:24.509> like

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
you can imagine how it would be like

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.150 
you can imagine how it would be like
