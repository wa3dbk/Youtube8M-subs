because I think the scopes are kind of

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.270

off<00:01:02.750> but<00:01:03.750> I'm<00:01:03.960> really<00:01:04.470> glad<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.800> have<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.250> I

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
better I really do like that they made

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.670 
better I really do like that they made
this<00:01:20.729> attempt<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.300> everything<00:01:21.690> but<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.590> know

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
to be honest with you in a lot of ways

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.450 
to be honest with you in a lot of ways
it<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.750> bit<00:01:25.079> of<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.290> letdown<00:01:25.649> I<00:01:25.920> think<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
it is a bit of a letdown I think the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.459 
it is a bit of a letdown I think the
head<00:01:26.670> sculpt<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.149> actually<00:01:27.509> not<00:01:27.659> too<00:01:27.899> bad<00:01:27.930> his

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
head sculpt is actually not too bad his

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:30.469 
head sculpt is actually not too bad his
head<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.770> actually<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.100> little<00:01:29.280> tall<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.909> me<00:01:30.030> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
head is actually a little tall to me and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.179 
head is actually a little tall to me and
it's<00:01:30.630> really<00:01:30.960> tough<00:01:31.259> getting<00:01:31.560> him<00:01:31.799> into<00:01:32.040> an

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
it's really tough getting him into an

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.910 
it's really tough getting him into an
optic<00:01:32.640> blast<00:01:33.000> kind<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.539> pose<00:01:33.719> both<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.799> his

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
optic blast kind of pose both of his

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.429 
optic blast kind of pose both of his
hands<00:01:35.159> are<00:01:35.310> kind<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.549> posed<00:01:35.759> like<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.899> it

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
hands are kind of posed like this so it

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.569 
hands are kind of posed like this so it
would<00:01:37.530> have<00:01:37.590> been<00:01:37.649> nice<00:01:37.890> if<00:01:37.920> we've<00:01:38.219> gotten

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
would have been nice if we've gotten

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.730 
would have been nice if we've gotten
some<00:01:38.789> kind<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.119> finger<00:01:39.390> articulation<00:01:39.990> or<00:01:40.259> some

pose<00:01:43.860> going<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:44.399> then<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.939> know<00:01:45.030> we<00:01:45.149> would

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
pose going on then you know we would

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.060 
pose going on then you know we would
have<00:01:45.360> been<00:01:45.479> set<00:01:45.810> but<00:01:46.079> overall<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.920> head

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
have been set but overall the head

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.859 
have been set but overall the head
sculpt<00:01:47.399> isn't<00:01:47.640> too<00:01:47.729> bad<00:01:47.969> I<00:01:48.270> think<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.630> flesh

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
sculpt isn't too bad I think the flesh

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.319 
sculpt isn't too bad I think the flesh
tone<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.289> kind<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.740> light<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.729> be<00:01:50.759> honest<00:01:51.149> with

the belt right here which actually has
two<00:02:08.369> settings<00:02:08.850> if<00:02:09.630> you<00:02:09.780> have<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.320> that

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
tighter second notch right there it kind

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.970 
tighter second notch right there it kind
of<00:02:12.450> goes<00:02:12.600> a<00:02:12.630> little<00:02:12.870> too<00:02:13.050> high<00:02:13.230> up<00:02:13.380> is<00:02:13.530> wasted

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
for my liking I appreciate that the X is

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.400 
for my liking I appreciate that the X is
actually<00:02:17.310> sculpted<00:02:18.090> inside<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.600> belt<00:02:18.870> not

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
actually sculpted inside the belt not

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.730 
actually sculpted inside the belt not
just<00:02:19.650> painted<00:02:20.010> over<00:02:20.100> it

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
just painted over it

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.950 
just painted over it
and<00:02:20.860> you<00:02:21.580> know<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.760> plastic<00:02:22.120> wrists<00:02:22.510> actually

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
and you know the plastic wrists actually

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.750 
and you know the plastic wrists actually
saw<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:23.440> plastic<00:02:23.980> underneath<00:02:24.190> here<00:02:24.520> so<00:02:24.670> you

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
saw a plastic underneath here so you

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.510 
saw a plastic underneath here so you
could<00:02:24.850> roll<00:02:25.090> this<00:02:25.300> up<00:02:25.570> and<00:02:25.810> you<00:02:25.870> could<00:02:26.020> see<00:02:26.260> how

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
could roll this up and you could see how

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.220 
could roll this up and you could see how
it's<00:02:27.520> all<00:02:27.640> plastic<00:02:27.940> underneath<00:02:28.420> like<00:02:28.930> there

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
it's all plastic underneath like there

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.990 
it's all plastic underneath like there
so<00:02:29.680> at<00:02:30.010> least<00:02:30.130> they<00:02:30.280> painted<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:30.700> blue<00:02:30.970> I

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
so at least they painted it blue I

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.040 
so at least they painted it blue I
thought<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:31.630> was<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.780> good<00:02:31.960> idea<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:34.300> yeah<00:02:34.600> so

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
thought that was a good idea and yeah so

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.840 
thought that was a good idea and yeah so
those<00:02:35.230> yellow<00:02:35.710> stripes<00:02:36.130> on<00:02:36.340> there<00:02:36.490> actually

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
those yellow stripes on there actually

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.910 
those yellow stripes on there actually
don't<00:02:37.090> come<00:02:37.390> off<00:02:37.600> there's<00:02:38.320> a<00:02:38.410> little<00:02:38.710> bit<00:02:38.830> of

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
don't come off there's a little bit of

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.440 
don't come off there's a little bit of
where<00:02:39.130> right<00:02:39.400> here<00:02:39.850> you<00:02:39.970> could<00:02:40.060> see<00:02:40.210> by<00:02:40.330> my

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
where right here you could see by my

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.670 
where right here you could see by my
thumb<00:02:40.690> right<00:02:40.810> there<00:02:41.020> but<00:02:41.260> aside<00:02:41.470> from<00:02:41.530> that

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
thumb right there but aside from that

thumb right there but aside from that
the<00:02:42.130> paint<00:02:42.430> does<00:02:42.700> stay<00:02:43.030> on<00:02:43.060> pretty<00:02:43.480> well<00:02:43.630> and

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
the paint does stay on pretty well and

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
of those old GI Joe those Mego figures

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.850 
of those old GI Joe those Mego figures
you<00:02:55.060> know<00:02:55.120> anything<00:02:55.390> make<00:02:55.600> Omega<00:02:55.990> I<00:02:56.170> can't

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
you know anything make Omega I can't

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:57.900 
you know anything make Omega I can't
remember<00:02:57.040> how<00:02:57.130> it's<00:02:57.280> pronounced<00:02:57.520> but<00:02:57.670> anyway

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
remember how it's pronounced but anyway

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.910 
remember how it's pronounced but anyway
well<00:02:58.240> this<00:02:58.360> is<00:02:58.450> closer<00:02:58.690> to<00:02:58.840> that<00:02:59.380> anyway<00:02:59.890> so

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
well this is closer to that anyway so

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.740 
well this is closer to that anyway so
his<00:03:00.220> articulation<00:03:00.520> his<00:03:00.910> head<00:03:01.210> does<00:03:01.390> not<00:03:01.570> move

no it doesn't rotate at the elbow it's

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.570 
no it doesn't rotate at the elbow it's
just<00:03:16.870> still<00:03:17.110> rotating<00:03:17.590> here<00:03:17.710> at<00:03:17.800> the<00:03:17.890> bicep

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
and you know his only function really I

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.940 
and you know his only function really I
guess<00:04:01.360> so<00:04:02.050> you<00:04:02.110> could<00:04:02.230> take<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:02.530> belt<00:04:02.740> and<00:04:02.890> you

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
guess so you could take the belt and you

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.290 
guess so you could take the belt and you
could<00:04:03.100> tighten<00:04:03.310> it<00:04:03.460> up<00:04:03.520> and<00:04:03.700> put<00:04:03.880> it<00:04:03.970> on<00:04:04.150> the

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
could tighten it up and put it on the

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.760 
could tighten it up and put it on the
second<00:04:04.630> notch<00:04:04.780> but<00:04:05.200> when<00:04:05.290> you<00:04:05.380> do<00:04:05.500> that<00:04:05.530> you

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
second notch but when you do that you

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.350 
second notch but when you do that you
want<00:04:05.950> to<00:04:05.980> put<00:04:06.160> it<00:04:06.220> on<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.340> first<00:04:06.610> and<00:04:06.820> second

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
want to put it on the first and second

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.970 
want to put it on the first and second
notch<00:04:07.480> when<00:04:07.720> you<00:04:07.780> do<00:04:07.930> this<00:04:08.110> yeah<00:04:08.410> see<00:04:08.740> how<00:04:08.830> that

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
notch when you do this yeah see how that

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.440 
notch when you do this yeah see how that
looks<00:04:09.190> I<00:04:09.280> think<00:04:09.310> it's<00:04:09.580> just<00:04:09.670> too<00:04:09.910> high<00:04:10.090> up<00:04:10.270> it

think<00:05:05.289> they<00:05:05.379> had<00:05:05.500> just<00:05:05.740> done<00:05:05.830> a<00:05:06.069> couple<00:05:06.490> things

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
think they had just done a couple things

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.689 
think they had just done a couple things
better<00:05:07.240> as<00:05:07.569> far<00:05:07.780> as<00:05:07.840> the<00:05:07.960> sculpt<00:05:08.530> goes<00:05:08.740> and<00:05:09.069> the

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
better as far as the sculpt goes and the

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.249 
better as far as the sculpt goes and the
articulation<00:05:10.030> then<00:05:10.780> we<00:05:10.870> would<00:05:11.020> have<00:05:11.139> had

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
articulation then we would have had

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:13.320 
articulation then we would have had
something<00:05:11.590> really<00:05:12.099> cool<00:05:12.490> here<00:05:12.789> so<00:05:13.030> I<00:05:13.060> thought

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
something really cool here so I thought

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.909 
something really cool here so I thought
the<00:05:13.449> concept<00:05:13.690> was<00:05:14.050> really<00:05:14.110> great<00:05:14.530> but<00:05:14.740> they

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
the concept was really great but they

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.290 
the concept was really great but they
just<00:05:15.159> didn't<00:05:15.370> really<00:05:15.460> pull<00:05:15.729> it<00:05:15.849> off<00:05:16.000> and<00:05:16.210> I'd

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
just didn't really pull it off and I'd

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.450 
just didn't really pull it off and I'd
been<00:05:16.509> always<00:05:17.020> curious<00:05:17.440> about<00:05:17.770> these<00:05:18.069> figures

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
been always curious about these figures

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.860 
been always curious about these figures
so<00:05:18.639> I<00:05:18.669> really<00:05:19.090> really<00:05:19.300> appreciate<00:05:19.750> it<00:05:19.780> man
