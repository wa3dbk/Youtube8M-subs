a<00:01:46.320> really<00:01:46.439> good<00:01:46.979> way<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.189> win<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> race<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:48.060> a

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
a really good way to win a race it's a

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.550 
a really good way to win a race it's a
good<00:01:48.299> way<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.540> get<00:01:48.659> out<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.960> cluster<00:01:49.409> right

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
good way to get out of the cluster right

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.679 
good way to get out of the cluster right
in<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.740> beginning<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.189> race<00:01:50.540> so<00:01:51.540> that's

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
in the beginning of the race so that's

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.730 
in the beginning of the race so that's
what<00:01:51.840> you're<00:01:51.930> going<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.079> want<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.350> do<00:01:52.470> if<00:01:52.649> you

what you're going to want to do if you
want<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.950> start<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.310> up<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.000> really

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
want to start it up and this is a really

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.580 
want to start it up and this is a really
good<00:01:54.299> way<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.509> practice<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:55.079> but<00:01:55.200> what's<00:01:55.439> gonna

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
good way to practice it but what's gonna

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.560 
good way to practice it but what's gonna
happen<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.009> it's<00:01:56.040> going<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.399> go<00:01:56.520> three<00:01:56.880> two<00:01:57.060> one

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
happen is it's going to go three two one

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.350 
happen is it's going to go three two one
and<00:01:57.950> whatever<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.219> after<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.820> says<00:01:59.969> one<00:02:00.210> and

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
then right it says go you're going to

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.709 
then right it says go you're going to
hit<00:02:01.829> your<00:02:01.860> right<00:02:02.219> trigger<00:02:02.700> for<00:02:03.119> your<00:02:03.210> Xbox

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
go hit it and then you

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.170 
go hit it and then you
it<00:02:09.849> that's<00:02:10.750> how<00:02:10.899> it<00:02:11.020> works<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:11.560> if<00:02:12.520> this<00:02:12.970> is

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
it that's how it works and if this is

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
there's a guy who you crush with me on

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.370 
there's a guy who you crush with me on
the<00:02:18.880> wall<00:02:19.030> like<00:02:19.209> that<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.599> I<00:02:19.690> get<00:02:19.840> crossing

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
the wall like that and I get crossing

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.860 
the wall like that and I get crossing
this<00:02:20.500> spun-out<00:02:20.910> like<00:02:21.910> that's<00:02:22.209> a<00:02:22.390> cluster

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
this spun-out like that's a cluster

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.630 
this spun-out like that's a cluster
right<00:02:22.989> there<00:02:23.170> but<00:02:23.319> if<00:02:23.410> I<00:02:23.530> get<00:02:23.590> that<00:02:23.739> a<00:02:24.130> Bruce

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.850 
right there but if I get that a Bruce
Lee<00:02:24.760> beginning<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:25.720> I<00:02:25.989> kind<00:02:26.530> of<00:02:26.620> I<00:02:26.770> don't

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
Lee beginning and I kind of I don't

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.740 
Lee beginning and I kind of I don't
really<00:02:27.010> honestly<00:02:27.790> like<00:02:27.970> starting<00:02:28.330> first<00:02:28.510> as

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
really honestly like starting first as

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.410 
really honestly like starting first as
the<00:02:28.840> people<00:02:29.170> drag<00:02:29.530> on<00:02:29.800> they<00:02:30.580> draft<00:02:30.940> off<00:02:31.150> you<00:02:31.390> a

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
the people drag on they draft off you a

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.630 
the people drag on they draft off you a
lot<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:31.950> it's<00:02:32.950> really<00:02:33.069> annoying<00:02:33.430> because

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
lot and it's really annoying because

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.949 
lot and it's really annoying because
when<00:02:33.760> they<00:02:33.940> spin<00:02:34.209> you<00:02:34.330> out<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.569> stuff<00:02:34.750> but

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
when they spin you out and stuff but

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.199 
when they spin you out and stuff but
boost<00:02:35.920> in<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.220> beginning<00:02:36.519> is<00:02:36.730> really

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
boost in the beginning is really

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.000 
boost in the beginning is really
important<00:02:37.720> as<00:02:38.140> you<00:02:38.170> get<00:02:38.440> it<00:02:38.620> you<00:02:38.650> might<00:02:38.920> be

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
important as you get it you might be

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.620 
important as you get it you might be
able<00:02:39.069> to<00:02:39.190> get<00:02:39.310> out<00:02:39.400> of<00:02:39.430> cluster<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.150> just<00:02:40.330> end

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
able to get out of cluster and just end

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.479 
able to get out of cluster and just end
up<00:02:40.720> getting<00:02:40.870> first<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:41.560> know<00:02:41.680> I'm<00:02:41.830> saying<00:02:42.130> but

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
up getting first you know I'm saying but

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.670 
up getting first you know I'm saying but
I'm<00:02:43.150> gonna<00:02:43.450> go<00:02:43.660> back<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.110> replay<00:02:44.319> that

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
I'm gonna go back and replay that

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.920 
I'm gonna go back and replay that
getting<00:02:45.100> in<00:02:45.220> slow<00:02:45.730> motion<00:02:46.000> just<00:02:46.480> see<00:02:46.750> how<00:02:46.870> you

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
getting in slow motion just see how you

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.979 
getting in slow motion just see how you
guys<00:02:47.230> can<00:02:47.500> test<00:02:47.769> it<00:02:47.980> out<00:02:48.100> and<00:02:48.569> just<00:02:49.569> taught<00:02:49.780> it

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
guys can test it out and just taught it

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.690 
guys can test it out and just taught it
right<00:02:50.140> even<00:02:50.590> though<00:02:50.769> I'm<00:02:51.310> going<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.459> go<00:02:51.580> out

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
right even though I'm going to go out
