00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 their plane was shot down in mid-flight these 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.490
 two pilots of the air force must 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.469
 now survive in a hostile environment 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:14.089
 their goal to join an extraction point 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:17.250
 to be evacuated without being spotted 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.779
 this is just an exercise but 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.140
 conditions are closest 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.910
 possible from reality to learn to 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.289
 tame their environment and be 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.289
 invisible to the eyes of the enemy 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.759
 it has to become an automatism 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.410
 for us and we were from the beginning 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.360
 good reflexes in a degraded situation 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.059
 to avoid endangering one's 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.160
 other danger the others at their heels 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.550
 twelve men trying to 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.379
 flush with the help of tracking dogs 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.329
 here every rustling every 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.399
 twig crunches is a track 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:56.640
 potential a game of cat and the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.989
 mouse military version one sounds try 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.850
 to put oneself on highest points 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.940
 possible to see them 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.650
 So here move far when 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.830
 is drunk from afar we look where he 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.020
 progresses and we intercept them after 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.000
 more than 35 hours of stalking through the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.570
 Landes forest with almost nothing to drink 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.880
 nor eat 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.030
 pilots arrive at the rendezvous point 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.740
 you an instructor is waiting for them 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.610
 explain to them the procedure of 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.850
 old helicopter recovery 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.479
 here the locked closed tag hooked 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.329
 imperative it's now up to their angel 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.299
 guardian to take over aboard 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.000
 this helicopter caracal a commando of 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.390
 paratroopers came get the two 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.439
 pilots for the exercise 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.979
 the helicopter is not allowed to 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:50.040
 ask but the device is cut for this 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.369
 type of mission after securing the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.590
 zoned 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.829
 the caracal little heliported the nine 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.369
 soldiers at once and better not 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.369
 scared of heights 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:04.860
 the goal of the training was successful 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:09.030
 apply the system serves for survival 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.800
 resistance escape and extractions a 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.860
 exercise they hope never 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.810
 must reproduce in real the last 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.200
 relief mission dates back to 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.510
 2014 in Niger in full serval operation 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.459
 a French pilot and his browser 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.400
 had ended up in enemy territory 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:30.230
 after an ejection he had been recovered 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.230
 in less than three hours
