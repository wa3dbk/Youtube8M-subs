00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
start with a nice light coat and let it

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.350 
start with a nice light coat and let it
build<00:00:41.129> up<00:00:41.309> from<00:00:41.460> there<00:00:46.160> as<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:47.910> see<00:00:48.180> as

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
build up from there as you can see as

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.439 
build up from there as you can see as
soon<00:00:48.600> as<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.870> hits<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.200> plastic<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:50.030> it<00:00:51.030> starts

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
soon as it hits the plastic it it starts

00:00:51.449 --> 00:01:07.630 
soon as it hits the plastic it it starts
to<00:00:51.539> generate<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.320> gloss<00:00:52.649> coating

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.490 

so<00:01:08.640> what<00:01:09.210> I've<00:01:09.329> learned<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.750> one<00:01:10.109> coat<00:01:10.469> of

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
so what I've learned is one coat of

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.830 
so what I've learned is one coat of
gloss<00:01:10.920> coating<00:01:11.250> will<00:01:11.549> dry<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.420> almost<00:01:12.630> like<00:01:12.810> a

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
gloss coating will dry to almost like a

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.200 
gloss coating will dry to almost like a
satin<00:01:13.319> finish<00:01:13.729> definitely<00:01:14.729> shinier<00:01:15.179> than

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
satin finish definitely shinier than

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.270 
satin finish definitely shinier than
original<00:01:15.750> plasti-dip<00:01:16.109> but<00:01:16.409> not<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> wet<00:01:16.950> gloss
