00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.430
 very good to all kids we are here 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.410
 in a new episode with again Carlos 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.389
 we have already carried these four 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.759
 games against him 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.980
 I do not know if you have raised the 41 assured 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.929
 that he has gone up and if not, this will be the 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.690
 second so let's go to them guys 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.920
 another shipment we will see how it is 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.390
 it gives us this time we are going to see where it leaves 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.550
 ok let's see 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.580
 is trying to put me the fertilizer but it's 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.150
 to be not 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.090
 stunned 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:39.470
 and we go with the first low 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.980
 it is not done in the first low 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:46.150
 if it's not because I'm failing a lot 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.150
 It was not for me 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.880
 to put 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.110
 to see if the measure comes, I have a 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.030
 theory that does not hit so many marker hits 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.110
 like the normal 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.110
 and today I confirmed it 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.620
 let's see for sure how this one hit him 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.440
 a hit marker to the notes you'll see 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.280
 if it did not hit him in the clear face 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.700
 of peace 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.100
 you have seen marquez the host does not hit 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.009
 both haymarket as normal peephole 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.960
 that 's a trick for 4 is very low 3 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.850
 I do not know I have no idea 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.900
 in the head man if he does not die in the 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.960
 head and flip what 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.500
 as we drive took you 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.500
 individual or what 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.150
 man is not always going to hit without margin 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.790
 is clear and more strongly through 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.280
 6 hill marquez so I prefer to use the 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.430
 Also, it goes better for distances 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.430
 short 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.979
 let's find this we go 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.560
 the game is going very well already 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:07.560
 very bad 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.560
 primark that can not be to take out is 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.080
 take to recharge to recharge 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.220
 wait for the fast 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.220
 how is it that I do not have time 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.350
 we go 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:29.050
 or to kill of bastard wanted to do me the 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:29.050
 ten without dying your bank 360 languages 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.569
 and those are the things that I do not understand 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.290
 when he scored them perfectly but I'm going 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.290
 running to 92 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.290
 I'm going to make a challenge to immolate myself 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.290
 together with him 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.150
 Now I had it done well because nothing 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.830

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:01.710

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.710
