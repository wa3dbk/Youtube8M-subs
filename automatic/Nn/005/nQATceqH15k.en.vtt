00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
out there and obviously through my

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.649 
out there and obviously through my
hitting<00:01:41.460> off<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.610> little<00:01:41.820> bit<00:01:42.030> because<00:01:42.210> i<00:01:42.390> was

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
hitting off a little bit because i was

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.870 
hitting off a little bit because i was
starting<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.200> not<00:01:43.740> do<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.369> well<00:01:44.399> wasn't<00:01:44.729> a

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
starting to not do so well wasn't a

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.280 
starting to not do so well wasn't a
little<00:01:45.119> bit<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.360> slump<00:01:45.689> if<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.020> want<00:01:46.200> to

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
little bit of a slump if you want to

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.990 
little bit of a slump if you want to
call<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.649> but<00:01:47.310> still<00:01:47.520> getting<00:01:47.790> hits

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
call it that but still getting hits

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.440 
call it that but still getting hits
every<00:01:48.780> game<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.409> i<00:01:49.439> guess<00:01:50.220> i<00:01:50.490> had<00:01:50.939> like<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.149> 10

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
every game so i guess i had like a 10

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.749 
every game so i guess i had like a 10
game<00:01:51.689> winning<00:01:51.990> streak<00:01:52.200> or<00:01:52.590> 10th<00:01:53.130> not<00:01:53.310> 10<00:01:53.579> game

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
game winning streak or 10th not 10 game

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.109 
game winning streak or 10th not 10 game
10<00:01:54.360> game<00:01:54.390> hitting<00:01:54.540> streak<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.790> believe

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
10 game hitting streak and I believe

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.359 
10 game hitting streak and I believe
that's<00:01:57.299> actually<00:01:57.780> still<00:01:58.020> going<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.860> just<00:01:59.189> got

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
that's actually still going I just got

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.789 
that's actually still going I just got
to<00:01:59.460> record<00:01:59.790> some<00:02:00.000> more<00:02:00.229> videos<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.380> stuff<00:02:01.560> so

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
to record some more videos and stuff so

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.389 
to record some more videos and stuff so
it<00:02:01.920> might<00:02:02.130> be<00:02:02.159> up<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.700> 15<00:02:03.329> or<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:04.189> but<00:02:05.189> I

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
it might be up to like 15 or so but I

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.969 
it might be up to like 15 or so but I
actually<00:02:05.850> am<00:02:06.119> now<00:02:06.270> on<00:02:06.680> veteran<00:02:07.680> like

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
actually am now on veteran like

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.059 
actually am now on veteran like

get a home run something that is a
little<00:02:37.200> rare<00:02:37.530> for<00:02:37.860> me<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:37.980> guess<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:39.209> another

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
little rare for me I guess and another

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.899 
little rare for me I guess and another
thing<00:02:40.019> that's<00:02:40.319> weird<00:02:40.590> why<00:02:41.370> do<00:02:41.430> we<00:02:41.579> have<00:02:41.640> blue

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
thing that's weird why do we have blue

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.509 
thing that's weird why do we have blue
helmets<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.599> mean<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.590> rest<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:43.920> our<00:02:43.980> uniforms

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.789 
helmets I mean the rest of our uniforms
are<00:02:44.700> red<00:02:45.060> but<00:02:45.359> I<00:02:45.569> don't<00:02:46.109> know<00:02:46.170> what<00:02:46.349> it<00:02:46.440> is<00:02:46.590> but

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
are red but I don't know what it is but

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.160 
are red but I don't know what it is but
I<00:02:46.980> love<00:02:47.400> like<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.299> was<00:02:48.390> saying<00:02:48.450> before<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:49.049> I'm

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
I love like I was saying before that I'm

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.780 
I love like I was saying before that I'm
able<00:02:49.319> to<00:02:49.440> be<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.620> contact<00:02:50.129> hitter<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.459> hit<00:02:50.640> to

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
able to be a contact hitter and hit to

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.690 
able to be a contact hitter and hit to
all<00:02:50.970> sides<00:02:51.329> of<00:02:51.599> the<00:02:51.690> field<00:02:52.280> that's<00:02:53.280> that's

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
all sides of the field that's that's

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.190 
all sides of the field that's that's
something<00:02:54.209> that<00:02:54.239> I<00:02:54.420> think<00:02:54.599> is<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.989> sign<00:02:55.170> of

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
something that I think is the sign of

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.690 
something that I think is the sign of
someone<00:02:55.680> who's<00:02:55.889> really<00:02:55.920> talented<00:02:56.340> as<00:02:56.670> a

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
someone who's really talented as a

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.220 
someone who's really talented as a
hitter<00:02:56.909> not<00:02:57.209> someone<00:02:57.510> who's<00:02:57.629> just<00:02:57.780> going<00:02:58.109> up

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
hitter not someone who's just going up

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.509 
hitter not someone who's just going up
there<00:02:58.409> swinging<00:02:59.720> so<00:03:00.720> in<00:03:00.930> this<00:03:01.049> at-bat<00:03:01.440> you<00:03:02.370> can

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
there swinging so in this at-bat you can

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:03.949 
there swinging so in this at-bat you can
see<00:03:02.760> how<00:03:02.970> I'm<00:03:03.090> struggling<00:03:03.389> a<00:03:03.629> little<00:03:03.690> bit<00:03:03.900> I

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
see how I'm struggling a little bit I

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.039 
see how I'm struggling a little bit I
check<00:03:04.349> swing<00:03:04.739> on<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.180> think<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.269> fastball<00:03:06.480> down

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
check swing on I think a fastball down

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.990 
check swing on I think a fastball down
that<00:03:07.319> was<00:03:07.530> he<00:03:08.069> throws<00:03:08.310> me<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.519> little<00:03:08.639> bit<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.849> a

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
that was he throws me a little bit of a

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.030 
that was he throws me a little bit of a
curve<00:03:09.269> up<00:03:09.599> top<00:03:09.810> or<00:03:10.079> maybe<00:03:10.319> a<00:03:10.409> change<00:03:10.739> up<00:03:10.889> with

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
curve up top or maybe a change up with

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.250 
curve up top or maybe a change up with
some<00:03:11.220> movement<00:03:11.639> and<00:03:11.790> I<00:03:12.480> actually<00:03:12.750> ripped<00:03:13.139> that

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
some movement and I actually ripped that

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.210 
some movement and I actually ripped that
one<00:03:13.319> so<00:03:13.950> that<00:03:14.280> worked<00:03:14.519> out<00:03:14.639> and<00:03:15.569> now<00:03:16.099> what<00:03:17.099> is

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
one so that worked out and now what is

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.640 
one so that worked out and now what is
this<00:03:17.430> I<00:03:17.900> don't<00:03:18.900> know<00:03:18.959> if<00:03:19.079> anyone<00:03:19.260> else<00:03:19.470> has

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
this I don't know if anyone else has

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.439 
this I don't know if anyone else has
been<00:03:19.769> having<00:03:20.040> this<00:03:20.129> issue<00:03:20.340> with<00:03:20.669> the<00:03:20.760> game<00:03:20.970> but
