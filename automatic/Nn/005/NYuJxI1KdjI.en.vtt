00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.970
 videoaktiv today I have one 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.500
 product out to introduce and 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.620
 to test 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.340
 that actually rather for compact snap 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.769
 thought is 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.020
 It is here that look looks like 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.449
 a very simple objective comes up 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.869
 the smartphone is called cyber 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.170
 shot dsc tx10 comes completely out of the house 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.539
 sony will just turn it on to smartphones 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.189
 stuck and what you can do with it 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.199
 I want to show that now, of course 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.790
 It is primarily a camera 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.530
 Of course you can also use videos 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.329
 Record and how it all 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.040
 works and how to use the camera 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.040
 controls that I show now 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:54.399
 the sony dsc tx10 is actually one 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.079
 normal compact camera you can see them 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.940
 not really on each of the camera 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.250
 For the first time she thinks thats easy 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.050
 a normal look you can get anywhere 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.300
 it unplugged or somewhere 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.430
 smartphone connects again to the optics 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.140
 Of course that's not the idea 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.820
 actually a very simple mechanical 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.550
 bracket here is the back of it 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.050
 here with a suspension so that the 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.009
 Smartphone here on it simply 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.840
 can be plugged 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.789
 and then it actually looks like one 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.429
 But it is quite a classic camera 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:24.039
 not all the operation is done 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:26.979
 the smartphone is the connection to the camera 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:29.140
 is done by wlan the camera itself 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.899
 it is relatively stupid how to handle the whole thing 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.940
 I explain that now because 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.500
 you need your own app and how 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.100
 you can see that I show now 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.119
 just the most important thing is there 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.789
 Of course that one time the camera 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:46.119
 turns on because when the camera is 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:48.190
 automatically builds a wlan on this 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.850
 wlan I have now in the settings 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.349
 choose 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.910
 of course I have in the case now 

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:53.590
 already done or had that 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.450
 I've ever connected so I 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.369
 do not need to enter passwords from 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.259
 basically the first time you pick up 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.690
 the access data at the back of the 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.470
 akkufach out there they are in there 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:08.110
 then I have to go next time 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.899
 the play mary app will open the plans in the 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.239
 rap comes from sony is free and 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.660
 can then just look for the device itself 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.770
 connect with it and as we see now 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.069
 I can show you already 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.480
 She shows a preview and what I do 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.480
 of course I can do it now 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.680
 trigger and thus a single picture 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.120
 now capture something here between the 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.349
 equipment happens completely 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.879
 regardless of being with each other 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.310
 are connected they are only by 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.780
 wireless network connected 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.459
 You can not set much you can 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.769
 Zoom in here, of course 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.080
 so that somehow the colleague here 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:47.620
 get closer with his camera a bit 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.170
 or you can get here in the 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.940
 attitudes still decide whether one 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.810
 the self-timer of every ten seconds 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.260
 wants to push 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.390
 if you like the image size 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.510
 vienna 16 to 9 or if you have a smaller one 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.849
 and 18 megapixels or just in smaller 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.530
 resolution 18 megapixel is already one 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.810
 quite a lot as a photo trigger already 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.790
 very nice and synonymous of the quality 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.450
 okay in the interior of the camera 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.190
 a 200 way works so one 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.430
 compact camera the sony already longer 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.780
 There's something here in the market 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.400
 it works that one of each 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.859
 single picture you already recorded 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.650
 has a so-called back image in the 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:28.650
 archive of the iphones or the android 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.049
 phones come back so you can 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.120
 directly on facebook or youtube or where 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.840
 Whatever it takes 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.440
 or you can communicate further 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.849
 also say that the camera at each 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.379
 is the triggering beep sound of itself 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.909
 but certainly not the idea 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:46.889
 Idea is more likely to be you 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.079
 hiding places in the corner and then just 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.700
 hiding his recordings 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.470
 bit for me the problem and also 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.329
 so in practice 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.239
 I have no option the camera 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.579
 Turn off the wlan with other devices 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.750
 So what's not possible here is that 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.199
 means i have to contact you all the time 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.810
 to let 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:05.669
 After a good two hours, the battery is empty 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.349
 so I can not do it anymore 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:09.329
 because they record all the time 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.010
 was a little bad would be nice 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.400
 you can turn it on and off via app 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.780
 and so spare the battery and so all 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.729
 others in the room are not every time 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.019
 confront that with the camera 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.459
 re-enter and then turn off 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.190
 is it forgetting that you 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.930
 photographing is relatively fast 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.580
 otherwise done as a classic 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.870
 camera as you of course 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.910
 a bit awkward because you are allowed 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.220
 Of course, never forget that somehow 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.900
 you always turn on the phone first 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.250
 then the camera must turn on 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.180
 have to connect then I have to 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.729
 call an app 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.169
 Only then can I record if you can do that 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.830
 everyone wants or not 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.320
 decide 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.330
 I found it very exciting the reactions 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.599
 The people were very diverse everyone 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.349
 fans scary exciting many say that 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:50.940
 is the future 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:52.710
 if that's really it's crucial 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:57.419
 The device will be released in October 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:59.099
 market and well who buys it decides 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.720
 So that's a great concept or is 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:03.090
 not then not me personally 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.610
 think it's so exciting that I have it 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.430
 as gadget would have it 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:12.340
 with 250 euro also relatively price 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:15.210
 relatively I know but I think so 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:18.250
 very exciting and above all very funny 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.630
 I'll show you some pictures now 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.210
 show it a few more videos we 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.680
 have done with it and I wish a lot 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.330
 fun with more videos we 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.980
 have just continued 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.170
 look what comes in connection so everything 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.360
 and best of all i like it 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:36.120
 click or subscribe 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.120
 down there right up to the next time 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.840
 Hello there are a few more 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.250
 recordings from practice 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.950
 Today it would not be quite like that 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.270
 beautiful no matter we do it anyway always 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.170
 again the sun shines i hope i 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.300
 have now even happiness in the 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.590
 detail shots me a few examples 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.670
 can intersect pictures 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.670
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.550
 on 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.229
 on 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.720
 to control wonderfully like about 1.5 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.550
 meters away from the camera 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.740
 picks up 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.530
 So here on the display I am so 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.430
 even though at 1 25 meters for 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.060
 the delay 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.060
 clear to see 

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.750
 rubbish
