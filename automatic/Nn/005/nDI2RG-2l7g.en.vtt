again stocks deficits I would I thought

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.600 
again stocks deficits I would I thought
that<00:00:40.350> these<00:00:40.440> were<00:00:40.500> made<00:00:40.739> like<00:00:40.949> in<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.190> factory

process<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.550> start<00:00:50.820> off<00:00:50.909> with<00:00:51.089> a<00:00:51.120> piece<00:00:51.360> of

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
process you start off with a piece of

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.990 
process you start off with a piece of
steel<00:00:51.720> for<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.080> blade<00:00:52.339> mark<00:00:53.339> out<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.580> shape

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
steel for the blade mark out the shape

steel for the blade mark out the shape
of<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.019> blade<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.830> then<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.339> cut<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.790> out

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
of the blade and then you cut it out

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.340 
of the blade and then you cut it out
with<00:00:58.350> an<00:00:58.470> angle<00:00:58.799> grinder<00:00:58.830> and<00:00:59.699> then<00:01:00.350> after

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
with an angle grinder and then after

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.979 
with an angle grinder and then after
that<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:02.010> cut<00:01:02.610> out<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.760> piece<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.089> rod<00:01:03.479> round

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
that you cut out a piece of rod round

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.590 
that you cut out a piece of rod round
rod<00:01:04.610> which<00:01:05.610> had<00:01:05.729> brought<00:01:05.909> over<00:01:06.150> here<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
rod which had brought over here to the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.320 
rod which had brought over here to the
forge<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:08.010> put<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.370> the<00:01:08.490> Forge<00:01:08.760> eat<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.180> up

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
forge and I put in the Forge eat it up

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.890 
forge and I put in the Forge eat it up
and<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.810> hammer<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.970> end<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.540> hammer

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
and I hammer it and on the end I hammer

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.780 
and I hammer it and on the end I hammer
it<00:01:13.110> into<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.350> square<00:01:13.799> here<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> part

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
it into a square here this is a part

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.280 
it into a square here this is a part
that's<00:01:14.880> going<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.150> go<00:01:15.270> into<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.570> handle<00:01:15.990> and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
that's going to go into the handle and

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.860 
that's going to go into the handle and
that<00:01:17.040> way<00:01:17.280> when<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.670> put<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.180> into<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.540> handle

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
that way when I put it into the handle

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.860 
that way when I put it into the handle
you<00:01:18.990> got<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> square<00:01:19.530> peg<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.190> a<00:01:20.340> square<00:01:20.370> hole

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
you got a square peg in a square hole

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.230 
you got a square peg in a square hole
instead<00:01:21.870> of<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.290> square<00:01:22.770> peg<00:01:23.010> in<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.430> round<00:01:23.850> peg

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
instead of a square peg in a round peg

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.790 
instead of a square peg in a round peg
in<00:01:24.300> a<00:01:24.540> round<00:01:24.570> hole<00:01:24.870> and<00:01:25.050> then<00:01:25.110> also<00:01:25.350> right<00:01:25.770> here

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
in a round hole and then also right here

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.280 
in a round hole and then also right here
you'll<00:01:26.640> see<00:01:26.670> I've<00:01:27.030> hammered<00:01:27.480> it<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.870> that<00:01:28.080> it

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
you'll see I've hammered it so that it

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.220 
you'll see I've hammered it so that it
is<00:01:28.320> narrower<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.610> direction<00:01:29.930> than<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.110> is

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
is narrower in this direction than it is

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.740 
is narrower in this direction than it is
in<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.740> direction<00:01:31.800> so<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.910> what<00:01:33.330> happens

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
in this direction so that what happens

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.750 
in this direction so that what happens
is<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.230> stronger<00:01:34.830> going<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:35.310> way<00:01:35.520> which<00:01:35.730> is

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
is it's stronger going this way which is

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.120 
is it's stronger going this way which is
all<00:01:36.120> the<00:01:36.150> forces<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.230> the<00:01:37.260> trowel<00:01:37.590> or<00:01:37.620> in<00:01:37.950> this

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
all the forces on the trowel or in this

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.630 
all the forces on the trowel or in this
way<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.730> then<00:01:39.210> they<00:01:39.510> bend<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.830> then<00:01:41.340> I

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
way and then they bend it and then I

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.200 
way and then they bend it and then I
take<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.030> next<00:01:42.240> door<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.690> slot<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.320> come<00:01:43.740> back

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
take it next door and slot it come back

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.290 
take it next door and slot it come back
put<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.420> slide<00:01:46.050> this<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.980> then<00:01:47.370> oxygen

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
put the slide this on and then oxygen

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.530 
put the slide this on and then oxygen
acetylene<00:01:48.570> weld<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.650> together<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.540> then

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
acetylene weld this together and then

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.790 
acetylene weld this together and then
while<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:51.960> still<00:01:52.230> hot<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:53.840> hammer<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.110> it's

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
while it's still hot I hammer it it's

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.860 
while it's still hot I hammer it it's
basically<00:01:56.130> Forge<00:01:56.550> welding<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.150> hammer<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.659> so

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
basically Forge welding you hammer it so

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.780 
basically Forge welding you hammer it so
that<00:01:58.230> you<00:01:58.409> can<00:01:58.560> press<00:01:58.800> the<00:01:58.950> molecules<00:01:59.520> and

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
that you can press the molecules and

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.380 
that you can press the molecules and
everything

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
everything

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.850 
everything
together<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.790> then<00:02:02.790> smooth<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.659> out<00:02:03.870> then<00:02:04.830> I

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
together and then smooth this out then I

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.940 
together and then smooth this out then I
grind<00:02:05.400> that<00:02:05.670> smooth<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.930> then<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.530> bring<00:02:07.830> it

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
grind that smooth and then I bring it

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.010 
grind that smooth and then I bring it
over<00:02:08.160> here<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.640> then<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.149> put<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.539> in<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.720> Forge

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
over here and then I put it in the Forge

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.809 
over here and then I put it in the Forge
heat<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.410> up<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.800> then<00:02:10.920> hammer<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:11.400> into<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
heat it up and then hammer this into the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.790 
heat it up and then hammer this into the
curve<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:15.450> it's<00:02:15.600> at<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:15.870> stage<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.200> last

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
curve so it's at this stage the last

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.670 
curve so it's at this stage the last
thing<00:02:17.100> is<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.760> wire<00:02:18.450> wheel<00:02:18.780> lifts<00:02:19.170> off<00:02:19.320> to<00:02:19.560> get

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
thing is to wire wheel lifts off to get

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.610 
thing is to wire wheel lifts off to get
all<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.980> slag<00:02:20.280> off<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:21.320> coat<00:02:22.320> it<00:02:22.470> with<00:02:22.500> a

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
all the slag off of it coat it with a

coat of clear varnish or acrylic and

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.440 
coat of clear varnish or acrylic and
install<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.110> handle<00:02:28.739> on<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.280> then<00:02:30.060> drill

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
install a handle on it and then drill

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.120 
install a handle on it and then drill
through<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.959> handle<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.530> put<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.739> rivet

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
through the handle and put a rivet

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.030 
through the handle and put a rivet
through<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:34.050> difference<00:02:34.440> most<00:02:34.680> trials

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
through and the difference most trials

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.370 
through and the difference most trials
they<00:02:35.520> they<00:02:35.910> were<00:02:35.970> just<00:02:36.209> shoved<00:02:36.900> on<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.260> can

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
they they were just shoved on you can

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.170 
they they were just shoved on you can
see<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.680> rivet<00:02:37.980> right<00:02:38.160> through<00:02:38.640> here<00:02:38.940> yeah

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
see the rivet right through here yeah

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.090 
see the rivet right through here yeah
that<00:02:39.750> can't<00:02:40.050> come<00:02:40.260> apart<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.920> biggest

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
that can't come apart the biggest

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.370 
that can't come apart the biggest
problem<00:02:41.519> with<00:02:41.670> small<00:02:42.000> tools<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.019> handles

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
problem with small tools is the handles

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.770 
problem with small tools is the handles
cut<00:02:43.560> down<00:02:43.769> or<00:02:44.070> them<00:02:44.730> breaking<00:02:45.030> well<00:02:45.390> this<00:02:45.600> is

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
cut down or them breaking well this is

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.640 
cut down or them breaking well this is
much<00:02:46.019> stouter<00:02:46.380> than<00:02:46.880> your<00:02:47.880> average<00:02:48.060> tool<00:02:48.650> it

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
much stouter than your average tool it

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.729 
much stouter than your average tool it
has<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:50.510> right<00:02:51.510> in<00:02:51.660> here<00:02:51.959> it's<00:02:52.140> very<00:02:52.410> thick

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
has a right in here it's very thick

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.229 
has a right in here it's very thick
that's<00:02:53.070> where<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.280> trowel<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:53.880> usually<00:02:54.209> very

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
that's where a trowel is usually very

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.590 
that's where a trowel is usually very
well<00:02:54.570> gives<00:02:54.959> yep<00:02:55.230> that's<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.560> earth<00:02:55.739> in<00:02:56.010> and

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
well gives yep that's the earth in and

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.080 
well gives yep that's the earth in and
this<00:02:57.600> is<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.870> much<00:02:58.170> thicker<00:02:58.470> rod<00:02:58.920> than<00:02:59.910> you

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
this is a much thicker rod than you

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.030 
this is a much thicker rod than you
would<00:03:00.269> find<00:03:00.540> on<00:03:00.870> most<00:03:01.230> travels<00:03:01.739> they'll<00:03:01.890> use

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
would find on most travels they'll use

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.620 
would find on most travels they'll use
about<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.340> three-eighths<00:03:02.760> inch<00:03:03.030> rod<00:03:03.269> and<00:03:03.510> this

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
about a three-eighths inch rod and this

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.780 
about a three-eighths inch rod and this
is<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:03.780> half<00:03:04.019> inch<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:05.010> it's<00:03:05.160> squeezed<00:03:05.519> up

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
is a half inch and that it's squeezed up

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.550 
is a half inch and that it's squeezed up
so<00:03:05.970> it's<00:03:06.120> stronger<00:03:06.540> in<00:03:06.630> this<00:03:06.750> direction<00:03:06.930> well

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
so it's stronger in this direction well

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.440 
so it's stronger in this direction well
above<00:03:07.829> I've<00:03:08.070> noticed<00:03:08.549> that<00:03:08.760> there's<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.209> lot

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
above I've noticed that there's a lot

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.110 
above I've noticed that there's a lot
more<00:03:09.510> than<00:03:10.230> just<00:03:10.260> one<00:03:10.799> type<00:03:11.100> of<00:03:11.130> trowel<00:03:11.579> to<00:03:11.850> you

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
more than just one type of trowel to you

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.030 
more than just one type of trowel to you
have<00:03:12.329> several<00:03:12.660> Lane<00:03:12.900> out<00:03:13.079> here<00:03:13.230> can<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.440> give

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
have several Lane out here can you give

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.979 
have several Lane out here can you give
me<00:03:14.130> a<00:03:14.160> synopsis<00:03:14.790> of<00:03:15.269> what<00:03:15.450> they<00:03:15.600> are<00:03:15.750> this

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
me a synopsis of what they are this

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.720 
me a synopsis of what they are this
trowel<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.769> I'm<00:03:16.890> making<00:03:17.220> right<00:03:17.370> here<00:03:17.579> this

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
trowel that I'm making right here this

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.940 
trowel that I'm making right here this
is<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:17.970> large<00:03:18.269> trial<00:03:18.690> it's<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.989> full-size<00:03:19.500> trowel

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
is a large trial it's a full-size trowel

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.229 
is a large trial it's a full-size trowel
and<00:03:20.100> this<00:03:20.280> for<00:03:20.459> people<00:03:20.700> with<00:03:20.790> pretty<00:03:21.030> big

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
and this for people with pretty big

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.530 
and this for people with pretty big
hands<00:03:21.750> then<00:03:22.530> I<00:03:22.560> make<00:03:23.040> two<00:03:23.310> more<00:03:23.579> trowel<00:03:24.000> this

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
hands then I make two more trowel this

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.449 
hands then I make two more trowel this
one<00:03:24.780> right<00:03:24.959> here<00:03:25.019> is<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.560> medium<00:03:26.070> you<00:03:26.190> can<00:03:26.340> see

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
one right here is a medium you can see

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.220 
one right here is a medium you can see
it's<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.670> same<00:03:26.910> length<00:03:27.209> as<00:03:27.450> that<00:03:27.480> just<00:03:27.780> narrow

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
it's the same length as that just narrow

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.319 
it's the same length as that just narrow
but<00:03:28.410> it's<00:03:28.530> narrower<00:03:28.920> and<00:03:29.220> then<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.000> short

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
but it's narrower and then the short

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.850 
but it's narrower and then the short
which<00:03:30.540> I<00:03:30.660> don't<00:03:30.840> have<00:03:31.079> right<00:03:31.350> here<00:03:31.380> is<00:03:31.680> the

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
which I don't have right here is the

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.030 
which I don't have right here is the
same<00:03:32.280> width<00:03:32.610> is<00:03:32.850> this<00:03:33.480> but<00:03:33.810> it's<00:03:33.959> shorter<00:03:34.769> so

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
same width is this but it's shorter so

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.410 
same width is this but it's shorter so
really<00:03:35.190> then<00:03:35.430> it's<00:03:35.610> a<00:03:35.700> difference<00:03:36.180> in<00:03:36.329> the

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
really then it's a difference in the

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.030 
really then it's a difference in the
size<00:03:36.570> of<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.840> user<00:03:37.079> depending<00:03:37.470> on<00:03:37.739> which<00:03:37.890> one

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
size of the user depending on which one

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.949 
size of the user depending on which one
of<00:03:38.070> those<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:38.370> choose<00:03:38.700> now<00:03:39.150> these<00:03:39.660> other

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
of those you choose now these other

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.720 
of those you choose now these other
three<00:03:40.200> here<00:03:40.470> explain<00:03:40.769> those<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:40.980> me<00:03:41.280> these<00:03:41.489> are

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
three here explain those to me these are

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.729 
three here explain those to me these are
variants<00:03:42.510> on<00:03:42.630> a<00:03:42.660> trowel<00:03:42.989> for<00:03:43.290> instance<00:03:43.590> this

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
variants on a trowel for instance this

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.610 
variants on a trowel for instance this
one<00:03:43.799> right<00:03:44.160> here<00:03:44.220> is<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:45.049> same<00:03:46.049> as<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.380> large

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
one right here is the same as the large

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.280 
one right here is the same as the large

two that I make one of them is a little
flatter<00:04:44.550> this<00:04:45.330> one<00:04:45.570> is<00:04:45.720> a<00:04:45.750> little<00:04:45.840> deeper<00:04:46.320> this

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
flatter this one is a little deeper this

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.710 
flatter this one is a little deeper this
one's<00:04:46.710> called<00:04:46.889> a<00:04:47.070> sweeter<00:04:47.400> and<00:04:47.729> for<00:04:48.630> a<00:04:48.660> number

one's called a sweeter and for a number

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.340 
one's called a sweeter and for a number
of<00:04:48.990> reasons<00:04:49.139> it's<00:04:49.710> both<00:04:50.220> a<00:04:50.400> leader<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.870> a

we<00:04:55.770> work<00:04:56.010> in<00:04:56.160> very<00:04:56.400> narrow<00:04:56.669> spaces<00:04:57.030> and<00:04:57.419> then

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
we work in very narrow spaces and then

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.040 
we work in very narrow spaces and then
as<00:04:58.440> a<00:04:58.740> you<00:04:59.400> can<00:04:59.550> pry<00:04:59.850> weeds<00:05:00.180> out<00:05:00.419> with<00:05:00.750> it<00:05:00.900> it's

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
as a you can pry weeds out with it it's

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.290 
as a you can pry weeds out with it it's
real<00:05:01.200> good<00:05:01.350> for<00:05:01.470> tap<00:05:01.710> rooted<00:05:02.070> weeds<00:05:02.310> and<00:05:02.729> then

real good for tap rooted weeds and then

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.300 
real good for tap rooted weeds and then
you<00:05:03.600> see<00:05:03.810> these<00:05:03.960> little<00:05:04.139> notches<00:05:04.470> right<00:05:04.979> here

you do with this is you put a pack of
the<00:05:17.190> seed<00:05:17.400> right<00:05:17.640> here<00:05:18.060> and<00:05:18.240> then<00:05:18.720> you<00:05:18.810> start

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
the seed right here and then you start

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.409 
the seed right here and then you start
tapping<00:05:19.560> like<00:05:19.770> this<00:05:20.070> and<00:05:20.460> the<00:05:20.940> seeds<00:05:21.210> will

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
tapping like this and the seeds will

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.020 
tapping like this and the seeds will
stage<00:05:21.810> as<00:05:22.169> they<00:05:22.380> march<00:05:22.620> down<00:05:22.890> here<00:05:23.250> and<00:05:23.430> it

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
stage as they march down here and it

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.640 
stage as they march down here and it
beats<00:05:24.240> the<00:05:24.419> heck<00:05:24.570> out<00:05:24.810> of<00:05:24.840> doing<00:05:25.200> this<00:05:25.320> after

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
beats the heck out of doing this after

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.560 
beats the heck out of doing this after
hand<00:05:25.890> exactly<00:05:26.490> so<00:05:26.640> it<00:05:26.820> you<00:05:26.970> can<00:05:27.120> use<00:05:27.270> it<00:05:27.300> as<00:05:27.539> a

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
hand exactly so it you can use it as a
