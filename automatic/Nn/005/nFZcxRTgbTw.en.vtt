00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
what on earth what out of earth happened

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.010 
what on earth what out of earth happened
here<00:00:12.050> who<00:00:13.050> knows<00:00:13.280> today<00:00:14.280> I<00:00:14.309> have<00:00:14.700> something

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
here who knows today I have something

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.400 
here who knows today I have something
pretty<00:00:16.020> neat<00:00:16.170> shape<00:00:16.410> so<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.850> tried<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.750> create<00:00:18.900> a

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
pretty neat shape so I tried to create a

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.370 
pretty neat shape so I tried to create a
propulsion<00:00:22.410> rocket<00:00:23.220> buying<00:00:24.030> cup<00:00:24.270> thing<00:00:24.630> so

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
propulsion rocket buying cup thing so

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.779 
propulsion rocket buying cup thing so
basically<00:00:25.740> it's<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> minecart<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.610> can

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
basically it's a minecart that can

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.990 
basically it's a minecart that can
mm-hmm<00:00:27.779> jump<00:00:28.650> over<00:00:28.770> gaps<00:00:28.980> using<00:00:29.550> its<00:00:29.789> ur

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
mm-hmm jump over gaps using its ur

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000 
mm-hmm jump over gaps using its ur
rocket<00:00:30.330> launchers<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.380> here's<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.830> mind

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.010 
rocket launchers so here's the mind

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.260 
rocket launchers so here's the mind
going<00:00:32.279> question<00:00:32.580> you<00:00:32.669> can<00:00:32.760> see<00:00:32.850> it's<00:00:33.120> got<00:00:33.239> a

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
going question you can see it's got a

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.240 
going question you can see it's got a
little<00:00:33.510> bit<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.720> an<00:00:33.780> upgrade<00:00:33.900> in<00:00:34.590> attachments

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
little bit of an upgrade in attachments

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.520 
little bit of an upgrade in attachments
and<00:00:35.970> it's<00:00:36.120> pretty<00:00:36.239> simple<00:00:36.420> when<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.170> push<00:00:37.379> it

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
and it's pretty simple when I push it

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.530 
and it's pretty simple when I push it
and<00:00:37.680> if<00:00:37.830> it<00:00:37.920> goes<00:00:38.100> over<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.790> activates<00:00:39.270> rail

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
and if it goes over this activates rail

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.540 
and if it goes over this activates rail
with<00:00:39.899> lapis<00:00:40.350> Anthony<00:00:40.829> well<00:00:41.370> basically

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
with lapis Anthony well basically

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.479 
with lapis Anthony well basically
activate<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.450> sir<00:00:42.750> demo<00:00:43.260> mode<00:00:43.380> so<00:00:43.710> let's<00:00:43.920> take

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
activate it sir demo mode so let's take

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.250 
activate it sir demo mode so let's take
a<00:00:44.520> look<00:00:44.610> at<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:45.050> little<00:00:46.050> bit<00:00:46.399> connection

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
a look at this little bit connection

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.720 
a look at this little bit connection
start<00:00:49.260> flying<00:00:49.410> over<00:00:49.710> there<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.430> will<00:00:50.520> jump<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
start flying over there it will jump the

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.310 
start flying over there it will jump the
gap<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.270> get<00:00:51.600> hit<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.780> sides

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
gap I get hit the sides

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.319 
gap I get hit the sides
that's<00:00:52.649> lovely<00:00:52.980> alright<00:00:53.879> let's<00:00:54.030> think<00:00:54.120> never

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
that's lovely alright let's think never

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.250 
that's lovely alright let's think never
look<00:00:54.480> at<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:54.899> with<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.079> bigger

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
look at that but with the bigger

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.360 
look at that but with the bigger
brighter<00:00:56.180> environment<00:00:57.210> yeah<00:00:57.989> just<00:00:58.230> magic<00:00:58.530> can

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
brighter environment yeah just magic can

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.029 
brighter environment yeah just magic can
sort<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.579> see<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.969> little<00:01:00.270> bit<00:01:00.420> better<00:01:00.800> see<00:01:01.800> just

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
sort of see a little bit better see just

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.779 
sort of see a little bit better see just
by<00:01:02.219> saving<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.550> gap<00:01:02.700> I<00:01:03.090> guess<00:01:03.750> nothing<00:01:04.520> so<00:01:05.520> this

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:05.789 
by saving a gap I guess nothing so this

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:07.639 
by saving a gap I guess nothing so this
would<00:01:06.000> make<00:01:06.149> absolutely<00:01:07.140> no<00:01:07.200> sense<00:01:07.320> of

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649 
would make absolutely no sense of

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:09.800 
would make absolutely no sense of
minecraft<00:01:07.979> turbo<00:01:08.520> cards<00:01:08.970> that's<00:01:09.210> ridiculous

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
minecraft turbo cards that's ridiculous

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.469 
minecraft turbo cards that's ridiculous
that<00:01:09.990> doesn't<00:01:10.229> fit<00:01:10.380> minecraft<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.009> do<00:01:11.220> but<00:01:12.149> I'm

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
that doesn't fit minecraft it do but I'm

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.120 
that doesn't fit minecraft it do but I'm
just<00:01:12.539> thinking<00:01:12.899> hey<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.500> should<00:01:13.560> make<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> debit

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
just thinking hey I should make a debit

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.740 
just thinking hey I should make a debit
card<00:01:14.280> that'll<00:01:14.580> be<00:01:14.729> pretty<00:01:14.880> neat<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.569> did

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
card that'll be pretty neat and it did

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.719 
card that'll be pretty neat and it did
turn<00:01:15.929> out<00:01:16.080> pretty<00:01:16.170> neat<00:01:16.440> so<00:01:16.770> there's<00:01:17.369> nothing

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
turn out pretty neat so there's nothing

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.790 
turn out pretty neat so there's nothing
particularly<00:01:18.660> complex<00:01:19.110> about<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.560> it's

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
particularly complex about this it's

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.820 
particularly complex about this it's
pretty<00:01:20.039> simplistic<00:01:20.490> actually<00:01:21.830> especially

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
pretty simplistic actually especially

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.990 
pretty simplistic actually especially
just<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.160> mock-up<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.520> something<00:01:23.729> else<00:01:23.819> I<00:01:23.940> was

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
just a mock-up of something else I was

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.460 
just a mock-up of something else I was
gonna<00:01:24.149> try<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.599> I'm<00:01:24.929> pretty<00:01:25.080> happy<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
gonna try and I'm pretty happy the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.109 
gonna try and I'm pretty happy the
result<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.340> can<00:01:26.459> actually<00:01:26.550> turn<00:01:26.849> on<00:01:27.060> the

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
result so I can actually turn on the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.969 
result so I can actually turn on the
thrusters<00:01:27.690> manually<00:01:28.170> which<00:01:28.470> presses<00:01:28.800> burn

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
thrusters manually which presses burn

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.699 
thrusters manually which presses burn
all<00:01:29.670> right<00:01:29.880> there<00:01:30.209> we<00:01:30.300> go<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.840> by<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.619> way

00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:31.709 
all right there we go and by the way

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:35.150 
all right there we go and by the way
this<00:01:31.830> is<00:01:31.950> fire<00:01:32.420> blue-white<00:01:33.420> fire<00:01:33.750> not<00:01:34.590> water<00:01:34.800> I

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
this is fire blue-white fire not water I

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.460 
this is fire blue-white fire not water I
mean<00:01:35.310> water<00:01:36.060> could<00:01:36.360> also<00:01:36.509> make<00:01:36.750> sense<00:01:36.929> in<00:01:37.380> the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
mean water could also make sense in the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.830 
mean water could also make sense in the
context<00:01:38.009> but<00:01:38.190> it's<00:01:38.459> fire<00:01:38.670> blue-white<00:01:39.630> fire

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
context but it's fire blue-white fire

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.020 
context but it's fire blue-white fire
because<00:01:40.140> blue<00:01:40.800> fire<00:01:41.039> is<00:01:41.220> more<00:01:41.369> extreme<00:01:41.700> more

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
because blue fire is more extreme more

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.309 
because blue fire is more extreme more
powerful<00:01:42.539> than<00:01:42.780> red<00:01:42.959> fire

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:43.319 
powerful than red fire

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:45.760 
powerful than red fire
that's<00:01:43.770> because<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.849> is<00:01:44.970> an<00:01:45.090> extreme

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
that's because this is an extreme

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.870 
that's because this is an extreme
extreme<00:01:46.770> invention<00:01:47.340> oh<00:01:49.580> that's<00:01:50.580> pretty<00:01:50.700> neat

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
extreme invention oh that's pretty neat

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.999 
extreme invention oh that's pretty neat
and<00:01:51.209> the<00:01:52.200> interesting<00:01:52.590> thing<00:01:52.619> about<00:01:52.770> this

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
and the interesting thing about this

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.070 
and the interesting thing about this
there<00:01:53.190> actually<00:01:53.489> is<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.849> I've<00:01:54.090> actually

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
there actually is that I've actually

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.559 
there actually is that I've actually
managed<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.590> animate<00:01:56.099> a<00:01:56.550> block<00:01:57.000> model<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.539> I

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
managed to animate a block model and I

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:59.120 
managed to animate a block model and I
didn't<00:01:57.750> realize<00:01:57.929> you<00:01:58.020> could<00:01:58.170> do<00:01:58.289> this<00:01:58.440> I<00:01:58.770> knew

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
didn't realize you could do this I knew

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.809 
didn't realize you could do this I knew
you<00:01:59.280> could<00:01:59.429> animate<00:01:59.670> um<00:02:00.229> block<00:02:01.229> textures<00:02:01.819> but

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
you could animate um block textures but

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:03.800 
you could animate um block textures but
I<00:02:02.849> didn't<00:02:03.030> know<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.179> could<00:02:03.300> actually<00:02:03.390> animate

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
I didn't know you could actually animate

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.540 
I didn't know you could actually animate
block<00:02:04.590> models<00:02:04.920> using<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.280> said<00:02:05.399> we're

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
block models using I said we're

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.010 
block models using I said we're
backwards<00:02:05.729> tip<00:02:06.119> me<00:02:06.239> so<00:02:06.390> that's<00:02:06.479> pretty<00:02:06.750> neat

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
backwards tip me so that's pretty neat

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.279 
backwards tip me so that's pretty neat
so<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.319> just<00:02:07.440> uses<00:02:07.739> like<00:02:07.860> one<00:02:08.069> single<00:02:08.489> module

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
so this just uses like one single module

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.320 
so this just uses like one single module
well<00:02:10.289> actually<00:02:10.410> -<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.580> off<00:02:11.670> state<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:12.090> one

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
well actually - so the off state is one

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.839 
well actually - so the off state is one
block<00:02:12.540> model<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.830> on<00:02:13.950> state<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.489> different

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
block model the on state is a different

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.520 
block model the on state is a different
one<00:02:14.939> but<00:02:15.299> like<00:02:15.629> when<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:15.989> switches<00:02:16.260> between

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
one but like when it switches between

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.170 
one but like when it switches between
like<00:02:17.060> animations

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
like animations

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.910 
like animations
that's<00:02:18.930> not<00:02:19.079> switching<00:02:19.349> block<00:02:19.680> mod<00:02:19.799> does

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
that's not switching block mod does

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.390 
that's not switching block mod does
anything

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
anything

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.550 
anything
it's<00:02:20.549> the<00:02:20.670> same<00:02:20.849> one<00:02:21.060> so<00:02:21.329> that's<00:02:21.989> pretty<00:02:22.319> neat

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
it's the same one so that's pretty neat

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.220 
it's the same one so that's pretty neat
if<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.730> understand<00:02:24.659> Rousseau<00:02:24.900> folks<00:02:25.079> if<00:02:25.170> you

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
if you understand Rousseau folks if you

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.059 
if you understand Rousseau folks if you
don't<00:02:25.379> then<00:02:25.530> that's<00:02:25.620> probably<00:02:25.829> like

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
don't then that's probably like

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.280 
don't then that's probably like
completely<00:02:26.519> uninteresting<00:02:27.120> see<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.420> but

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
completely uninteresting see you but

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.289 
completely uninteresting see you but
that's<00:02:28.530> pretty<00:02:28.709> much<00:02:28.829> all<00:02:29.099> there<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.549> it

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
that's pretty much all there is to it

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.729 
that's pretty much all there is to it
you<00:02:30.569> know<00:02:30.659> actually<00:02:30.930> it's<00:02:31.409> a<00:02:31.470> little<00:02:31.560> bit

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
you know actually it's a little bit

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.229 
you know actually it's a little bit
differently<00:02:32.069> today<00:02:32.340> if<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.879> enjoyed<00:02:33.120> the
