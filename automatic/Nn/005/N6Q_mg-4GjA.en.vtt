this<00:00:19.750> is<00:00:19.930> one<00:00:20.140> that<00:00:20.349> I<00:00:20.380> made<00:00:20.619> for<00:00:20.890> in<00:00:21.130> US<00:00:21.939> law

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
this is one that I made for in US law

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.929 
this is one that I made for in US law
professor<00:00:23.039> I'm<00:00:24.039> going<00:00:24.310> to<00:00:24.400> send<00:00:24.610> it<00:00:24.700> to<00:00:24.730> him

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
professor I'm going to send it to him

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.060 
professor I'm going to send it to him
with<00:00:25.149> a<00:00:25.180> finger<00:00:25.869> and<00:00:26.050> thumb<00:00:26.200> support<00:00:26.619> so<00:00:26.829> true

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
with a finger and thumb support so true

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.190 
with a finger and thumb support so true
the<00:00:27.220> next<00:00:27.489> week<00:00:27.719> but<00:00:28.719> of<00:00:28.840> course<00:00:29.079> the

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
the next week but of course the

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.749 
the next week but of course the
slingshot<00:00:29.649> is<00:00:29.800> nothing<00:00:30.160> without<00:00:30.489> rubber

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759 
slingshot is nothing without rubber

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.209 
slingshot is nothing without rubber
rubber<00:00:31.540> wasn't<00:00:32.079> invented<00:00:32.500> before<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:33.040> mid

00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:33.219 
rubber wasn't invented before the mid

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.139 
rubber wasn't invented before the mid
1800s<00:00:33.670> though<00:00:34.120> by<00:00:34.480> Charles<00:00:34.840> Goodyear<00:00:35.050> um

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
1800s though by Charles Goodyear um

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.529 
1800s though by Charles Goodyear um
however<00:00:37.739> what<00:00:38.739> did<00:00:39.100> the<00:00:39.610> Dennis<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.210> Menace

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:40.539 
however what did the Dennis the Menace

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:43.829 
however what did the Dennis the Menace
kids<00:00:40.899> use<00:00:41.530> before<00:00:41.890> rubber<00:00:42.370> was<00:00:42.579> invented<00:00:42.839> well

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839 
kids use before rubber was invented well

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:46.319 
kids use before rubber was invented well
let's<00:00:44.019> have<00:00:44.109> a<00:00:44.170> look<00:00:44.350> at<00:00:44.469> it<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:46.120> this<00:00:46.269> is

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
let's have a look at it so this is

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.349 
let's have a look at it so this is
probably<00:00:46.809> the<00:00:47.019> easiest<00:00:47.230> thing<00:00:47.859> it's<00:00:48.820> actually

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:49.359 
probably the easiest thing it's actually

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:52.799 
probably the easiest thing it's actually
a<00:00:49.600> sling<00:00:50.760> thoughts<00:00:51.760> are<00:00:51.909> called<00:00:52.120> David<00:00:52.570> sling

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
a sling thoughts are called David sling

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.139 
a sling thoughts are called David sling
because<00:00:53.199> that<00:00:53.530> is<00:00:53.710> what<00:00:54.429> King<00:00:54.699> David

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
because that is what King David

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.739 
because that is what King David
supposedly<00:00:55.780> used<00:00:56.440> when<00:00:56.829> he<00:00:56.859> killed<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:58.329> giant

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:58.749 
supposedly used when he killed the giant

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:01.649 
supposedly used when he killed the giant
Goliath<00:00:59.199> and<00:00:59.379> it's<00:01:00.309> very<00:01:00.489> easy<00:01:00.789> because<00:01:01.120> what

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
Goliath and it's very easy because what

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:03.930 
Goliath and it's very easy because what
you<00:01:01.749> do<00:01:01.899> is<00:01:01.929> it<00:01:02.559> has<00:01:02.739> a<00:01:02.800> loop<00:01:03.069> on<00:01:03.219> one<00:01:03.429> side<00:01:03.699> and

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
you do is it has a loop on one side and

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.320 
you do is it has a loop on one side and
you<00:01:04.449> slip<00:01:04.720> it<00:01:04.839> over<00:01:05.110> one<00:01:05.260> of<00:01:05.409> your<00:01:05.560> fingers<00:01:06.070> and

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
you slip it over one of your fingers and

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.540 
you slip it over one of your fingers and
then<00:01:07.330> it<00:01:07.450> has<00:01:07.600> a<00:01:07.630> pouch<00:01:07.960> and<00:01:08.290> the<00:01:09.040> other<00:01:09.190> end

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
then it has a pouch and the other end

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.700 
then it has a pouch and the other end
just<00:01:09.970> as<00:01:10.120> a<00:01:10.150> knot<00:01:10.420> so<00:01:10.690> you<00:01:11.140> can<00:01:11.380> put<00:01:11.560> your

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
just as a knot so you can put your

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.730 
just as a knot so you can put your
projectile<00:01:12.220> in<00:01:12.460> this<00:01:12.969> case<00:01:13.390> a<00:01:13.659> used<00:01:14.170> golf<00:01:14.500> ball

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
projectile in this case a used golf ball

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.080 
projectile in this case a used golf ball
and<00:01:14.950> then<00:01:15.670> you<00:01:15.790> can<00:01:15.969> swing<00:01:16.299> it<00:01:16.329> and<00:01:16.689> throw<00:01:16.990> it

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
and then you can swing it and throw it

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:29.719 
and then you can swing it and throw it
let's<00:01:19.090> do<00:01:19.270> that

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.539 

very<00:01:30.689> powerful<00:01:31.259> but<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.770> takes<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.280> lot<00:01:32.520> of

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
very powerful but it takes a lot of

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:44.340 
very powerful but it takes a lot of
practice<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.659> hit<00:01:33.840> anything<00:01:34.259> with<00:01:34.409> it

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.370 

so<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:46.189> improvement<00:01:46.909> of<00:01:47.090> that<00:01:47.810> handheld

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
so the improvement of that handheld

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.399 
so the improvement of that handheld
sling<00:01:48.920> is<00:01:49.130> actually<00:01:49.969> a<00:01:50.000> sling<00:01:50.509> on<00:01:50.780> a<00:01:50.840> stick

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
sling is actually a sling on a stick

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.850 
sling is actually a sling on a stick
it's<00:01:52.149> basically<00:01:53.149> the<00:01:53.450> same<00:01:53.659> setup<00:01:53.960> but<00:01:54.289> it's

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
it's basically the same setup but it's

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.039 
it's basically the same setup but it's
attached<00:01:55.159> to<00:01:55.369> a<00:01:55.399> pole<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:55.909> can<00:01:56.420> really<00:01:56.929> be

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
attached to a pole and can really be

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.139 
attached to a pole and can really be
built<00:01:57.289> within<00:01:57.530> five<00:01:57.860> minutes<00:01:58.250> and<00:01:58.819> it<00:01:58.939> has<00:01:59.119> a

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
built within five minutes and it has a

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.039 
built within five minutes and it has a
loop<00:01:59.420> that<00:01:59.929> goes<00:02:00.229> over<00:02:00.649> a<00:02:00.679> nail<00:02:01.100> or<00:02:02.049> anything

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
loop that goes over a nail or anything

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.609 
loop that goes over a nail or anything
else<00:02:03.500> like<00:02:03.740> a<00:02:03.799> small<00:02:04.219> rod<00:02:04.459> and<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:06.110> idea<00:02:06.439> is

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
else like a small rod and the idea is

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.820 
else like a small rod and the idea is
that<00:02:06.649> if<00:02:07.399> you<00:02:07.459> throw<00:02:07.939> it<00:02:08.170> it<00:02:09.170> will<00:02:09.410> detach

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
that if you throw it it will detach

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.259 
that if you throw it it will detach
automatically<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.299> shortfalls<00:02:13.269> so

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
automatically and the shortfalls so

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.289 
automatically and the shortfalls so
because<00:02:14.750> of<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.200> long<00:02:15.920> lever<00:02:16.310> this<00:02:16.910> is<00:02:17.090> very

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
because of the long lever this is very

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:18.819 
because of the long lever this is very
powerful<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:18.019> can<00:02:18.049> actually<00:02:18.440> use<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:18.799> to

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
powerful and you can actually use it to

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.400 
powerful and you can actually use it to
throw<00:02:19.489> very<00:02:19.700> heavy<00:02:20.000> projectiles<00:02:20.690> with

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
throw very heavy projectiles with

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.360 
throw very heavy projectiles with
tremendous<00:02:21.709> force<00:02:23.019> so<00:02:24.019> again<00:02:24.739> we<00:02:24.950> take<00:02:24.980> our

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
tremendous force so again we take our

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:39.640 
tremendous force so again we take our
golf<00:02:25.610> ball<00:02:36.489> so<00:02:37.489> this<00:02:37.670> is<00:02:37.910> really<00:02:38.660> powerful<00:02:38.900> but

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
golf ball so this is really powerful but

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.470 
golf ball so this is really powerful but
it<00:02:39.769> takes<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:40.069> long<00:02:40.310> time<00:02:40.370> to<00:02:40.670> be<00:02:40.910> accurate<00:02:41.329> with

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
it takes a long time to be accurate with

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:49.230 
it takes a long time to be accurate with
it

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.670 

you

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.949 

so<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.709> thought<00:02:57.069> about<00:02:57.269> would<00:02:58.269> have<00:02:58.480> been<00:02:58.659> would

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
so I thought about would have been would

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.539 
so I thought about would have been would
it<00:02:59.049> have<00:02:59.230> been<00:02:59.260> possible<00:02:59.920> to<00:02:59.980> make<00:03:00.159> a

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
it have been possible to make a

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.000 
it have been possible to make a
slingshot<00:03:00.849> like<00:03:01.299> weapon<00:03:02.109> without<00:03:02.290> any<00:03:02.739> rubber

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
slingshot like weapon without any rubber

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.089 
slingshot like weapon without any rubber
at<00:03:03.280> all<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:04.870> I<00:03:04.900> looked<00:03:05.170> at<00:03:05.290> ancient<00:03:05.769> weapon

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
at all so I looked at ancient weapon

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.360 
at all so I looked at ancient weapon
design<00:03:06.459> and<00:03:06.700> I<00:03:07.150> found<00:03:07.480> that<00:03:07.750> they<00:03:07.900> used

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
design and I found that they used

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.229 
design and I found that they used
torsion<00:03:10.349> weapons<00:03:11.349> like<00:03:12.129> ballestas<00:03:12.670> and<00:03:12.909> so<00:03:13.060> on

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
torsion weapons like ballestas and so on

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.170 
torsion weapons like ballestas and so on
that<00:03:13.750> used<00:03:14.019> twisted<00:03:14.620> rope<00:03:14.859> as<00:03:15.129> an<00:03:15.760> energy

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
that used twisted rope as an energy

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.220 
that used twisted rope as an energy
source<00:03:16.209> and<00:03:17.340> you<00:03:18.340> see<00:03:18.579> that<00:03:19.019> twisted<00:03:20.019> rope

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
source and you see that twisted rope

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.949 
source and you see that twisted rope
actually<00:03:20.680> works<00:03:20.890> pretty<00:03:20.980> good

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
actually works pretty good

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.649 
actually works pretty good
so<00:03:22.959> they<00:03:23.109> use<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.319> for<00:03:23.470> catapults<00:03:24.280> and<00:03:24.659> valleys

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:25.659 
so they use it for catapults and valleys

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:30.420 
so they use it for catapults and valleys
stars<00:03:27.090> this<00:03:28.090> is<00:03:28.180> really<00:03:28.450> only<00:03:28.569> hemp<00:03:28.930> rope<00:03:29.430> very

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
stars this is really only hemp rope very

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.879 
stars this is really only hemp rope very
simple<00:03:30.849> and<00:03:31.090> it's<00:03:31.540> already<00:03:31.840> pre<00:03:32.109> dip<00:03:32.349> preet

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
simple and it's already pre dip preet

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.440 
simple and it's already pre dip preet
twisted<00:03:34.109> it's<00:03:35.109> hard<00:03:35.409> as<00:03:35.560> stone<00:03:35.799> already<00:03:36.450> so

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
twisted it's hard as stone already so

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.379 
twisted it's hard as stone already so
this<00:03:37.629> really<00:03:37.989> works<00:03:38.230> like<00:03:38.439> a<00:03:39.060> combination<00:03:40.060> of

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
this really works like a combination of

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.780 
this really works like a combination of
a<00:03:40.480> crossbow<00:03:40.989> in<00:03:41.290> a<00:03:41.379> slingshot<00:03:41.620> so<00:03:42.519> you<00:03:42.579> can

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
a crossbow in a slingshot so you can

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.720 
a crossbow in a slingshot so you can
pull<00:03:43.000> it<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:43.299> release<00:03:43.689> it<00:03:43.900> and<00:03:44.370> as<00:03:45.370> you<00:03:45.519> see

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
pull it and release it and as you see

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.699 
pull it and release it and as you see
there's<00:03:46.060> force<00:03:46.359> behind<00:03:46.569> it<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:49.290> if<00:03:50.290> you<00:03:50.530> need

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
there's force behind it and if you need

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.069 
there's force behind it and if you need
more<00:03:50.919> power<00:03:51.159> what<00:03:52.150> you<00:03:52.269> can<00:03:52.389> simply<00:03:52.720> do<00:03:52.870> is

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
more power what you can simply do is

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.830 
more power what you can simply do is
twist<00:03:53.769> it<00:03:54.010> a<00:03:54.099> little<00:03:54.129> bit<00:03:54.400> more<00:03:54.730> and<00:03:54.970> you<00:03:55.720> get

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
twist it a little bit more and you get

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.879 
twist it a little bit more and you get
automatically<00:03:56.500> getting<00:03:56.769> more<00:03:56.950> power<00:03:58.709> you<00:03:59.709> can

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
automatically getting more power you can

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.719 
automatically getting more power you can
do<00:04:00.010> that<00:04:00.190> on<00:04:00.280> both<00:04:00.430> sides<00:04:02.250> friction<00:04:03.250> holds<00:04:03.489> it

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:03.729 
do that on both sides friction holds it

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:07.849 
do that on both sides friction holds it
in<00:04:03.849> place

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:14.420 

so<00:04:08.859> let's<00:04:09.069> shoot<00:04:09.280> with<00:04:09.549> it

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:22.280 

you

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:28.189 

you

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:32.370 

so<00:04:29.199> I<00:04:29.230> think<00:04:29.440> I<00:04:30.120> proved<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.540> theory<00:04:31.990> that<00:04:32.020> it

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
so I think I proved the theory that it

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.500 
so I think I proved the theory that it
is<00:04:32.500> possible<00:04:32.949> to<00:04:33.010> make<00:04:33.280> a<00:04:33.310> slingshot<00:04:33.669> like

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
is possible to make a slingshot like

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.800 
is possible to make a slingshot like
weapon<00:04:35.080> without<00:04:35.290> any<00:04:35.680> rubber<00:04:35.980> at<00:04:36.160> all<00:04:36.600> is<00:04:37.600> it

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
weapon without any rubber at all is it

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:38.219 
weapon without any rubber at all is it
good

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
good

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.980 
good
well<00:04:38.650> not<00:04:39.100> really<00:04:39.550> it's<00:04:40.060> totally<00:04:40.449> weak<00:04:40.660> and

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
well not really it's totally weak and

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.230 
well not really it's totally weak and
very<00:04:41.320> very<00:04:41.650> clumsy<00:04:42.160> but<00:04:42.729> I<00:04:42.760> think<00:04:43.120> it's

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
very very clumsy but I think it's

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.270 
very very clumsy but I think it's
interesting<00:04:43.389> and<00:04:44.380> of<00:04:44.530> course<00:04:44.740> you<00:04:44.860> can<00:04:45.040> see

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
interesting and of course you can see

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.550 
interesting and of course you can see
that<00:04:45.639> if<00:04:46.060> you<00:04:46.270> turn<00:04:46.479> this<00:04:46.630> into<00:04:46.690> a<00:04:46.990> crossbow

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
that if you turn this into a crossbow

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.510 
that if you turn this into a crossbow
and<00:04:48.490> you<00:04:48.729> use<00:04:48.940> a<00:04:48.970> lot<00:04:49.270> more<00:04:49.300> rope<00:04:50.110> and<00:04:50.520> pre

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
and you use a lot more rope and pre

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.520 
and you use a lot more rope and pre
twist<00:04:51.820> it<00:04:52.000> much<00:04:52.180> harder<00:04:52.360> and<00:04:52.720> probably<00:04:53.380> also

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
twist it much harder and probably also

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.080 
twist it much harder and probably also
take<00:04:53.830> a<00:04:53.860> different<00:04:54.160> type<00:04:54.400> of<00:04:54.430> rope<00:04:54.760> that's<00:04:54.970> a

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
take a different type of rope that's a

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.969 
take a different type of rope that's a
little<00:04:55.330> bit<00:04:55.510> more<00:04:55.690> elastic<00:04:56.169> like<00:04:56.620> modern

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
little bit more elastic like modern

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.310 
little bit more elastic like modern
paracord<00:04:57.550> you<00:04:58.060> can<00:04:58.240> make<00:04:58.419> a<00:04:58.449> really<00:04:58.780> really

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
paracord you can make a really really

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.770 
paracord you can make a really really
powerful<00:04:59.500> weapon<00:05:00.130> out<00:05:00.250> of<00:05:00.400> this<00:05:00.570> but<00:05:01.570> this<00:05:01.720> is

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
powerful weapon out of this but this is

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.750 
powerful weapon out of this but this is
probably<00:05:02.470> my<00:05:02.950> weirdest<00:05:03.580> slingshot<00:05:04.570> I<00:05:05.760> still

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
probably my weirdest slingshot I still

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.480 
probably my weirdest slingshot I still
like<00:05:06.910> it<00:05:06.940> even<00:05:07.210> if<00:05:07.450> it's<00:05:07.600> weak<00:05:08.130> so<00:05:09.130> as<00:05:09.310> a<00:05:09.340> little

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
like it even if it's weak so as a little

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.840 
like it even if it's weak so as a little
bonus<00:05:09.850> I<00:05:10.270> made<00:05:10.960> a<00:05:10.990> new<00:05:11.320> project<00:05:12.070> tie<00:05:12.430> for<00:05:12.729> my

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
bonus I made a new project tie for my

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.080 
bonus I made a new project tie for my
blunderbuss<00:05:13.389> slingshot<00:05:13.870> it's<00:05:14.470> actually<00:05:14.800> a

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
blunderbuss slingshot it's actually a

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.719 
blunderbuss slingshot it's actually a
GoPro<00:05:16.090> arrow

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
GoPro arrow

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:19.830 
GoPro arrow
unfortunately<00:05:18.729> the<00:05:19.060> protective<00:05:19.570> case

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
unfortunately the protective case

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.430 
unfortunately the protective case
doesn't<00:05:20.260> fit<00:05:20.440> so<00:05:20.760> I<00:05:22.050> hope<00:05:23.050> that<00:05:23.229> GoPro

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
doesn't fit so I hope that GoPro

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.800 
doesn't fit so I hope that GoPro
survives<00:05:24.039> the<00:05:24.250> shot<00:05:24.490> we'll<00:05:25.150> just<00:05:25.360> shoot<00:05:25.600> it

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
survives the shot we'll just shoot it

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.450 
survives the shot we'll just shoot it
straight<00:05:25.960> up<00:05:26.169> in<00:05:26.410> the<00:05:26.470> air<00:05:26.590> while<00:05:26.949> the<00:05:26.979> camera

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
straight up in the air while the camera

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.360 
straight up in the air while the camera
is<00:05:27.490> mine<00:05:27.789> ok<00:05:28.510> the<00:05:28.660> camera<00:05:28.810> is<00:05:29.020> running<00:05:29.199> we<00:05:30.160> now

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
is mine ok the camera is running we now

00:05:30.370 --> 00:06:21.119 
is mine ok the camera is running we now
put<00:05:30.610> it<00:05:30.900> inside<00:05:31.900> of<00:05:31.960> the<00:05:32.200> weapon

00:06:21.119 --> 00:06:21.129 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:25.899 

that<00:06:22.129> shattered<00:06:22.750> the<00:06:24.039> NCD<00:06:25.039> from<00:06:25.490> the<00:06:25.639> little

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:25.909
