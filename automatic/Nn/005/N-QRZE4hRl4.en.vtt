00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.340
 many more toxins elapsed it presents a new excuse 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.510
 Haiti 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.729
 very advantageous use 

00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:11.549
 so hop like that since the update for six weeks and then of 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.999
 the appearance of strikes including among others to increase but today these 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:17.380
 keystrokes that will interest us with use 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.779
 eight others interesting 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.079
 and aesthetics ie that of the fonts then to start 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.539
 like that none of my constructions 11% and auspicious art this kind of 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:31.669
 decoration especially for its titles the windows of this manor the shutter gives 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.489
 very very badly it is to deal with it too much districom our 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.360
 given to the listener what to be filled is ugly 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.290
 so what am I going to show you so just an audi wall r8 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.670
 the houses but could quite use tricks on your house it's 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.750
 true that it gives for relatively good 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.220
 so I give it 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.220
 all the space for titles that is to say 2 out of 2 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.160
 so here we are with 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.230
 our very hectic life immediately showed how to evolve 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.530
 it's extremely simple you take your bow you need four 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.590
 you filed like this 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.440
 a cube 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.390
 hopscotch a cube of oyster shells each time 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.720
 and then jacques préaux and just closed the works like these and 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.420
 we listened magnificent volley 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.200
 good then the illusion I found frankly or rather well in Russia's 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.890
 luxury as it from the inside first 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.440
 I do not see any difference 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.700
 from the outside it's pretty - ready for really bad we know just as 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.700
 sharecropping session 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.860
 materials that do not go with them at all with the use of olé 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.660
 will not do it 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.010
 in any case it works 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.000
 really good 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.070
 with that sand as see and power 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.280
 t i suggest to try note unless the world cup it really has to 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.380
 this man 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.190
 at the rank of super nice 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.510
 so hop for example you can train to test it ensures various 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.510
 constructions 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.960
 for the terraced houses you will see strangely that gives really 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.840
 well 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.070
 and for 100 th 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.150
 when you have several points of the side by side it really gives you 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.149
 smaller fours well towards attention then what's going on 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:16.089
 especially like this 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:18.349
 especially like this houses 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:19.559
 you put % 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:23.339
 sand next to the public here is a wooden beam and there you can 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:25.589
 redo the model 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:27.059
 m 

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:29.729
 these 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:31.219
 then afp 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.739
 but above but not required 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.779
 I do it because it's the second floor I like to see if this censorship 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.129
 at my floor 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.889
 to not be too repetitive 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.889
 that's it and so you can 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.120
 to make it frankly presentiment I do not know what you think in particular 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.120
 for houses and mediaeval 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:59.349
 often we 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.349
 with a basic how to say building in may 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.129
 but it often looks like that with a wooden base 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.959
 really the illusion is good alone suggest you to test its punctuation 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.989
 construction you tell me in the comments what you think in 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.139
 waiting i'll tell you in toronto for new texting tips and the 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.939
 somb chain do you wear well eggman crash-test
