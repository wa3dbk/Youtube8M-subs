00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello everyone knows who you have for 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.490
 a new video so this time I 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.990
 will show you a pretty nice bug that 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.240
 is present on league of legend 2 then 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.070
 2 then to rim later seems pages 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.920
 so in fact in the description of 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.719
 your status you can put html 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.600
 and suddenly you can have fun 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.039
 to make statutes pretty fun so I 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.810
 think you must have already seen it with 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.000
 your contact list and the big 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.609
 question that arise people and 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.230
 how to put a lot of texts in 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.279
 this area so first of all I'm going 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.790
 to show you what to do 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.380
 for m to have fun changing the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.290
 text size put colors and 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.040
 so it's actually it's html by these 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.260
 html 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.430
 vasic these clickers cookies I'm wrong 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.070
 that's when you started writing 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.570
 in a cast iron tag the size so that 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.640
 they were some 60 that's the size 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.170

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.600
 hexadecimal to find them I you 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.370

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.890
 you also use your photoshop or 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.570
 other if you obviously have and you 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.110
 copy the little code that is there so 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.330

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.700

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.869

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.030
 how to make a long text to do 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.520
 a long text you copy the code or the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.430

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.540

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.799
 addressed to 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.810
 we all know how to select it in full 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.369
 with control to you go on your 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.540
 client league of legends so except the 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.340
 rapt here be there click here so some 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.229
 times will require a system where click and hop there 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.689
 you take claude like that and that's it 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.329

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.579

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.280
 more 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.770

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.510
 validate normally it is valid all 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.210
