00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.890 
you can get frost we've actually got
some<00:00:10.950> suggestions<00:00:11.429> telling<00:00:12.269> me<00:00:12.360> where<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.719> go

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
some suggestions telling me where to go

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.810 
some suggestions telling me where to go
but<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.380> didn't<00:00:13.830> really<00:00:13.950> like<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.280> suggestion

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
but I didn't really like the suggestion

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.000 
but I didn't really like the suggestion
so<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.000> found<00:00:15.269> this<00:00:15.480> place<00:00:15.719> so<00:00:16.529> on<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.830> map<00:00:16.980> you

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
so I found this place so on the map you

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.439 
so I found this place so on the map you
can<00:00:17.190> see<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.369> big<00:00:17.609> circle<00:00:17.820> with<00:00:18.029> an<00:00:18.119> X<00:00:18.270> going

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
can see a big circle with an X going

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.670 
can see a big circle with an X going
through<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.779> this<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.109> place<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.380> most

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
through it this is the place that most

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.740 
through it this is the place that most
people<00:00:20.010> will<00:00:20.070> tell<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.430> farm<00:00:20.789> but<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.449> found

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
people will tell you to farm but I found

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.880 
people will tell you to farm but I found
that<00:00:21.869> there's<00:00:22.080> way<00:00:22.350> too<00:00:22.380> much<00:00:22.650> competition

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
that there's way too much competition

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.710 
that there's way too much competition
there<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:23.880> decided<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.330> find<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.570> new

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
there so I decided to find a new

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.599 
there so I decided to find a new
location<00:00:24.900> which<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.890> just<00:00:26.070> west<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.490> the

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
location which is just west of the

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.460 
location which is just west of the
argent<00:00:27.000> tournament<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.930> while<00:00:28.140> you're<00:00:28.289> here

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
argent tournament so while you're here

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.200 
argent tournament so while you're here
there<00:00:28.680> will<00:00:28.740> be<00:00:28.859> three<00:00:29.160> main<00:00:29.400> areas<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:30.060> all

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
there will be three main areas that all

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.240 
there will be three main areas that all
have<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> bunch<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.900> mobs<00:00:31.140> spawning<00:00:31.470> around<00:00:31.859> and

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
have a bunch of mobs spawning around and

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.860 
have a bunch of mobs spawning around and
it's<00:00:32.340> relatively<00:00:32.730> easy<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.210> gather<00:00:33.390> them<00:00:33.690> all

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
it's relatively easy to gather them all

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.690 
it's relatively easy to gather them all
up<00:00:34.079> as<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.350> can<00:00:34.440> see<00:00:34.649> here<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.100> video<00:00:35.340> and

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
up as you can see here in the video and

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.310 
up as you can see here in the video and
is<00:00:36.030> using<00:00:36.210> my<00:00:36.390> arrange<00:00:36.660> abilities<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.170> get

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
is using my arrange abilities to get

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.229 
is using my arrange abilities to get
them<00:00:37.469> closer<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.950> me<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.460> they're<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
them closer to me so that they're in the

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.750 
them closer to me so that they're in the
range<00:00:39.480> for<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.110> AoE<00:00:40.350> looting<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.610> goes

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
range for the AoE looting so it goes

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.729 
range for the AoE looting so it goes
relatively<00:00:42.329> fast<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.840> mobs<00:00:43.050> also<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.620> an

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
relatively fast the mobs also have an

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.130 
relatively fast the mobs also have an
insanely<00:00:44.280> high<00:00:44.640> respawn<00:00:45.210> rate<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.079> you

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
insanely high respawn rate so you

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.510 
insanely high respawn rate so you
shouldn't<00:00:46.559> really<00:00:46.739> have<00:00:46.980> any<00:00:47.160> trouble

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
shouldn't really have any trouble

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.549 
shouldn't really have any trouble
finding<00:00:47.670> any<00:00:48.000> new<00:00:48.149> mobs<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.600> kill<00:00:48.809> it's

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
finding any new mobs to kill it's

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.930 
finding any new mobs to kill it's
basically<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.219> straight<00:00:50.520> line<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.820> can

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
basically in a straight line you can

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.029 
basically in a straight line you can
start<00:00:51.120> at<00:00:51.239> one<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.230> areas<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.739> go<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
start at one of the areas and go to the

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.410 
start at one of the areas and go to the
next<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.489> then<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.670> next<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.059> can<00:00:54.149> simply

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
next and then the next you can simply

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.330 
next and then the next you can simply
just<00:00:54.480> fly<00:00:54.899> back<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.739> first<00:00:55.949> one<00:00:56.190> and

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
just fly back to the first one and

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.799 
just fly back to the first one and
restart<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.879> process<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.510> by<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.690> time

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
restart the process and by the time

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.360 
restart the process and by the time
you're<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.379> next<00:00:58.590> one<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.129> I'll<00:00:59.250> be

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
you're to the next one so I'll be

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.250 
you're to the next one so I'll be
respawned<00:00:59.820> again<00:01:00.120> that's<00:01:00.600> what<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.780> like<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.140> do

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
respawned again that's what I like to do

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.709 
respawned again that's what I like to do
when<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.530> makes<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.890> very<00:01:02.219> quick<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.820> easy<00:01:03.090> so

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
when it makes it very quick and easy so

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.119 
when it makes it very quick and easy so
like<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.899> mentioned<00:01:04.019> earlier<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.739> video<00:01:04.860> i

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
like I mentioned earlier in the video i

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.070 
like I mentioned earlier in the video i
prefer<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.489> spot<00:01:05.820> over<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> other<00:01:06.450> locations

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
prefer the spot over the other locations

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.870 
prefer the spot over the other locations
that<00:01:07.229> people<00:01:07.500> use<00:01:07.710> because<00:01:07.920> there<00:01:08.549> just<00:01:08.580> isn't

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
that people use because there just isn't

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.940 
that people use because there just isn't
any<00:01:09.390> competition<00:01:10.049> here<00:01:10.229> at<00:01:10.350> all<00:01:10.530> as<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.860> can

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
any competition here at all as you can

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.620 
any competition here at all as you can
see<00:01:11.159> there's<00:01:11.580> not<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.760> single<00:01:12.030> player<00:01:12.390> here

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
see there's not a single player here

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.929 
see there's not a single player here
with<00:01:12.810> me<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.619> only<00:01:13.799> time<00:01:14.220> I've<00:01:14.400> ever<00:01:14.520> ran

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
with me and the only time I've ever ran

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.850 
with me and the only time I've ever ran
into<00:01:15.150> another<00:01:15.270> player<00:01:15.689> here<00:01:16.080> was<00:01:16.500> when<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
into another player here was when the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.649 
into another player here was when the
guy<00:01:17.040> was<00:01:17.280> trying<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.729> do<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.000> quest<00:01:18.299> i<00:01:18.450> was<00:01:18.570> in

guy was trying to do the quest i was in

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.210 
guy was trying to do the quest i was in
this<00:01:18.750> area<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.560> really<00:01:19.740> wasn't<00:01:19.920> even

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
this area so it really wasn't even
