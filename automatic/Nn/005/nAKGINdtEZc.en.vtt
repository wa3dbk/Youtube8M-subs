00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:07.170
 is a triad chord formed by the 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:09.790
 fundamental third major and fifth just 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.150
 to build the chord we will place 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.210
 Heart finger on third string second 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.940
 fret 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.730
 index finger on fourth string second 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.730
 fret and ring finger on second string 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.279
 second fret 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.430
 the first and fifth strings are played at 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:32.270
 air has the bass on the fifth string 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.610
 to the air that is a the the sixth rope not 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.910
 must be touched 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.490
 the middle and ring index fingers are 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.070
 placed on the same fret 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.620
 you'll be more comfortable if you put your fingers 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.910
 forming a staircase somewhat inclined to 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.910
 Regarding the frets 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.790
 look for the most comfortable position of your 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.880
 thumb in the images you see positions 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.640
 extreme that you should avoid the same as 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.309
 in the seventh chord yes the doll will 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.920
 turn slightly to the left to 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.470
 correctly place the thumb that 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.800
 wants to look out the back of the 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.880
 mast watches the position of your wrist and 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.310
 avoid hiding it 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.729
 practice construction several times 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.039
 of the chord visualizing the middle finger 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.549
 shortly the hand will build the footprint in 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:28.900
 block 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:31.420
 before stepping remember to step on and relax 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.340
 he plays the arpeggio three times 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.050
 raised in the video with the 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.050
 fingerings that we already know 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.450
 Y 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.370
 i 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.640
 ah 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.390
 do not 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.620
 ah 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.430
 do not 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.430
 ah 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.650
 ah
