00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.189
 Now I will talk about the festival which we 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.960
 started this year it's such 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.579
 experiment we still do not understand ourselves 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.579
 what happens therefore we call it 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:35.420
 our first international annual 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:38.150
 festival called just fresh art 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.829
 we really like this name and me 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:48.800
 it seems to be fully consistent with that 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:50.750
 what do we do you understand when you 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.810
 doing art and in some kind 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.050
 the moment you feel you have found something 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.970
 his theme his technique his people his 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.980
 audience you start to grow 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.500
 it is in this that often happens with 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.140
 great artists and with small 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.090
 by artists it doesn't matter in general 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.710
 that any troupe any artist in 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.930
 some point starts to hang on 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:16.070
 some kind of your own theme and develop only 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.260
 her and the story is pretty simple yes nothing 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.960
 there is no terrible thing in it and it is normal 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.260
 art continues to live and develop 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.180
 but fresh and innovative avant-garde 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.060
 art is no longer happening in such 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.850
 pipes that exist 10-20 15 years and 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.430
 so on and so we thought that we want 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.610
 see what is so super new and 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.330
 super fresh happens in the world in the world 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.420
 modern dance 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.360
 where to look for it 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.909
 innovative such a story and we thought 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.010
 that graduates and students of some very 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.020
 good prestigious dance academies 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.390
 most likely these are the people who have not yet 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.119
 found yourself in this dance such 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.040
 art and the world and they are looking try 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.170
 something completely new to them 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.510
 there is something that has not tried yet 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.369
 No one can ever be is not always 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.040
 very convincingly maybe this is not 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.379
 always truly something masterpiece 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.060
 but this is a search and look at it very much 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.069
 interesting because all the same 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.620
 great art grows out of some 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.930
 student sampling that's why we 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.540
 came up with a piece of fresh art festival from 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.520
 students but probably for students 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.780
 because 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.670
 adults are probably crazy too 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:34.130
 interesting to look at students in 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:35.840
 first of all so we did this 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.300
 festival and this year we will have 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.280
 program to consist of four different 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:46.190
 days 4 days four countries JUST fresh 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.840
 The demon has four different jobs from 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.110
 graduates of the Berlin dance 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.550
 Academy I would say very much 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.830
 concept dance for real 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.790
 profound really uneasy 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:02.870
 look hard but crazy interesting 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:05.870
 then just fresh Israel is two works 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.209
 male solo and female solo as always 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.900
 incredibly fizich on as usual 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.580
 incredibly emotional but with 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.150
 its topic will also be interesting 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.790
 see come next day this 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.590
 day just fresh &amp; rashad where graduates 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.470
 our dance academy named 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.300
 vaganova here this program is scientific 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.760
 creative laboratory composition 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.209
 modern dance forms will show your 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.360
 dance 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.750
 which means it will be as always 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.769
 conceptually can be with humor and 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.239
 truly tie 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.750
 but at least for the Russian 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:44.989
 the viewer for sure and the last day is the day 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.810
 just fresh france where will be shown 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.930
 one job but a big project 14 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.549
 joint project of choreographer from france 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.620
 children of tyrone which of course cannot 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.330
 name any but the students did not graduate 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.280
 while it will work with our 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.870
 Petersburg very young 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.660
 dancers from the dance project 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.450
 guild they are all our graduates 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.850
 conservatory and in any case it is such 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.160
 collaboration is something very already 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.190
 well-established yes as choreography children 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.200
 rons and at the same time something very new 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.180
 such that young people can bring 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.880
 dancers of the performance of the first world 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.669
 war and truly masterly 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.950
 technically the station in general here is ours 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.810
 program 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:30.289
