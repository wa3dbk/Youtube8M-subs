 opposite side of the usb 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.059
 connection 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.559
 Both come in one 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.930
 Freistision of your television or 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.800
 Monitors usually on the back 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.390
 to find 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.770
 in connection with it is by the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.390
 TV the display adapter 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.580
 automatically detected and as pearls 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.710
 ready to transmit from 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.540
 files images or the mirror of 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.130
 display content is not internet or 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.110
 Wi-Fi access required 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.880
 the connection is only via wifi 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.070
 direct between adapter and the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.409
 actual device state should be 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.390
 you use a windows 8.1 device like that 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.460
 really her the lenovo jova two pro 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.590
 then it seems the right one is rising 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.900
 devices when there project out and 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.640
 goes on to add wireless display 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.020
 here should be the display adapter 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.790
 be listed and after a short 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.720
 Touch are both devices with each other 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.850
 connected 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.470
 when transiting it something different and 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.310
 comes on the respective smartphone or 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.810
 tablet on 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.509
 In general , the pond should be the display 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.350
 adapter with android 4.2.1 or higher 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.119
 function 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.130
 in the practical test this was not the case 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.170
 case to others will even make it 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.250
 spoken that android 4.4 kitkat 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.869
 is assumed 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.240
 so i could use the display adapter 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.310
 only with the HTC evo m 7 and m8 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.460
 Coupled with the ass and made 7 of 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.350
 samsung galaxy a5 or motogp of 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.939
 Motorola was not possible with me 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.650
 depending on the manufacturer you have to under 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.240
 Android in the settings go to 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.910
 the setting and there wifi direct 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.200
 or girl issue or screen 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.090
 Mirror to select 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.730
 there will be the wireless display 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.410
 adapter displayed as already said that 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.810
 Pairing has with me only with the htc 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.550
 does and when it works for him 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.020
 should you have a device with the weiher that 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.210
 Display adapter successfully connected 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.130
 you can not just have a look on it 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.080
 the screens can throw it all 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.490
 media content on the monitor or tv 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.580
 being represented 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.690
 pictures videos youtube websites where that 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.520
 streaming portals 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.400
 Everything is possible here, the picture quality 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.100
 was correspondingly good content in 1080p 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.090
 So full hd on the tv or monitor 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.250
 be transmitted 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.230
 However, it should be noted that the closer you get 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.209
 the tv is the better 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.530
 Also the picture quality up to one 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.360
 Distance of ten meters within 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.530
 but no one could 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.270
 find problems 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.800
 however, it is always stuck during operation 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.660
 that entered easily delayed 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.640
 So you want to be presented 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.740
 responsive games like america 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.510
 it could be a problem to play 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.550
 see simple video transmission 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.290
 but really good from the wireless 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.470
 Display adapter is mainly for users 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.239
 of windows 8.1 notebooks tablets 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.830
 and also windows phone devices useful 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.330
 So that this platform is the adapter 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.830
 is fully usable 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.209
 unfortunately there is currently with 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.100
 Android devices still too many 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.019
 connection problems so the display 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.790
 adapter for these devices rather less 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.920
 is suitable here it is called before 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.540
 Just try it out now 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.190
 I thank you for the end of my review 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.959
 to watch me and I'm glad that 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.880
 She asked if the criticism suggestions 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.620
 and wishes you then skin them as always 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.060
 below in the comments above 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.769
 easy videos resp 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.150
 Of course , I would also like to abo the channel 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.410
 Of course I am very happy 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.410
