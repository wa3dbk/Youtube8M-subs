the<00:02:31.430> ease<00:02:31.610> of<00:02:31.640> getting<00:02:31.970> in<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:32.570> out<00:02:32.660> of<00:02:32.720> a<00:02:32.960> car

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
the ease of getting in and out of a car

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.700 
the ease of getting in and out of a car
we<00:02:33.920> have<00:02:34.250> given<00:02:34.640> priority<00:02:34.910> into<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.140> sitting

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
we have given priority into the sitting

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.620 
we have given priority into the sitting
position<00:02:36.890> and<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:37.550> sense<00:02:37.820> of<00:02:37.970> hold<00:02:38.270> holding<00:02:38.930> so

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
position and a sense of hold holding so

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.300 
position and a sense of hold holding so
when<00:02:41.630> you<00:02:41.750> get<00:02:41.960> in<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.440> car<00:02:42.710> you<00:02:43.100> can

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
when you get in the car you can

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.020 
when you get in the car you can
immediately<00:02:43.550> switch<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:45.170> your<00:02:45.800> mind<00:02:46.160> from

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
immediately switch the your mind from

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.660 
immediately switch the your mind from
your<00:02:47.209> routine<00:02:47.690> daily<00:02:47.990> life<00:02:48.320> a<00:02:48.560> too<00:02:49.010> exciting

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
your routine daily life a too exciting

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.970 
your routine daily life a too exciting
unusual<00:02:50.150> world<00:02:50.420> which<00:02:50.959> is<00:02:51.110> important<00:02:51.620> element

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
unusual world which is important element

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.680 
unusual world which is important element
of<00:02:52.100> historical<00:02:52.730> and<00:02:52.910> then<00:02:53.360> we<00:02:53.510> have

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
of historical and then we have

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.630 
of historical and then we have
drastically<00:02:54.230> lowered<00:02:54.770> the<00:02:55.130> driving<00:02:55.520> position

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
drastically lowered the driving position

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.660 
drastically lowered the driving position
so<00:02:56.300> he<00:02:56.330> pointed<00:02:56.959> 400<00:02:57.410> millimeter<00:02:57.830> which<00:02:58.430> is

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
so he pointed 400 millimeter which is

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.940 
so he pointed 400 millimeter which is
one<00:02:58.880> of<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.090> lowest<00:02:59.270> among<00:02:59.810> the<00:03:00.260> toyota<00:03:00.650> cars

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
one of the lowest among the toyota cars

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.640 
one of the lowest among the toyota cars
in<00:03:01.220> history<00:03:04.420> so<00:03:05.420> this<00:03:05.660> is<00:03:05.780> a<00:03:05.840> sports<00:03:06.170> car<00:03:06.470> and

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
in history so this is a sports car and

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.830 
in history so this is a sports car and
people<00:03:07.160> would<00:03:07.250> say<00:03:07.520> maybe<00:03:07.760> two<00:03:08.030> passenger<00:03:08.600> car

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
people would say maybe two passenger car

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.920 
people would say maybe two passenger car
will<00:03:08.989> suffice<00:03:09.680> but<00:03:10.580> we<00:03:11.269> were<00:03:11.450> particular

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
will suffice but we were particular

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.199 
will suffice but we were particular
about<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.410> four<00:03:12.620> passenger<00:03:13.130> car<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:13.610> that<00:03:14.030> is

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
about the four passenger car and that is

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.070 
about the four passenger car and that is
quite<00:03:14.450> significant<00:03:15.550> because<00:03:16.550> when<00:03:17.330> you<00:03:17.540> visit

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
quite significant because when you visit

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.440 
quite significant because when you visit
two<00:03:18.260> different<00:03:18.709> circuit<00:03:19.430> drive<00:03:19.790> events

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
two different circuit drive events

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.690 
two different circuit drive events
across<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:20.870> country<00:03:21.019> you<00:03:21.980> notice<00:03:22.400> that<00:03:22.580> the

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
across the country you notice that the

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.449 
across the country you notice that the
people<00:03:22.940> actually<00:03:23.660> load<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.200> car<00:03:24.440> with<00:03:24.769> the

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
people actually load the car with the

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.320 
people actually load the car with the
spare<00:03:25.910> tires<00:03:26.239> and<00:03:26.720> 20<00:03:26.930> kids<00:03:27.320> and<00:03:27.610> so<00:03:28.610> in<00:03:29.150> that

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
spare tires and 20 kids and so in that

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.350 
spare tires and 20 kids and so in that
case<00:03:29.600> two<00:03:30.500> passengers<00:03:31.070> busca<00:03:31.580> would<00:03:31.880> require

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
case two passengers busca would require

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.410 
case two passengers busca would require
another<00:03:32.750> car<00:03:33.080> for<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:34.040> transporting<00:03:34.790> gun<00:03:34.970> but

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
another car for the transporting gun but

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.620 
another car for the transporting gun but
in<00:03:35.630> this<00:03:35.810> 2+2<00:03:36.709> package<00:03:37.100> if<00:03:37.310> you<00:03:37.640> fold<00:03:37.940> down<00:03:38.570> the

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
loaded together with the caddy toolkits

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.370 
loaded together with the caddy toolkits
and<00:03:45.080> as<00:03:45.560> a<00:03:45.590> result<00:03:45.800> two<00:03:46.280> sets<00:03:46.550> of<00:03:46.700> golf<00:03:46.940> clubs

and as a result two sets of golf clubs

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:55.460 
and as a result two sets of golf clubs
can<00:03:48.380> be<00:03:48.620> loaded<00:03:48.890> and<00:03:49.370> still<00:03:50.120> plenty<00:03:50.540> of<00:03:50.660> space

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.820 

so<00:03:56.400> in<00:03:56.520> order<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.820> decide<00:03:57.270> the<00:03:57.450> design<00:03:57.840> if<00:03:58.590> we

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
so in order to decide the design if we

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.600 
so in order to decide the design if we
follow<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.760> conventional<00:04:00.420> approach<00:04:01.610> it

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
follow the conventional approach it

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.030 
follow the conventional approach it
would<00:04:02.820> just<00:04:03.060> turn<00:04:03.300> out<00:04:03.540> to<00:04:03.720> be<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:04.140> boring<00:04:04.620> car

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
would just turn out to be a boring car

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.760 
would just turn out to be a boring car
about<00:04:05.700> universally<00:04:06.450> acceptable<00:04:06.990> that<00:04:07.560> was<00:04:07.740> a

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
about universally acceptable that was a

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:14.150 
about universally acceptable that was a
concern<00:04:08.160> from<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:08.910> beginning<00:04:11.780> therefore<00:04:13.160> the

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
concern from the beginning therefore the

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.970 
concern from the beginning therefore the
we<00:04:14.790> didn't<00:04:15.270> have<00:04:15.570> this<00:04:15.900> executive<00:04:16.590> committee

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
we didn't have this executive committee

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.340 
we didn't have this executive committee
meeting<00:04:17.459> to<00:04:17.609> consider<00:04:17.850> and<00:04:18.359> inspect<00:04:19.019> the

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
meeting to consider and inspect the

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.700 
meeting to consider and inspect the
design<00:04:19.739> but<00:04:20.250> rather<00:04:20.489> we<00:04:21.120> gathered<00:04:22.109> all<00:04:22.440> these

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
design but rather we gathered all these

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.680 
design but rather we gathered all these
sports<00:04:23.070> car<00:04:23.310> users<00:04:23.490> within<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.120> company<00:04:24.480> and

capitalists<00:04:27.570> and<00:04:27.720> those<00:04:28.290> panels<00:04:28.740> inspected

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
capitalists and those panels inspected

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.300 
capitalists and those panels inspected
the<00:04:29.790> maracas<00:04:30.480> at<00:04:30.870> different<00:04:31.560> phases<00:04:31.770> and<00:04:32.160> they

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
the maracas at different phases and they

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.640 
the maracas at different phases and they
came<00:04:32.550> up<00:04:32.730> with<00:04:32.850> their<00:04:33.000> own<00:04:33.060> views<00:04:33.600> freely<00:04:34.320> and

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
came up with their own views freely and

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.760 
came up with their own views freely and
in<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.460> back<00:04:35.610> of<00:04:35.940> this<00:04:36.150> working<00:04:37.140> place<00:04:37.350> of<00:04:37.620> the

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
in the back of this working place of the

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.130 
in the back of this working place of the
clay<00:04:37.980> model<00:04:38.310> we<00:04:39.020> put<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:40.950> best<00:04:41.280> available

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
clay model we put the the best available

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.620 
clay model we put the the best available
2000gt<00:04:43.140> so<00:04:43.740> that<00:04:43.920> the<00:04:44.100> workers<00:04:44.580> would<00:04:45.270> feel

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
2000gt so that the workers would feel

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.190 
2000gt so that the workers would feel
that<00:04:45.810> aura<00:04:46.140> of<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.740> 2000gt<00:04:47.780> so<00:04:48.780> by<00:04:48.960> going

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
that aura of the 2000gt so by going

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.159 
that aura of the 2000gt so by going
through<00:04:49.530> all<00:04:49.680> those<00:04:49.860> steps<00:04:50.040> that<00:04:50.880> we<00:04:51.419> cut<00:04:51.930> off

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
through all those steps that we cut off

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.630 
through all those steps that we cut off
all<00:04:52.560> these<00:04:52.770> a<00:04:52.830> non<00:04:53.220> essential<00:04:53.790> element<00:04:54.240> in<00:04:55.640> the

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
all these a non essential element in the

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.780 
all these a non essential element in the

production process where we the actual

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.640 
production process where we the actual
the<00:05:00.560> design<00:05:01.560> is<00:05:01.860> shaped<00:05:02.340> that<00:05:03.230> in<00:05:04.230> order<00:05:04.380> to

to<00:05:07.530> produce<00:05:08.340> a<00:05:08.730> dedicated<00:05:09.419> time<00:05:09.750> the<00:05:10.140> keywords

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
to produce a dedicated time the keywords

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.909 
to produce a dedicated time the keywords
are<00:05:10.830> low<00:05:11.310> body<00:05:11.580> fun<00:05:12.270> and<00:05:12.540> beautiful<00:05:12.660> and<00:05:13.260> then

are low body fun and beautiful and then

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.390 
are low body fun and beautiful and then
the<00:05:14.960> we<00:05:15.960> will<00:05:16.320> have<00:05:16.470> the<00:05:16.590> front<00:05:16.800> face<00:05:17.040> which

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
the we will have the front face which

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.310 
the we will have the front face which
gives<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.210> impression<00:05:18.419> of<00:05:18.690> intelligence

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
gives the impression of intelligence

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.400 
gives the impression of intelligence
again<00:05:19.710> and<00:05:19.890> the<00:05:20.400> clear<00:05:20.669> image<00:05:21.060> named<00:05:21.720> public

the front range of you we adopted the

word first frameless in a mirror which
was<00:06:31.770> specially<00:06:32.610> developed<00:06:32.970> for<00:06:33.330> hot<00:06:33.569> yoga<00:06:36.530> hot

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.530 
was specially developed for hot yoga hot

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.570 
was specially developed for hot yoga hot
yoga<00:06:38.180> what<00:06:39.180> is<00:06:39.840> a<00:06:39.900> car<00:06:40.560> that<00:06:40.590> the<00:06:41.039> customer<00:06:41.550> can

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
yoga what is a car that the customer can

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.180 
yoga what is a car that the customer can
enjoy<00:06:42.150> their<00:06:42.509> own<00:06:42.690> tuning<00:06:43.229> and<00:06:43.409> they<00:06:43.949> can

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
enjoy their own tuning and they can

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.770 
enjoy their own tuning and they can
customize<00:06:44.729> it<00:06:44.940> for<00:06:44.970> their<00:06:45.690> own<00:06:46.490> speculations

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:47.780 
customize it for their own speculations

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.930 
customize it for their own speculations
so<00:06:48.780> it's<00:06:49.020> a<00:06:49.139> car<00:06:49.409> that<00:06:49.770> can<00:06:50.009> evolve<00:06:50.639> together

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:50.940 
so it's a car that can evolve together

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.360 
so it's a car that can evolve together
with<00:06:51.330> customers<00:06:51.840> it<00:06:52.169> is<00:06:52.470> really<00:06:52.830> a<00:06:52.860> Wellborn

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
with customers it is really a Wellborn

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.700 
with customers it is really a Wellborn
material<00:06:53.940> which<00:06:54.120> can<00:06:54.330> evolve<00:06:54.870> with<00:06:55.139> customers

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
material which can evolve with customers

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.339 
material which can evolve with customers
so<00:06:56.460> it's<00:06:56.789> not<00:06:57.030> bound<00:06:57.300> by<00:06:57.539> the<00:06:57.690> conventional

00:06:58.339 --> 00:06:58.349 
so it's not bound by the conventional

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:00.950 
so it's not bound by the conventional
stereotype<00:06:58.860> it<00:06:59.250> is<00:06:59.669> a<00:06:59.699> new<00:07:00.000> challenge<00:07:00.330> with

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 
stereotype it is a new challenge with

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.010 
stereotype it is a new challenge with
all<00:07:01.199> new<00:07:01.530> trials<00:07:02.130> so<00:07:02.909> this<00:07:03.120> is<00:07:03.300> how<00:07:03.539> we<00:07:03.599> have

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.020
