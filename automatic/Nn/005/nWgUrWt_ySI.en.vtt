00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:26.199
 wake audio tv personal for + welcome in the new comment on open beta 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.199
 the craziest 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.149
 in this first art the very first part bin story lusting without mind hit me 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.580
 nuts for those who haven't seen anyone yet 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.149
 still had time to 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.219
 download the free open beta downloadable from all users 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.110
 originates 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.589
 if it has not been revolutionized because 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:48.050
 enough game is credible 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.840
 marina di carrara there are also 3d interfaces with the movement you are 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.170
 you the mouse remained more or less the same search 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.180
 they are quite similar 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.909
 on the other hand there was no reason to change 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:04.560
 under this spectrum 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.400
 we speak instead of two other changes 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.390
 much but much more for revolutionaries in the now series to multiplayer d sentences 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.870
 of the third chapter 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:15.840
 the energy 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.530
 f 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.300
 inca and stud which is the only one I played 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.590
 the energy was consumed 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.250
 activating stealth mode or invisibility 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.670
 activating the armor 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.370
 running he runs away 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.370
 exalting is when it jumped to top using let's say nanotuta 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.390
 in this third chapter there was a change 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.140
 in my opinion but 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.369
 very very positive 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:43.640
 the battleship 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.210
 and invisibility are two energies 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.350
 separated 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.240
 so then when we are with the armor it then activates a more position 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.350
 defensive pe e 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.970
 synthesis I call I don't know a refill and we have to escape 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.800
 we can activate endlessly without worrying about allergies because 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.810
 surely we will find it full and we will go to eat it 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.039
 only in relation to invisibility, therefore I am 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.759
 be it two separate energy bars as you can see in mine 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:14.279
 bb pack game 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:18.469
 I repeat a very positive change the amps improve a lot it becomes fluid 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:19.279
 quite a lot of 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:23.839
 you also because the jump the shot does not consume more energy dance your own 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:26.010
 fake and this is not a dancing element 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.909
 you app 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:31.329
 bring chrysis to a level equal to other fps where of course escape 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.530
 jumping does not presuppose the fact that we have to take food 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.529
 specials ok 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:39.529
 so great for this good guys 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:44.949
 let's talk about graphics 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:49.329
 I mean cases if you know the game of the benchmark here game that you can put 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.149
 try any system 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:52.539
 I'm 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:57.839
 pm was positively impressed by the graphics changes after played 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:58.980
 in depth 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.099
 crysis 2 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.099
 I purchased it as soon as his queen went on offer 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:08.319
 the graphics have improved and the kidnapped 2 has not already been revolutionized 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.199
 I'm pleasant on the other hand have passed 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:13.489
 2 years seems to me 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.260
 so not revolutionized improved in my opinion in the colors as mentioned la 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.920
 very bright colors vegetation 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.519
 % of textures or improved there are texte at 5 directix 11 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.140
 that go to improve even more the meches of the objects 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.460
 that mr. from the ground like footprints 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.420
 as tiles you see it here it all seems really hehe realized a lot 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.019
 well the reflexes have been improved in my opinion 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.310
 and there are no more white points you see the metal surface 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:46.359
 of the plane all very but very defined 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:51.039
 a game of mint graphics always pays habbo you could have a sky tooth 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:54.039
 had I gone I would forge the map to enjoy the graphics 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:04:00.269
 we come to the sore point and it is here that I want the comments on your part I must 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.879
 see if I'm a jerk 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.689
 or if there is something wrong with this site 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:10.209
 I repeat we are known met-art recently demos are called open beta for 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.290
 report a user that the game is not finished so there will surely be 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.290
 still some improvements by crytek 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:24.070
 the prorpio I don't know the youtube shave me I owe me I have to confess combo ita 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.770
 friend as if we were at the bar 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.169
 every time keshika esis 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.499
 I'm excited like a hermit crab 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:37.499
 I play half-board 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.349
 ciccio kunora 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:41.650
 well 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.999
 chic choc an hour and a half 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:46.749
 and I don't understand why 

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:49.610
 parents should be like this 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.130
 complicated where and why they do not intend all is cool the weapons are beautiful 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.030
 you can punch very strong people you can jump crazy 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.080
 who has a fist on the ground who kills all those who are near 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.080
 ditto for really electrifying below these list points 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.520
 the pointer 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.050
 the pointer I don't understand why 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.470
 site flaunts and go in the direction the pointer 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.130
 at the end ink raisins above all multiplayer bothers this campaign 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.880
 who cares 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.729
 but in my multiplayer I think 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:24.319
 not very direct 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:25.870
 it's difficult to aim 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.830
 but it is not because we are in conditions of pressure like it can 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.909
 be beats file zither batterfild a game shooting pag 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:35.719
 but on this 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:37.990
 he beats it only with you in my opinion 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.159
 when 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:40.629
 one player aims 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:42.169
 demands from his hand 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:47.230
 the lamp from the site its pointer the maximum response to the maximum 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.090
 hair 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.130
 flou ita 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.340
 three movements of the mouse her. pole 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.550
 I always find that 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.970
 at home as if we had an expected salami the gun is inert on 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.439
 this weapon when aiming 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:01.879
 we start admiring from the left we go to the right the viewfinder remains to the left for 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:03.939
 half an hour 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:07.830
 fuck the nanotute you're very strong you had to move it like a piece of 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.770
 aluminum this weapon not like a cast iron stuff that standards actually are 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.129
 alano suit if the super soldier or 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:16.229
 weapons handling 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:19.270
 ok, probably we don't understand Galilean about this 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.550
 I'm wrong 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.840
 you and me like this change cd cases sa would be the perfect alternative to fight 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.260
 with fps more arcor 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.270
 let's say electrifying com + spectacular attractions 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.499
 though that in the end when you meet a friend and lady well 

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:39.459
 there are those handicaps of the inertia of the but which do not work 

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:41.990
 I can't stand it 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.560
 I don't know it insults you of doing what you want this thing not 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.619
 support 

00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:47.419
 you 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:51.169
 as it is not that I do not like how I play again 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:54.439
 really spectacular phases come out 

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:57.619
 and I don't understand why there is always this flaw that 

00:06:57.619 --> 00:06:59.380
 I don't know 3 mind 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.320
 and I don't know if it was requested by some kind of community as unique and 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.249
 special 

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:08.719
 for this type of difficulty in handling and the weapon in these inertia 

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:10.369
 I don't know about the viewfinder 

00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:14.599
 continues not to convince I find that it was the only real thing to change not 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:16.060
 has been changed again 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.599
 and as promised, my personal opinion arrived at the end of the video 

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:22.999
 please let me know what you think 

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:23.930
 ok 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:24.800
 for 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.129
 so but the final report we repeat is an opel vectra so there will be 

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:30.029
 updates 

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:35.269
 The very cool graphics really deserve to be played if you feel you are already alone 

00:07:35.269 --> 00:07:38.729
 for the campaign but rather than to download it cracked I recommend 

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:42.219
 buy it. and I'm 13 and we don't play video games anymore 

00:07:42.219 --> 00:07:46.509
 here emmy as I always hope god got away from me too much 

00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:48.699
 if I ask you to comment 

00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:49.949
 or sorry, though 

00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:51.449
 the slogan 

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:54.449
 comment and vote if you want
