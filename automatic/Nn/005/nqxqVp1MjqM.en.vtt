to<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.549> Chinese<00:01:53.939> border<00:01:54.180> nor<00:01:54.869> would<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.079> be

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
to the Chinese border nor would it be

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.870 
to the Chinese border nor would it be
too<00:01:55.439> close<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.950> South<00:01:56.189> Korean<00:01:56.579> board<00:01:56.820> it

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
too close to the South Korean board it

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.880 
too close to the South Korean board it
would<00:01:56.969> be<00:01:57.060> sort<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.390> like<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.780> between<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.680> two

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.469 
would be sort of like in between the two
borders<00:01:59.250> they<00:01:59.430> do<00:01:59.490> not<00:01:59.700> want<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.090> endanger

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
that the next step that they could

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.220 
that the next step that they could
foresee<00:03:31.190> for<00:03:31.519> North<00:03:31.760> Korea<00:03:32.030> would<00:03:32.870> be<00:03:33.049> to

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
foresee for North Korea would be to

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.280 
foresee for North Korea would be to
conduct<00:03:33.680> a<00:03:33.799> nuclear<00:03:33.980> test<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:35.030> so<00:03:35.569> if<00:03:35.840> indeed

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
conduct a nuclear test and so if indeed

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.189 
conduct a nuclear test and so if indeed
today<00:03:36.739> North<00:03:37.430> Korea<00:03:37.699> did<00:03:38.030> do<00:03:38.299> that<00:03:38.329> then<00:03:39.019> it

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:39.199 
today North Korea did do that then it

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:41.259 
today North Korea did do that then it
would<00:03:39.379> then<00:03:39.680> it<00:03:39.829> was<00:03:40.040> reacting<00:03:40.760> to<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.030> global

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269
