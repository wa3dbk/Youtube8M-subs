review<00:00:06.450> on<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:07.290> Nintendo<00:00:07.950> 64<00:00:08.429> controller

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
review on the Nintendo 64 controller

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.140 
review on the Nintendo 64 controller
from<00:00:09.059> Tommy<00:00:09.710> so<00:00:10.710> this<00:00:11.010> is<00:00:11.190> it<00:00:11.340> here<00:00:11.759> in<00:00:11.969> the

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
from Tommy so this is it here in the

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.810 
from Tommy so this is it here in the
package<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.900> on<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:14.009> back<00:00:14.190> they<00:00:14.580> have<00:00:14.790> a

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
package and on the back they have a

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.820 
package and on the back they have a
diagram<00:00:15.509> showing<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:16.020> different<00:00:16.410> controls

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
diagram showing the different controls

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.450 
diagram showing the different controls
and<00:00:17.220> so<00:00:18.180> it<00:00:18.570> comes<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.380> plastic<00:00:19.680> suicide

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
and so it comes in this plastic suicide

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.790 
and so it comes in this plastic suicide
packaging<00:00:21.300> which<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.840> pain<00:00:22.230> in<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.380> ass<00:00:22.560> to

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
packaging which is a pain in the ass to

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.519 
packaging which is a pain in the ass to
open<00:00:23.100> but<00:00:23.250> I've<00:00:23.460> already<00:00:24.000> pre-cut<00:00:24.779> mine<00:00:25.260> to

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
open but I've already pre-cut mine to

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.580 
open but I've already pre-cut mine to
make<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.859> little<00:00:26.039> bit<00:00:26.250> easier<00:00:30.050> so<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.560> a

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
make it a little bit easier so this is a

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.420 
make it a little bit easier so this is a
controller<00:00:32.540> and<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:34.020> feels<00:00:34.260> very<00:00:34.590> solid<00:00:35.010> it

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
controller and it feels very solid it

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.790 
controller and it feels very solid it
doesn't<00:00:35.460> feel<00:00:35.880> cheap<00:00:36.239> at<00:00:36.390> all<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.899> it's<00:00:37.469> made

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
doesn't feel cheap at all and it's made

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.810 
doesn't feel cheap at all and it's made
out<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.040> ABS<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.120> PVC<00:00:39.629> plastic<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.670> so<00:00:41.670> it's

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
out of ABS and PVC plastic and so it's

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.819 
out of ABS and PVC plastic and so it's
the<00:00:41.910> same<00:00:42.120> way<00:00:42.300> as<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.750> original<00:00:43.290> 64

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
the same way as the original 64

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.520 
the same way as the original 64
controller<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.570> green<00:00:45.870> one<00:00:45.899> here

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
controller this is the green one here

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.350 
controller this is the green one here
but<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.800> does<00:00:46.980> come<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.850> variety<00:00:48.030> of

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
but it does come in a variety of

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.869 
but it does come in a variety of
different<00:00:48.570> colors<00:00:49.050> like<00:00:50.210> grey<00:00:52.399> the<00:00:53.399> clear

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
different colors like grey the clear

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:07.130 
different colors like grey the clear
blue<00:00:57.230> red<00:01:01.489> black<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:04.519> also<00:01:05.659> just<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.810> plain

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
blue red black and also just the plain

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.250 
blue red black and also just the plain
clear<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.909> bottom<00:01:09.180> leo<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.720> same<00:01:09.990> as

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
clear so the bottom leo is the same as

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.289 
clear so the bottom leo is the same as
the<00:01:10.439> OEM<00:01:10.560> controller<00:01:11.280> except<00:01:11.820> they've<00:01:11.939> added

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
the OEM controller except they've added

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.600 
the OEM controller except they've added
in<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.750> turbo<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.470> slow<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.280> Clear<00:01:14.580> button

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
in a turbo a slow and a Clear button

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.270 
in a turbo a slow and a Clear button
which<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.270> nice<00:01:15.540> for<00:01:15.780> fighting<00:01:16.140> games<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
which is nice for fighting games and the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.190 
which is nice for fighting games and the
d-pad<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.820> basically<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.540> same<00:01:18.720> as<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:18.960> OEM

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
d-pad is basically the same as the OEM

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.380 
d-pad is basically the same as the OEM
controller<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:20.850> nice<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.180> see<00:01:21.360> that

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
controller and it's nice to see that

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.990 
controller and it's nice to see that
they<00:01:21.689> didn't<00:01:22.110> use<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> disc<00:01:22.830> style<00:01:23.220> d-pad<00:01:23.759> like

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
they didn't use a disc style d-pad like

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.190 
they didn't use a disc style d-pad like
some<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.330> other<00:01:24.479> third-party

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
some of the other third-party

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.859 
some of the other third-party
controllers<00:01:25.939> like<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.150> one<00:01:27.360> here<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.720> can

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
controllers like this one here you can

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.660 
controllers like this one here you can
see<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.320> disc<00:01:28.530> style<00:01:28.950> makes<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.369> little<00:01:29.549> bit

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
see the disc style makes it a little bit

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.289 
see the disc style makes it a little bit
more<00:01:29.790> awkward<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.450> use<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.270> B

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
more awkward to use and the a and the B

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.359 
more awkward to use and the a and the B
buttons<00:01:33.900> they<00:01:34.170> don't<00:01:34.380> stick<00:01:34.680> out<00:01:34.770> too<00:01:35.159> much

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
buttons they don't stick out too much

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.429 
buttons they don't stick out too much
from<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.790> face<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.299> controller<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.409> this

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
from the face of the controller so this

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.200 
from the face of the controller so this
makes<00:01:37.799> smoother<00:01:38.340> movement<00:01:38.520> between<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
makes smoother movement between the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.069 
makes smoother movement between the
buttons<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.130> L<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.520> R<00:01:41.759> buttons<00:01:42.299> are<00:01:42.689> nice

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
buttons and the L and R buttons are nice

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.899 
buttons and the L and R buttons are nice
and<00:01:43.409> clicky<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:43.920> it's<00:01:44.070> not<00:01:44.220> necessarily<00:01:44.880> a

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
and clicky but it's not necessarily a

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:45.830 
and clicky but it's not necessarily a
bad<00:01:45.119> thing

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
bad thing

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.690 
bad thing
it<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.500> makes<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.860> different<00:01:47.040> feel<00:01:47.430> from

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
it just makes it a different feel from

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.310 
it just makes it a different feel from
the<00:01:47.790> other<00:01:47.939> buttons<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.600> controller<00:01:48.990> and

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
the other buttons on the controller and

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.480 
the other buttons on the controller and
the<00:01:49.380> Z<00:01:50.369> or<00:01:50.640> Z<00:01:50.939> button<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.659> very<00:01:52.170> responsive<00:01:53.130> and

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
the Z or Z button is very responsive and

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.730 
the Z or Z button is very responsive and
the<00:01:54.299> C<00:01:54.540> buttons<00:01:54.810> are<00:01:54.990> also<00:01:55.170> nice<00:01:55.530> and

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
the C buttons are also nice and

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.929 
the C buttons are also nice and
responsive<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.860> first<00:02:02.100> off<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.490> analog

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
responsive so first off this analog

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.999 
responsive so first off this analog
stick<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.509> by<00:02:03.960> far<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.380> best<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.890> we've

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
stick is by far the best that we've

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.069 
stick is by far the best that we've
tested<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.520> any<00:02:05.729> controller<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.570> Tommy

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
tested on any controller and Tommy

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.680 
tested on any controller and Tommy
decided<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.770> use<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.950> metal<00:02:08.459> base<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.479> can

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
decided to use a metal base so you can

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.730 
decided to use a metal base so you can
see<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.110> they're<00:02:10.379> four

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
see that they're four

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.890 
see that they're four
stick<00:02:11.070> and<00:02:11.430> they<00:02:11.940> did<00:02:12.090> away<00:02:12.180> with<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.480> plastic

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
stick and they did away with the plastic

which is found on other controllers and

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.420 
which is found on other controllers and
so<00:02:15.270> this<00:02:15.420> allows<00:02:15.720> for<00:02:15.750> precise<00:02:16.410> control<00:02:16.710> and

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
so this allows for precise control and

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.790 
so this allows for precise control and

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
controllers like on this old one here

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.410 
controllers like on this old one here
you<00:02:25.290> can<00:02:25.470> see<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.830> it's<00:02:26.010> sloppy<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:27.060> Wiggles

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
you can see that it's sloppy and Wiggles

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.220 
you can see that it's sloppy and Wiggles
around<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.930> lot<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:29.420> also<00:02:30.420> there's<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.780> small

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
around a lot and also there's a small

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.860 
around a lot and also there's a small
plastic<00:02:31.890> dust<00:02:32.250> cover<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:32.910> they<00:02:33.030> added<00:02:33.210> in<00:02:33.570> at

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
plastic dust cover that they added in at

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.230 
plastic dust cover that they added in at
the<00:02:34.020> base<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.470> stick<00:02:34.770> and<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.700> grips<00:02:36.000> on

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
the base of the stick and the grips on

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.970 
the base of the stick and the grips on
the<00:02:36.270> thumb<00:02:36.600> stick<00:02:37.020> are<00:02:37.590> they're<00:02:37.740> a<00:02:37.770> little

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
the thumb stick are they're a little

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.410 
the thumb stick are they're a little
more<00:02:38.100> pronounced<00:02:38.460> than<00:02:38.670> most<00:02:38.880> third-party

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
more pronounced than most third-party

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.000 
more pronounced than most third-party
controllers<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.230> gives<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.560> little<00:02:40.800> bit

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
controllers so it gives you a little bit

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.460 
controllers so it gives you a little bit
more<00:02:41.190> control<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.180> overall<00:02:42.960> it's<00:02:43.200> very

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
more control and overall it's very

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.420 
more control and overall it's very
smooth<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.840> cord<00:02:49.170> is<00:02:49.410> made<00:02:49.650> out<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.160> same

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
smooth the cord is made out of the same

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.790 
smooth the cord is made out of the same
material<00:02:51.030> as<00:02:51.210> the<00:02:51.270> original<00:02:51.990> n64<00:02:52.410> controller

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
material as the original n64 controller

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.430 
material as the original n64 controller
and<00:02:53.310> it's<00:02:53.430> also<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.940> same<00:02:54.440> approximate

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
and it's also the same approximate

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.070 
and it's also the same approximate
length<00:02:55.680> so<00:02:56.430> this<00:02:56.580> is<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.850> connector<00:02:57.330> here<00:02:57.690> and

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
length so this is the connector here and

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.830 
length so this is the connector here and
it<00:02:58.380> just<00:02:58.560> clicks<00:02:58.920> in<00:02:59.190> nicely<00:02:59.460> into<00:03:00.360> your<00:03:00.390> and

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
it just clicks in nicely into your and

it just clicks in nicely into your and
64<00:03:01.530> console<00:03:04.160> so<00:03:05.160> I'm<00:03:05.220> going<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:05.490> sum<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:05.700> up

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
64 console so I'm going to sum it up

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.510 
64 console so I'm going to sum it up
with<00:03:06.030> some<00:03:06.210> pros<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:06.510> cons<00:03:06.860> for<00:03:07.860> pros<00:03:08.220> the

with some pros and cons for pros the
analog<00:03:09.000> stick<00:03:09.270> is<00:03:09.300> made<00:03:09.660> with<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:09.990> metal<00:03:10.260> base

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
analog stick is made with the metal base

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.960 
analog stick is made with the metal base
that<00:03:10.770> I<00:03:10.800> showed<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:11.610> it<00:03:11.700> allows<00:03:11.940> for

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
that I showed you so it allows for

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.690 
that I showed you so it allows for
smooth<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:12.840> precise<00:03:13.110> control<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.890> also<00:03:14.460> the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
face of the analog stick is grippy so

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.370 
face of the analog stick is grippy so
your<00:03:17.880> thumbs<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.300> lot<00:03:18.480> less<00:03:18.690> likely<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.170> slip

your thumbs a lot less likely to slip

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.310 
your thumbs a lot less likely to slip
off<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.890> they<00:03:20.610> also<00:03:20.790> added<00:03:21.210> the<00:03:21.630> turbo<00:03:22.080> the

controllers<00:03:32.190> that<00:03:32.280> we've<00:03:32.430> tested<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:33.150> Tommy

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
controllers that we've tested and Tommy

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.900 
controllers that we've tested and Tommy
decided<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.620> keep<00:03:34.740> the<00:03:34.920> original<00:03:34.950> d-pad

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
decided to keep the original d-pad

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.790 
decided to keep the original d-pad
layout<00:03:36.330> on<00:03:36.480> this<00:03:36.630> one<00:03:36.900> instead<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.380> using<00:03:37.710> the

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
layout on this one instead of using the

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.080 
layout on this one instead of using the
circular<00:03:38.280> disc<00:03:38.490> like<00:03:38.670> some<00:03:38.880> of<00:03:39.000> the

circular disc like some of the
third-party<00:03:39.300> controllers<00:03:40.250> so<00:03:41.250> this

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
third-party controllers so this

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.160 
third-party controllers so this
controller<00:03:42.060> is<00:03:42.150> nice<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:42.600> cheap<00:03:42.810> at<00:03:42.960> under

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.950 
controller is nice and cheap at under
$15<00:03:44.070> and<00:03:44.340> it's<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:45.120> best<00:03:45.360> third-party

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
$15 and it's the best third-party

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.650 
$15 and it's the best third-party
controller<00:03:46.410> that<00:03:46.530> we've<00:03:46.680> tested<00:03:47.390> the<00:03:48.390> cons

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.420 
controller that we've tested the cons
for<00:03:48.900> this<00:03:49.050> controller<00:03:49.440> or<00:03:49.710> it<00:03:49.800> doesn't<00:03:50.070> have

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430

the<00:03:50.670> side<00:03:50.940> grips<00:03:51.300> like<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.750> original<00:03:52.200> so<00:03:52.830> you

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
the side grips like the original so you

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.260 
the side grips like the original so you
can<00:03:53.070> see<00:03:53.250> here<00:03:53.460> they're<00:03:53.580> just<00:03:53.610> a<00:03:53.820> little<00:03:54.000> bit

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
can see here they're just a little bit

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.300 
can see here they're just a little bit
shorter<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:54.840> this<00:03:55.230> may<00:03:55.410> deter<00:03:55.710> some<00:03:56.010> people
