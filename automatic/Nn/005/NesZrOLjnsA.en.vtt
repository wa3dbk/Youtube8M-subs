00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 and the liquidity injections of 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.960
 central banks are from the stock markets 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.500
 but celebrated my dear ladies 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.559
 and mens bank economists operate the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.900
 Idea says inflation will hold up at all 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.609
 to the next few years because we have 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.910
 yes about capacity in china 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.070
 that's right, and because of this 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.710
 all over capacity will be installation 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.980
 can not arise at all and 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.960
 globalization high 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.250
 you can compete 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.349
 remove high inflation 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.450
 then the nicest cook say that 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.370
 Inflation plans for the next few years 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.719
 kubica 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.790
 but I may be a passat now 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.079
 and if she goes after tonight anyway 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.989
 go home and tell the bankers 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.899
 I'm right then I have my job 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.280
 can be done here but yes 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.000
 I will show them again for a very short time 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.010
 something else 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.710
 I keep hearing that course book value 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.940
 ratio of us stock market will be 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.079
 still historical relatively alright though 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.739
 No one speaks is what they are down 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.339
 to the right 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.340
 Worth 35 percent of this farm 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.830
 that 's it you give a billion for 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.659
 company that harmony 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.810
 is that they give a billion lead 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.070
 take off the recordings and 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.509
 according to different methods commission 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.990
 result actually has that and 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.030
 actually in the adria 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.890
 But what do you do on your balance sheet? 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.930
 your active side like the company 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.329
 stand with a billion 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.020
 there are half a billion good will be like that 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.970
 easy it is 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.439
 and these are the can see them here 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.540
 right start 35 percent of book value 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.340
 US stocks as the brand already is 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.689
 Not all gold glitters in the world 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.430
 mainstream media if you have something 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:49.680
 regulating action and securities loans to 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.090
 usa shows them that very briefly 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.170
 maybe one or the other has that 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.890
 last weeks this year already 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.259
 seen 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.360
 the us securities of the banks 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.590
 are at a record high in september 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.079
 to 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:04.509
 1013 if it is through such shows 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:07.130
 look at it because it has been retracted so far 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:10.819
 and here you can see the trading volume in the 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.700
 s &amp; p 500 both in the index and in the 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.879
 switzerland and that's not me I have 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.040
 learned according to the classical teaching 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:21.349
 gasoline big up countries or too 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.730
 has fly in big downtrend and 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.580
 sales are rising 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.549
 liesenfeld then what is the find that 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.819
 trend confirms the anna 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.590
 Share courses now go through the blanket 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.299
 But the revenues makes it free is the 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.620
 at least , the classic state lives 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.299
 but who cares rather than today 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.720
 is the world of completely different anyway 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.260
 page 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.819
 then there are differences to full time 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.500
 no problem at all, one has the 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.989
 classical instead of four reasons copy 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.879
 everything was interested and the 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.790
 property münster walter and börsen 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.829
 as for him a raid shares are therefore 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.860
 a lasso and gold should be the best 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:00.110
 sell because you are considering 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.370
 zloty the gold ban message taken 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.250
 will be just when it's most 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.750
 needs such as the status and take 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.700
 therefore, the shares should buy and 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.250
 Shares will be in government reform 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.840
 I can only protect your fortune 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.000
 I'll just tell the fan about it 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.170
 to come the history books and 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.599
 to see if that in the 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.430
 past like that and you can see them here 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.859
 Pay attention to German currency reform household 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.930
 14-year-old the charges of the city 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:28.790
 has made all the requirements for the conversion 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.500
 for the first new pricing after the 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.630
 Currency reform has made the market easy 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.579
 cared for and you see that the market 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.709
 I 've been educated here about something 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.690
 is how strongly the individual falles 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.180
 took the end of the 50s to 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.400
 We will return to the old levels 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.019
 I just saw it 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.650
 facts against such arguments as one 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.970
 often stayed in wales gets served 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.850
 and then we deal with it 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.000
 the statement content brings him 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.040
 stocks provide inflation protection who 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.810
 calls such a statement ever 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.570
 by a banker or asset manager 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.990
 get donated as well as benjamin 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.730
 to expand or why we do not trust anyone 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.630
 is I think for the first time is 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.320
 not interested 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.730
 but each of them is the opera or you 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:17.920
 Now , small is happy to show that 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.120
 that is the law that ours 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.570
 So that we also figure then 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.210
 speak 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.490
 I have inflation adjusted here 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.520
 the then hire prost then will 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.870
 and I have the inflation 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.320
 That's what this beautiful one is about 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.940
 black pulled through as you as 1947 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.350
 the wage and three stops after the 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.310
 second world with which you better 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.590
 were lifted 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.590
 there went the inflation and the ceiling or 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.870
 you can see here that rose to 20 percent 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:48.410
 and they see that adjusted for inflation 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:51.590
 the stock market at that time marked 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:54.170
 had lost and if we continue 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.030
 we had 1900 and the end of the 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.060
 sixties beginning of the seventies 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.190
 In 1970, Mittel already had one 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.230
 inflation you see that here recession 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.810
 to detect over 6 percent 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.610
 and that happened in this time of the 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.990
 sixties beginning of the seventies 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.030
 what happened you see here very much 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.810
 beautiful 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.210
 moment I have here also the 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.210
 possibility to point out and thus everyone 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.990
 I have to do that now 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.480
 show correctly 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.580
 that's the six percent and what's up 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.340
 your purchasing power adjusted in this phase 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.070
 in this inflationary push the 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.740
 us stock market on 3 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:33.260
 and when in 1973 we look at 2 of the 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.760
 first workshops and then inflation 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.560
 study at the end of the seventies at 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.740
 second accident already what happened there 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.050
 At that time, the shares have lost massively 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.200
 so I can not with a good conscience 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.720
 put them down and tell them they buy 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.310
 massive shares because they will be in front 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.790
 inflation before the consequences of inflation 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.340
 protect 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.980
 Looking at this start I can do that 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.570
 they do not yet one is such a 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.230
 to keep a meaningful world 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:04.070
 I think that is also thoughtful 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.810
 That's right, and now and again 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.020
 know about silver one also later 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.020
 times
