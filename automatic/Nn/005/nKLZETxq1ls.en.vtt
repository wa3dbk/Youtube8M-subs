00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Hi everyone, I'm Carlos Barcellos. 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.730
 You're still on the wheels. I'm a pilot. 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.830
 motorcycle and came here with a video 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.150
 the Internet for us to discuss and 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.150
 bring tips for you this 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.980
 We all want to bike we love it. 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.890
 videos with onboard cameras I brought 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.960
 this video was recorded an average motorcycle 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.720
 accelerating but a road 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.750
 with four meters wide which I 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.420
 I want with you to focus the attention of 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.340
 how much of a friend are you? 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.290
 Sending a gal is very cool to walk 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.690
 evil to each other 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.270
 the speed is not high the pizza with 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.280
 only four meters wide in a 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.039
 allows for many situations of high 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.760
 speed but it is very easy to cause a 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.160
 accident 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.190
 we have a pilot ahead of a colleague 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:58.739
 Our friend who is going to walk with us, he 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.629
 It causes an overshoot in a situation of 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.570
 continuous strip where you have difficulty 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.350
 causing the cars to become 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.530
 face 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.760
 here he has difficulty going to the 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.950
 continuous track 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.170
 note that you will sign your colleague 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.420
 gets a very delicate situation pulls 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.290
 My life my friend moved to the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.900
 see the car on the other side he escaped 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.970
 more friends go ahead 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.210
 other friends walking together and let's go 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.409
 on a common road that we all 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.270
 We walk everyday 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.000
 We like to spend the weekend with 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:38.729
 the friends came a sequence of curves 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.780
 the speed is not so high a curve of 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.689
 of the ray 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.290
 Look what happened to your friend. 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.119
 straight 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.250
 he had already been demonstrating there 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.500
 previously had difficulty 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.710
 control your bike and here's my 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.509
 attention of who of us you are 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.570
 watching the video in some situation 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.310
 walking on a road did not 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.710
 other side going to the track 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.590
 opposite or near the shoulder in that 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.840
 if this friend got stuck outside was 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.379
 road and the bike crashed into a 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.270
 luckily nothing happened is for this 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.960
 type of situation that is worth the control to 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.270
 technical 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.430
 piloting that on our site you in two 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.630
 wheels you will learn to avoid this 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.340
 type of situation 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.440
 control improves control of your 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.360
 bike we will take the attention directly 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.730
 at this point where I want to bring a 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.650
 tip for you 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.990
 he goes straight because he aborted the 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.270
 do not bend the curve 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.160
 avoid going as far as possible to the 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.080
 view of the road to keep 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.850
 attention on the curve that continues to 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.670
 so do not go out it 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.920
 simply raised his bike and avoided 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.920
 do not bend curve
