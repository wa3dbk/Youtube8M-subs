00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 Galera says that the personal droid back 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.850
 then that it was good for you and 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.080
 I'm here today with the command called 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.530
 berson val made by our friend ds4 3cm 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.450
 from r 43 and i think it's never him 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.310
 I think that same and although this 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.949
 here it is very simple to them to 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.830
 choose only two tools but I found 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.750
 good until I found it half-way to the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.710
 But it's okay, let's put our 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.300
 I command here then I go to a place 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.390
 more open right 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.099
 He has the command of the timber and I 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.989
 already showed service that works well 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.969
 also is with the timbu is the legacy their 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.140
 Look, look, it's already done. 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.600
 almost ready 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.600
 now the margarine is stuck and hand 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.980
 It worked fine, it's just you. 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.989
 It can also be oxy. Just click on it. 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.000
 plate here click on little things 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.160
 I really did not understand here, either. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.379
 You have here because in the case of the video 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.750
 shown something else is ok but let's get it 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.640
 Here I am going to get a golden ax 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.350
 also a diamond pick 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.440
 Now we come here so let's get 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.840
 Our worst can name the item is good 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.210
 bank understands the following you seeing here 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.100
 and me our year called silver gold 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.560
 Tibery, look what happens. 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.470
 Let's test it out, guys, if it breaks 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.930
 now omar rubik akiba game mode zero 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.880
 how our work here looks only the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.770
 Man, how 's it going guys? 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.060
 it works as if it were a team that 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.670
 You see that lot of team that you 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.439
 breaks the bottom and he too 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.030
 it breaks the whole tree right 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.310
 today you also need another way there 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.290
 another block as a new one 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.079
 command that he also left these 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.780
 gold tools and we also 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.790
 Give this team it 's just I really like using 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.829
 the gold tool because in the case by 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.509
 example for water works well is because 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.030
 you can improve if with any type 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.170
 and it gets so tight already 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.960
 is almost over here with my 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.790
 as an ax I also really like to use 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.890
 the golden tool from things 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.350
 is to save the page things like this 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.299
 I think it is more balanced okay then 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.979
 this may be our our ax 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.780
 gold timber it breaks the whole tree 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.280
 it's just you breaking part underneath it 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.990
 is in the case of the bottom of the tree 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.909
 You can come here in a moment too. 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.979
 face mask 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.920
 Look, this is what I think. 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.060
 by pj's because if the pm have 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.680
 diamond right 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.209
 Good. Let's do something, I 'll go. 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.340
 I'll get the ores and I'll put it here. 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.900
 quickie for you, good guys, I just 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.129
 make one of the best one here thing 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.930
 interesting that when I selected 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.129
 affects the diamond planet I do not 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.569
 I liked none of it, too. 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.549
 but met when to choose first 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.519
 inventory with the instant name it me 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.109
 gave a new pick and the durability of 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.189
 side of what was the 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.829
 normal 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:37.859
 so I think it got a little less than 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:40.290
 pen is equal to it has a text from the donor 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.730
 respect base at 6am good line 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.980
 next is to break here 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.480
 But it happens, man. I think it's crazy. 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.439
 this effect because it's like a team 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.200
 it's really right 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:51.120
 only he breaks one by one looks only 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.090
 very cool, the guy, it's just that 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.760
 so is denial by a see 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.069
 and as it is a normal pick type only has 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.019
 a name of changed is you can enchant 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.200
 even more it is the net as you can 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.450
 put a strong on it the diamond does not 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.250
 works galley does not really work 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.760
 It's good, so you never have a penny. 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.859
 Boys, there's coal here, too. 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.799
 I do not think everyone was there either. 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.900
 second time the guys are like this 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.510
 but it's because like so in the beginning in 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.769
 gave those ores in our little plate 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.870
 I thought it only worked the lead. 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.079
 of the plate is here also with Estonia 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.139
 Fred then there's never any rest here we go 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.609
 put the luxury quickly here then only 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.769
 works for me they are interconnected 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:38.879
 in dispute we would put a 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:41.189
 type 2 here so jaime mode 09 is that 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.859
 break how it works 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:46.859
 does not even work for stone star 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.599
 We arrived in a country where there is so expensive I 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:51.090
 which is because of possible by some 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.769
 bugs in what can happen because dope 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.900
 I do not know right guy think not because the 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.909
 Diamond worked not only also found 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.699
 that it was because of much 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:01.169
 milena but anyway it just does not work all 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:04.530
 It works so I guess it's not because of 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:06.239
 I did not have 7th team here 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.919
 now the command is basically this they 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.370
 suddenly this pick is that our 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:12.989
 instant and santi orp kex who also 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.239
 find a gold that works as if 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.099
 It's a simple timbre but it's a case 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.570
 you want to give him strength for 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:20.880
 command for you can add 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.169
 more thing then you're going is the 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.990
 business when you do this too 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.700
 You can add more things only you. 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.270
 Seeing how it works, you can. 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.639
 which expands 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.080
 It is not on your account even Wesley that 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.090
 enjoying the video brings scenes that are the 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.229
 creator credits the original video and 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.810
 also when the case you want to download 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:40.099
 and put on its striking beauty then it is 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.099
 That's it, people said.
