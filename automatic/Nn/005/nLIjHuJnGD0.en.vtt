I'm<00:00:15.360> gonna<00:00:15.690> have<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.929> figure<00:00:16.080> out<00:00:16.170> how<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.350> get

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
I'm gonna have to figure out how to get

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.470 
I'm gonna have to figure out how to get
the<00:00:16.590> original<00:00:16.949> copy<00:00:17.100> back<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.609> could<00:00:18.119> just<00:00:18.270> take

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
the original copy back I could just take

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.080 
the original copy back I could just take
one<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.810> my<00:00:18.900> videos<00:00:19.580> original<00:00:20.580> videos<00:00:20.850> and

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
one of my videos original videos and

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.400 
one of my videos original videos and
just<00:00:21.240> like<00:00:21.390> cut<00:00:21.600> out<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.779> intro<00:00:22.050> from<00:00:22.140> there

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
just like cut out the intro from there

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.140 
just like cut out the intro from there
but<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.010> won't<00:00:23.100> look<00:00:23.310> as<00:00:23.519> good<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:23.880> stuff<00:00:24.029> like

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
but it won't look as good and stuff like

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.849 
but it won't look as good and stuff like
that<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.390> I'll<00:00:24.720> figure<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.050> out<00:00:25.199> but<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.650> won't

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
that so I'll figure it out but it won't

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.320 
that so I'll figure it out but it won't
be<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:25.980> bunch<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.580> problem<00:00:26.789> just<00:00:27.060> give<00:00:27.180> me

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
be that bunch of a problem just give me

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.599 
be that bunch of a problem just give me
a<00:00:27.570> couple<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.349> videos<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.800> figure<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.130> out<00:00:29.189> so

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
a couple of videos to figure that out so

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.730 
a couple of videos to figure that out so
anyways<00:00:30.210> looking<00:00:30.480> at<00:00:30.599> his<00:00:30.720> team<00:00:30.960> looks<00:00:31.619> like

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
anyways looking at his team looks like

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.950 
anyways looking at his team looks like
his<00:00:31.890> mega<00:00:32.130> evolution<00:00:32.730> could<00:00:32.940> either<00:00:33.239> be<00:00:33.600> al

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
his mega evolution could either be al

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.620 
his mega evolution could either be al
exam<00:00:34.380> or<00:00:34.620> absol<00:00:35.160> I'm<00:00:35.910> just<00:00:36.149> gonna<00:00:36.270> kind<00:00:36.540> of

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
exam or absol I'm just gonna kind of

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.229 
exam or absol I'm just gonna kind of
assume<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.260> was<00:00:37.500> absalon<00:00:38.250> estly<00:00:38.430> because<00:00:39.210> I

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
assume it was absalon estly because I

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.979 
assume it was absalon estly because I
feel<00:00:39.960> like<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.469> just<00:00:40.860> because<00:00:41.219> um<00:00:42.030> absol<00:00:42.809> is

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
feel like that just because um absol is

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.260 
feel like that just because um absol is
like<00:00:43.140> more<00:00:43.590> useful<00:00:44.160> or<00:00:44.430> like<00:00:44.700> less<00:00:45.000> useful

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
like more useful or like less useful

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.910 
like more useful or like less useful
without<00:00:45.570> his<00:00:45.809> mega<00:00:45.960> evolution<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:46.739> that's

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
without his mega evolution so that's

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.290 
without his mega evolution so that's
kind<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.129> honestly<00:00:47.489> what<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.730> thought<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.149> would

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
kind of honestly what I thought it would

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.299 
kind of honestly what I thought it would
be<00:00:48.450> at<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.629> point<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.500> anyways<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.100> end<00:00:50.250> up

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
be at this point so anyways I end up

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.670 
be at this point so anyways I end up
going<00:00:50.579> out<00:00:50.670> with<00:00:50.850> my<00:00:51.000> slope<00:00:51.300> early<00:00:51.899> he's<00:00:52.530> going

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
going out with my slope early he's going

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.410 
going out with my slope early he's going
to<00:00:52.770> go<00:00:52.860> with<00:00:52.980> his<00:00:53.190> trevenant<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.789> Jess<00:00:54.300> you're

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
to go with his trevenant and Jess you're

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.670 
to go with his trevenant and Jess you're
just<00:00:54.539> gonna<00:00:54.629> end<00:00:54.719> up<00:00:54.930> going<00:00:55.050> for<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.289> will<00:00:55.440> was

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
just gonna end up going for the will was

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.979 
just gonna end up going for the will was
honestly<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.340> isn't<00:00:56.520> too<00:00:56.760> bad<00:00:56.789> but<00:00:57.360> i<00:00:57.780> guess

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
honestly this isn't too bad but i guess

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.569 
honestly this isn't too bad but i guess
like<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.260> problem<00:00:58.739> would<00:00:58.890> be<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.550> i

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
like the problem would be is that i

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.250 
like the problem would be is that i
can't<00:00:59.789> really<00:01:00.120> do<00:01:00.300> too<00:01:00.480> much<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.079> guy

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
can't really do too much to this guy

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.529 
can't really do too much to this guy
back<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:02.010> unfortunately<00:01:02.910> like<00:01:03.149> Fire<00:01:03.390> Blast

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
back and unfortunately like Fire Blast

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.359 
back and unfortunately like Fire Blast
isn't<00:01:03.899> really<00:01:04.080> doing<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.379> much<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.890> he's

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
isn't really doing that much and he's

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.429 
isn't really doing that much and he's
like<00:01:05.580> rest<00:01:05.909> Lum<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.930> sucks<00:01:07.229> because

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
like rest Lum and that sucks because

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.320 
like rest Lum and that sucks because
harvest<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.189> basically<00:01:08.640> he<00:01:08.790> gets<00:01:08.970> full<00:01:09.180> HP

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
harvest so basically he gets full HP

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.899 
harvest so basically he gets full HP
every<00:01:09.750> time<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.710> anyways<00:01:11.340> nothing<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.760> can

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
every time so anyways nothing I can

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.730 
every time so anyways nothing I can
really<00:01:11.939> do<00:01:12.240> about<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.479> he<00:01:13.350> actually<00:01:13.500> ended

doesn't have a mega evolution anymore

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.899 
doesn't have a mega evolution anymore

now he's going to end up going into his
trevenant<00:02:24.330> what<00:02:24.540> I'm<00:02:24.629> going<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.810> decide<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.200> do

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
trevenant what I'm going to decide to do

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.839 
trevenant what I'm going to decide to do
is<00:02:25.500> I'm<00:02:25.650> just<00:02:25.799> going<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.040> decide<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.459> go<00:02:26.580> for<00:02:26.610> a

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
is I'm just going to decide to go for a

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.490 
is I'm just going to decide to go for a
skull<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.720> thought<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:28.049> was<00:02:28.200> going<00:02:28.379> to<00:02:28.440> be

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
skull and I thought this was going to be

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.039 
skull and I thought this was going to be
the<00:02:28.680> best<00:02:28.860> usage<00:02:29.220> for<00:02:29.430> me<00:02:29.580> right<00:02:29.819> now<00:02:29.849> I<00:02:30.750> was

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
the best usage for me right now I was

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.360 
the best usage for me right now I was
kind<00:02:31.200> of<00:02:31.290> hoping<00:02:31.349> that<00:02:31.709> maybe<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:32.040> would<00:02:32.160> burn

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
kind of hoping that maybe you would burn

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.979 
kind of hoping that maybe you would burn
him<00:02:32.519> or<00:02:32.610> anything<00:02:32.790> but<00:02:33.090> then<00:02:33.239> again<00:02:33.360> he<00:02:33.690> Islam

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
him or anything but then again he Islam

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.300 
him or anything but then again he Islam
so<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.349> doesn't<00:02:34.560> really<00:02:34.620> matter<00:02:34.830> in<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.129> long

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
so it doesn't really matter in the long

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.039 
so it doesn't really matter in the long
run<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.730> didn't<00:02:36.120> really<00:02:36.209> want<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.480> switch<00:02:36.720> out<00:02:36.930> I

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
run I didn't really want to switch out I

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.270 
run I didn't really want to switch out I
didn't<00:02:37.260> want<00:02:37.410> anything<00:02:37.590> else<00:02:37.799> taking<00:02:38.129> damage

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
didn't want anything else taking damage

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.949 
didn't want anything else taking damage
from<00:02:38.459> this<00:02:38.700> thing<00:02:38.849> so<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.060> was<00:02:39.150> like<00:02:39.239> okay<00:02:39.450> slow

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
from this thing so I was like okay slow

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
will do and maybe this will do a little

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.190 
will do and maybe this will do a little
bit<00:03:14.250> more<00:03:14.430> it<00:03:14.790> actually<00:03:15.090> does<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:15.450> ton<00:03:15.810> more

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
bit more it actually does a ton more

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.229 
bit more it actually does a ton more
does<00:03:16.440> a<00:03:16.470> large<00:03:17.069> amount<00:03:17.489> of<00:03:17.579> damage<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:17.970> was

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239

does a large amount of damage that was
beautiful<00:03:18.989> damage<00:03:19.349> did<00:03:19.829> not<00:03:20.040> expected<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.639> do

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
beautiful damage did not expected to do

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.729 
beautiful damage did not expected to do
that<00:03:20.940> much<00:03:21.090> honestly<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.959> looks<00:03:22.230> like<00:03:22.380> the

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
that much honestly it looks like the

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.319 
that much honestly it looks like the
next<00:03:23.069> foul<00:03:23.280> play<00:03:23.519> obviously<00:03:23.760> we'll<00:03:24.150> be<00:03:24.269> able

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
next foul play obviously we'll be able

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.759 
next foul play obviously we'll be able
to<00:03:24.450> knock<00:03:24.599> him<00:03:24.780> out<00:03:24.870> even<00:03:25.109> though<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:25.319> am<00:03:25.530> burned

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
to knock him out even though I am burned

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.259 
to knock him out even though I am burned
shouldn't<00:03:26.190> be<00:03:26.250> that<00:03:26.370> much<00:03:26.519> of<00:03:26.700> an<00:03:26.790> issue<00:03:26.880> so

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
shouldn't be that much of an issue so

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.420 
shouldn't be that much of an issue so
now<00:03:27.450> he's<00:03:27.900> gonna<00:03:28.139> end<00:03:28.349> up<00:03:28.530> going<00:03:28.739> into<00:03:29.010> his

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
now he's gonna end up going into his

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.309 
now he's gonna end up going into his
slow<00:03:29.669> bro<00:03:29.849> I<00:03:30.030> decided<00:03:30.419> to<00:03:30.510> go<00:03:30.630> for<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:30.989> foul

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
slow bro I decided to go for the foul

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.110 
slow bro I decided to go for the foul
play<00:03:31.530> again<00:03:31.829> and<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.400> does<00:03:32.549> literally<00:03:32.970> nothing

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
play again and it does literally nothing

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.000 
play again and it does literally nothing
at<00:03:33.359> all<00:03:33.480> to<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.750> slow<00:03:33.989> bro<00:03:34.139> which<00:03:34.349> is<00:03:34.530> pretty

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
at all to the slow bro which is pretty

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.559 
at all to the slow bro which is pretty
funny<00:03:35.370> it's<00:03:35.849> obviously<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:36.329> could<00:03:36.419> tell

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
funny it's obviously you could tell

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:37.940 
funny it's obviously you could tell
there<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.019> trevenant<00:03:37.470> with<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.769> willow

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
there that the trevenant with the willow

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.530 
there that the trevenant with the willow
is<00:03:38.190> it's<00:03:38.400> going<00:03:38.579> to<00:03:38.639> be<00:03:38.730> specially<00:03:39.090> defensive

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
is it's going to be specially defensive

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
is it's going to be specially defensive
probably<00:03:39.870> should<00:03:40.019> have<00:03:40.079> thought<00:03:40.200> about<00:03:40.410> that

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
probably should have thought about that

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.770 
probably should have thought about that
before<00:03:40.849> but<00:03:41.849> I<00:03:41.910> just<00:03:42.120> wasn't<00:03:42.299> really<00:03:42.569> thinking

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
before but I just wasn't really thinking

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.140 
before but I just wasn't really thinking
about<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.079> so<00:03:43.410> I<00:03:43.620> don't<00:03:44.519> really<00:03:44.669> have<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.910> switch

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
about it so I don't really have a switch

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.550 
about it so I don't really have a switch
it<00:03:45.269> for<00:03:45.480> umbreon<00:03:45.959> either<00:03:46.139> i<00:03:46.200> don't<00:03:46.410> really

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
it for umbreon either i don't really

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.530 
it for umbreon either i don't really
want<00:03:47.040> anything<00:03:47.280> taking<00:03:47.700> slow<00:03:48.120> growers<00:03:48.329> heads

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
want anything taking slow growers heads

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.330 
want anything taking slow growers heads

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
nice thing about this is though is that

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.129 
nice thing about this is though is that
I<00:04:23.610> can<00:04:23.849> take<00:04:24.060> a<00:04:24.120> shadow<00:04:24.479> ball<00:04:24.690> and<00:04:24.930> then

retaliate with a bull strike but the

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.119 
retaliate with a bull strike but the
problem<00:04:27.569> is<00:04:27.749> is<00:04:27.930> that<00:04:27.990> I'm<00:04:28.530> actually<00:04:28.740> not

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:29.129 
problem is is that I'm actually not

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:30.230 
problem is is that I'm actually not
going<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.430> be<00:04:29.490> able<00:04:29.520> to<00:04:29.819> knock<00:04:29.999> him<00:04:30.180> out
