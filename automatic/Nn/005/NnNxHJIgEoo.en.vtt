something but the biggest thing I did
wrong<00:01:18.210> here<00:01:18.420> was<00:01:18.600> not<00:01:18.780> priming<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.400> or<00:01:20.400> not

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
wrong here was not priming it or not

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.249 
wrong here was not priming it or not
priming<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.299> but<00:01:21.420> not<00:01:21.509> putting<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.840> light<00:01:22.020> color

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
priming it but not putting a light color

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.950 
priming it but not putting a light color
underneath<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:23.090> doing<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.180> orange<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:24.630> top<00:01:24.659> of

underneath it doing it orange on top of
black<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.259> thought<00:01:25.439> if<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.619> just<00:01:25.650> sees<00:01:25.950> enough

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
black I thought if I just sees enough

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.450 
black I thought if I just sees enough
codes<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:27.299> would<00:01:27.450> look<00:01:27.540> bright<00:01:28.159> all<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.310> other

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130
