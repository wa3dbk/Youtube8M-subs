00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.580
Hi Everyone! Kristina here. Welcome to another
card video. Today I'm using this die set from

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.839
Pretty Pink Posh and this is a brand new die
set that was just released a few days ago

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:15.280
and I'm taking part in their blog hop kind
of showcasing some of their new products.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.689
So I thought I would show you a card using
this die set and the first thing I'm doing

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.470
is die cutting some Sea Glass card stock from
Simon Says Stamp and I'm doing selective die

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.070
cutting. You'll notice that both cutting pads
weren't completely on the die. I like had

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.470
the top one only coming in half way and that
makes it so that it only cuts three of those

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.500
circles. I just wanted three of them, I didn't
want all six. I'm going to be placing it over

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.520
the top of some white card stock here. I'm
going to use my and trace around those circle

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.320
windows. This is going to give me an idea
of where I have space to stamp inside those

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.020
circles. So the stamp set I'm using is from
Lawn Fawn and it's the Hello Sunshine stamp

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.619
set. I'm going to just stamp the three birds
that are in the stamp set in those three circles.

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.890
I'm using Memento Tuxedo Black ink, because
I'm going to be coloring them with some Copic

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.650
Markers. So I erased those circles and then
I did one wash of color in Y11 and now I'm

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.440
going to come in with Y18 and add some more
intense yellow. I'm just putting it right

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.060
on the bottom of each bird kind of on their
bellies. Then I'm going to take that lighter

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.890
yellow color and go back and kind of blend
that out. This is really simple Copic coloring.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.479
Just a few colors and it's really easy to
get a nice blend with these two yellow colors.

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.300
I thought it was just nice and bright and
cheerful on these little birds. So after I

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.370
had those colored I took some Clear Kool Tak
foam adhesive. This is clear foam adhesive.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:52.370
I just cut some little squares and put it
on that light blue piece. I adhered the bird

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.920
card stock to this note card. This note card
is from Lawn Fawn also. It's actually 3.5"x5.25"

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.340
I think or maybe 5" tall, I can't remember
exactly. But it's such a cute note card and

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.359
they are already cut and folded for you and
everything. So I'm using some Slate card stock

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:16.349
from Simon Says Stamp. I'm using the stamp
that says Hello Sunshine., but I'm taking

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:22.400
off the hello and just having sunshine. I
stamped that in VersaMark ink. Then coated

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.120
it with some Hero Arts white embossing powder.
I heat set that just until it melted and then

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.480
I put it on the front of the card to just
kind of decide on spacing and I just place

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.489
that on here, it's not adhered yet. Cut off
the end so I knew how far I wanted it to hang

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:43.469
over the edge. Then I took my scissors and
cut a little V-Shape out of the end so that

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:48.579
it looked more like a ribbon. Then I'm going
to take some adhesive. I'm using Tombow Xtreme

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:53.139
Adhesive today. Super super strong adhesive.
I just did a run of that adhesive along the

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:59.029
back and I'm going to adhere that right above
the three birds, exactly where I was just

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:04.040
kind of seeing where it was placed before.
So I'll just adhere that down and then I'll

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.819
go ahead and open up the card and trim off
the excess on the one side. Then I have this

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:15.480
star die cut. This is from a die cut set from
Lawn Fawn. It's from the same collection and

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.189
I just cut it out of some Lemon Chiffon card
stock from Simon Says Stamp. I cut off the

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:27.010
little tips on a couple of the rays so that
I can have it look like it's going behind

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.609
the bird piece, but it's really just on top
of the gray that's above the birds. So I put

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.779
a little adhesive on the sun and then I'm
putting that right down on the side of the

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:43.230
card and it's going to overhang both sides
of the card. So I've got the sun on one side

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.639
and then the gray banner on the other. So
I decided to cut out four more of these hello

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:53.620
die cuts. So I have 5 total. The die is from
Lawn Fawn as well. I'm just using my Tombow

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.639
Mono Multiglue to put dots of adhesive on
them and then I'm going to be stacking all

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:03.529
five die cuts on top of each other. This is
going to create almost like a faux chipboard.

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:07.659
It's going to be a really think piece to put
on top of the card. It's going to look its

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:11.930
going to look really really neat. I'm just
adhering that 5th piece of card stock right

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.509
on top., I like to use liquid adhesive because
it's easier to make sure that everything is

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:22.190
lines up right because you have a little bit
of time to move things around. Now, I'm going

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.960
to put adhesive on the back of that die cut.
Iâ€™ll be pressing it down onto the card front

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.460
right over top of the sunshine. Above the
sunshine bird and on top of the sun ray right

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.389
there. So, I'm almost done with the card.
I just have a couple more things to do. Going

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.030
to be adding this string to the very bottom.
This string is from Lawn Fawn as well. I'm

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:49.900
using quite a bit of Lawn Fawn stuff on today's
card. I just tied that into a bow. Trimmed

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.900
off the tails. Then I took some Ranger white
enamel accents and I coated the entire die

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.300
cut that says hello I just thought it was
a really cool effect and it gives a little

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.050
bit of a shine and almost looks like a puffy
sticker. I think it looks really really neat.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.930
I'm going to give you a close up shot of it
in a minute. Here we go. So you can see how

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.979
thick that die cut it. Now I'm going to take
my Clear Wink of Stella Brush pen and add

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:21.560
a little bit of shimmer on top of the birds.
I also wanted to mention that I corner chomped

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.789
those top corners using 0.5" Corner Chomper
and that is the card for today. Make sure

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.349
