00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
like to apply it on the sides of my nose

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.670 
like to apply it on the sides of my nose
so<00:03:03.930> I<00:03:03.989> can<00:03:04.230> better<00:03:04.439> hide<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.980> creases<00:03:06.620> on<00:03:07.620> the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
so I can better hide the creases on the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.390 
so I can better hide the creases on the
top<00:03:08.129> of<00:03:08.280> my<00:03:08.430> lip<00:03:08.730> on<00:03:09.379> the<00:03:10.379> bottom<00:03:10.739> of<00:03:10.829> my<00:03:10.889> lip

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
top of my lip on the bottom of my lip

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.990 
top of my lip on the bottom of my lip
also<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:13.310> I<00:03:14.310> like<00:03:14.639> to<00:03:14.760> hide<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:16.200> highlight<00:03:17.040> on

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
also and I like to hide the highlight on

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.649 
also and I like to hide the highlight on
the<00:03:18.769> bottom<00:03:19.769> of<00:03:19.919> the<00:03:20.069> contour<00:03:20.459> line<00:03:20.700> so<00:03:21.419> I<00:03:21.480> get

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:21.659 
the bottom of the contour line so I get

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:28.030 
the bottom of the contour line so I get
to<00:03:21.750> find<00:03:21.959> that<00:03:22.079> line<00:03:22.319> a<00:03:22.349> little<00:03:22.500> better<00:03:23.239> okay

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.830 

as<00:03:29.040> you<00:03:29.159> can<00:03:29.310> see<00:03:29.549> the<00:03:29.790> highlight<00:03:30.120> is<00:03:30.450> coming

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
as you can see the highlight is coming

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.740 
as you can see the highlight is coming
in<00:03:30.989> very<00:03:31.349> well

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.830 

and<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.800> also<00:03:34.950> added<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.760> my<00:03:36.240> forehead<00:03:38.840> to

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
and it also added to my forehead to

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.810 
and it also added to my forehead to
blended<00:03:40.380> that<00:03:41.840> on<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:42.990> a<00:03:43.020> line<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:43.820> my

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
blended that on to a line and my

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:51.760 
blended that on to a line and my
highlight<00:03:45.300> line<00:03:45.540> I<00:03:46.430> just<00:03:47.430> use<00:03:47.690> kind<00:03:48.690> of

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.840 

dabbing<00:03:52.770> motion<00:03:53.220> near<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.800> contour<00:03:55.800> line<00:03:56.010> so

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
dabbing motion near the contour line so

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.250 
dabbing motion near the contour line so
I<00:03:56.910> like<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.150> remove<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.690> excess<00:03:59.180> fond<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.900> of

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
I like to remove the excess fond of of

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.870 
I like to remove the excess fond of of
my<00:04:01.470> brush<00:04:01.740> so<00:04:02.130> I<00:04:02.190> can<00:04:02.340> go<00:04:02.460> ahead<00:04:02.520> and<00:04:02.640> blend

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
my brush so I can go ahead and blend

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.760 
my brush so I can go ahead and blend
that<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.150> little<00:04:03.510> better<00:04:03.690> it<00:04:04.530> doesn't

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
that a little better it doesn't

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.880 
that a little better it doesn't
interfere<00:04:05.070> with<00:04:05.310> any<00:04:05.690> of<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.930> highlight<00:04:07.770> of

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
interfere with any of the highlight of

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.180 
interfere with any of the highlight of
the<00:04:07.980> contour<00:04:08.480> what<00:04:09.480> I<00:04:09.510> like<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:09.900> do<00:04:10.050> is<00:04:10.380> I<00:04:11.040> like

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
the contour what I like to do is I like

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.099 
the contour what I like to do is I like
to<00:04:11.930> sweep<00:04:13.790> back<00:04:14.790> and<00:04:15.060> forth<00:04:15.360> on<00:04:15.570> the<00:04:15.720> contour

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
to sweep back and forth on the contour

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.160 
to sweep back and forth on the contour
line<00:04:16.380> as<00:04:17.190> you'll<00:04:17.400> see<00:04:17.609> here<00:04:18.090> and<00:04:18.330> then<00:04:19.430> up<00:04:20.430> in

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
line as you'll see here and then up in

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.400 
line as you'll see here and then up in
circular<00:04:22.170> motions<00:04:22.650> work<00:04:23.070> up<00:04:23.810> so<00:04:24.810> you<00:04:25.110> want<00:04:25.350> to

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
circular motions work up so you want to

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.710 
circular motions work up so you want to
blend<00:04:25.650> in<00:04:25.830> that<00:04:25.880> contour<00:04:26.880> line<00:04:27.060> with<00:04:27.450> the

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
blend in that contour line with the

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.560 
blend in that contour line with the
highlight<00:04:28.320> okay<00:04:29.100> so<00:04:29.160> again<00:04:32.120> circular<00:04:33.120> motions

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
highlight okay so again circular motions

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.280 
highlight okay so again circular motions
upwards<00:04:34.380> and<00:04:35.010> then<00:04:35.400> sweep<00:04:35.970> back<00:04:36.540> and<00:04:36.930> forth

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
upwards and then sweep back and forth

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.409 
upwards and then sweep back and forth
and<00:04:37.680> then<00:04:38.100> circular<00:04:38.550> motions<00:04:38.910> again<00:04:39.210> that's

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
and then circular motions again that's

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.750 
and then circular motions again that's
usually<00:04:39.860> how<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:40.980> do<00:04:41.160> it

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
usually how I do it

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.909 
usually how I do it
okay<00:04:43.430> it's<00:04:44.430> gonna<00:04:44.580> go<00:04:44.850> ahead<00:04:45.120> and<00:04:45.480> blend<00:04:46.440> in<00:04:46.710> my

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
okay it's gonna go ahead and blend in my

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.309 
okay it's gonna go ahead and blend in my
neck

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:48.319 
neck

and my forehead just make sure the the
key<00:05:01.729> to<00:05:01.879> contouring<00:05:02.599> is<00:05:02.749> really<00:05:03.050> to<00:05:03.259> blend<00:05:03.589> and

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:04.189 
key to contouring is really to blend and

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:09.570 
key to contouring is really to blend and
blend<00:05:04.520> and<00:05:04.999> blend<00:05:05.229> until<00:05:06.229> your<00:05:06.860> heart<00:05:07.069> desires

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
again I'm just gonna draw a line on the

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.159 
again I'm just gonna draw a line on the
sides<00:05:29.509> of<00:05:29.659> my<00:05:29.809> nose<00:05:31.240> and<00:05:32.240> I'm<00:05:32.599> gonna<00:05:32.719> work<00:05:32.959> that

sides of my nose and I'm gonna work that

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:38.379 
sides of my nose and I'm gonna work that
line<00:05:33.469> into<00:05:34.279> my<00:05:34.990> usually<00:05:35.990> my<00:05:36.139> eye<00:05:36.349> shadow<00:05:37.389> for
