00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.399 
now it's basically the little ball of
that<00:01:47.700> forms<00:01:48.180> at<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.689> tip<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.020> wick<00:01:49.200> and

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
that forms at the tip of the wick and

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.740 
that forms at the tip of the wick and
when<00:01:50.130> your<00:01:50.640> wicks<00:01:50.970> have<00:01:51.149> mushroom<00:01:51.509> tops

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
when your wicks have mushroom tops

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.569 
when your wicks have mushroom tops
that's<00:01:52.500> always<00:01:52.740> going<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.220> help<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.399> ensure

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
that's always going to help to ensure

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.800 
that's always going to help to ensure
that<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.909> flames<00:01:54.090> are<00:01:54.180> going<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.420> get<00:01:54.509> really

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
that the flames are going to get really

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.660 
that the flames are going to get really
big<00:01:55.170> thick<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.740> wide<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.369> when<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.549> have

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
big thick and wide and when you have

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.429 
big thick and wide and when you have
flames<00:01:56.909> like<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.299> chances<00:01:58.170> are<00:01:58.290> it's<00:01:58.409> going

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
flames like that chances are it's going

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.020 
flames like that chances are it's going
to<00:01:58.619> melt<00:01:58.710> your<00:01:58.829> wax<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.219> lot<00:01:59.369> smoothly<00:01:59.820> and

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
to melt your wax a lot smoothly and

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.539 
to melt your wax a lot smoothly and
quickly<00:02:00.770> consistently<00:02:01.770> giving<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.280> better

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
quickly consistently giving you a better

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.819 
quickly consistently giving you a better
burn<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.060> hopefully<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.750> better<00:02:03.899> throw<00:02:04.290> just

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
burn and hopefully a better throw just

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.130 
burn and hopefully a better throw just
because<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.640> flames<00:02:05.939> are<00:02:06.240> really<00:02:06.810> good<00:02:06.990> does

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
because the flames are really good does

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.270 
because the flames are really good does
not<00:02:07.170> mean<00:02:07.560> it's<00:02:07.680> going<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.890> give<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.099> good

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
not mean it's going to give you a good

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.550 
not mean it's going to give you a good
throw<00:02:08.489> because<00:02:08.759> I've<00:02:08.940> had<00:02:09.200> excellent<00:02:10.200> burning

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
throw because I've had excellent burning

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.229 
throw because I've had excellent burning
candles<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.190> throw<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.910> just<00:02:12.090> like

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
candles and throw is just like

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.250 
candles and throw is just like
non-existent<00:02:12.480> so

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
non-existent so

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.280 
non-existent so
that's<00:02:13.980> always<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.340> gamble<00:02:14.730> but<00:02:15.140> you<00:02:16.140> know<00:02:16.230> at

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
that's always a gamble but you know at

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.960 
that's always a gamble but you know at
least<00:02:16.349> a<00:02:16.530> burn<00:02:16.739> so<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.069> have<00:02:17.340> one<00:02:17.549> out<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.790> two

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
least a burn so you have one out of two

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.750 
least a burn so you have one out of two
so<00:02:18.180> that's<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.290> good<00:02:19.439> thing<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:20.519> was<00:02:20.670> the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
so that's a good thing and that was the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.270 
so that's a good thing and that was the
first<00:02:20.790> day<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:22.230> set<00:02:22.439> lingered<00:02:22.920> all

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
medium to long so that's always cool

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:50.599 
medium to long so that's always cool
needs<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.769> little<00:03:49.980> mushroom<00:03:50.250> tops<00:03:50.459> on

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
there now look very closely see where

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.270 
there now look very closely see where
the<00:03:55.949> wax<00:03:56.190> beginning<00:03:56.849> to<00:03:57.030> kind<00:03:57.269> of<00:03:57.329> like<00:03:58.280> like

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
the wax beginning to kind of like like

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.849 
the wax beginning to kind of like like
there's<00:03:59.519> that<00:04:00.349> it<00:04:01.349> looks<00:04:01.500> like<00:04:01.620> like

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
there's that it looks like like

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.180 
there's that it looks like like
scattered<00:04:02.370> black<00:04:02.760> particles<00:04:03.419> in<00:04:03.780> there<00:04:04.010> on<00:04:05.010> if

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
scattered black particles in there on if

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.770 
scattered black particles in there on if
you<00:04:05.280> can<00:04:05.400> see<00:04:05.579> it<00:04:05.609> but<00:04:05.849> it's<00:04:05.909> like<00:04:06.090> there<00:04:06.510> and

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
you can see it but it's like there and

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.420 
you can see it but it's like there and
it's<00:04:07.260> beginning<00:04:07.739> to<00:04:07.769> turn<00:04:09.349> not<00:04:10.349> really<00:04:10.650> black

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
it's beginning to turn not really black

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.399 
it's beginning to turn not really black
but<00:04:12.000> I<00:04:12.180> can<00:04:12.209> see<00:04:12.540> like<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.930> change<00:04:13.169> is<00:04:13.260> going

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409 
but I can see like the change is going

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:14.599 
but I can see like the change is going
to<00:04:13.470> happen<00:04:13.769> especially<00:04:13.829> if<00:04:14.129> it's<00:04:14.220> candle

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
to happen especially if it's candle

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.339 
to happen especially if it's candle

the mass appeal route I wish they would
have<00:05:03.210> you<00:05:04.199> know<00:05:04.229> instead<00:05:04.740> of<00:05:04.800> like<00:05:05.039> the<00:05:05.970> icing

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270

should have been like cream cheese I

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.580 
should have been like cream cheese I
mean<00:05:09.539> it<00:05:09.599> would<00:05:09.690> have<00:05:09.780> made<00:05:09.870> sense<00:05:09.930> it's<00:05:10.500> a

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
mean it would have made sense it's a

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.820 
mean it would have made sense it's a
carrot<00:05:10.889> cake<00:05:11.099> but<00:05:11.789> instead<00:05:11.970> they<00:05:12.270> went<00:05:12.830> the

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
carrot cake but instead they went the

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.490 
carrot cake but instead they went the
sweet<00:05:14.220> massive<00:05:14.610> hill<00:05:14.990> route<00:05:15.990> and<00:05:16.199> they<00:05:16.289> did

sweet massive hill route and they did

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.620 
sweet massive hill route and they did
you<00:05:16.800> know<00:05:16.889> the<00:05:17.039> icing<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:17.759> that's<00:05:18.389> basically

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
you know the icing and that's basically

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.499 
you know the icing and that's basically
