00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.860 
following number one and I cannot stress
this<00:00:43.829> enough<00:00:43.969> it's<00:00:44.969> kind<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.360> hard<00:00:45.539> if<00:00:45.660> it's<00:00:45.780> a

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
this enough it's kind of hard if it's a

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.940 
this enough it's kind of hard if it's a
happy<00:00:46.230> poem<00:00:47.450> but<00:00:48.450> if<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.230> sad<00:00:49.440> poem<00:00:49.680> which

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
happy poem but if it's a sad poem which

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.950 
happy poem but if it's a sad poem which
is<00:00:49.980> basically<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.700> only<00:00:50.850> type<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.480> poem<00:00:51.780> that

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
is basically the only type of poem that

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.569 
is basically the only type of poem that
I<00:00:52.079> write<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:54.469> find<00:00:55.469> it's<00:00:55.620> really<00:00:56.039> easy<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.309> write

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
I write I find it's really easy to write

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.529 
I write I find it's really easy to write
if<00:00:56.850> your<00:00:57.570> emotions<00:00:57.960> are<00:00:58.109> really<00:00:58.320> raw<00:00:59.270> most<00:01:00.270> of

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
if your emotions are really raw most of

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.479 
if your emotions are really raw most of
the<00:01:00.660> time<00:01:00.870> now<00:01:01.140> sometimes<00:01:01.620> things<00:01:01.859> happen<00:01:02.250> and

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
the time now sometimes things happen and

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.100 
the time now sometimes things happen and
you<00:01:02.550> literally<00:01:03.420> can't<00:01:03.690> write<00:01:03.840> about<00:01:04.019> it

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
you literally can't write about it

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.450 
you literally can't write about it
because<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.409> hurts<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:04.650> much<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.220> can't

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
because it hurts so much that you can't

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.550 
because it hurts so much that you can't
even<00:01:05.519> think<00:01:05.640> which<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.479> totally<00:01:06.990> fine<00:01:07.200> and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
even think which is totally fine and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.130 
even think which is totally fine and
that's<00:01:08.189> kind<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.520> what<00:01:09.420> I've<00:01:09.540> been<00:01:09.810> doing

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
that's kind of what I've been doing

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.700 
that's kind of what I've been doing
lately

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
lately

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.480 
lately
so<00:01:11.510> what<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.540> would<00:01:12.659> suggest<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:14.010> rehash

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
so what I would suggest is to rehash

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.810 
so what I would suggest is to rehash
those<00:01:14.820> old<00:01:15.030> emotions<00:01:15.290> so<00:01:16.290> for<00:01:16.560> example<00:01:17.220> I'm

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
those old emotions so for example I'm

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.690 
those old emotions so for example I'm
reading<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.270> poem<00:01:18.479> right<00:01:18.659> now<00:01:18.780> about<00:01:19.580> you<00:01:20.580> know

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869

write poems is I start by thinking of
these<00:03:02.200> small<00:03:02.560> lines<00:03:02.800> that<00:03:03.190> I<00:03:03.220> really<00:03:03.670> like<00:03:03.880> and

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
these small lines that I really like and

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.330 
these small lines that I really like and
they're<00:03:04.330> like<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:05.470> zingers<00:03:05.860> that<00:03:06.100> I<00:03:06.130> call

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.220 
they're like the zingers that I call
them<00:03:06.519> like<00:03:06.670> they're<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.330> main<00:03:07.600> lines<00:03:07.959> that

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
them like they're the main lines that

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.949 
them like they're the main lines that
are<00:03:08.319> in<00:03:08.440> there<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:10.120> I<00:03:10.150> just<00:03:10.239> write<00:03:10.600> down<00:03:10.630> these

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
are in there so I just write down these

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.590 
are in there so I just write down these
lines<00:03:11.260> or<00:03:12.220> write<00:03:12.519> down<00:03:12.700> like<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:13.000> basis<00:03:13.420> of

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
the concept that I want to do and then

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.770 
the concept that I want to do and then
once<00:03:17.650> I<00:03:17.799> do<00:03:17.860> that<00:03:17.980> I<00:03:18.370> go<00:03:18.579> over<00:03:18.610> and<00:03:19.209> over<00:03:19.570> and

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
once I do that I go over and over and

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.120 
once I do that I go over and over and
over<00:03:20.110> and<00:03:20.320> I<00:03:20.410> try<00:03:20.620> to<00:03:20.650> write<00:03:20.920> words<00:03:21.160> that<00:03:21.400> fit

and<00:03:24.130> I<00:03:24.220> try<00:03:24.459> to<00:03:24.519> construct<00:03:25.090> it<00:03:25.329> use<00:03:25.600> some

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
and I try to construct it use some

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.479 
and I try to construct it use some
filler<00:03:26.110> sentences<00:03:26.709> I<00:03:26.860> guess<00:03:27.070> because<00:03:27.280> not

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
filler sentences I guess because not

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:28.650 
filler sentences I guess because not

the poem that I'm running there's a lot

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.039 
the poem that I'm running there's a lot
of<00:03:50.980> lines<00:03:51.160> that<00:03:51.280> are<00:03:51.370> kind<00:03:51.609> of<00:03:51.670> soso<00:03:52.090> so

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
of lines that are kind of soso so

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.630 
of lines that are kind of soso so
usually<00:03:53.470> what<00:03:53.620> I<00:03:53.650> do<00:03:53.769> is<00:03:54.010> just<00:03:54.040> write<00:03:54.459> them

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
usually what I do is just write them

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.490 
usually what I do is just write them
down<00:03:54.670> anyway<00:03:55.239> so<00:03:55.690> I<00:03:55.720> write<00:03:55.930> the<00:03:56.079> lines<00:03:56.290> down

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
down anyway so I write the lines down

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.430 
down anyway so I write the lines down
first<00:03:56.799> and<00:03:57.160> then<00:03:57.700> after<00:03:58.090> all<00:03:58.630> of<00:03:58.989> that's<00:03:59.170> done

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
first and then after all of that's done

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.050 
first and then after all of that's done
or<00:03:59.739> at<00:03:59.829> least<00:04:00.010> for<00:04:00.190> like<00:04:00.280> one<00:04:00.459> stands<00:04:00.790> out<00:04:01.030> of

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
or at least for like one stands out of

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.810 
or at least for like one stands out of
them<00:04:01.299> from<00:04:01.510> there<00:04:01.720> I'll<00:04:01.900> go<00:04:02.019> back<00:04:02.170> and

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
them from there I'll go back and

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.250 
them from there I'll go back and
construct<00:04:03.820> sentences<00:04:04.030> and<00:04:04.600> then<00:04:04.780> from<00:04:05.049> there

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
construct sentences and then from there

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.380 
construct sentences and then from there
a<00:04:05.530> look<00:04:06.040> and<00:04:06.250> see<00:04:06.430> how<00:04:06.640> I<00:04:06.670> can<00:04:06.940> change<00:04:06.970> things

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
a look and see how I can change things

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.569 
a look and see how I can change things
to<00:04:07.600> make<00:04:07.630> them<00:04:07.870> sound<00:04:08.079> a<00:04:08.200> bit<00:04:08.320> more

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
to make them sound a bit more

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:13.110 
to make them sound a bit more
interesting<00:04:09.630> so<00:04:11.430> like<00:04:12.430> if<00:04:12.640> there's<00:04:12.850> a<00:04:12.910> word

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120

don't want to repeat to make it sound a

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.569 
don't want to repeat to make it sound a
little<00:04:16.690> bit<00:04:16.900> more<00:04:16.930> mature<00:04:17.169> you<00:04:18.100> can<00:04:18.310> just<00:04:18.459> like

Souris<00:04:23.169> on<00:04:23.890> line<00:04:24.220> which<00:04:24.880> is<00:04:25.030> what<00:04:25.180> I<00:04:25.210> do<00:04:25.330> I<00:04:25.690> find

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
Souris on line which is what I do I find

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.720

also listening to music helps

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.200 
also listening to music helps

about memorization that's how the

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.680 
about memorization that's how the
