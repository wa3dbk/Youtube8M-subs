00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 hello my friends I am leonardo 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:09.450
 ramalho and today I'm going to start 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.610
 to make videos in French for 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.450
 help my French friends too 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.560
 well chosen 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:20.130
 the organ is not gone a little bit of regard 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.800
 to help what did not know 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.710
 gloves because that's money 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.210
 information we do not know the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.519
 part of the guards did not know and think 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.929
 that the gloves are all the same but 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.649
 it's not exactly like that 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.730
 today ten I also liked so 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.340
 the stores here in montreal quebec 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.100
 patience in may I actually 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.789
 also the son he congratulated for the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.780
 fifth year of the stores actually and 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.629
 for me in personal opinion this is the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.780
 best store for the guardians I 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.430
 even happening all over Quebec 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.280
 it's the best store because we do not 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.460
 find better varieties and 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.090
 good quality and of course good prices 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.369
 it's not an advertisement that I made 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.760
 for the stores if actually my opinion 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:19.580
 personal personal today I 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:22.380
 will you talk about the sncf where you m 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.799
 what was different with 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.979
 the models on the side the round the 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:35.009
 difference actually is the hockey form 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:37.729
 and we did it on the wrist and 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.740
 what's the point of these people's things 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:44.130
 that's a protection and at the same time 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.740
 we support for the wrists why 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.579
 the demands in hand because these 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:55.409
 horrible hockey crimes by talking about 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:57.840
 guys we have rubber zones in 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.180
 the fingers because they help us 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.729
 according to the company and didace that we 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.110
 help to make a good punch at 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.119
 balloon but usually it's not a 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.319
 big difference if you do not know 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.650
 how to make the right punches ok 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:23.329
 latex in one piece a little 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:27.379
 skull berries with the adidas logo 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:32.329
 neoprene not very very very elastic 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:36.189
 on the other hand we open we sync we do not 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:40.489
 will not be very elastic that gets done there 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:43.639
 59 his compensation orders has no 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.560
 asti bad the city of this part 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.849
 if dunga 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.459
 the movies that said the protections of the 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.530
 fingers are all these words live ok with 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:55.370
 in zip 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.889
 how here inside fake if you 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.780
 do not like the protections you can 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:01.579
 remove them quietly and 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.819
 the fit and not going to change big 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.040
 thing 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.010
 but that's your model who told me 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.430
 much surprised between the models we 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.419
 had before the speed because 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.889
 bands and berries adjusted to your hand 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:17.259
 of course the protections are good 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:20.479
 flexible 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:24.829
 that's the essence that you're not going to 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:27.169
 really felt the protection for me I 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.909
 do not like to be honest with you 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:32.180
 I do not like but these protections 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:34.639
 models he's calling me a lot the apple 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.919
 as I said oh 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:38.509
 at the beginning of the video the difference is 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.509
 that this apple the wet road 

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:42.799
 it is made to play in the rain that 

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:44.959
 wet conditions 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.449
 by cons I have the days I played with 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:51.439
 his models in a synthetic turf 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:54.560
 owns of course but always with a 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:58.489
 little gaming not right for montanier 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.590
 apple patrolled by sea or mid 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.540
 example in fact all the guys that you 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:09.009
 that you use it has to be it 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:09.009
 wet to keep his long life ok 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:15.650
 what are the fingers posed by the 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:18.259
 good on the flec cutting pump that goes 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.829
 talk to you about that after that but with 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:23.300
 this show at the fingertip as 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.410
 another brand is called rush 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.980
 ok the flu 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.810
 is really amazing like the three 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.620
 latest adidas models i give it 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.580
 well the resistance 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.410
 it depends how you play 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.810
 how are you going to enter a treaty or 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.490
 and store the gloves on the other hand 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.770
 What can I tell you 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:49.800
 series there are not many defaults I 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.110
 will show you a little bit about the 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.050
 protection and we have fingers when you 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.060
 can see I can close my hand 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.400
 quietly a thing that I like 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.720
 a lot it's fat duck and I can 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.550
 where my hand lives without the protections 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.520
 the ex yen my fingers ok you can see 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.260
 I can close and open my hand as long as 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.440
 he lies as if they do not have any 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.680
 protection inside the protection 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.680
 of focus 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:23.070
 it's going to be two-way that's your hand 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:25.890
 and do not go all the way 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:30.090
 looks like he's going to protect from the wind too much 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:32.610
 alright ok it 's fine of course it's okay 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.110
 help to make one stop but also the 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.170
 balloon comes loud because they knew 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:41.040
 do a support here that the protections 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:43.410
 finger hockey yesterday when I played 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.600
 with to do a little test I have 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.440
 ask even if I could do an art 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.910
 is that I did 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:53.700
 without these protection people then when 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.600
 I put his gloves on my hand for the 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:06:01.730
 first time I 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:04.350
 I found contracting citrate 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:08.490
 mechanical machines we will not say this 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.940
 that they look at it's really a 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:14.220
 machine 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:16.650
 ok the negatives the indian lbqq 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:20.340
 no wicks or soup but ch 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:23.100
 which allows it to look circulates to 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.990
 inside like that we can feel the 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:28.800
 comfortable and good hands dry during 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.070
 the games and rubbers under 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.110
 fingers 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:36.229
 he knows he is very fragile if you 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:39.840
 can see it's already broken at 4 by ok 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:41.970
 but that's just a small detail 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.889
 because it's not going to change the quality 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:48.110
 of the glove of course the flu that is of 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:51.750
 the other very important side of seeing it 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:54.660
 this little course between inches and 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:57.300
 the indicator and that will open 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.130
 all the hands at the complex ignite 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.800
 but in this part if he is a winner 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.990
 do not have that well it's almost certain that he 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.699
 will open 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:08.039
 but there are techniques for which it does not 

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:09.810
 do not follow but can not try 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:11.759
 use it for all the guys as per 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.220
 example if you wear 10 

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:16.740
 take pink like that it'll be more 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.479
 in bigger ones 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.310
 this way you will see more 

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:23.009
 space to live but by 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:25.289
 against as I said that we can not 

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:26.610
 use it for all the guys there are some 

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:28.340
 guys who are more adjusted who else 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:33.960
 if the gains are too big it's going to be 

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:36.270
 too much started it will move in that it's 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:39.810
 no good it's retro petty and will spoil 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:42.539
 more quickly and more this part there 

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:43.940
 ok if you have doubts and 

00:07:42.539 --> 00:07:46.880
 questions to do something 

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:51.599
 do not hesitate to write me here below 

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:52.620
 do not forget I liked the video and 

00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:57.650
 of course to share 

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:57.650
 thank you very much and see you next time
