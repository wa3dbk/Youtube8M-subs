00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.150
 sweetheart 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.460
 his mother never taught him to 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.460
 wash properly 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:01:04.379
 well 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.920
 look she finally learned to wash 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.320
 his linen 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.020
 I wonder how she did is 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.490
 well darling I have the answer 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.960
 for your information I got up early 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.960
 this morning and I washed our windows 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.170
 are we looking through a window that has 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.790
 need to be cleaned are we wearing 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.310
 judgments when we do not have 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.680
 all data 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.860
 the savior said why do you see her 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.960
 straw that is in your brother's eye 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.610
 and do not you see the beam that is 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.200
 in your eye or to paraphrase 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.970
 why do you think you are 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.150
 dirty linen with tulle m 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.470
 at his neighbor but does not see kills 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.150
 the window pane in his own house 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.460
 we really have no way of 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.670
 know the heart the intentions or the 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.020
 situation of someone who says or does 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.020
 something we find 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:10.960
 justify criticizing where the 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.960
 command did not judge points
