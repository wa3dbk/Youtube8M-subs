here his cheapest is actually 13,000 buy

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.770 
here his cheapest is actually 13,000 buy
it<00:02:09.569> now<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.470> we're<00:02:10.590> going<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.770> put<00:02:10.800> them<00:02:11.009> at<00:02:11.129> 12

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
it now so we're going to put them at 12

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.640 
it now so we're going to put them at 12
750<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:12.989> if<00:02:13.349> you<00:02:13.410> do

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
750 and if you do

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.309 
750 and if you do
math<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.610> e8<00:02:14.849> x<00:02:15.060> takes<00:02:15.420> away<00:02:15.659> about<00:02:15.959> seven

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
math the e8 x takes away about seven

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.399 
math the e8 x takes away about seven
hundred<00:02:16.349> coins<00:02:16.799> so<00:02:17.610> that's<00:02:17.939> 3k<00:02:18.540> profit<00:02:19.019> about

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
hundred coins so that's 3k profit about

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.960 
hundred coins so that's 3k profit about
that's<00:02:19.920> about<00:02:20.069> 2.5<00:02:20.670> 3k<00:02:21.269> profit<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:22.849> it's<00:02:23.849> a

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
that's about 2.5 3k profit and it's a

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.270 
that's about 2.5 3k profit and it's a
