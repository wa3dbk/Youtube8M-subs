Hello and welcome to The Vegan Corner.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.650
Today's recipe is for an innocent, delicious
smelling and ever-so-slightly

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.880
completely inedible vegan deodorant,
homemade of course!

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.330
This is the second recipe we have
proposed for our cosmetics line

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.390
and hopefully you'll enjoy it just
as much as the first one.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.180
This product is so good that it is capable
of making any man fall at your feet,

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.870
especially if you aim to get it
right in their eyes.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.750
The ingredient list is in the description
below the video.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.430
To being with, place the baking
soda and the water into a bowl.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.390
Stir the ingredients well until the baking
soda is completely dissolved.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.960
Now, take another container, tip in
the glycerine, the xanthan gum

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.730
and stir them well so to properly disperse it.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.510
Now, you want to add in a small quantity
of the water mixture you made before

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.720
(about 1tsp or 5ml) and use a milk frother
to properly combine the ingredients.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.320
Xanthan gum is very difficult to disperse
properly, especially in such

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.650
a small quantity of product.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.020
This is why you must use this piece of equipment
to obtain a smooth final deodorant.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.120
The other option is to use a blender for this
task and to make 1 litre of deodorant,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.900
but I honestly doubt that any of us

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.930
are in such desperate need of deodorant.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.010
Anyway, keep adding a little water
mixture at a time and working it in

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.680
until it is all incorporated.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.680
An important thing to mention is that this
product has no antiperspirant action,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.930
due to it being completely free
from antiperspirant agents.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.140
Makes sense really.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.520
Also, with this product being homemade
and preservatives free,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.760
it won't last very long at room temperature,
so make sure to keep it in a dark place

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.650
and to use it within a month after making it.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.050
At this point, add in the aloe gel and stir it in.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.930
The last step is to add in the oil, the
essential oils and stir them in

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.390
using a spoon or a small  spatula
to complete the product.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.040
We like to store this product in a roll-on
bottle so that it is easy to apply.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.580
You can either use the bottle
of a finished deodorant,

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.050
or buy some empty roll-on bottles
on eBay; your choice!

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.180
And there you have it, your completely vegan
and amazing-smelling roll-on deodorant.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.510
