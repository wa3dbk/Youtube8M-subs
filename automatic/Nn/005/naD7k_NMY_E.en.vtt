have<00:00:45.060> a<00:00:45.090> temperature<00:00:45.570> drop<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.230> if<00:00:46.380> you

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 
have a temperature drop so if you

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.010 
have a temperature drop so if you
monitor<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> temperature<00:00:48.060> around<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.570> 60

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
monitor the temperature around that 60

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.200 
monitor the temperature around that 60
second<00:00:49.470> to<00:00:49.620> 65th<00:00:50.250> day<00:00:50.490> you'll<00:00:50.790> notice<00:00:51.090> a

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
temperature drop and then sometimes you

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.950 
temperature drop and then sometimes you
know<00:00:55.800> they'll<00:00:56.040> strain<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:57.120> hold<00:00:57.450> their<00:00:57.690> tail

up they'll act uncomfortable and they

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.540 
up they'll act uncomfortable and they

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
don't produce a pup okay so let's say a

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.780 
don't produce a pup okay so let's say a
puppy<00:01:03.030> comes<00:01:03.360> out<00:01:03.979> but<00:01:04.979> then<00:01:05.189> over<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.759> next

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
puppy comes out but then over the next

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.390 
puppy comes out but then over the next
couple<00:01:06.270> hours<00:01:06.360> no<00:01:06.930> puppies<00:01:07.350> come<00:01:07.620> how<00:01:08.100> do<00:01:08.159> you

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
couple hours no puppies come how do you

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.570 
couple hours no puppies come how do you
know<00:01:08.900> that<00:01:09.900> or<00:01:10.710> how<00:01:10.979> do<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.100> know<00:01:11.280> when<00:01:11.490> you

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
know that or how do you know when you

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.580 
know that or how do you know when you
need<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.820> go<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> veterinarian<00:01:12.390> okay<00:01:13.110> and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
need to go to the veterinarian okay and

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.160 
need to go to the veterinarian okay and
I<00:01:14.130> tell<00:01:14.430> people<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> general<00:01:15.570> rule<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.960> thumb

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
I tell people as a general rule of thumb

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.039 
I tell people as a general rule of thumb
if<00:01:16.530> they<00:01:16.979> don't<00:01:17.190> produce<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.760> puppy<00:01:18.240> at<00:01:18.479> about

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
if they don't produce a puppy at about

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.780 
if they don't produce a puppy at about
every<00:01:19.290> two<00:01:19.470> hours<00:01:19.530> out<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.310> half<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.580> two

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
every two hours out and a half to two

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.120 
every two hours out and a half to two
hours<00:01:20.870> then<00:01:21.870> I<00:01:21.990> probably<00:01:22.229> need<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.560> look<00:01:22.770> at<00:01:22.979> it

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
hours then I probably need to look at it

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.550 
hours then I probably need to look at it
and<00:01:23.400> at<00:01:23.580> least<00:01:23.820> do<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.180> vaginal<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.110> cervical

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
and at least do a vaginal and cervical

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.860 
and at least do a vaginal and cervical
exam<00:01:25.950> okay<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.490> make<00:01:26.760> sure<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.180> cervix<00:01:27.720> is

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
exam okay to make sure that cervix is

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.320 
exam okay to make sure that cervix is
staying<00:01:28.110> dilated<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.490> puppy<00:01:29.880> can<00:01:30.090> move

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
staying dilated and the puppy can move

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.399 
staying dilated and the puppy can move
through<00:01:30.690> it<00:01:30.840> okay

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
through it okay

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.280 
through it okay
sometimes<00:01:32.340> those<00:01:32.970> pets<00:01:33.360> will<00:01:33.630> respond<00:01:34.080> to<00:01:34.260> a

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
sometimes those pets will respond to a

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.680 
sometimes those pets will respond to a
medicine<00:01:34.590> called<00:01:34.890> oxytocin<00:01:35.310> oxytocin<00:01:36.299> when

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
medicine called oxytocin oxytocin when

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.260 
medicine called oxytocin oxytocin when
you<00:01:36.840> inject<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.440> it<00:01:38.250> will<00:01:38.490> cause<00:01:38.700> immediate

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
you inject it it will cause immediate

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.000 
you inject it it will cause immediate
contraction<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.110> uterus<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.740> if<00:01:40.860> the

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
contraction of the uterus and if the

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.789 
contraction of the uterus and if the
cervix<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.580> open<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.210> everything<00:01:42.960> seems<00:01:43.440> okay

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
cervix is open and everything seems okay

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.859 
cervix is open and everything seems okay
then<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:44.880> give<00:01:45.210> them<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.330> shout-out<00:01:45.570> to

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
then you can give them a shout-out to

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.660 
then you can give them a shout-out to
Tosun<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.439> they'll<00:01:46.560> produce<00:01:46.890> another<00:01:47.189> puppy

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
Tosun and they'll produce another puppy

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.880 
Tosun and they'll produce another puppy
so<00:01:48.180> there's<00:01:48.420> about<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.689> two-hour<00:01:49.170> window<00:01:49.409> where

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
so there's about a two-hour window where

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.670 
so there's about a two-hour window where
they<00:01:50.460> ought<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.670> produce<00:01:51.090> puppies

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
they ought to produce puppies

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.350 
they ought to produce puppies
consistently<00:01:52.680> okay<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.729> if<00:01:53.790> they<00:01:53.909> don't<00:01:54.090> you

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360

if they want to keep it for breeding if

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.640 
if they want to keep it for breeding if
not<00:02:37.680> most<00:02:38.220> time<00:02:38.430> will<00:02:38.640> spare<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:40.200> puppies

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
not most time will spare the puppies

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.440 
not most time will spare the puppies
come<00:02:40.920> out<00:02:41.130> they're<00:02:41.490> tired<00:02:41.790> they've<00:02:42.240> been

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450

come out they're tired they've been
under<00:02:42.690> anesthesia<00:02:43.200> most<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.950> them<00:02:44.100> recover

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
under anesthesia most of them recover

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.380 
under anesthesia most of them recover
then<00:02:45.209> we<00:02:45.360> put<00:02:45.600> them<00:02:45.720> on<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:47.070> bitch<00:02:47.390> for
