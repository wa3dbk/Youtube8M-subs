here's<00:00:01.860> a<00:00:01.979> simple<00:00:02.520> stairway<00:00:03.000> I<00:00:03.030> think

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.130 
here's a simple stairway I think

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.419 
here's a simple stairway I think
practically<00:00:05.130> anyone<00:00:05.790> can<00:00:06.450> build<00:00:07.140> it<00:00:07.529> is<00:00:08.370> a

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
practically anyone can build it is a

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.780 
practically anyone can build it is a
string<00:00:08.820> or<00:00:08.970> list<00:00:09.150> stairway<00:00:09.620> two<00:00:10.620> by<00:00:10.800> fours<00:00:11.190> two

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
string or list stairway two by fours two

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.980 
string or list stairway two by fours two
by<00:00:12.000> eight<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.990> build<00:00:13.230> out<00:00:13.349> two<00:00:13.590> by<00:00:13.740> sixes<00:00:14.309> and

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
by eight and build out two by sixes and

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.380 
by eight and build out two by sixes and
two<00:00:15.990> by<00:00:16.139> twelves<00:00:16.560> for<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.070> treads<00:00:17.580> it's<00:00:18.240> about

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
two by twelves for the treads it's about

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.929 
two by twelves for the treads it's about
three<00:00:18.690> foot<00:00:18.930> wide<00:00:19.400> seven<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.550> half<00:00:20.580> inch

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
three foot wide seven and a half inch

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.420 
three foot wide seven and a half inch
riser<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.750> course<00:00:21.960> might<00:00:22.769> not<00:00:22.980> work<00:00:23.189> for

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
riser and of course might not work for

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.279 
riser and of course might not work for
every<00:00:23.670> situation<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.869> course<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.170> can

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
every situation but of course you can

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.670 
every situation but of course you can
always<00:00:25.410> adjust<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:26.510> height<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.080> risers

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
always adjust the height of the risers

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.740 
always adjust the height of the risers
now<00:00:29.010> if<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.220> need<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.580> stabilize<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.599> can

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
now if you need to stabilize it you can

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.650 
now if you need to stabilize it you can
always<00:00:30.960> add<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.470> 2x4<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.460> back<00:00:32.669> something

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
always add a 2x4 to the back something

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.650 
always add a 2x4 to the back something
like<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:33.930> would<00:00:34.170> provide<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.559> lot<00:00:34.860> more

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
like this would provide a lot more

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.330 
like this would provide a lot more
stabilization<00:00:36.660> put<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.260> piece<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.469> plywood<00:00:37.770> on

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
stabilization put a piece of plywood on

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.979 
stabilization put a piece of plywood on
it<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.969> know<00:00:39.059> it's<00:00:39.090> going<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.420> make<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.930> a

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
it you know it's going to make it a

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.170 
it you know it's going to make it a
little<00:00:40.110> sturdier<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.730> can<00:00:41.850> always<00:00:41.940> put

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
little sturdier and you can always put

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.600 
little sturdier and you can always put
plywood<00:00:42.570> on<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.719> side<00:00:43.170> if<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.040> don't<00:00:44.309> like

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
plywood on the side if you don't like

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.880 
plywood on the side if you don't like
this<00:00:44.879> particular<00:00:45.329> look<00:00:45.870> though<00:00:46.230> where<00:00:46.590> the

this particular look though where the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.450 
this particular look though where the
plywood<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:48.230> sticking<00:00:49.230> up<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:50.160> might<00:00:50.430> not

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
plywood is sticking up this might not

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.020 
plywood is sticking up this might not
look<00:00:50.670> as<00:00:51.329> nice<00:00:52.489> you<00:00:53.489> know<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.820> plywood

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
look as nice you know with the plywood

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.990 
look as nice you know with the plywood
sticking<00:00:54.690> up<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.989> can<00:00:55.110> always<00:00:55.520> lower<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.789> and

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
sticking up you can always lower it and

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.170 
sticking up you can always lower it and
move<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.199> wall<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.399> other<00:00:59.550> words<00:00:59.789> let<00:01:00.030> the

move the wall in in other words let the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.150 
move the wall in in other words let the
treads<00:01:00.539> overhang<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.590> treads<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.039> risers

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
treads overhang the treads and risers

here actually has a one-inch nosing on

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.520 
here actually has a one-inch nosing on
it<00:01:12.659> will<00:01:13.170> be<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> little<00:01:13.650> smaller<00:01:14.780> with<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:16.170> ten

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
it will be a little smaller with a ten

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.100 
it will be a little smaller with a ten
and<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.740> half<00:01:16.920> inch<00:01:17.509> tread<00:01:18.509> width<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.990> other

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.270 
and a half inch tread width the other
one<00:01:19.290> would<00:01:19.439> have<00:01:19.530> had<00:01:19.680> an<00:01:19.770> eleven<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.250> half

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
one would have had an eleven and a half

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.450 
one would have had an eleven and a half
inch<00:01:20.610> tread<00:01:20.880> width<00:01:21.229> with<00:01:22.229> out<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.979> nosing

inch tread width with out and nosing
this<00:01:23.610> one<00:01:23.759> here<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:23.970> going<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.119> have<00:01:24.210> an<00:01:24.330> eleven

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
this one here is going to have an eleven

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.260 
this one here is going to have an eleven
and<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.810> half<00:01:24.869> inch<00:01:25.170> tread<00:01:25.500> size<00:01:25.770> but<00:01:26.640> basically

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
and a half inch tread size but basically

and a half inch tread size but basically
have<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> ten<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.020> half<00:01:28.170> inch<00:01:28.470> tread<00:01:29.280> run<00:01:29.810> now

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
have a ten and a half inch tread run now

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.219 
have a ten and a half inch tread run now
here's<00:01:32.040> an<00:01:32.310> example<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:33.060> what<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.659> would<00:01:33.960> look

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
here's an example of what it would look

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.840 
here's an example of what it would look
like<00:01:34.909> if<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.420> left<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.380> original<00:01:38.130> frame<00:01:38.520> or

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
like if you left the original frame or

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.850 
like if you left the original frame or
the<00:01:38.880> frame<00:01:39.240> from<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.689> very<00:01:40.170> beginning<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.829> just

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
the frame from the very beginning I just

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.440 
the frame from the very beginning I just
want<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.280> give<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.460> an<00:01:41.549> idea<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.850> will<00:01:42.270> need

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
want to give you an idea you will need

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.969 
want to give you an idea you will need
to<00:01:42.570> modify<00:01:43.189> the<00:01:44.299> frames<00:01:45.299> there<00:01:45.869> if<00:01:46.590> you're

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
to modify the frames there if you're

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.510 
to modify the frames there if you're
going<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.549> use<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.210> particular<00:01:48.570> design<00:01:49.520> last

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
going to use this particular design last

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.940 
going to use this particular design last
but<00:01:50.820> not<00:01:50.939> least<00:01:51.450> if<00:01:52.049> you're<00:01:52.170> going<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.439> use<00:01:52.680> a

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
but not least if you're going to use a

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.300 
but not least if you're going to use a
going<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.490> make<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.640> stairway<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.119> little<00:01:54.390> wider

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
going to make a stairway a little wider

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.620 
going to make a stairway a little wider
let's<00:01:56.310> just<00:01:56.460> say<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.610> six-foot<00:01:57.119> stairway<00:01:57.570> you

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
let's just say a six-foot stairway you

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.060 
let's just say a six-foot stairway you
could<00:01:57.840> always<00:01:57.960> do<00:01:58.200> something<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:58.770> this

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
could always do something like this

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.179 
could always do something like this
instead<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.939> using<00:02:00.149> two<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:01.140> would<00:02:01.259> use<00:02:01.829> three

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
instead of using two you would use three

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.030
