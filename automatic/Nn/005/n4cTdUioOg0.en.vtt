00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello and welcome to another 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:07.190
 video today I introduce you to toni 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.190
 kross respect 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.200
 we are here again on this 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.090
 texture pack review march around before we 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.470
 go in and look at the blocks 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.480
 Let's have a look at some basics again 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.490
 things anja how they manage the snow 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.079
 hunger and take display and so on 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.980
 and so on 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.070
 I'll come back for the snow 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.180
 a detour made in the snow bio and 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.739
 Did you take a few screenshots? 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.680
 that looks pretty nice 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:39.270
 how she puts it out with the rain 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.930
 I have a brief weather and then 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.519
 Do you see what that looks like ? 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.640
 from experience to hunger display the 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:51.269
 cdu yes below is a whole 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.949
 nice layout but a bit 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.659
 unimaginative then already became in the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.940
 the end effect that would be we look 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:00.329
 So go to the traffic user interface 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.420
 I get up and that looks like that 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.300
 they turn out very well so like 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.810
 me personally very well and it has stopped 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.479
 as I said this yes it is only one 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.100
 medieval texture pack and such 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.490
 it's really happening everywhere, too 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.490
 really really good 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.810
 I think you already have a font 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.670
 seen 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.250
 I have a few things already 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.250
 Typed in that's the normal one 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.200
 So no special font from the font 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.200
 The texture pack comes from therefore is there 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.299
 give it too much to say 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.909
 otherwise see the moon and now 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.840
 also the sun 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.490
 and I also have a few pictures 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.409
 made like the whole looks in 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.140
 our city in uk city ​​i have one 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.579
 few pictures made of buildings like that 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.530
 Luxury villa with us also that that 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.329
 holiday home of bet holidays and the see 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.439
 you like this texture pack on 7 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.759
 they start working together with buildings 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.049
 Just come in and have a look 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.549
 blocks and that should actually 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.690
 I'm going a bit faster today 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.770
 wants it too long since 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.370
 stop and you celebrate again 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.900
 went out 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.400
 that happens to me every goddamn time 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.090
 do we have tools do you have 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.470
 sure what the menu looks like now 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.850
 The lighter is here now 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.190
 very bad to recognize because so 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:24.320
 bright is meier looks so come from there 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.210
 a few such a few soot particles the 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.160
 look very cool i like it a lot 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.590
 good are as similar as the sun 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.230
 so it's his trademark of 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.900
 the texture pack the lava is also very 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.030
 we already have special and water 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.480
 So seen a bit of the rain in 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.280
 bright hue and that's all too 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.920
 cool in here now yeah so you guys 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.210
 see if the water is there so this 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.720
 also quite cool from even in 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.030
 connection with the shape of building materials 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.750
 yes, here with a bit oh god there 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.250
 I know that too 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.680
 that would have wanted to be his house 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.720
 is wanted but it is already very difficult 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.720
 to recognize now here in the first moment 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.240
 That's the wool 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.520
 otherwise we have here now 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.630
 Building materials one recognizes there actually 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.940
 so everything right away 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.690
 so there is not such a clear one now 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.570
 The glass looks like this is one 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.709
 a little bit over it 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.450
 and that's actually pretty cool 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.040
 if you form together then 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.570
 Can you do it the way you are 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.920
 in bad you have and you want that there no one 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.510
 purely looks which of course absolute 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.110
 nonsens in minecraft you can do that 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.260
 here in this text shop tail quite well 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.670
 censor 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.189
 that no one can look purely new 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.629
 otherwise they are the windows 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:38.430
 stairs okay okay 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.140
 I have such a small garden here 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.390
 that they plant you like that 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:47.159
 look at this in this department 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:50.340
 spec and even here the bushes the 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:52.470
 now fitting for this are on the other 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.879
 side we have such a few items as 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.230
 the whole thing looks like when you put that in 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.750
 the hand has or if it is up 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.810
 I'm in the bottom of the floor 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.650
 shelf built by the ipo forces so 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.980
 I use this on otherwise it is 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.190
 a ladder the crafting table is what 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.889
 that's an oven and a chest this 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.949
 looks very special now you have to 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:21.900
 already say 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:23.430
 haha carpet and heads too 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.620
 yes surprised me very positive 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.120
 So he has a possible stuff 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.260
 reingemacht or I do not know who 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.150
 that probably made an army 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:38.430
 These are all new pictures so there 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:40.289
 There is nothing old with it and very much 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.830
 very cool so for everyone 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:44.400
 something here 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.650
 you can have curtains madrigale hat 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.830
 actually everything only so you can 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.550
 since his apartment was good 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.860
 represent 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.430
 a little bit so refine all the way 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:59.160
 just aha we go on John's 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.380
 plane we say with tnt block of flats 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:08.910
 ideally the gps of normal slopes 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:10.830
 it could be dispensers and the 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:15.570
 printing plates and so on and so forth 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:17.490
 the non- sensory blog that is 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.510
 actually everything clearly yes now 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.780
 Let's see what that looks like 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.430
 that's the way it is there 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.060
 soot particles i dont know how to do that 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.130
 should call 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.860
 and these are also these chattering there so 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:32.930
 also made pretty cool so you see 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.930
 Now here are all the cards and the rails 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:40.150
 different let the different 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:43.090
 I like the backes very much 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:49.090
 and the eggs are different, it also 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:52.750
 not big reason that here is the 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.160
 food pretty much see the net too 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.250
 Fish out of here you can go now 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.050
 just start living here 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.630
 weapons and tools so i hope that 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.070
 It's not too fast, but so much too 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.330
 say you can hold the picture yes 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.280
 look at everything and then 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.230
 So that works, I want it 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:12.760
 make something shorter than last 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:13.870
 twice yes these are the weapons and on 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.610
 otherwise we have a few here 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.170
 items that are so little interesting now 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.060
 the books now all look the same 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.850
 here 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.800
 we we have the compost as 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.940
 So it does not work here 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.610
 Last two times that I always with 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:33.400
 he still moves with me 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:35.230
 okay and the clock a scissors and down 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.150
 So it's really great 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.200
 I also find the armor that 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.090
 I like it very much 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.970
 Unfortunately, simon is pretty bad 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.770
 maybe I'll just put one on 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.270
 so you can see the a little bit the 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.910
 actually the diamond would have to be here 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:56.200
 armor so let's take it 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:56.920
 out and put the times and then sees 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.200
 that's how it looks 

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:05.449
 okay well we keep going all around 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:08.419
 magic potions yes that looks like this 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:11.650
 nothing special so brilliant are last 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:15.469
 Fach materials and they look that way 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:16.370
 gips not so much to say so 

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:19.759
 I like it very much 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:21.860
 so that's it from me very 

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:23.569
 very nice rosberg otherwise i would 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.069
 that does not show me here 

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:27.080
 for watching I hope that this time 

00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:29.029
 something was more pleasant because it was something 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.319
 went faster just write in the 

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:32.300
 comments what you think about it 

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:33.650
 if you want to see more what you see 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.659
 I want to have it now, too 

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:39.110
 this one also has a few candidates 

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:42.289
 who have even made spex and 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:43.819
 who sent such a link under me but 

00:07:42.289 --> 00:07:45.529
 I do not want to download anything from 

00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:47.449
 I do not know what it looks like yes there 

00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:50.539
 I'm just too lazy for that though 

00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:52.969
 her a resort pack creates yes and her 

00:07:50.539 --> 00:07:54.199
 I want you to show that then you can 

00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:55.909
 for example , that can go on 

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:58.370
 planet minecraft imagine it 

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:59.870
 others can download too 

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.099
 and then you can give us the link of it 

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.300
 send and recognize us that there 

00:08:01.099 --> 00:08:04.039
 look at it and then decide 

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.629
 there you will want to show here or net 

00:08:04.039 --> 00:08:07.909
 yes that is so 

00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:10.550
 Now I have the suggestion to you 

00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:11.930
 have something from me thank you for that 

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:14.379
 watch and say goodbye to one 

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.379
 another video
