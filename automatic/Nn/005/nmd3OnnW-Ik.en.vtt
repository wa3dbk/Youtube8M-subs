00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.770 
actually a 90 gallon tank easement tank
and<00:01:45.189> the<00:01:45.430> pump<00:01:45.640> is<00:01:45.729> actually<00:01:45.909> running<00:01:46.270> at<00:01:46.450> 40%

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
and the pump is actually running at 40%

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.980 
and the pump is actually running at 40%
yeah<00:01:47.500> so<00:01:47.939> we<00:01:48.939> tried<00:01:49.180> to<00:01:49.210> cranking<00:01:49.689> it<00:01:49.750> up<00:01:49.810> at

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
yeah so we tried to cranking it up at

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.960 
yeah so we tried to cranking it up at
50%<00:01:50.409> in<00:01:50.710> above<00:01:50.950> it<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.250> actually<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.729> water

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
50% in above it and actually the water

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.999 
50% in above it and actually the water
was<00:01:52.229> overflowing<00:01:53.229> through<00:01:53.470> the<00:01:53.590> other<00:01:53.710> side

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
was overflowing through the other side

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.740 
was overflowing through the other side
so<00:01:54.640> we<00:01:54.759> actually<00:01:54.880> had<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.180> keep<00:01:55.329> the<00:01:55.450> pump<00:01:55.630> at

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
so we actually had to keep the pump at

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.870 
so we actually had to keep the pump at
40%<00:01:55.990> now<00:01:56.740> I<00:01:56.770> hear<00:01:57.159> that<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.400> pump<00:01:57.640> is<00:01:57.700> actually

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
40% now I hear that the pump is actually

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.740 
40% now I hear that the pump is actually
come<00:01:58.180> in<00:01:58.270> with<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.450> basic<00:01:58.780> controller<00:01:59.110> yeah

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
come in with the basic controller yeah

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.539 
come in with the basic controller yeah
well<00:02:01.750> as<00:02:01.930> you<00:02:02.049> can<00:02:02.170> see<00:02:02.409> right<00:02:02.619> now<00:02:02.799> the<00:02:03.250> pumps

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
well as you can see right now the pumps

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.060 
well as you can see right now the pumps
actually<00:02:03.939> running<00:02:04.149> on<00:02:04.360> pulsing<00:02:05.110> mode<00:02:05.290> so<00:02:05.770> if

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
actually running on pulsing mode so if

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.469 
actually running on pulsing mode so if
you<00:02:06.159> can<00:02:06.280> see<00:02:06.549> the<00:02:06.729> surface<00:02:06.909> over<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.270> water

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
you can see the surface over the water

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.889 
you can see the surface over the water
you<00:02:07.659> can<00:02:07.810> see<00:02:07.840> it's<00:02:08.110> pausing<00:02:09.360> one<00:02:10.360> after<00:02:10.780> the

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
you can see it's pausing one after the

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.429 
you can see it's pausing one after the
other<00:02:10.929> and<00:02:11.639> then<00:02:12.639> we<00:02:12.819> can<00:02:12.999> actually<00:02:13.180> in<00:02:14.139> the

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:14.439 
other and then we can actually in the

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:15.420 
other and then we can actually in the
basic<00:02:14.769> controller<00:02:15.129> we

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
basic controller we

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.520 
basic controller we
and<00:02:15.549> set<00:02:15.909> up<00:02:16.030> different<00:02:16.569> variables<00:02:16.989> for

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
and set up different variables for

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.509 
and set up different variables for
example<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:18.430> length<00:02:18.700> between<00:02:19.060> each<00:02:19.659> powers

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
example the length between each powers

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.630 
example the length between each powers
and<00:02:21.519> also<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:22.030> time<00:02:22.989> of<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.769> maximum<00:02:24.370> flow

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
and also the time of the maximum flow

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.369 
and also the time of the maximum flow
for<00:02:24.969> each<00:02:25.090> power<00:02:25.359> sold<00:02:25.659> again<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:25.989> can<00:02:26.140> create

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
for each power sold again you can create

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.559 
for each power sold again you can create
a<00:02:26.620> long<00:02:27.040> powers<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:27.670> then<00:02:27.760> short<00:02:27.969> pause<00:02:28.209> and

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
a long powers and then short pause and

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.839 
a long powers and then short pause and
at<00:02:29.170> alarm<00:02:29.469> power<00:02:29.680> or<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.400> can<00:02:30.519> do<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.670> short

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
at alarm power or you can do a short

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.979 
at alarm power or you can do a short
house<00:02:31.090> long<00:02:31.420> forms<00:02:32.010> etcetera<00:02:33.010> so<00:02:33.750> it's<00:02:34.750> quite

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
house long forms etcetera so it's quite

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.709 
house long forms etcetera so it's quite
it's<00:02:35.650> quite<00:02:35.739> easy<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.549> configure<00:02:36.969> with<00:02:37.510> that

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:37.719 
it's quite easy to configure with that

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.780 
it's quite easy to configure with that
basic<00:02:38.019> controller<00:02:38.409> okay<00:02:38.980> what<00:02:39.459> about<00:02:39.549> the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
basic controller okay what about the

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.699 
basic controller okay what about the
glass<00:02:39.969> I<00:02:40.299> see<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.569> magnet<00:02:40.930> how<00:02:41.109> thick<00:02:41.409> in<00:02:41.560> that

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
glass I see the magnet how thick in that

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.099 
glass I see the magnet how thick in that
glass<00:02:41.889> how<00:02:42.430> thick<00:02:43.000> with<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.269> magnet<00:02:43.599> yeah<00:02:43.900> but

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
glass how thick with the magnet yeah but

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.199 
glass how thick with the magnet yeah but
that's<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.409> standard<00:02:45.250> mount<00:02:45.549> can<00:02:45.819> be<00:02:46.030> mounted

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
that's the standard mount can be mounted

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.030 
that's the standard mount can be mounted
on<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.540> three-quarter<00:02:47.079> inch<00:02:47.109> class<00:02:47.439> but<00:02:48.010> for

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
on a three-quarter inch class but for

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.589 
on a three-quarter inch class but for
the<00:02:48.310> larger<00:02:48.579> tank<00:02:48.819> that<00:02:49.090> will<00:02:49.299> have<00:02:49.569> a

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
the larger tank that will have a

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.569 
the larger tank that will have a
separate<00:02:49.959> kit<00:02:50.169> that<00:02:50.379> can<00:02:50.500> go<00:02:50.709> as<00:02:50.919> thick<00:02:51.340> as<00:02:51.549> a

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
separate kit that can go as thick as a

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.909 
separate kit that can go as thick as a
inch<00:02:52.239> and<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.540> quarter<00:02:52.689> well<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:53.769> also

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:53.919 
inch and a quarter well and also

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:56.580 
inch and a quarter well and also
everybody<00:02:54.430> think<00:02:55.060> about<00:02:55.269> this<00:02:55.470> for<00:02:56.470> those

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
everybody think about this for those

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.589 
everybody think about this for those
people<00:02:56.859> that<00:02:56.950> have<00:02:57.099> the<00:02:57.280> larger<00:02:57.669> tanks<00:02:58.060> with

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
people that have the larger tanks with

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.349 
people that have the larger tanks with
thicker<00:02:59.169> glasses<00:02:59.500> the<00:03:00.129> magnet<00:03:00.579> is<00:03:00.849> actually

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
thicker glasses the magnet is actually

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.059 
thicker glasses the magnet is actually
waterproof<00:03:01.689> so<00:03:02.260> you<00:03:02.290> can<00:03:02.409> actually<00:03:02.680> put<00:03:03.040> that

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
waterproof so you can actually put that

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.009 
waterproof so you can actually put that
magnet<00:03:03.609> in<00:03:03.819> the<00:03:04.060> overflow<00:03:04.359> if<00:03:04.750> you<00:03:04.840> have<00:03:04.989> a

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
magnet in the overflow if you have a

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.740 
magnet in the overflow if you have a
tank<00:03:05.260> where<00:03:05.530> it's<00:03:05.680> more<00:03:06.129> than<00:03:06.280> an<00:03:06.400> inch<00:03:06.599> and<00:03:07.599> it

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
tank where it's more than an inch and it

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.149 
tank where it's more than an inch and it
works<00:03:07.959> just<00:03:08.079> as<00:03:08.260> well<00:03:08.290> for<00:03:08.680> that<00:03:08.859> Peninsula

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159 
works just as well for that Peninsula

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:12.000 
works just as well for that Peninsula
