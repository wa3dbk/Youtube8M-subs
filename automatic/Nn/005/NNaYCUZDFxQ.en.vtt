00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.569
 I am very happy for this agreement to which 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:06.310
 we got all the leaders first 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:07.419
 What I want to say is that here there was not 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.210
 victors or losers 

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:12.730
 it seems to me here here there was not a dispute 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.930
 of two political fractions but here 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.029
 there was a regulatory interpretation 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.200
 what was he going to talk about and 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.700
 I thank the entire Argentine leadership 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.590
 in my name and of all the leaders 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.180
 I think we're happy with that 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.670
 unanimously voted for the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.860
 subject of regulatory interpretation 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.600
 and that I thought it was a decision 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.340
 be more than anything political because there 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.350
 two ways of thinking and it's good that 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.300
 Argentine soccer has the opportunity 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.510
 to agree on this starting 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.950
 there have reached an agreement because 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.190
 I think we have to be worked to 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.620
 Afa, this is not something that can be 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.260
 wait until the first of March and already 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.270
 that there are several leaders interested in 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.470
 participate and work in the 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.990
 Argentine soccer association is 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.760
 good that today we can all work 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.050
 together today is the first meeting that 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.360
 will surely have this afternoon with the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.550
 president of the afa with the insecure and 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.339
 let's go to work and let's see how we 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.280
 we agree to work 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.750
 we want to know how 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.300
 is the association of Argentine football 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.520
 we have some ideas also hopefully 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.970
 can you agree that they are 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.220
 of pleasure also for louis and for 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.320
 of course we want to have 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.060
 clarity and transparency throughout 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.200
 and I think that's the goal and 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.940
 also what we have talked with 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.200
 some leaders I also spoke with a 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.450
 lots of people I think today 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.900
 we have to look for the best in everything 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.310
 and all Argentines in the world 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.450
 most important have to be for 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.830
 this change and this total unification of 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.840
 Argentine football so it's with 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.030
 sebastián verón the little witch is a 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.830
 very important person for everything 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.410
 comes in the Argentine soccer of the place 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.690
 that is will surely talk with what 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.450
 insecure with other leaders too 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.310
 here surely louis and should be the idea 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.869
 that must also coincide with the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.190
 our put together a great work team 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.290
 to work together 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.090
 in the goal that everything is better by 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.410
 course the word audit because 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.780
 for some it sounds strong but we have 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.570
 to clearly see the numbers of afa 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.220
 because to be talking and generation of 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.550
 income of new generation of income 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.170
 of new sponsor resources when 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.200
 we are not very clear about the panorama where 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.900
 goes the money and everything 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.430
 I think that that is is good 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.050
 to clarify this has nothing to 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.180
 see with the excellent work that they are 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.920
 making the veedores that put the 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.050
 doctor servini de cubria that I know that 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.910
 they are doing a very good job 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.560
 that that has to do with money from 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.930
 soccer for everyone here what we are 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.610
 speaking is to see clearly because there 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.590
 to do an internal audit also 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.060
 inside the pfa to see what are the 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.010
 numbers really what is the money from 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.709
 here until the end of the year how is the box 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.460
 it's something totally logical we understood the 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.400
 leaders who 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.640
 which is better out there in the future 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.040
 negotiation of an important contract 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.870
 like the one we have here until 2019 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.840
 with football for all to negotiate with the 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.600
 next government so we understood that 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.030
 out there working all together from 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.380
 now we could get more armed to a 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.820
 future negotiation with the new government 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.500
 of what the soccer contract will be 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.390
 for all that is 75 percent 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.290
 the income that the association has today 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.629
 of Argentine soccer 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.879
 it seems illogical to postpone it to the extent 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.230
 that we do not all work together because the 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.120
 election was set for October 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.340
 Argentina could have sponsor the 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.900
 international sponsor all sponsor 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.879
 international 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.220
 there may be local sponsors too but 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.140
 the vast majority would have to be sponsors 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.300
 international that seem to be a resource 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.310
 of money 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.580
 and there I think marketing campaigns 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.230
 to do this I've read sprays that 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.970
 surely in the work plan that 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.520
 we give you leaders and that 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.030
 after run inside press well 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.820
 appears the subject mark s hears of being 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.370
 close I have no doubt of who I am 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.860
 best player in the world and to which 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.510
 we can work with him I would like 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.000
 that each category I have a sponsor 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.260
 different from each category of football 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.980
 Argentine of the federal tournaments 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.080
 federal tournament national bird of first b 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.520
 first c first d 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.780
 it's good that they have a sponsor for him 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.549
 seems to apply a lot of work from the 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.560
 lighting managers of those tournaments 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.720
 I wish and it would be very good for football 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.580
 argentino that we can get to a list 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.250
 of unity but more than that is a subject 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.590
 politician for me for me that's why I say me 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.030
 it seems here we have to work and see 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.980
 clearly which one we hope we can 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.840
 agree on the project because 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.110
 if there is no project in common it is very 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.340
 difficult to arm an agreement here the project 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.080
 in common the other day that's why it was the 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.600
 consensus is because there was unanimity in 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.400
 a 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.190
 in a regulatory interpretation and 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.200
 there is consensus there then it seems to me that 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.880
 you have to believe in a project that is 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.100
 common this thing from political offices 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.980
 and from there we all go a list 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.650
 unity because politically I'm not 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.270
 according to that I am always a 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.550
 person who want unity by 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.560
 Of course I would like to have a 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.700
 Absolutely transparent institution 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:11.120
 clear and healthy with better income with 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.010
 control of expenses with iron work 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.800
 of all the leaders it's not good to see 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:18.890
 a game the other day I saw arsenal-mouth and 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.630
 I looked at the rostrum to the full side of the 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.060
 another completely empty side was to throw 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.340
 a mouth corner and I felt depression 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.310
 training at a time and I was not 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.410
 well let's get to 2019 with I think 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.490
 with 22 teams now with this with this 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.220
 that has been tested now because we arrived 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.160
 with 24 but obviously the 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.170
 format of 30 is a format that by 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.060
 Of course you are going to need more 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.440
 income that's not clear because there's 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.910
 clubs that still see with the income 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.770
 previous to having ascended 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.840
 there is also a big claim from the 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.700
 clubs that rose with respect to 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.930
 that were very badly positioned and more 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.060
 they are going to continue in the first division 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.650
 because one thing is to play at first is 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.180
 divine because for some but there are 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.680
 that keep the club and I that the 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.570
 leaders as they suffer also for 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.290
 then come to the end of the month and pay the 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.290
 contracts that have
