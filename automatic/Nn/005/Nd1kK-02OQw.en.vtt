first<00:00:21.570> let's<00:00:21.960> look<00:00:22.050> at<00:00:22.350> what<00:00:22.500> we<00:00:22.590> consider<00:00:22.949> to

first let's look at what we consider to

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.529 
be a normal October jet stream pattern
over<00:00:25.500> Alaska<00:00:26.010> you'll<00:00:26.670> recall<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.330> jet

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
over Alaska you'll recall that the jet

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.480 
over Alaska you'll recall that the jet
stream<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.140> fast-moving<00:00:28.590> river<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.279> air
