00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:02.920 

I<00:01:57.160> see<00:01:58.160> the<00:01:58.280> brains<00:01:58.580> of<00:01:58.760> the<00:02:01.660> try<00:02:02.660> from<00:02:02.810> a

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
I see the brains of the try from a

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.930 
I see the brains of the try from a
different<00:02:03.200> angle<00:02:03.320> just<00:02:04.190> I<00:02:04.460> don't<00:02:04.610> know<00:02:04.790> if

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
different angle just I don't know if

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.670 
different angle just I don't know if
it's<00:02:05.060> going<00:02:05.210> to<00:02:05.270> help<00:02:05.420> start<00:02:06.350> from<00:02:06.530> the

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
it's going to help start from the

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:26.740 
it's going to help start from the
outside<00:02:07.000> work<00:02:08.000> your<00:02:08.150> way<00:02:08.300> in<00:02:08.560> Piper<00:02:09.560> swell<00:02:25.750> if
