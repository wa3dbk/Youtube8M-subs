go ahead to look at the back side of the

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.430 
go ahead to look at the back side of the
pant<00:01:36.420> very<00:01:37.420> similar<00:01:37.780> design<00:01:38.020> to<00:01:38.050> the<00:01:38.200> front

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
pant very similar design to the front

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.170 
pant very similar design to the front
you<00:01:38.830> can<00:01:38.860> see<00:01:39.010> that<00:01:39.220> gusset<00:01:39.790> which<00:01:40.000> is<00:01:40.150> a

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
you can see that gusset which is a

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.670 
you can see that gusset which is a
stretch<00:01:40.540> material<00:01:40.840> running<00:01:41.200> from<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.500> back

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
stretch material running from the back

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.160 
stretch material running from the back
lower<00:01:42.430> back<00:01:42.520> yard<00:01:43.150> all<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.750> way<00:01:43.840> down<00:01:43.990> to<00:01:44.110> the

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
lower back yard all the way down to the

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.020 
lower back yard all the way down to the
front<00:01:44.350> closure<00:01:44.680> this<00:01:45.010> will<00:01:45.159> offer<00:01:45.280> some<00:01:45.430> great

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
front closure this will offer some great

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.210 
front closure this will offer some great
mobility<00:01:46.360> you<00:01:47.230> have<00:01:47.380> this<00:01:47.650> material<00:01:48.100> right

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
mobility you have this material right

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.010 
mobility you have this material right
here<00:01:48.250> which<00:01:49.030> offers<00:01:49.420> a<00:01:49.450> little<00:01:49.659> bit<00:01:49.840> more

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
here which offers a little bit more

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.780 
here which offers a little bit more
increased<00:01:50.500> ventilation<00:01:50.890> it's<00:01:51.250> not<00:01:51.400> quite<00:01:51.670> as

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
increased ventilation it's not quite as

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.760 
increased ventilation it's not quite as
dense<00:01:52.060> as<00:01:52.240> what<00:01:52.420> you<00:01:52.510> saw<00:01:52.630> on<00:01:52.690> the<00:01:52.780> front<00:01:53.080> but

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
dense as what you saw on the front but

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.290 
dense as what you saw on the front but
typically<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.340> materials<00:01:54.760> back<00:01:54.909> here<00:01:55.090> don't

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
typically the materials back here don't

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.820 
typically the materials back here don't
get<00:01:55.510> as<00:01:55.690> much<00:01:55.960> where<00:01:56.260> so<00:01:56.470> you<00:01:56.560> can<00:01:56.710> actually

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
get as much where so you can actually

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.680 
get as much where so you can actually
sacrifice<00:01:57.550> a<00:01:57.580> little<00:01:57.790> bit<00:01:58.000> and<00:01:58.090> increase<00:01:58.479> the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
sacrifice a little bit and increase the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.330 
sacrifice a little bit and increase the
comfort<00:01:58.930> and<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.290> ventilation<00:02:00.010> of<00:02:00.070> the<00:02:00.159> pad

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
comfort and the ventilation of the pad

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.690 
comfort and the ventilation of the pad
here<00:02:00.840> moving<00:02:01.840> on<00:02:02.020> down<00:02:02.350> you<00:02:03.100> can<00:02:03.220> see<00:02:03.250> here

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
here moving on down you can see here

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.010 
here moving on down you can see here
that<00:02:03.729> they<00:02:03.909> are<00:02:04.030> still<00:02:04.300> using<00:02:04.600> that<00:02:04.810> nice

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
that they are still using that nice

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.719 
that they are still using that nice
thick<00:02:05.409> stretch<00:02:05.770> material<00:02:06.070> here<00:02:06.430> so<00:02:06.610> it's

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
thick stretch material here so it's

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.100 
thick stretch material here so it's
actually<00:02:06.850> one<00:02:07.120> of<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.270> larger<00:02:07.659> ones<00:02:07.840> it's

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
actually one of the larger ones it's

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.440 
actually one of the larger ones it's
that<00:02:08.679> this<00:02:09.039> whole<00:02:09.310> area<00:02:09.729> right<00:02:09.879> here<00:02:09.939> is<00:02:10.239> all<00:02:10.420> a

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
that this whole area right here is all a

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.119 
that this whole area right here is all a
stretch<00:02:10.929> material<00:02:11.200> so<00:02:11.439> it's<00:02:11.560> an<00:02:11.620> offer<00:02:11.769> some

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
stretch material so it's an offer some

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.099 
stretch material so it's an offer some
great<00:02:12.370> mobility<00:02:12.670> not<00:02:13.359> going<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.599> catch<00:02:13.840> up<00:02:14.019> on

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:14.109 
great mobility not going to catch up on

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:14.850 
great mobility not going to catch up on
the<00:02:14.230> legs<00:02:14.409> too<00:02:14.650> much

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
the legs too much

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.070 
the legs too much
and<00:02:15.070> then<00:02:15.430> also<00:02:15.610> if<00:02:15.850> we<00:02:15.970> turn<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.300> over<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:16.960> can

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
and then also if we turn it over you can

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.570 
and then also if we turn it over you can
see<00:02:17.260> here<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.530> does<00:02:17.710> have<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.040> zipper<00:02:18.250> and

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580

kind of clean look there I'm going up
back<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.320> lower<00:02:32.650> back<00:02:32.920> portion<00:02:33.430> here<00:02:33.640> I'm

back to the lower back portion here I'm
you<00:02:34.210> can<00:02:34.360> see<00:02:34.510> here<00:02:34.690> they're<00:02:34.930> using<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.230> great

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
you can see here they're using a great

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.490 
you can see here they're using a great
level<00:02:36.220> protection<00:02:36.630> it's<00:02:37.630> not<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:38.020> hex<00:02:38.260> orb

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
level protection it's not the hex orb

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.900 
level protection it's not the hex orb
that<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:38.680> saw<00:02:38.800> on<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:38.950> 180<00:02:39.340> pad<00:02:39.580> but<00:02:39.760> it's<00:02:39.880> a

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
that you saw on the 180 pad but it's a

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.490 
that you saw on the 180 pad but it's a
similar<00:02:40.300> type<00:02:40.480> material<00:02:41.020> so<00:02:41.200> it's<00:02:41.320> basically

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
similar type material so it's basically

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.650 
similar type material so it's basically
a<00:02:41.709> VN<00:02:42.040> foam<00:02:42.430> that's<00:02:43.000> going<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.240> offer<00:02:43.330> some

a VN foam that's going to offer some

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.840 
a VN foam that's going to offer some
great<00:02:43.870> protection<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.530> lower<00:02:44.680> spine<00:02:44.890> now
