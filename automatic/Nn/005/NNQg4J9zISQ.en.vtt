00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.290
 hi girls, how can we talk about a 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.970
 product that I'm using that I've 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.460
 proven that it has convinced me and to which 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.189
 you can also get different uses 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.620
 is this softener in crystallites of the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.379
 mark of ernest that many will know 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.600
 because several years ago used to 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.309
 made to me it was recommended to me by a company 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.920
 of work that is called shoes and also 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.519
 visited and spoke to me really well because I 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.780
 He said that the smell of fabric softener 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.050
 was trained in clothes and that 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.880
 made it long I did not go 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.250
 spending time was using others 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.460
 professionals I have seen a clear offer 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.860
 and I bought it I have to tell you that 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.500
 yes it is true that the text remains 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.960
 in clothes that last a lot and 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.300
 tell you that the operation is 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.010
 different from the others normally 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.420
 we are in softener in the 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.640
 compartment for the softener that 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.710
 we have a washing machine in this case it 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.680
 has to throw or well inside the drum 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.090
 or mixed with the detergent in the 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.250
 detergent compartment because 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.100
 these crystallites begin to act 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.710
 from the first moment from there to what 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.229
 the longer the smell lasts, the more 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.430
 put an amount that is marked 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.420
 in the plug 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.580
 here 47 you will see that I have a little bit here 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.960
 amount this is because what used 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.509
 for something else and I told you that you have 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.220
 different uses what used as 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.560
 air freshener is great as 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.780
 freshener what you need to do is 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.270
 put a certain amount me with this 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.550
 had enough in a type container 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.440
 this this is the lid of the boat or 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.750
 good in the container that you want and 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.030
 place it in the bathroom in the living room and 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.250
 you will see that nothing else to enter house with 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.170
 get to the milestones of clean that good 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.180
 the end of the day when we buy 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.270
 an air freshener what we want is that 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.670
 it smells clean then the relationship 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.890
 softener is super good I have in the 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.020
 wardrobe a few days and the truth is that 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.760
 has the same intensity as the first 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.460
 day that is equal if I had put 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.440
 today and the closet smells really good 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.960
 another option is to put it in this kind of 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.600
 bags that I have put in in 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.850
 a drawer of symphonies where I have the 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.160
 inner shirts and to ensure that 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.470
 was a little bag that did not have 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.790
 holes and the crystals did not fall 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.610
 the times administrators of the 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.860
 advice another way to use what 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.170
 of good that other people use is 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.420
 putting it in burners you put water and 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.510
 an amount of softener 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.610
 crystallites then light the candle and 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.560
 there is also also the house 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.740
 but since it is a product that is not 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.450
 especially indicated for let's not 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.930
 It is manufactured as a freshener but as 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.060
 softener and I have some fear 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.350
 today we get the other side so we have 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.180
 fact that the video until today because 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.470
 I wanted to tell the experience I've been 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.050
 at all times in the visualization 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.810
 where I had it and yes that 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.280
 It really smelled very nice but 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.610
 when they made the crystals 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.220
 I was doing with little bubbles like 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.319
 you were seeing and gave me some 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.000
 things and good is going to be that you take a and 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.880
 then a component ignites and 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.980
 my mother another that is something watching 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.340
 and in bridge seen that there was no water left 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.900
 that was already staying here and off 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.450
 the vein and I did not expect it to shut down 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.069
 alone that maybe nothing happens and it's 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.959
 even in many of you already what 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.510
 you have used you are calm already 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.790
 it went well but I had a certain 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.350
 respect we go anyway and you 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.450
 I say with the sachets placing in a 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.070
 vessel we go in these ways like 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.420
 while of functions or what good so 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.120
 It is a product that I recommend because 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.100
 it's not expensive it's often on offer 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.690
 you see the little papers these or the 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.880
 offers that have supermarkets that 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.620
 is in three scents this is the freshness 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.709
 floral then there is one in blue that I do not know 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.710
 very well and another in yellow and I tried 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.600
 This was the one that most 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.550
 well we go to testers you have to more 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.870
 I liked the others I can 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.000
 say but I imagine that you have also 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.920
 well I hope you liked this 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.690
