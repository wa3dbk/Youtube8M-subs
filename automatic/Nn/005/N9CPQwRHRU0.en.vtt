hey<00:00:00.329> how's<00:00:00.539> going<00:00:00.750> guys<00:00:00.989> cold<00:00:01.260> too<00:00:01.350> much<00:00:01.469> back

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
hey how's going guys cold too much back

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.320 
hey how's going guys cold too much back
out<00:00:01.890> it<00:00:01.979> with<00:00:02.070> an<00:00:02.190> updated<00:00:02.639> version<00:00:03.090> of<00:00:03.179> the

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
top 5 best CPUs for the money now I've

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.190 
top 5 best CPUs for the money now I've
been<00:00:05.609> being<00:00:05.790> requested<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.450> do<00:00:06.569> this<00:00:06.690> video<00:00:06.930> so

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
been being requested to do this video so

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.629 
been being requested to do this video so
much<00:00:07.230> recently<00:00:07.919> you<00:00:08.280> guys<00:00:08.370> have<00:00:08.550> to

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
much recently you guys have to

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.030 
much recently you guys have to
understand<00:00:09.059> that<00:00:09.150> unlike<00:00:09.540> GPU<00:00:10.110> CPU<00:00:10.410> prices

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
understand that unlike GPU CPU prices

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.919 
understand that unlike GPU CPU prices
usually<00:00:11.250> stay<00:00:11.759> in<00:00:11.969> line<00:00:12.179> so<00:00:12.660> it<00:00:12.750> really

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
usually stay in line so it really

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.419 
usually stay in line so it really
doesn't<00:00:13.230> make<00:00:13.320> sense<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.769> do<00:00:13.920> these<00:00:14.070> kind<00:00:14.280> of

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
doesn't make sense to do these kind of

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.340 
doesn't make sense to do these kind of
videos<00:00:14.670> monthly<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.179> usually<00:00:15.630> have<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.870> wait<00:00:16.049> at

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
videos monthly I usually have to wait at

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.769 
videos monthly I usually have to wait at
least<00:00:16.680> three<00:00:17.070> months<00:00:17.250> before<00:00:17.789> some<00:00:18.240> dramatic

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
least three months before some dramatic

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.660

shifts<00:00:19.140> occur<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.680> in<00:00:19.859> this<00:00:20.010> case<00:00:20.250> not<00:00:20.640> even

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
shifts occur and in this case not even

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.670 
shifts occur and in this case not even
that<00:00:20.970> many<00:00:21.119> changes<00:00:21.390> have<00:00:21.689> occurred<00:00:21.840> but<00:00:22.350> you

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
that many changes have occurred but you

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.019 
that many changes have occurred but you
guys<00:00:22.769> keep<00:00:22.980> requesting<00:00:23.250> me<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.609> do<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:23.850> video

titles start coming out you're gonna be

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.060 
titles start coming out you're gonna be
seeing<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.930> lot<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.199> games<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.649> minimum

requirement<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.969> quad<00:00:57.329> core<00:00:57.570> CPU<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.500> if

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
requirement is a quad core CPU so if

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.840 
requirement is a quad core CPU so if
you're<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.829> tight<00:00:59.070> budget<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.430> definitely

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
you're on a tight budget you definitely

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.760 
you're on a tight budget you definitely
want<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.000> look<00:01:00.090> towards<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.570> CPU<00:01:00.960> at<00:01:01.020> $73

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.229 
want to look towards this CPU at $73
this<00:01:01.920> packs<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.280> lot<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.550> performance<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.149> it

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
this packs a lot of performance and it

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.450 
this packs a lot of performance and it
is<00:01:03.329> quad<00:01:03.570> cores<00:01:03.840> at<00:01:04.019> 3.7<00:01:04.830> gigahertz<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.309> this

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
is quad cores at 3.7 gigahertz so this

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.070 
is quad cores at 3.7 gigahertz so this

$97 don't expect a lot of performance in
games<00:01:25.860> but<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.310> still<00:01:26.520> fairly<00:01:26.759> solid<00:01:27.299> and

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
games but it's still fairly solid and

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.149 
games but it's still fairly solid and
the<00:01:27.630> great<00:01:27.840> thing<00:01:27.990> about<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.380> CPU<00:01:28.799> since<00:01:29.040> it

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
the great thing about this CPU since it

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.249 
the great thing about this CPU since it
is<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> 6<00:01:29.610> core<00:01:29.820> CPU<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.360> excels<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:30.990> things<00:01:31.170> like

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
is a 6 core CPU it excels in things like

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.649 
is a 6 core CPU it excels in things like

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.160 
alongside pretty decent gaming is
definitely<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> win<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.479> end<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> FX<00:01:40.020> is

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
definitely a win so the end the FX is

definitely a win so the end the FX is
300<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.890> great<00:01:41.100> CPU<00:01:41.549> coming<00:01:41.850> from<00:01:41.970> AMD

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
300 is just a great CPU coming from AMD

a very reasonable price of $97 it's six

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.630 
a very reasonable price of $97 it's six
cores<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.450> games<00:01:46.170> also<00:01:46.500> nowadays<00:01:46.860> are<00:01:47.310> taking

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
cores and games also nowadays are taking

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.580 
cores and games also nowadays are taking
advantage<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.240> more<00:01:48.450> than<00:01:48.600> four<00:01:48.810> cores<00:01:49.079> maybe
