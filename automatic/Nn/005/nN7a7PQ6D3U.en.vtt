00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.980 

surfing<00:00:02.100> has<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.520> really<00:00:03.060> deep<00:00:03.270> tradition<00:00:03.840> of

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
surfing has a really deep tradition of

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.590 
surfing has a really deep tradition of
shaping<00:00:04.380> your<00:00:04.470> own<00:00:04.589> surfboard<00:00:05.160> and<00:00:05.700> so<00:00:06.180> I<00:00:06.210> saw

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
shaping your own surfboard and so I saw

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.270 
shaping your own surfboard and so I saw
that<00:00:06.629> need<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.410> created<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.859> place<00:00:08.040> where

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
that need and created a place where

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.400 
that need and created a place where
anybody<00:00:08.760> could<00:00:09.090> come<00:00:09.120> before<00:00:09.690> sprout<00:00:10.200> there

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
anybody could come before sprout there

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.499 
anybody could come before sprout there
wasn't<00:00:10.740> really<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:11.040> clear<00:00:11.490> way<00:00:11.790> for<00:00:12.210> people

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
wasn't really a clear way for people

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.780 
wasn't really a clear way for people
that<00:00:12.690> come<00:00:12.900> in<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.860> get<00:00:13.980> their<00:00:14.190> design<00:00:14.460> in

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
that come in and to get their design in

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.490 
that come in and to get their design in
and<00:00:14.940> out<00:00:15.030> efficiently<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:15.900> can<00:00:16.379> be

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
and out efficiently it can be

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.620 
and out efficiently it can be
overwhelming<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.279> with<00:00:17.609> sprout<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.330> really

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
overwhelming and with sprout it really

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.810 
overwhelming and with sprout it really
allows<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.199> surfer<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.920> narrow<00:00:20.369> down<00:00:20.580> their

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
allows the surfer to narrow down their

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.759 
allows the surfer to narrow down their
design<00:00:21.090> choices<00:00:21.539> whether<00:00:21.779> it's<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.170> fabric

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
design choices whether it's a fabric

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.290 
design choices whether it's a fabric
texture<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.460> they<00:00:23.580> want<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.850> see<00:00:24.029> on<00:00:24.180> the

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
texture that they want to see on the

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.140 
texture that they want to see on the
board<00:00:24.480> or<00:00:24.750> as<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:24.960> 3d<00:00:25.380> object<00:00:26.029> what<00:00:27.029> are<00:00:27.090> you

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
board or as a 3d object what are you

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.490 
board or as a 3d object what are you
thinking<00:00:27.510> for<00:00:27.539> your<00:00:27.689> board<00:00:27.990> well<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.380> know<00:00:28.470> I

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
thinking for your board well you know I

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.230 
thinking for your board well you know I
grabbed<00:00:28.769> this<00:00:28.890> burlap<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.609> was<00:00:29.820> thinking<00:00:30.119> maybe

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
grabbed this burlap I was thinking maybe

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.460 
grabbed this burlap I was thinking maybe
we<00:00:30.420> could<00:00:30.539> use<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:30.960> some<00:00:31.109> way<00:00:31.230> what<00:00:31.380> do

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
we could use that in some way what do

you think perfect just camera button up
here<00:00:33.540> it's<00:00:33.690> gonna<00:00:33.750> get<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.050> ready<00:00:34.230> hit<00:00:34.800> the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
here it's gonna get it ready hit the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.840 
here it's gonna get it ready hit the
blue<00:00:35.070> icon<00:00:37.040> when<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.100> scan<00:00:38.309> these<00:00:38.489> directly

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
blue icon when we scan these directly

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.290 
create whatever shape you wanted for
your<00:01:12.720> inland<00:01:13.820> alright<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.940> looks<00:01:14.970> real<00:01:15.240> good

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
your inland alright that looks real good

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.550 
your inland alright that looks real good
let's<00:01:15.630> go<00:01:15.690> ahead<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.900> save<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.350> then

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
let's go ahead and save this and then

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.870 
let's go ahead and save this and then
we'll<00:01:16.680> do<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.950> leave<00:01:17.130> concept<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.759> had

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
we'll do to leave concept that you had

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.850 
we'll do to leave concept that you had
called<00:01:18.390> save<00:01:18.780> as<00:01:19.670> project<00:01:21.500> cool<00:01:22.500> man

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
called save as project cool man

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.469 
called save as project cool man
so<00:01:23.039> here<00:01:23.190> you're<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.460> second<00:01:23.850> concepts

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
so here you're on the second concepts

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.850 
so here you're on the second concepts
just<00:01:24.600> swipe<00:01:24.930> down<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.229> leaves<00:01:25.440> that<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.649> want

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
just swipe down the leaves that you want

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.270 
just swipe down the leaves that you want
to<00:01:25.920> incorporate<00:01:27.740> how<00:01:28.740> about<00:01:28.890> something<00:01:29.039> like

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
to incorporate how about something like

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.790 
to incorporate how about something like
this<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.759> send<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.119> burlap<00:01:30.479> behind<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.500> so

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
this and send the burlap behind it so

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.590 
this and send the burlap behind it so
just<00:01:32.039> same<00:01:32.190> thing<00:01:32.399> move<00:01:32.580> the<00:01:32.729> burlap<00:01:33.000> over<00:01:33.390> and

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
just same thing move the burlap over and

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.230 
just same thing move the burlap over and
then<00:01:33.750> push<00:01:34.500> send<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.890> back<00:01:35.070> perfect<00:01:35.640> awesome

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
then push send the back perfect awesome

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.180 
then push send the back perfect awesome
and<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:36.600> resize<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.560> burlap<00:01:37.860> if<00:01:38.070> you

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
and you can resize the burlap if you

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.400 
and you can resize the burlap if you
want<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.490> full<00:01:38.640> board<00:01:38.940> in<00:01:39.060> there<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.390> have<00:01:40.170> one

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
want the full board in there I have one

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.080
