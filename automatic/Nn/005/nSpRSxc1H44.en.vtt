00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello to all youtube people today 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.170
 I bring a story that is not a pancake 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.059
 and pasta but rather a story of a 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.820
 series that surely marked the childhood of 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.099
 many is about dragon ball z speaks 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.710
 about an alternative ending not like that of 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.020
 dragon ball gt but another that only 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.760
 It came out in Japan and as I really follow 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.680
 much that series in a day of 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.840
 boredom I found this data 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.090
 revealing that leaves with many things in 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.820
 what to think after many years of 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.949
 Fighting deaths, pain and victories though 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.600
 some defeats did not seem to have 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.000
 new enemies since the confrontation 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.000
 definitive goku with omega 6 in role 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.309
 everything seemed very passive quiet nothing 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.079
 new but this did not seem to calm 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.090
 the protagonists of the series since 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.610
 it usually happened that a great enemy 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.950
 died and after a while a better one 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.230
 it appeared so they thought that while 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.850
 more time was spent the new enemy was 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.829
 I was preparing to make a 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.960
 ambush but that was the first 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.359
 printing could also be the end of 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.600
 the adventures of our beloved goku no 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.010
 more enemies no more emotion too many 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.440
 years in tranquility passed 40 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.810
 with which something that was already 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.670
 really old and weak they had already died 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.310
 several members of the series 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.800
 for example mister satan days ago that 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.350
 Goku lay sitting in a chair almost without 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.780
 get up with luck to go to the bathroom not 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.150
 he ate he spoke little he did not fight in the most 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.980
 minimum what many thought was weird 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.990
 is that old age is a sai ya jim de 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.510
 age similar to Goku's had not 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.160
 affected the time as much as to goku what 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.590
 that had to be taken into account was that 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.020
 Goku, however powerful it seemed, was 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.150
 of low class with which he developed a 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.340
 superior strength but inferior health 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.830
 counting the heart disease that 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.540
 goku had in the saga of the androids what 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.910
 that actually leads to death 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.370
 until it comes trunks to warn clear 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.620
 although a long time had passed from that 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.080
 illness and goku had already died several 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.630
 all that affected him over time 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.540
 a day that seemed the last in life 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.729
 from goku crumpled rotten weak all 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.040
 they surrounded crying praying that they would not 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.750
 die and he tried to talk but what 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.720
 The only thing that he was able to understand was 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.830
 take care if there is danger run but that 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.170
 It was the only thing he could understand 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.630
 words suddenly looks at his son 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.090
 bojan stares at him and is seen in the 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.130
 right eye drop a tear when your 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.200
 tear fell on his pants was his 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.240
 last second of life may 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.490
 principle do not believe it since for 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.530
 many was an idol of his childhood and that 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.960
 they believe that he can not die that they revive him 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.180
 with the spheres but it was already late but 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.220
 the worst had not yet come a couple 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.740
 of years later as everyone had 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.110
 imagined a new enemy appears or 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.480
 rather, some new enemies very 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.630
 powerful were not unprotected 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.060
 there were still vegeta trunks wang and 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.850
 others but what they faced 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.709
 it was something common were deformed beings 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.900
 demons his last enemies are not 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.240
 compared with these horrendous beings that 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.130
 they seemed to burn it every step of the way 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.260
 that they gave turned into fire and 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.300
 ashes to such an extent that much 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.120
 of the world was left with a similar texture 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.580
 to that of hell they were irrepressible 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.440
 the warriors z could not with all for 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.810
 what they had to flee to another planet 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.700
 to a planet that seemed impossible to 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.500
 arrive since they had to find a 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.490
 planet with living conditions 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.230
 required 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.120
 but the last image that was left of 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.700
 that series was the planet earth 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.010
 burning and rotting quickly already 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.840
 there was nothing to do good that has 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.220
 been everything I hope you liked it 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.220
 until next time
