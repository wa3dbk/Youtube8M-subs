 I add the three cloves of chopped garlic 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.140
 I come with this brand 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.890
 As I had already told you, I had crushed 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.890
 and has liquefied 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.750
 tomato 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.000
 and here I have it ready so I'm going 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.519
 to understand here the sofrito with which 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.519
 I was managing automatically 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.340
 while the liquid between tomatoes 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.370
 crushed that has been crushed or 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.989
 smoothie without water 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.520
 so they can see that the tomato is letting go 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.760
 a lot of liquid from the good 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.150
 to the diets 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.390
 for its high water content here goes the 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.870
 natural tomato also but chopped and the 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.870
 laurel leaf 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.280
 that cooks a little that is going 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.450
 evaporating the water and I come with the 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.450
 we add paprika 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.310
 with spicy 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.310
 and black pepper 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:14.060
 and do not miss your cousin 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:17.410
 your cousin the cumin you can see yes no 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.410
 his cousin the count 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.299
 now 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.109
 a pinch of salt 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.490
 head 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.490
 and then we will try 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.440
 and that the flavors are mixed 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.100
 in the flavors 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.980
 I quickly return to the rhythm 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:54.700
 and white wine a jet 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:57.430
 generous and this will make a broth 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.650
 spectacular 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.400
 being a pan 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:06.239
 it was a type of poster 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.489
 wide as alcohol is 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:12.079
 will evaporate faster and will remain 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.079
 essence of this wine 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.870
 a handful of rice I'm using rice 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.870
 round 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:25.110
 because it's rum they say it's not happening 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.340
 I add the washed garbanzo 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.620
 recognized 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.639
 equal delay equal two tools 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:37.020
 we mix we let 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.020
 is impregnated with flavor 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:46.160
 and we add water and oregano I 'm going to 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.160
 cast oregano 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.690
 I do not have the oregano hand 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.840
 summer 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.740
 and so we quickly have our rice 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.620
 with chickpeas 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:06.050
 now it's lukewarm water from the grid like I've 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.050
 heated australia warm 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.410
 I think that's fine if we see that 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:19.020
 lack of water because we have added rice 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:23.150
 Well, just warm water 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.150
 and if it was broth then warm broth 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.250
 to cook 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:35.240
 and we come back in 517 minutes reflections 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.920
 while our chickpea and our hoop 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:41.430
 it's going here I have the steaks 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:44.550

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.100
 which I'm going to pepper to fry with 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:50.070
 few with little oil to create the 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:54.680
 iron effect after I add it 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:58.340
 thyme on top and this will be delicious 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:02.210
 and quickly salt pepper salt pepper 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:05.229
 On the one hand salt pepper on the other and 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.229
 so I'll do everything 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:12.129
 while my rice is falling apart 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:14.350
 moving away seeing how good 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:18.160
 I already have here 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:21.449

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.240
 customers 

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:42.569
 I'll turn it over and bathe it later with 

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:45.289
 thyme 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:45.289
