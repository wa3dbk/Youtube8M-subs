00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.970
 9 in this video I'll show you briefly 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.680
 how you could move your sony and 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.530
 Although have command installed with 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.530
 you on any free pony 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.030
 could move for that I have my times 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.289
 just a building stolen here 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.529
 I did not hear it because I myself 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.850
 no nice pony had 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.710
 if I give it a pony I come to 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.980
 my own pony will be here too 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.119
 displayed when we look here 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.859
 So we do not just have this 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.830
 building but we have down here 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.590
 also a lot of boxes with items item 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.719
 Frames plant everything there 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.890
 properly packed pony lot 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.469
 and now let's just say that 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.120
 move another place before that 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.770
 we do that, I show again a 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.190
 small special case and that I set times 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.379
 a box directly to the side of the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.469
 lot here 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.280
 if I try now to move to 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.930
 example here 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.550
 I'll give you the command 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.739
 Pony move 1 pony and then pull 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.080
 He tells me in chat places with 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.100
 crates or slopes at the edges can 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.960
 not be moved 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.270
 That's because if you have one 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.390
 land and has a box at the 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.090
 page is then it could happen that 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.729
 yes, the neighbor also on the same page 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.380
 the plot has a box by 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.810
 would then arise a double box 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.400
 you could clown him items or it 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.290
 could be that everyone a double box 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.000
 and then a box of four would 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.030
 arise and that leads to errors in 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.869
 minecraft works minecraft game 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.610
 then not right anymore 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.040
 For this reason you have to first of all 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.930
 boxes on the sides to remove and 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.640
 after that you can just go to another one 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.470
 land going to enter pony at 10 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.950
 500 car costs currently doing this 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.130
 we maybe still a bit 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.110
 cheaper and ever moved 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.500
 Super easy as often as you can 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.689
 would like to 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.549
 important to note is this 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.659
 Property can not be seen so 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.909
 it always gets into the same 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.240
 look heavenly so look here 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.850
 here is the exit from the cottage 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.119
 that the exit goes in the direction 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.310
 east 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.929
 and now it does not matter where we go 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:13.620
 Let's move here zack moved 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.400
 and the exit here is still going on 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.829
 eastbound 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.420
 it will not turn that fast either 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:21.030
 that can be technically pretty 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.709
 complicated to install and straight in 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.689
 minecraft is very complicated because of it 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.370
 Did not think of something like that 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.450
 maybe someone plugin 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.560
 programmed with his own 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.260
 can move land 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.079
 Well, anyway you can now 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.060
 start your little village and you 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.560
 with all your buddies then in 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.769
 the same corner of the tree 10 or 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.500
 similar so much fun with the command 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.500
 and also a lot of fun can often continue
