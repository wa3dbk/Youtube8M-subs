00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.500
Hi guys, today we have a mega important topic to cover.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.320
What happened when you didn't realise that your girlfriend had a new haircut?

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.420
Or when you forgot to check how much fuel you had in the boat?

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.500
Ofcourse! I know that you understand what I am talking about.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.240
Being attentive to little details is crucial in spearfishing

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.820
The risks could be not seeing fish until it was too late or

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.620
not understanding the signs/symptoms of a blackout.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.240
Dont think of your underwater journey as just a hobby...

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.140
Make the most of it.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.880
Be aware of what happens within you and around you.

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:25.215
Your brain is your most important tool.

00:02:25.215 --> 00:02:29.095
But your body is not less important

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.200
Listen to it and use it to improve your technique +

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.320
+ and overall underwater experience.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.240
For example: Are you tired?

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.060
Dehydrated (thirsty)?

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.380
Shall you push more or finish the dive?

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.040
But dont limit yourself to only looking "inside of you". 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.320
How shall you approach your prey? Where shall you dive?

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.080
Here or there?

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.820
When is the best time for the shot?

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.480
What is the behaviour of the fish?

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.580
Does your partner need help?

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.740
Learn to act at any given time.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.700
Pulling a trigger,

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.700
helping your partner

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.420
or doing something as simple as having a drink (Hydration is an extremely important issue)

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.920
If you think you should act - ACT!
