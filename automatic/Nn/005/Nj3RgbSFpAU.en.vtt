00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.390 
community review and we're here to talk
about<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.839> seed<00:00:07.170> studio<00:00:07.620> electronic<00:00:08.189> brick

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
about the seed studio electronic brick

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.459 
about the seed studio electronic brick
starter<00:00:09.000> kit<00:00:09.210> now<00:00:09.840> we've<00:00:10.019> already<00:00:10.170> gone<00:00:10.410> ahead

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
starter kit now we've already gone ahead

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.950 
starter kit now we've already gone ahead
and<00:00:10.740> we've<00:00:11.010> opened<00:00:11.370> up<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.639> box<00:00:12.269> itself<00:00:12.719> to

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
and we've opened up the box itself to

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.749 
and we've opened up the box itself to
kind<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.380> take<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.740> look<00:00:13.980> at<00:00:14.070> what<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.280> has<00:00:14.429> and

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
kind of take a look at what it has and

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.430 
kind of take a look at what it has and
we<00:00:15.450> asked<00:00:15.690> as<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:15.839> look<00:00:15.960> at<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.080> review<00:00:16.350> we

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
we asked as you look at the review we

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.470 
we asked as you look at the review we
took<00:00:16.590> some<00:00:16.740> pictures<00:00:16.980> all<00:00:17.580> things<00:00:17.850> are<00:00:18.029> you

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
took some pictures all things are you

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.810 
took some pictures all things are you
know<00:00:18.510> individually<00:00:19.199> packed<00:00:20.160> inside<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.699> this

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
know individually packed inside of this

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.640 
know individually packed inside of this
now<00:00:21.449> some<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.930> things<00:00:22.080> we<00:00:22.170> planned<00:00:22.289> do<00:00:22.500> or

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
now some of the things we planned do or

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.830 
now some of the things we planned do or
is<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.740> series<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.100> experiments<00:00:23.699> now<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.720> to

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
is a series of experiments now just to

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.380 
is a series of experiments now just to
start<00:00:25.080> off<00:00:25.430> I<00:00:26.430> already<00:00:26.699> have<00:00:26.910> some<00:00:27.150> things

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
start off I already have some things

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.730 
start off I already have some things
assembled<00:00:27.840> here<00:00:27.930> because<00:00:28.140> we<00:00:28.260> were<00:00:28.320> thinking

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
assembled here because we were thinking

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.839 
assembled here because we were thinking
around<00:00:28.949> what<00:00:29.130> they<00:00:29.220> just<00:00:29.400> see<00:00:29.609> what<00:00:29.730> we're

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
around what they just see what we're

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.100 
around what they just see what we're
getting<00:00:29.939> into<00:00:31.160> basically<00:00:32.930> what<00:00:33.930> you're<00:00:34.050> going

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
getting into basically what you're going

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.200 
getting into basically what you're going
to<00:00:34.260> have<00:00:34.350> inside<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.829> kit<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.670> what<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.000> see

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
to have inside the kit is what you see

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.840 
to have inside the kit is what you see
here<00:00:36.950> so<00:00:37.950> you're<00:00:38.129> going<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.280> have<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.460> series<00:00:38.790> of

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
here so you're going to have a series of

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.819 
here so you're going to have a series of
cables<00:00:39.090> these<00:00:39.870> cables<00:00:40.260> going<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.440> be<00:00:40.500> used<00:00:40.680> to

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
cables these cables going to be used to

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.110 
cables these cables going to be used to
connect<00:00:41.160> all<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.489> different<00:00:41.790> sectors<00:00:41.940> that

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
connect all the different sectors that

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.240 
connect all the different sectors that
come<00:00:42.329> with<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.660> kit<00:00:42.890> you're<00:00:43.890> also<00:00:44.010> going<00:00:44.190> to

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
come with the kit you're also going to

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.850 
come with the kit you're also going to
have<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.670> now<00:00:44.910> not<00:00:45.450> only<00:00:45.539> an<00:00:46.050> LCD<00:00:46.320> screen<00:00:46.680> like

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
have a now not only an LCD screen like

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.190 
have a now not only an LCD screen like
this<00:00:46.980> one<00:00:47.160> here<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.600> with<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> cable<00:00:49.050> that

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
this one here and with a cable that

this one here and with a cable that
comes<00:00:49.440> with<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.770> which<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.370> easily<00:00:50.670> mountable

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
comes with it which is easily mountable

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.029 
comes with it which is easily mountable
whatever<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.020> need<00:00:52.170> has<00:00:52.410> mounting<00:00:52.860> holes

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
whatever you need has mounting holes

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.700 
whatever you need has mounting holes
here<00:00:53.190> here<00:00:53.460> here<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.850> here<00:00:54.320> so<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.620> do<00:00:55.680> a

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
here here here and here so you can do a

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.040 
here here here and here so you can do a
number<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.070> experiments<00:00:56.699> with<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.899> is

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
number of experiments with this this is

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.660 
number of experiments with this this is
going<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.230> be<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> shield<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.250> will<00:00:59.370> be<00:00:59.489> used

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
going to be a shield that will be used

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.319 
going to be a shield that will be used
with<00:00:59.850> one<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.239> seed<00:01:01.170> studio<00:01:02.059> by<00:01:03.059> doing<00:01:03.270> a

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
with one of the seed studio by doing a

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.289 
with one of the seed studio by doing a
compatible<00:01:04.369> microcontrollers<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.000> case

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
compatible microcontrollers in this case

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.539 
compatible microcontrollers in this case
we're<00:01:06.510> using<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.960> one<00:01:07.170> here<00:01:07.439> which<00:01:08.220> has<00:01:08.369> been

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
we're using this one here which has been

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.550 
we're using this one here which has been
mounted<00:01:09.060> onto<00:01:09.270> an<00:01:09.689> additional<00:01:10.170> plate<00:01:10.380> which

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
mounted onto an additional plate which

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
electronic brick starter kit but we've

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.840 
electronic brick starter kit but we've
mounted<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:16.049> here<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.619> seed<00:01:17.040> studio<00:01:19.850> my

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
mounted on here a seed studio my

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.060 
mounted on here a seed studio my

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
controller with a 9-volt battery as you

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.890 
controller with a 9-volt battery as you
can<00:01:23.189> see<00:01:23.310> it's<00:01:23.430> already<00:01:23.640> positioned<00:01:24.600> and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
can see it's already positioned and

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.999 
can see it's already positioned and
ready<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.170> go<00:01:25.259> with<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.470> power<00:01:25.680> plug<00:01:25.890> that

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
ready to go with the power plug that

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.190 
ready to go with the power plug that
just<00:01:26.189> kind<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.400> plugs<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.330> there<00:01:27.540> nice<00:01:28.020> and

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
just kind of plugs in there nice and

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.230 
just kind of plugs in there nice and
easy<00:01:28.229> as<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.680> see<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.950> power<00:01:29.189> not<00:01:30.060> sure

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
easy as you can see the power not sure

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.670 
easy as you can see the power not sure
if<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.360> can<00:01:30.420> see<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> power<00:01:31.020> come<00:01:31.320> on<00:01:31.470> there

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
if you can see the power come on there

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.340 
if you can see the power come on there
or<00:01:31.799> not<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.189> just<00:01:32.340> plug<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.670> right<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:33.000> and

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
or not but you just plug it right in and

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.080 
or not but you just plug it right in and
the<00:01:34.350> power<00:01:34.560> comes<00:01:34.890> on<00:01:35.100> there's<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.970> little

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
the power comes on there's a little

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.450 
the power comes on there's a little
green<00:01:36.299> light<00:01:36.540> there<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.590> should<00:01:37.829> see<00:01:38.040> turn

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
green light there you should see turn

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.039 
green light there you should see turn
off<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> little<00:01:39.509> hard<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.750> see<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.020> this

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
off it's a little hard to see in this

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.109 
off it's a little hard to see in this
lighting<00:01:40.350> but<00:01:40.610> anyways<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.820> nicely

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
lighting but anyways this is nicely

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.910 
lighting but anyways this is nicely
mounted<00:01:42.689> we<00:01:42.780> suggest<00:01:43.170> getting<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.590> kind<00:01:43.890> of

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
mounted we suggest getting this kind of

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.130 
mounted we suggest getting this kind of
do<00:01:44.189> your<00:01:44.490> experiments<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.299> addition<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
do your experiments in addition to the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.480 
do your experiments in addition to the
electronic<00:01:46.549> brick<00:01:47.549> starter<00:01:48.119> kit<00:01:49.189> now<00:01:50.189> do<00:01:50.250> not

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
electronic brick starter kit now do not

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.499 
electronic brick starter kit now do not
come<00:01:50.640> with<00:01:50.759> batteries<00:01:50.909> that's<00:01:51.299> something

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
come with batteries that's something

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.120 
come with batteries that's something
that<00:01:51.540> we<00:01:51.659> mount<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:52.049> there<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.979> we've

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
that we mount it on there so we've

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.889 
that we mount it on there so we've
talked<00:01:53.369> about<00:01:53.490> these<00:01:53.850> two<00:01:54.060> components<00:01:54.360> now<00:01:54.840> we

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
talked about these two components now we

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.600 
talked about these two components now we
have<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.320> shield<00:01:55.680> which<00:01:55.950> will<00:01:56.100> go<00:01:56.189> mount<00:01:56.460> it

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
have this shield which will go mount it

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.389 
have this shield which will go mount it
on<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.329> board<00:01:58.140> right<00:01:58.409> here<00:01:58.439> what<00:01:59.250> this

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
on to this board right here what this

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.010 
on to this board right here what this
shields<00:01:59.670> going<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.880> do<00:01:59.939> it's<00:02:00.299> basically

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
shields going to do it's basically

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.410 
shields going to do it's basically
nicely<00:02:01.799> designed<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.399> all<00:02:02.729> these<00:02:02.909> cables

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
nicely designed so that all these cables

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.020 
nicely designed so that all these cables
here<00:02:03.570> plug<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.469> easily<00:02:05.219> teach<00:02:05.670> one<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.909> these

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
here plug in easily teach one of these

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.700 
here plug in easily teach one of these
components<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:07.229> don't<00:02:07.380> really<00:02:07.469> have<00:02:07.619> to

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
components and you don't really have to

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.469 
components and you don't really have to
think<00:02:07.860> much<00:02:08.099> about<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.459> but

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
think much about it but

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.940 
think much about it but
so<00:02:09.599> has<00:02:09.750> three<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.229> these<00:02:10.319> connectors<00:02:10.739> which

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
so has three of these connectors which

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.070 
so has three of these connectors which
you<00:02:11.039> can<00:02:11.159> use<00:02:11.190> for<00:02:11.610> example<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.599> control<00:02:12.870> one

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
you can use for example to control one

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.380 
you can use for example to control one
of<00:02:13.170> these<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.549> mounts<00:02:14.909> just<00:02:15.120> right<00:02:15.269> on

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
of these and that mounts just right on

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.070 
of these and that mounts just right on
top<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.629> that<00:02:15.690> board<00:02:15.930> like<00:02:16.709> such<00:02:17.659> now<00:02:18.659> in

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
top of that board like such now in

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.369 
top of that board like such now in
addition<00:02:19.349> to<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:19.879> you<00:02:20.879> know<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.959> cabling

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
addition to that you know the cabling

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.780 
addition to that you know the cabling
and<00:02:22.590> all<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.799> other<00:02:22.980> stuff<00:02:23.040> we<00:02:23.340> have<00:02:23.459> a<00:02:23.489> series

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
and all the other stuff we have a series

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.339 
and all the other stuff we have a series
of<00:02:23.819> sensors<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:24.840> I'm<00:02:24.900> just<00:02:25.019> going<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.200> quickly

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
of sensors so I'm just going to quickly

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.839 
of sensors so I'm just going to quickly
go<00:02:25.560> through<00:02:25.709> each<00:02:26.010> one<00:02:26.040> even<00:02:26.519> though<00:02:26.610> they're

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
go through each one even though they're

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.729 
go through each one even though they're
all<00:02:27.019> illustrated<00:02:28.019> in<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.200> pictures<00:02:28.500> in<00:02:28.650> the

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
all illustrated in the pictures in the

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.920 
all illustrated in the pictures in the
actual<00:02:29.190> review<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:30.269> this<00:02:30.360> is<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.510> push<00:02:31.440> button

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
actual review so this is a push button

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.690 
actual review so this is a push button
here<00:02:33.930> we<00:02:34.049> have<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.590> believe<00:02:34.709> this<00:02:34.980> is<00:02:35.099> an<00:02:35.220> LED

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
here we have I believe this is an LED

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.380 
here we have I believe this is an LED
light<00:02:36.230> okay<00:02:37.459> here<00:02:38.459> we<00:02:38.519> have<00:02:38.819> I<00:02:38.849> believe<00:02:39.209> it's

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
light okay here we have I believe it's

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.410 
light okay here we have I believe it's
the<00:02:39.569> tilt<00:02:40.409> switch<00:02:40.849> the<00:02:41.849> way<00:02:42.000> that<00:02:42.120> usually

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
the tilt switch the way that usually

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.059 
the tilt switch the way that usually
works<00:02:42.599> is<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:42.989> have<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.349> little<00:02:43.560> tube

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
works is that you have this little tube

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.710 
works is that you have this little tube
here<00:02:44.340> with<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.489> little<00:02:44.670> ball<00:02:44.879> inside<00:02:45.299> and<00:02:45.599> when

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
here with a little ball inside and when

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.599 
here with a little ball inside and when
it<00:02:45.810> makes<00:02:45.930> contact<00:02:46.019> on<00:02:46.410> either<00:02:46.500> side<00:02:46.829> you<00:02:47.069> know

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
it makes contact on either side you know

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.420 
it makes contact on either side you know
it's<00:02:47.730> it's<00:02:48.000> on<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:48.269> side<00:02:48.329> or<00:02:48.569> that<00:02:48.599> side<00:02:49.430> not

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
it's it's on this side or that side not

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.920 
it's it's on this side or that side not
sure<00:02:50.609> if<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.760> can<00:02:50.819> hear<00:02:50.879> shaking<00:02:51.480> but<00:02:51.629> it<00:02:51.720> does

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
sure if you can hear shaking but it does

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.619 
sure if you can hear shaking but it does
rattle<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:53.069> have<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.250> pedometer<00:02:53.730> which<00:02:54.329> in

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
rattle you have a pedometer which in

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:55.849 
rattle you have a pedometer which in
this<00:02:54.750> case<00:02:54.810> they're<00:02:55.200> calling<00:02:55.560> just<00:02:55.709> a

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
this case they're calling just a

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.369 
this case they're calling just a
rotation<00:02:56.430> rotation<00:02:57.390> type<00:02:57.840> sensor<00:02:58.170> which

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
rotation rotation type sensor which

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.449 
rotation rotation type sensor which
rotates<00:03:00.650> here<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.769> have<00:03:01.950> just<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.280> regular

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
rotates here you have just a regular

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.000 
rotates here you have just a regular
terminal<00:03:05.329> here<00:03:06.329> you<00:03:06.540> have<00:03:06.720> I<00:03:07.109> believe<00:03:07.799> this<00:03:07.950> is

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
terminal here you have I believe this is

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.569 
terminal here you have I believe this is
a<00:03:08.190> light<00:03:08.819> sensor<00:03:09.260> so<00:03:10.260> light<00:03:10.890> sensors<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.549> can

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
a light sensor so light sensors you can

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.979 
a light sensor so light sensors you can
see<00:03:12.049> that<00:03:13.049> little<00:03:13.319> little<00:03:14.389> round<00:03:15.389> or<00:03:15.780> oval

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
see that little little round or oval

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.670 
see that little little round or oval
thing<00:03:16.500> there<00:03:16.680> is<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:16.919> actual<00:03:17.160> light<00:03:17.370> sensor

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
thing there is the actual light sensor

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.430 
thing there is the actual light sensor
and<00:03:20.150> here<00:03:21.150> we<00:03:21.299> have<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.810> nice<00:03:22.169> thing<00:03:22.380> about

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
and here we have a nice thing about

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.400 
and here we have a nice thing about
these<00:03:23.180> this<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.329> a<00:03:24.359> temperature<00:03:25.169> sensor

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
these this is a temperature sensor

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.309 
these this is a temperature sensor
itself<00:03:25.889> now<00:03:26.849> the<00:03:26.910> nice<00:03:27.299> thing<00:03:27.329> about<00:03:27.660> seats<00:03:28.139> to

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
itself now the nice thing about seats to

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.900 
itself now the nice thing about seats to
do<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:28.620> if<00:03:28.769> they<00:03:28.859> actually<00:03:29.190> label<00:03:29.549> each<00:03:29.669> one<00:03:29.819> of

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
do is if they actually label each one of

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.059 
do is if they actually label each one of
their<00:03:30.000> sensors<00:03:30.389> which<00:03:31.200> is<00:03:31.349> very<00:03:31.590> nice<00:03:31.799> it

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
their sensors which is very nice it

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.949 
their sensors which is very nice it
makes<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.489> easy<00:03:32.639> to<00:03:32.760> determine<00:03:33.239> what<00:03:33.599> type

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
makes it easy to determine what type

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.360 
makes it easy to determine what type
what<00:03:34.230> sensor<00:03:34.530> is<00:03:34.650> what<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:36.690> we<00:03:36.780> have<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:36.900> buzzer

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
what sensor is what and we have a buzzer

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.500 
what sensor is what and we have a buzzer
so<00:03:38.370> this<00:03:38.639> originally<00:03:39.060> came<00:03:39.180> with<00:03:39.239> a<00:03:39.359> little

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
so this originally came with a little

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.990 
so this originally came with a little
piece<00:03:40.410> of<00:03:40.440> paper<00:03:40.680> /<00:03:40.980> we<00:03:41.130> just<00:03:41.310> put<00:03:41.669> that<00:03:41.700> right

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
piece of paper / we just put that right

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.559 
piece of paper / we just put that right
off<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.389> here's<00:03:43.349> another<00:03:43.440> LED<00:03:44.040> light<00:03:44.250> so<00:03:44.849> what

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
off and here's another LED light so what

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:46.699 
off and here's another LED light so what
we've<00:03:45.720> thought<00:03:45.930> about<00:03:45.989> doing<00:03:46.260> we're<00:03:46.500> going<00:03:46.620> to

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
we've thought about doing we're going to

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.589 
we've thought about doing we're going to
a<00:03:46.769> series<00:03:47.130> of<00:03:47.190> experiments<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.329> we're<00:03:48.480> going

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
a series of experiments and we're going

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.750 
a series of experiments and we're going
to<00:03:48.660> use<00:03:48.870> all<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.950> things<00:03:50.099> you<00:03:50.250> see<00:03:50.400> here<00:03:50.579> to<00:03:50.669> do

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
to use all the things you see here to do

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.369 
to use all the things you see here to do
these<00:03:50.880> experiments<00:03:51.299> so<00:03:51.690> just<00:03:51.989> to<00:03:52.079> give<00:03:52.109> you<00:03:52.319> a

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
these experiments so just to give you a

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.949 
these experiments so just to give you a
highlight<00:03:52.950> of<00:03:52.980> what<00:03:53.340> we<00:03:53.430> plan<00:03:53.730> on<00:03:53.760> doing<00:03:53.959> so

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
highlight of what we plan on doing so

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.479 
highlight of what we plan on doing so
basically<00:03:55.500> we're<00:03:55.799> going<00:03:55.919> to<00:03:55.980> be<00:03:56.040> mounting

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
basically we're going to be mounting

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:02.570 
basically we're going to be mounting
this<00:03:57.950> like<00:03:58.950> so<00:03:59.329> on<00:04:00.329> to<00:04:00.840> this<00:04:00.989> board

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
this like so on to this board

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.559 
this like so on to this board
okay<00:04:03.580> so<00:04:04.330> that's<00:04:04.510> mounted<00:04:04.930> like<00:04:05.110> such<00:04:06.569> and

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
okay so that's mounted like such and

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.990 
okay so that's mounted like such and
we're<00:04:08.500> going<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.650> connect<00:04:08.890> to<00:04:09.040> it<00:04:09.220> via<00:04:09.489> USB

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
we're going to connect to it via USB

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.030 
we're going to connect to it via USB
which<00:04:10.420> is<00:04:10.540> like<00:04:10.630> a<00:04:10.720> mini<00:04:10.870> USB<00:04:11.110> connector<00:04:11.860> to

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
which is like a mini USB connector to

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.770 
which is like a mini USB connector to
our<00:04:12.130> computer<00:04:12.489> so<00:04:12.580> we<00:04:12.610> can<00:04:12.790> download<00:04:13.030> our<00:04:13.420> our

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
our computer so we can download our our

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.620 
our computer so we can download our our
sketches<00:04:14.290> on<00:04:14.650> to<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.130> board<00:04:15.370> and<00:04:15.520> then<00:04:16.480> we're

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
sketches on to the board and then we're

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.080 
sketches on to the board and then we're
going<00:04:16.720> to<00:04:16.810> use<00:04:16.989> this<00:04:17.200> particular<00:04:17.980> shield<00:04:18.669> to

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
going to use this particular shield to

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.940 
going to use this particular shield to
plug<00:04:19.329> in<00:04:19.510> all<00:04:19.720> these<00:04:19.870> devices<00:04:20.230> so<00:04:20.620> like<00:04:20.799> for

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
plug in all these devices so like for

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.770 
plug in all these devices so like for
example<00:04:21.040> this<00:04:21.940> is<00:04:22.000> going<00:04:22.270> to<00:04:22.330> plug<00:04:22.450> in<00:04:22.600> right

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
example this is going to plug in right

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.650 
example this is going to plug in right
right<00:04:23.380> there<00:04:23.590> like<00:04:23.800> so<00:04:24.040> and<00:04:24.760> so<00:04:24.790> on<00:04:25.180> not<00:04:25.510> sure

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
right there like so and so on not sure

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.629 
right there like so and so on not sure
if<00:04:25.720> you<00:04:25.780> can<00:04:25.870> actually<00:04:26.050> see<00:04:26.260> that<00:04:26.680> there<00:04:26.980> but

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
if you can actually see that there but

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.620 
if you can actually see that there but
these<00:04:27.850> are<00:04:28.710> you<00:04:29.710> can<00:04:29.830> see<00:04:29.980> they<00:04:30.130> open<00:04:30.460> up<00:04:31.260> and

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
these are you can see they open up and

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.300 
these are you can see they open up and
that<00:04:34.630> makes<00:04:34.840> it<00:04:34.900> easy<00:04:35.139> and<00:04:35.410> it<00:04:35.620> drips<00:04:35.860> onto<00:04:36.070> the

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
that makes it easy and it drips onto the

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.070 
that makes it easy and it drips onto the
cable<00:04:36.460> so<00:04:36.700> make<00:04:36.850> sure<00:04:36.880> doesn't<00:04:37.090> come<00:04:37.630> loose<00:04:37.660> on

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
cable so make sure doesn't come loose on

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.050 
cable so make sure doesn't come loose on
you<00:04:38.280> so<00:04:39.280> what<00:04:39.580> we're<00:04:39.700> gonna<00:04:39.790> do<00:04:39.880> is<00:04:39.970> we're

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
you so what we're gonna do is we're

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.200 
you so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:04:40.150> do<00:04:40.270> a<00:04:40.330> series<00:04:40.840> of<00:04:40.870> experiments<00:04:41.620> so<00:04:42.310> what

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
gonna do a series of experiments so what

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.000 
gonna do a series of experiments so what
kind<00:04:43.450> of<00:04:43.479> experiments<00:04:43.990> we<00:04:44.139> do<00:04:44.320> with<00:04:44.560> all<00:04:44.800> these

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
kind of experiments we do with all these

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.219 
kind of experiments we do with all these
sensors<00:04:45.430> now<00:04:45.850> they<00:04:46.030> gave<00:04:46.210> you<00:04:46.389> the<00:04:46.510> sensor<00:04:47.110> so

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
sensors now they gave you the sensor so

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:48.570 
sensors now they gave you the sensor so
you<00:04:47.320> can<00:04:47.440> kind<00:04:47.620> of<00:04:47.650> tinker<00:04:48.040> around<00:04:48.070> with<00:04:48.370> all

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
you can kind of tinker around with all

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.090 
you can kind of tinker around with all
these<00:04:48.700> things<00:04:48.970> and<00:04:49.350> you<00:04:50.350> know<00:04:50.440> get<00:04:50.710> familiar

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
these things and you know get familiar

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.830 
these things and you know get familiar
with<00:04:51.280> all<00:04:51.580> the<00:04:51.729> sensors<00:04:52.090> and<00:04:52.360> all<00:04:52.419> the<00:04:52.570> devices

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
with all the sensors and all the devices

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.260 
with all the sensors and all the devices
they<00:04:53.169> have<00:04:53.320> it<00:04:53.560> can<00:04:53.710> connect<00:04:54.010> to<00:04:54.100> the<00:04:54.190> board<00:04:54.430> so

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
they have it can connect to the board so

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.240 
they have it can connect to the board so
you<00:04:55.300> can<00:04:55.750> cope<00:04:55.930> with<00:04:56.050> your<00:04:56.229> own<00:04:56.380> type<00:04:57.100> of

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
you can cope with your own type of

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.430 
you can cope with your own type of
projects<00:04:57.790> and<00:04:58.000> expand<00:04:58.330> on<00:04:58.450> this<00:04:58.600> again<00:04:59.290> you

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
projects and expand on this again you

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.590 
projects and expand on this again you
know<00:04:59.530> this<00:04:59.710> is<00:04:59.830> just<00:05:00.130> an<00:05:00.250> introductory<00:05:00.669> so

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
know this is just an introductory so

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.530 
know this is just an introductory so
it's<00:05:01.720> a<00:05:01.780> starter<00:05:02.200> kit<00:05:02.410> nothing<00:05:03.130> more<00:05:03.450> but<00:05:04.450> you

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
it's a starter kit nothing more but you

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.590 
it's a starter kit nothing more but you
can<00:05:04.810> do<00:05:04.990> some<00:05:05.229> pretty<00:05:05.380> sophisticated

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
can do some pretty sophisticated

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.490 
can do some pretty sophisticated
experiments<00:05:07.600> and<00:05:07.720> things<00:05:07.900> with<00:05:08.080> it<00:05:08.110> to<00:05:08.380> get

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
experiments and things with it to get

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.560 
experiments and things with it to get
you<00:05:08.650> going<00:05:08.830> and<00:05:09.160> then<00:05:09.580> later<00:05:09.760> use<00:05:10.030> this<00:05:10.330> same

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
you going and then later use this same

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.469 
you going and then later use this same
platform<00:05:11.140> to<00:05:11.289> expand<00:05:11.800> whatever<00:05:12.419> projects<00:05:13.419> you

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
platform to expand whatever projects you

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:18.240 
platform to expand whatever projects you
might<00:05:13.630> have<00:05:14.880> so<00:05:15.880> let's<00:05:16.419> start<00:05:16.720> off<00:05:16.900> with<00:05:17.250> kind

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
might have so let's start off with kind

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.850 
might have so let's start off with kind
of<00:05:18.310> looking<00:05:18.520> at<00:05:18.700> a<00:05:18.789> few<00:05:18.970> things<00:05:19.210> here<00:05:19.620> so<00:05:20.620> I'm

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
of looking at a few things here so I'm

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.380 
of looking at a few things here so I'm
going<00:05:21.039> to<00:05:21.100> kind<00:05:21.250> of<00:05:21.310> just<00:05:21.820> move<00:05:22.120> some<00:05:22.360> things

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
going to kind of just move some things

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:30.480 
going to kind of just move some things
around<00:05:26.400> okay<00:05:27.510> so<00:05:28.830> one<00:05:29.830> experiment<00:05:30.340> that<00:05:30.460> I

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
around okay so one experiment that I

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.750 
around okay so one experiment that I
plan<00:05:30.700> on<00:05:30.789> doing<00:05:31.260> is<00:05:32.370> that<00:05:33.370> we're<00:05:33.610> going<00:05:33.700> to

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
plan on doing is that we're going to

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.990 
plan on doing is that we're going to
have<00:05:34.830> basically<00:05:35.830> we're<00:05:36.580> going<00:05:36.700> to<00:05:36.760> connect

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
have basically we're going to connect

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.460 
have basically we're going to connect
these<00:05:37.120> two<00:05:37.330> sensors<00:05:37.690> here<00:05:37.870> so<00:05:37.930> these<00:05:38.289> two

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
these two sensors here so these two

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:39.540 
these two sensors here so these two
central<00:05:38.710> you<00:05:38.830> have<00:05:38.950> an<00:05:39.039> ambient<00:05:39.400> light

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
central you have an ambient light

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.969 
central you have an ambient light
temperature<00:05:40.050> sorry<00:05:41.050> I<00:05:41.110> never<00:05:41.229> a<00:05:41.380> light<00:05:41.680> sensor

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
temperature sorry I never a light sensor

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:44.580 
temperature sorry I never a light sensor
and<00:05:42.310> an<00:05:42.520> LED<00:05:42.880> so<00:05:43.720> we're<00:05:43.870> going<00:05:44.020> to<00:05:44.080> do<00:05:44.289> and

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
and an LED so we're going to do and

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.020 
and an LED so we're going to do and
we're<00:05:44.770> going<00:05:44.890> to<00:05:44.979> have<00:05:45.070> this<00:05:45.220> photometers<00:05:45.789> so

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
we're going to have this photometers so

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.240 
we're going to have this photometers so
what<00:05:46.180> we're<00:05:46.270> going<00:05:46.360> to<00:05:46.450> do<00:05:46.510> is<00:05:46.720> actually<00:05:47.020> use<00:05:47.530> a

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
what we're going to do is actually use a

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.130 
what we're going to do is actually use a
pedometer<00:05:48.700> to<00:05:49.090> adjust<00:05:49.750> the<00:05:49.870> brightness

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
pedometer to adjust the brightness

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.890 
pedometer to adjust the brightness
hopefully<00:05:50.890> of<00:05:51.250> this<00:05:51.789> led<00:05:52.210> let's<00:05:52.600> see<00:05:52.720> if<00:05:52.810> we

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
hopefully of this led let's see if we

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.010 
hopefully of this led let's see if we
can<00:05:53.050> do<00:05:53.229> that<00:05:53.260> and<00:05:53.729> adjust<00:05:54.729> that<00:05:55.240> if<00:05:55.479> we<00:05:55.630> can<00:05:55.840> to

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
can do that and adjust that if we can to

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.360 
can do that and adjust that if we can to
be<00:05:56.110> great<00:05:56.350> if<00:05:56.470> not<00:05:56.590> it'll<00:05:56.770> just<00:05:56.919> be<00:05:56.979> like<00:05:57.039> an<00:05:57.220> on

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
be great if not it'll just be like an on

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.100 
be great if not it'll just be like an on
and<00:05:57.550> off<00:05:57.610> for<00:05:57.910> us<00:05:58.060> and<00:05:58.270> then<00:05:58.870> we're<00:05:58.960> going<00:05:59.050> to

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
and off for us and then we're going to

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.230 
and off for us and then we're going to
have<00:05:59.260> this<00:05:59.440> ambient<00:05:59.950> light<00:06:00.100> sensor<00:06:00.550> kind<00:06:01.150> of

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
have this ambient light sensor kind of

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.830 
have this ambient light sensor kind of
sitting<00:06:01.510> over<00:06:01.840> it<00:06:01.930> like<00:06:02.080> so

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.530 

just<00:06:05.440> like<00:06:05.620> this<00:06:05.919> so<00:06:06.730> that<00:06:06.850> way<00:06:06.970> it's<00:06:07.090> directly

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:07.540 
just like this so that way it's directly

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.780 
just like this so that way it's directly
over<00:06:07.840> the<00:06:07.870> LED<00:06:08.100> now<00:06:09.100> what<00:06:09.310> that's<00:06:09.490> going<00:06:09.639> to<00:06:09.699> do

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
over the LED now what that's going to do

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.370 
over the LED now what that's going to do
is<00:06:09.940> going<00:06:09.970> to<00:06:10.150> tell<00:06:10.300> us<00:06:10.330> basically<00:06:10.900> it's<00:06:11.139> a

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
is going to tell us basically it's a

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.230 
is going to tell us basically it's a
sensor<00:06:11.800> reading<00:06:12.130> from<00:06:12.280> the<00:06:12.430> ambient<00:06:12.730> light

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
sensor reading from the ambient light

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.939 
sensor reading from the ambient light
sensor<00:06:13.660> and<00:06:13.870> then<00:06:14.470> what<00:06:14.590> we're<00:06:14.680> going<00:06:14.770> to<00:06:14.889> do

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:14.949 
sensor and then what we're going to do

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:17.040 
sensor and then what we're going to do
is<00:06:15.100> we're<00:06:15.220> going<00:06:15.310> to<00:06:15.400> output<00:06:15.639> the<00:06:15.970> results<00:06:16.479> to

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
is we're going to output the results to

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.260 
is we're going to output the results to
the<00:06:17.199> screen<00:06:17.470> here<00:06:17.830> okay<00:06:18.699> so<00:06:18.760> it's<00:06:19.090> one

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
the screen here okay so it's one

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.120 
the screen here okay so it's one
experiment<00:06:19.660> we<00:06:19.780> plan<00:06:19.990> on<00:06:20.110> doing<00:06:20.139> another<00:06:20.979> one

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
experiment we plan on doing another one

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.320 
experiment we plan on doing another one
that<00:06:21.220> we<00:06:21.250> plan<00:06:21.490> on<00:06:21.580> doing<00:06:21.610> is<00:06:21.910> taking<00:06:22.060> the

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
that we plan on doing is taking the

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.960 
that we plan on doing is taking the
other<00:06:22.479> LED<00:06:22.900> and<00:06:23.370> using<00:06:24.370> the<00:06:24.520> temperature

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:24.970 
other LED and using the temperature

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.090 
other LED and using the temperature
sensor<00:06:25.330> to<00:06:26.110> determine<00:06:26.530> if<00:06:26.590> the<00:06:26.740> temperature

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
sensor to determine if the temperature

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.730 
sensor to determine if the temperature
rises<00:06:27.610> or<00:06:27.850> lowers<00:06:28.330> or<00:06:28.540> whatever<00:06:28.870> when<00:06:29.410> we<00:06:29.560> turn

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
rises or lowers or whatever when we turn

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.790 
rises or lowers or whatever when we turn
it<00:06:29.889> on<00:06:30.510> and<00:06:31.510> again<00:06:31.750> that'll<00:06:32.020> be<00:06:32.139> controlled<00:06:32.560> by

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
it on and again that'll be controlled by

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.290 
it on and again that'll be controlled by
using<00:06:33.900> one<00:06:34.900> of<00:06:34.930> these<00:06:35.790> using<00:06:36.790> this<00:06:36.910> pentameter

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
using one of these using this pentameter

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.219 
using one of these using this pentameter
or<00:06:37.660> rotation<00:06:38.229> sensor<00:06:38.560> as<00:06:38.620> they<00:06:38.740> call<00:06:38.919> it<00:06:39.060> and

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:40.229 
or rotation sensor as they call it and

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:42.629 
or rotation sensor as they call it and
again<00:06:41.229> the<00:06:41.350> readouts<00:06:41.770> from<00:06:42.160> the<00:06:42.310> temperature

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 
again the readouts from the temperature

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:44.570 
again the readouts from the temperature
sensor<00:06:42.940> will<00:06:43.060> be<00:06:43.150> shown<00:06:43.389> here<00:06:44.080> on<00:06:44.229> this<00:06:44.350> screen

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 
sensor will be shown here on this screen

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.650 
sensor will be shown here on this screen
yet<00:06:45.580> another<00:06:45.790> one<00:06:45.940> of<00:06:46.030> each<00:06:46.120> plan<00:06:46.360> on<00:06:46.479> doing

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660 
yet another one of each plan on doing

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.480 
yet another one of each plan on doing
which<00:06:46.810> is<00:06:46.960> very<00:06:47.169> basic<00:06:47.590> just<00:06:47.979> using<00:06:48.250> the<00:06:48.340> push

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
which is very basic just using the push

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.680 
which is very basic just using the push
button<00:06:49.110> push<00:06:50.110> button<00:06:50.470> and<00:06:50.970> the<00:06:51.970> buzzer<00:06:52.150> just

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:52.690 
button push button and the buzzer just

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.990 
button push button and the buzzer just
showing<00:06:53.050> an<00:06:53.139> example<00:06:53.229> of<00:06:53.680> pushing<00:06:54.639> the<00:06:54.729> button

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.000 
showing an example of pushing the button

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.120 
showing an example of pushing the button
and<00:06:55.180> the<00:06:55.240> buzzer<00:06:55.419> going<00:06:55.630> off<00:06:55.840> pushing<00:06:56.530> buzzer

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.130 
and the buzzer going off pushing buzzer

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.409 
and the buzzer going off pushing buzzer
off<00:06:58.650> and<00:06:59.729> other<00:07:00.729> things<00:07:01.000> are<00:07:01.090> just<00:07:01.150> going<00:07:01.360> to

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:01.419 
off and other things are just going to

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:02.969 
off and other things are just going to
add<00:07:01.539> is<00:07:01.750> that<00:07:01.780> we're<00:07:02.020> going<00:07:02.110> to<00:07:02.169> take<00:07:02.350> the<00:07:02.530> tilt

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:02.979 
add is that we're going to take the tilt

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:05.189 
add is that we're going to take the tilt
sensor<00:07:03.370> will<00:07:04.000> mount<00:07:04.150> it<00:07:04.389> onto<00:07:04.510> the<00:07:04.720> board<00:07:04.930> here

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199 
sensor will mount it onto the board here

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:07.170 
sensor will mount it onto the board here
and<00:07:05.410> that<00:07:05.889> way<00:07:06.010> when<00:07:06.160> we<00:07:06.310> do<00:07:06.430> tilt<00:07:06.729> it<00:07:06.910> will

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.180 
and that way when we do tilt it will

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.710 
and that way when we do tilt it will
show<00:07:07.389> readout<00:07:07.900> of<00:07:08.199> that<00:07:08.669> here<00:07:09.669> so<00:07:10.270> this<00:07:10.539> going

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 
show readout of that here so this going

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.360 
show readout of that here so this going
to<00:07:10.810> serve<00:07:11.050> as<00:07:11.289> a<00:07:11.320> you<00:07:11.590> know<00:07:11.710> it's<00:07:12.190> going<00:07:12.310> to

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.370 
to serve as a you know it's going to

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.159 
to serve as a you know it's going to
show<00:07:12.520> us<00:07:12.639> many<00:07:12.910> different<00:07:13.270> things<00:07:13.419> so<00:07:14.080> that's

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:14.169 
show us many different things so that's

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:15.810 
show us many different things so that's
all<00:07:14.410> we<00:07:14.440> have<00:07:14.680> in<00:07:14.830> mind<00:07:15.070> and<00:07:15.550> that's<00:07:15.700> the

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:15.820 
all we have in mind and that's the

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.940 
all we have in mind and that's the
overview<00:07:16.120> of<00:07:16.510> what<00:07:16.630> we<00:07:16.720> plan<00:07:16.930> to<00:07:16.960> do<00:07:17.169> with<00:07:17.470> the

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:17.950 
overview of what we plan to do with the

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.150 
overview of what we plan to do with the
electronic<00:07:18.520> brick<00:07:19.240> starter<00:07:19.630> kit<00:07:20.039> what<00:07:21.039> we'll

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:21.160 
electronic brick starter kit what we'll

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.520 
electronic brick starter kit what we'll
do<00:07:21.310> is<00:07:21.430> we'll<00:07:21.550> do<00:07:21.729> one<00:07:22.150> video<00:07:22.330> for<00:07:22.900> each<00:07:23.139> one<00:07:23.440> of

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:23.530 
do is we'll do one video for each one of

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.230 
do is we'll do one video for each one of
the<00:07:23.590> experiments<00:07:23.979> and<00:07:24.400> hopefully<00:07:24.849> post<00:07:25.090> the

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 
the experiments and hopefully post the

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.640 
the experiments and hopefully post the
code<00:07:25.419> up<00:07:25.599> for<00:07:25.840> you<00:07:25.930> so<00:07:26.050> you<00:07:26.139> can<00:07:26.229> see<00:07:26.440> what<00:07:26.530> how

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:26.650 
code up for you so you can see what how

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.800 
code up for you so you can see what how
we<00:07:26.710> did<00:07:26.979> it<00:07:27.010> and<00:07:27.550> again<00:07:27.940> remember<00:07:28.120> all<00:07:28.510> these

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:28.810 
we did it and again remember all these

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.450 
we did it and again remember all these
will<00:07:29.020> connect<00:07:29.289> easily<00:07:29.470> with<00:07:29.889> the<00:07:29.979> cables<00:07:30.340> that

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:30.460 
will connect easily with the cables that

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.250 
will connect easily with the cables that
they've<00:07:30.580> included<00:07:31.030> with<00:07:31.599> all<00:07:31.750> of<00:07:31.870> these<00:07:31.960> here

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:32.260 
they've included with all of these here

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:37.469 
they've included with all of these here
so<00:07:33.039> just<00:07:33.250> as<00:07:33.370> a<00:07:33.400> sample<00:07:34.710> this<00:07:35.710> is<00:07:35.860> a<00:07:36.360> kind<00:07:37.360> of

00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:37.479 
so just as a sample this is a kind of

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:39.210 
so just as a sample this is a kind of
going<00:07:37.750> outside<00:07:37.900> the<00:07:38.229> scope<00:07:38.440> of<00:07:38.560> this<00:07:38.620> initial

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:39.220 
going outside the scope of this initial

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.040 
going outside the scope of this initial
video<00:07:39.430> but<00:07:39.669> these<00:07:39.820> just<00:07:40.090> plug<00:07:40.300> in<00:07:40.450> like<00:07:40.750> so

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.050 
video but these just plug in like so

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.990 
video but these just plug in like so
there<00:07:41.349> and<00:07:41.770> then<00:07:42.250> you<00:07:42.400> should<00:07:42.550> take<00:07:42.669> one<00:07:42.880> of

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.000 
there and then you should take one of

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.510 
there and then you should take one of
these<00:07:43.060> and<00:07:43.120> you<00:07:43.599> plug<00:07:44.139> it<00:07:44.260> in<00:07:44.349> and<00:07:45.220> you're<00:07:45.340> done

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 
these and you plug it in and you're done

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.580 
these and you plug it in and you're done
that's<00:07:45.910> it<00:07:46.120> it's<00:07:46.300> plugged<00:07:46.570> it<00:07:46.720> what<00:07:47.410> we<00:07:47.500> have

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:47.590 
that's it it's plugged it what we have

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.050 
that's it it's plugged it what we have
to<00:07:47.680> do<00:07:47.800> is<00:07:47.830> make<00:07:48.070> sure<00:07:48.099> you<00:07:48.310> know<00:07:48.430> what<00:07:48.639> port<00:07:48.940> is

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:49.060 
to do is make sure you know what port is

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.360 
to do is make sure you know what port is
connected<00:07:49.180> to<00:07:49.919> so<00:07:50.919> when<00:07:51.039> you<00:07:51.160> start

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:51.370 
connected to so when you start

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.279 
connected to so when you start
programming<00:07:52.000> with<00:07:52.120> it<00:07:52.270> you<00:07:52.750> know<00:07:52.960> that<00:07:53.139> this

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:53.289 
programming with it you know that this

00:07:53.289 --> 00:07:55.260 
programming with it you know that this
is<00:07:53.500> the<00:07:53.650> rotation<00:07:54.310> sensor<00:07:54.669> and<00:07:54.880> how<00:07:54.970> to<00:07:55.030> read

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:55.270 
is the rotation sensor and how to read

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.170 
is the rotation sensor and how to read
it<00:07:55.419> okay<00:07:56.260> we'll<00:07:56.740> also<00:07:56.860> show<00:07:57.220> some<00:07:57.460> readouts<00:07:57.910> of

00:07:58.170 --> 00:07:58.180 
it okay we'll also show some readouts of

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.200 
it okay we'll also show some readouts of
this<00:07:59.110> rotation<00:07:59.500> sensor<00:07:59.860> with<00:08:00.789> each<00:08:01.000> one<00:08:01.180> of

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:01.210 
this rotation sensor with each one of

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.750 
this rotation sensor with each one of
its<00:08:01.389> experiments<00:08:01.960> on<00:08:02.139> here<00:08:02.800> so<00:08:03.010> we<00:08:03.160> know<00:08:03.310> what

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:03.760 
its experiments on here so we know what

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.600 
its experiments on here so we know what
in<00:08:03.970> fact<00:08:04.120> it<00:08:04.419> is<00:08:04.570> doing<00:08:05.099> that<00:08:06.099> concludes<00:08:06.490> this

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:06.610 
in fact it is doing that concludes this

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.300 
in fact it is doing that concludes this
introduction<00:08:07.030> to<00:08:07.330> the<00:08:07.510> electronic<00:08:08.380> brick

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:09.310 
introduction to the electronic brick
