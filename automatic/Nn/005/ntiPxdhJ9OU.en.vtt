00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.660
 Joins me I 'm around too 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.360
 today a little child comparison 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.480
 between the samsung galaxy note 8 den 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.910
 apple ipad mini and google nexus 7 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.039
 I have now on all three devices 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.330
 there are two installed first of all 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.640
 Of course we close the whole 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.140
 applications that run in the background 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.609
 I have, of course, before that 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.250
 but I can do that again 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.390
 here briefly demonstrate that no 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.640
 complaints in the comments 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.320
 show up as you can all see 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.550
 Applications in the background are included 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.350
 all devices are closed 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.200
 as that means you can download the app now 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.300
 actually already start as 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.100
 Next we can get the exact one 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.280
 hardware from the individual devices yet 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.620
 So look at the Samsung Galaxy 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.980
 note 8 we have as operating system 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.760
 Android 4.1 became point 2 as a processor 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.270
 now to rm 1 6 gigahertz processor 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.640
 installed 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.789
 and who with two gigabytes of ram to 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.750
 available with the apple ipad mini so as 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.689
 operating system ios 6.1 point 3 and here 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.630
 is an apple a5 processor with 1 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.549
 gigahertz trend and as ram we have 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.450
 half a gigabyte available 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:21.710
 last but not least the nexus 7 here 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:24.390
 operating system has 24.2.2011 video library 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.360
 1.3 gigahertz processor installed 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.619
 and who with 4 1 gb ram available too 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.530
 Let's try all three 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.040
 equipment in vain so synchronously possible 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.040
 perform 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.830
 I guess that far so synchronously 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.080
 otherwise we have to do it now 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.210
 wait and see which of these three devices 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.620
 now the highest score reached 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.600
 it does not matter now how 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.610
 quickly the process is over but 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.040
 the score you reach at the end 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.500
 We could post the comments 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.970
 what your favorite of these three tablets 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.190
 here is or 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.110
 which you own if so, too 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.270
 have these three should can you 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.980
 also like to do the gp2 test 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.050
 and the score he achieved 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.360
 just post in the comments 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.030
 so that you can see if it's big 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.710
 difference is 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.830
 otherwise the samsung galaxy is now 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:23.640
 Note 8 First, the doctor finished 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:25.560
 the score of 2118 the score 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.340
 time now just how good the individual 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.590
 Processes can be carried out so 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.990
 how fast the performance of that 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.000
 whole is like the memory 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.390
 speed of the device is and so 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.910
 continue 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.420
 and as I said the more points you have 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.790
 the better the tablet or the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.920
 smartphone and second, was now the 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:52.500
 google next 7 to the end 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:56.700
 the score of 1448 and too good 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.530
 last to the ipad mini with 758 process 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.590
 that according to the song human second 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.390
 of course then the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.340
 It is best of these three tablets 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.590
 maybe that's what it's all about 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.090
 is just the latest is currently and 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.850
 that's why the better 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.940
 hardware otherwise has the google 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:18.510
 nexus 7 second and then up 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.770
 place three still has the ipad mini if 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.880
 has you the video like I would 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.600

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.370
 looking forward 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.340
