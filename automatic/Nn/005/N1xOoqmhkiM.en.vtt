once<00:00:01.829> we've<00:00:02.010> made<00:00:02.040> sure<00:00:02.659> batteries<00:00:03.659> are<00:00:03.840> in

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
once we've made sure batteries are in

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:05.749 
once we've made sure batteries are in
our<00:00:04.080> weather<00:00:04.230> radio<00:00:04.650> and<00:00:05.100> we<00:00:05.250> have<00:00:05.400> a<00:00:05.430> power

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
our weather radio and we have a power

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.639 
our weather radio and we have a power
supply<00:00:06.270> for<00:00:06.330> it<00:00:06.750> so<00:00:06.960> that<00:00:07.109> it's<00:00:07.259> going<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.529> be

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
supply for it so that it's going to be

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.310 
supply for it so that it's going to be
on<00:00:07.799> all<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:08.370> time<00:00:08.420> on<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.690> side<00:00:09.900> there's<00:00:10.170> the

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
on all the time on the side there's the

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.230 
on all the time on the side there's the
switch<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.830> turn<00:00:10.980> it<00:00:11.040> off<00:00:11.340> er<00:00:11.370> on<00:00:11.730> that's<00:00:12.059> for

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
switch to turn it off er on that's for

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.730 
switch to turn it off er on that's for
the<00:00:12.330> weather<00:00:12.509> radio<00:00:12.809> operation<00:00:13.380> we<00:00:13.500> want<00:00:13.679> to

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
the weather radio operation we want to

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.499 
the weather radio operation we want to
make<00:00:13.830> sure<00:00:13.980> that's<00:00:14.190> turned<00:00:14.580> on<00:00:14.790> then<00:00:15.330> there

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
make sure that's turned on then there

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.660 
make sure that's turned on then there
are<00:00:15.630> two<00:00:15.839> steps<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.440> setting<00:00:17.039> weather<00:00:17.340> radio

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
are two steps to setting weather radio

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.760 
are two steps to setting weather radio
up<00:00:17.850> so<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.570> will<00:00:18.690> get<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.109> alerts<00:00:19.439> for

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
up so that it will get the alerts for

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.340 
up so that it will get the alerts for
your<00:00:20.039> County<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.789> sound<00:00:21.119> them<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:22.140> first

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
your County and sound them the first

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.200 
your County and sound them the first
step<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:23.010> need<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.279> set<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.609> channel<00:00:24.090> would

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
step is we need to set the channel would

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.060 
step is we need to set the channel would
be<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.480> channel<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.140> closest

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
be the channel of the closest

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.019 
be the channel of the closest
transmitter<00:00:27.410> to<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.439> location<00:00:29.130> you're<00:00:29.250> in<00:00:29.310> to

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
transmitter to the location you're in to

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.519 
transmitter to the location you're in to
make<00:00:30.179> sure<00:00:30.210> you're<00:00:30.480> getting<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.810> good<00:00:31.050> strong

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
make sure you're getting a good strong

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.130 
make sure you're getting a good strong
radio<00:00:32.040> signal<00:00:32.520> coming<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.690> make<00:00:33.809> sure<00:00:33.989> you

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
radio signal coming in to make sure you

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.080 
radio signal coming in to make sure you
get<00:00:34.320> all<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.649> those<00:00:34.800> advisories<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
get all of those advisories and the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.299 
get all of those advisories and the
other<00:00:36.300> step<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.140> set<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.620> same<00:00:37.890> code

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
other step is to set the same code

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.670 
other step is to set the same code
that's<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.030> county<00:00:39.480> code<00:00:39.780> applied<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.379> every

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
that's a county code applied to every

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.979 
that's a county code applied to every
county<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.280> United<00:00:41.760> States<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.840> the

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
county in the United States so the

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.889 
county in the United States so the
advisories<00:00:43.829> issued<00:00:44.100> for<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.760> County<00:00:45.180> will

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
advisories issued for that County will

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.600 
advisories issued for that County will
set<00:00:46.170> off<00:00:46.289> your<00:00:46.320> radio<00:00:47.010> if<00:00:47.219> they're<00:00:47.370> set<00:00:47.579> for

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
set off your radio if they're set for

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.520 
set off your radio if they're set for
every<00:00:48.180> County<00:00:48.539> then<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.780> goes<00:00:48.899> off<00:00:49.079> all<00:00:49.289> night

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
every County then it goes off all night

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.959 
every County then it goes off all night
long<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.370> next<00:00:50.579> thing<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.820> know<00:00:50.910> you

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
long and the next thing you know you

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.580 
long and the next thing you know you
don't<00:00:51.210> want<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.629> weather<00:00:51.840> radio<00:00:52.230> anymore

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
don't want this weather radio anymore

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.010 
don't want this weather radio anymore
you<00:00:53.219> need<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.579> set<00:00:53.820> for<00:00:54.000> just<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.360> one<00:00:54.570> County

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.240 
up or down whatever we need to do to
cycle<00:01:39.780> through<00:01:39.810> we<00:01:40.470> want<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.740> cycle<00:01:41.130> them

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
cycle through we want to cycle them

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.179 
cycle through we want to cycle them
until<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.729> reads<00:01:41.939> Channel<00:01:42.770> now<00:01:43.770> we're<00:01:44.070> at<00:01:44.130> a

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
until it reads Channel now we're at a

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.600 
until it reads Channel now we're at a
point<00:01:44.399> where<00:01:44.759> when<00:01:44.939> we<00:01:45.090> hit<00:01:45.270> select

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
point where when we hit select

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.160 
point where when we hit select
now<00:01:47.610> we're<00:01:47.880> cycling

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
now we're cycling

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.020 
now we're cycling
the<00:01:50.170> static<00:01:50.650> it<00:01:50.770> means<00:01:50.950> we're<00:01:51.130> not<00:01:51.159> picking<00:01:51.790> up

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
the static it means we're not picking up

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.010 
the static it means we're not picking up
a<00:01:52.180> signal

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.859 

so<00:01:56.530> what<00:01:57.070> we<00:01:57.220> want<00:01:57.430> to<00:01:57.460> do<00:01:57.610> now<00:01:57.790> is<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.390> up<00:01:58.570> and

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
so what we want to do now is the up and

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.319 
so what we want to do now is the up and
down<00:01:59.079> arrows<00:01:59.649> will<00:01:59.920> cyclist<00:02:00.399> cyclist<00:02:01.060> through

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
down arrows will cyclist cyclist through

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.120 
down arrows will cyclist cyclist through
all<00:02:01.600> of<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.899> options<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:04.000> cycle<00:02:04.509> is

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
all of the options so the cycle is

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.010 
all of the options so the cycle is
eventually<00:02:06.130> it<00:02:06.580> will<00:02:06.759> hit<00:02:06.970> the<00:02:07.020> closest

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
eventually it will hit the closest

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.850 
eventually it will hit the closest
broadcast<00:02:08.759> transmission<00:02:09.759> and<00:02:09.970> at<00:02:10.959> this<00:02:11.560> point

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
broadcast transmission and at this point

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.470 
broadcast transmission and at this point
we<00:02:11.980> can<00:02:12.130> stop<00:02:12.400> because<00:02:12.880> we've<00:02:13.090> hit<00:02:13.360> the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
we can stop because we've hit the
