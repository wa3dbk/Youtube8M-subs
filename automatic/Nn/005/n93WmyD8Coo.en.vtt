00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:11.110
 This is my first time with the demo of kings. 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.739
 three of these 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:16.339
 has a face that does not know if the total demand made available by the 5th in a 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:17.060
 game 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.999
 of rest in you and 3d light commercials are gonçalo knowing this game 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:23.800
 let the cross 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.329
 Did I have the game? 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:27.199
 even how was going there? 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.039
 the first screen the drawing shows only the title of the blog that we have both the 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:31.710
 siege 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.710
 begins 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.160
 so let's see how it's a short demo 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.160
 you do a lot of this rosset this move 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.940
 and how is the setting of the game really? 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.990
 already starts here 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.010
 here below shows you rustock not remembering that this space here looks at 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.230
 Do you see the camera the rapporteur? 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.230
 Do you see the camera? 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.200
 and everything else 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.550
 but let's go 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.560
 take chances with a shot in the mouth only of beijing coin the white order that the mine 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.830
 it's the first person 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.800
 and for joy 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.800
 finite arno 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.480
 and here it shows an interesting thing right? 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.010
 the pressure on the rails this guy right there 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.010
 Do not tell who it is. 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.150
 however these guys with 3ds for me are great dilma 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:22.319
 the paraná 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.319
 What name? 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:38.839
 the tre-pa 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.749
 in the mussel area take position 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:51.319
 He opal and left. 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.319
 if your way home 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:59.139
 the guy passed straight israel 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.499
 but that requires simão 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:06.499
 if they are not extreme 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.609
 Never 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:54.669
 he has someone pass after 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:02.039
 r 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.829
 I think it's neither 

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:14.869
 both still 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:19.999
 Let's taste in the car and now 

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:22.620
 I think I'll have to go there, right? 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.620
 and there is no neymar back 

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:36.559
 at one point 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:44.689
 remembering that these animals are very high 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:57.409
 it's not a raft to trade ammo diu 

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:06.520
 6 6 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.529
 I do not fear simple biting 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:11.800
 and it shows how the game is 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.529
 I hope you enjoyed 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:17.529
 I like it, I'm waiting for the final version of this game and what I promise 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:19.229
 it promises much worse 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:23.219
 after this animation zinha what happens again is kim 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:26.599
 back to the game's home screen and here starts from cycles all over again 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:27.900
 It's not if you can 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.229
 I enjoyed that dry period greeting cards to listen to the best use of the game 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.120
 No, it's good, thanks again, people. Thanks.
