00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.230
 my collection and overall that can happen to for a break the losc prepares 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.530
 but we have to get there 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.039
 the king of pop 

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:10.999
 pursuit 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:12.779

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.819
 the plata 

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:16.900
 that's what libya did 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.900
 this places 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:24.630
 for the lessor 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.539
 here are three bells 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.610
 it is on his return to form to maintain afp 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.520
 if you are alone then 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.340
 and then the hole is forbidden 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.520
 so that's it for what it is 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.790
 with their breath all that for the game of petanque 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.990
 an expert who stops the heart 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.990
 so after for the calibration you what are the rights 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.050
 lapointe stall 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.050
 withdrawn 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.050
 ap here is the attendant 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.810
 for the great athletes 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.670
 I make the poet or was expensive 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.760
 scala 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.420
 we talk about the environment 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.090
 in the sides 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.090
 martin 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.590
 for the period 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.590
 no need to be afraid 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.740
 everything is going better 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.350
 sacred 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.350
 abdelhak 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.100
 no 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.100
 gates believe 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.500
 so that of a pen stroke 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.500
 at the end of this tax over the bumper 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.320
 here is a little bit of money 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.320
 you have to make reports 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.910
 here 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.740
 indeed 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.350
 and after 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.350
 you can already roofs a polar shape 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.049
 there they died 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.369
 without vote 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:41.369
 without calling 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:07.979
 so that's pursuit 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.979
 for rubbish goods 

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:16.339
 it is wood that is well 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:28.479
 that promises 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.489
 this 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:40.699
 the two seconds it would be rather for the round of 16 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:44.529
 the painting 

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:56.279
 at least they do not show up right away 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.109
 Why 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.269

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.360
 the conveyor 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.150
 It is a very good thing 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.150

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.900
 why four ecocentres of contact 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.430
 still a little snowshoeing there 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:21.689
 ingenious despite everything there is a small 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.430
 Pollution 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.699
 I have to go back to the coal 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.479
