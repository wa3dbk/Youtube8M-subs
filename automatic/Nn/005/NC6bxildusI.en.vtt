i<00:00:15.990> am<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.800> cell<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.550> all<00:00:17.820> know<00:00:18.029> your<00:00:18.270> body<00:00:18.510> is

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
i am a cell you all know your body is

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.380 
i am a cell you all know your body is
made<00:00:18.990> up<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.380> cells<00:00:19.650> humans<00:00:20.550> animals<00:00:20.850> and

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
made up of cells humans animals and

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.080 
made up of cells humans animals and
plants<00:00:21.869> are<00:00:21.960> all<00:00:22.199> made<00:00:22.529> up<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.890> cells<00:00:23.130> we<00:00:23.880> can

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
plants are all made up of cells we can

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.620 
plants are all made up of cells we can
only<00:00:24.269> be<00:00:24.510> seen<00:00:24.810> under<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:25.199> microscope<00:00:25.310> ah<00:00:26.630> so

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
only be seen under a microscope ah so

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.230 
only be seen under a microscope ah so
you<00:00:27.720> want<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:27.990> know<00:00:28.109> how<00:00:28.260> we<00:00:28.320> form<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.830> body<00:00:29.240> many

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
you want to know how we form a body many

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.240 
you want to know how we form a body many
of<00:00:30.449> us<00:00:30.599> join<00:00:30.900> together<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.560> form<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.949> tissue

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
of us join together to form a tissue

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.000 
of us join together to form a tissue
then<00:00:33.059> tissues<00:00:33.750> joined<00:00:34.110> together<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.559> make<00:00:34.710> an

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
then tissues joined together to make an

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.850 
then tissues joined together to make an
organ<00:00:35.520> after<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.540> organs<00:00:37.200> joined<00:00:37.590> together

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
organ after that organs joined together

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.180 
organ after that organs joined together
to<00:00:38.340> form<00:00:38.610> an<00:00:38.760> organ<00:00:38.820> system<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:40.020> all<00:00:40.590> organ

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
to form an organ system and all organ

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.110 
to form an organ system and all organ
systems<00:00:41.760> combine<00:00:42.239> together<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.989> form<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.440> body

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
systems combine together to form a body

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.729 
systems combine together to form a body
so<00:00:45.120> now<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.360> know<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:46.050> we<00:00:46.260> are<00:00:46.289> very

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
so now you know that we are very

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.430 
so now you know that we are very
important<00:00:47.579> now<00:00:48.300> let<00:00:48.510> me<00:00:48.629> tell<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.870> about<00:00:49.110> my

transport<00:02:14.290> of<00:02:14.379> material<00:02:14.950> within<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.459> cell

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
transport of material within the cell

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.539 
transport of material within the cell
and<00:02:16.000> often<00:02:16.629> between<00:02:17.019> the<00:02:17.230> cells<00:02:17.500> they<00:02:18.040> connect

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
and often between the cells they connect

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.550 
and often between the cells they connect
different<00:02:18.760> parts<00:02:19.030> of<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.540> cell<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.019> help

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
different parts of the cell and help

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.089 
different parts of the cell and help
them<00:02:20.799> to<00:02:20.980> exchange<00:02:21.549> material<00:02:22.500> now<00:02:23.500> let's<00:02:23.860> talk

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
them to exchange material now let's talk

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.550 
them to exchange material now let's talk

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
about the powerhouse of the cell these

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.729 
about the powerhouse of the cell these
organelles<00:02:27.129> are<00:02:27.459> called<00:02:28.079> mitochondria<00:02:29.079> these

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
organelles are called mitochondria these

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.670 
organelles are called mitochondria these
are<00:02:30.010> small<00:02:30.430> rod-shaped<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.780> are<00:02:32.140> found<00:02:32.349> in

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
are small rod-shaped and are found in

membranes<00:03:34.379> so<00:03:35.379> guys<00:03:35.680> you<00:03:36.129> saw<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.400> important

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
membranes so guys you saw the important

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.009 
membranes so guys you saw the important
parts<00:03:37.329> of<00:03:37.449> my<00:03:37.569> body

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
parts of my body

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.159 
parts of my body
oh<00:03:38.250> one<00:03:39.250> more<00:03:39.459> important<00:03:39.909> part<00:03:40.209> do<00:03:40.840> you<00:03:40.930> see

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
oh one more important part do you see

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.009 
oh one more important part do you see
these<00:03:41.319> black<00:03:41.680> dots<00:03:41.739> on<00:03:42.280> my<00:03:42.430> body

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
these black dots on my body

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.800 
these black dots on my body
aha<00:03:44.049> yes<00:03:44.709> you<00:03:45.010> can<00:03:45.190> see<00:03:45.430> these<00:03:45.639> these<00:03:46.599> are

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
aha yes you can see these these are

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.559 
aha yes you can see these these are
called<00:03:47.109> ribosomes<00:03:48.040> either<00:03:48.940> they<00:03:49.269> float

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
called ribosomes either they float

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.349 
called ribosomes either they float
freely<00:03:49.930> in<00:03:50.260> cytoplasm<00:03:50.979> or<00:03:51.549> they<00:03:51.790> are<00:03:51.940> attached

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
freely in cytoplasm or they are attached

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.930 
freely in cytoplasm or they are attached
to<00:03:52.569> the<00:03:52.810> surface<00:03:53.290> of<00:03:53.470> endoplasmic<00:03:53.940> reticulum

to the surface of endoplasmic reticulum

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.629 
to the surface of endoplasmic reticulum
these<00:03:55.690> are<00:03:55.900> involved<00:03:56.379> in<00:03:56.470> making<00:03:56.680> proteins<00:03:57.400> in

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
these are involved in making proteins in

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.990 
these are involved in making proteins in
the<00:03:57.729> cell<00:03:58.139> so<00:03:59.139> guys<00:03:59.409> it's<00:03:59.769> time<00:04:00.069> to<00:04:00.250> go<00:04:00.430> my

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000
