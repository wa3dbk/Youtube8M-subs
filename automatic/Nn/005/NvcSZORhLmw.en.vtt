there's<00:00:20.369> another<00:00:20.640> aspect<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.360> support<00:00:21.779> and

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
there's another aspect of support and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.429 
there's another aspect of support and
that's<00:00:23.220> what<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.669> do<00:00:23.970> with<00:00:24.480> your<00:00:24.750> hand<00:00:25.110> and

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
that's what you do with your hand and

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.850 
that's what you do with your hand and
fingers<00:00:25.890> when<00:00:26.579> they<00:00:26.669> make<00:00:26.849> contact<00:00:27.180> with<00:00:28.169> the

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
fingers when they make contact with the

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.130 
fingers when they make contact with the
keys<00:00:30.559> now<00:00:31.559> there<00:00:31.710> are<00:00:31.829> four<00:00:32.279> key<00:00:33.050> elements<00:00:34.050> you

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
keys now there are four key elements you

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.580 
keys now there are four key elements you
need<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.500> understand<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.550> order<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.840> integrate

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
need to understand in order to integrate

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.000 
need to understand in order to integrate
that<00:00:38.399> proper<00:00:39.000> hand<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.480> finger<00:00:39.809> support<00:00:40.230> into

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
that proper hand and finger support into

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.979 
that proper hand and finger support into
playing<00:00:41.340> let's<00:00:42.239> take<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> look

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.069 

number<00:00:45.989> one<00:00:46.219> you<00:00:47.219> need<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:47.999> enough<00:00:48.539> support

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
number one you need just enough support

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.579 
number one you need just enough support
in<00:00:49.350> your<00:00:49.559> wrists<00:00:49.949> and<00:00:50.249> knuckles<00:00:50.899> to<00:00:51.899> get<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:52.589 
in your wrists and knuckles to get the

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:58.819 
in your wrists and knuckles to get the
keys<00:00:52.859> down<00:00:56.690> any<00:00:57.690> less<00:00:57.929> than<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.649> you're

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
keys down any less than that and you're

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.319 
keys down any less than that and you're
gonna<00:00:58.949> collapse<00:01:01.339> any<00:01:02.339> more<00:01:02.699> than<00:01:02.909> that<00:01:03.089> and

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
gonna collapse any more than that and

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:11.350 
gonna collapse any more than that and
you're<00:01:03.569> working<00:01:04.080> harder<00:01:04.530> than<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.739> need<00:01:05.010> to

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.530 

number<00:01:12.360> two<00:01:13.040> once<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.220> key<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.610> down<00:01:17.540> don't

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
number two once the key is down don't

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.359 
number two once the key is down don't
keep<00:01:19.469> pushing<00:01:21.049> right<00:01:22.049> now<00:01:22.890> what<00:01:23.159> does<00:01:23.310> that

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
keep pushing right now what does that

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.600 
keep pushing right now what does that
have<00:01:23.759> no<00:01:24.180> effect<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.899> the<00:01:25.049> sound<00:01:25.520> but<00:01:26.520> it

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
have no effect on the sound but it

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.389 
have no effect on the sound but it
creates<00:01:27.030> an<00:01:27.149> awful<00:01:27.899> lot<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.229> tension<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.100> it's

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
creates an awful lot of tension and it's

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.870 
creates an awful lot of tension and it's
just<00:01:29.759> gonna<00:01:29.969> wear<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.840> out<00:01:31.039> unnecessarily

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.529 

number<00:01:35.880> three<00:01:36.829> there<00:01:37.829> are<00:01:37.950> two<00:01:38.250> basic<00:01:39.210> ways<00:01:39.240> to

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
number three there are two basic ways to

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.990 
number three there are two basic ways to
build<00:01:40.079> support<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:41.009> your<00:01:41.159> hand<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.759> your

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
build support in your hand and your

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.029 
build support in your hand and your
fingers<00:01:42.030> when<00:01:42.719> you're<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:42.960> contact<00:01:43.259> with<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
fingers when you're in contact with the

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.230 
fingers when you're in contact with the
keys<00:01:44.689> the<00:01:45.689> first<00:01:46.049> way<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.649> by<00:01:46.950> relying<00:01:47.789> mostly

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
keys the first way is by relying mostly

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.910 
keys the first way is by relying mostly
on<00:01:48.539> your<00:01:48.750> bones<00:01:49.759> to<00:01:50.759> carry<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.210> load<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.920> the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
on your bones to carry the load and the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.490 
on your bones to carry the load and the
second<00:01:53.460> way<00:01:53.609> is<00:01:53.969> to<00:01:54.090> rely<00:01:54.600> mostly<00:01:54.899> on<00:01:55.229> your

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
second way is to rely mostly on your

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.120 
second way is to rely mostly on your
muscles<00:01:56.659> to<00:01:57.659> carry<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.990> load<00:01:58.170> let's<00:01:58.859> take<00:01:59.100> a

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
muscles to carry the load let's take a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.620 
muscles to carry the load let's take a
look<00:01:59.369> at<00:01:59.460> both<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.700> those<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.329> extreme<00:02:01.109> cases

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
look at both of those in extreme cases

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.050 
look at both of those in extreme cases
let's<00:02:03.630> go<00:02:03.810> ahead<00:02:03.929> and<00:02:04.890> take<00:02:05.130> your<00:02:05.280> pinky<00:02:05.789> and

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
let's go ahead and take your pinky and

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.480 
let's go ahead and take your pinky and
just<00:02:07.020> kind<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.380> let's<00:02:07.560> shoot<00:02:07.890> straight<00:02:08.369> out

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
just kind of let's shoot straight out

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.270 
just kind of let's shoot straight out
from<00:02:09.030> your<00:02:09.149> arm<00:02:09.390> here<00:02:09.660> now<00:02:10.470> let's<00:02:10.710> play<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.070> note

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
from your arm here now let's play a note

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:20.190 
from your arm here now let's play a note
with<00:02:11.490> that<00:02:11.700> see<00:02:12.270> what<00:02:12.390> happens

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.350 

and<00:02:21.200> it's<00:02:21.770> none<00:02:22.100> of<00:02:22.130> a<00:02:22.310> gun<00:02:22.520> if<00:02:22.700> you're<00:02:22.880> like<00:02:23.060> me

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
and it's none of a gun if you're like me

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.780 
and it's none of a gun if you're like me
you<00:02:23.840> can<00:02:23.990> realize<00:02:24.350> quickly<00:02:24.590> this<00:02:24.980> is<00:02:25.160> not<00:02:25.520> a

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
you can realize quickly this is not a

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.580 
you can realize quickly this is not a
way<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.120> play<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.600> piano<00:02:26.900> right<00:02:27.320> there's<00:02:27.530> just

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
way to play the piano right there's just

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.460 
way to play the piano right there's just
an<00:02:27.830> enormous<00:02:28.250> amount<00:02:28.700> of<00:02:29.030> tension<00:02:29.450> in<00:02:30.110> here

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
an enormous amount of tension in here

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.620 
an enormous amount of tension in here
that<00:02:31.250> just<00:02:31.430> shoot<00:02:31.700> straight<00:02:31.940> up<00:02:32.240> your<00:02:32.450> arm

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
that just shoot straight up your arm

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.830 
that just shoot straight up your arm
right<00:02:32.870> this<00:02:33.800> is<00:02:34.010> an<00:02:34.130> example<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.790> using<00:02:35.060> mostly

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
right this is an example of using mostly

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.030 
right this is an example of using mostly
our<00:02:36.200> muscles<00:02:36.800> clearly<00:02:37.670> not<00:02:37.850> a<00:02:38.090> way<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.900> play<00:02:39.110> so

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
our muscles clearly not a way to play so

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.240 
our muscles clearly not a way to play so
let's<00:02:40.190> shake<00:02:40.490> that<00:02:40.730> one<00:02:40.910> off<00:02:41.020> right<00:02:42.070> let's<00:02:43.070> try

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
let's shake that one off right let's try

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.600 
let's shake that one off right let's try
again<00:02:44.140> take<00:02:45.140> our<00:02:45.290> pinkie<00:02:45.710> now<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.430> let's

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
again take our pinkie now and let's

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.890 
again take our pinkie now and let's
point<00:02:47.420> it<00:02:47.510> straight<00:02:47.900> down<00:02:49.000> okay<00:02:50.000> let's<00:02:50.720> play

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
point it straight down okay let's play

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.480 
point it straight down okay let's play
that<00:02:51.140> same<00:02:51.470> note<00:02:51.710> again<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.190> see<00:02:52.340> what

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
that same note again and see what

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:59.370 
that same note again and see what
happens

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.570 

now<00:03:00.380> if<00:03:00.440> you're<00:03:00.620> like<00:03:00.770> me<00:03:00.830> this<00:03:01.250> feels

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
now if you're like me this feels

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.540 
now if you're like me this feels
remarkably<00:03:02.150> easy<00:03:02.810> but<00:03:03.440> surprisingly<00:03:04.250> easy

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
remarkably easy but surprisingly easy

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.140 
remarkably easy but surprisingly easy
right<00:03:05.890> there's<00:03:06.890> very<00:03:07.220> little<00:03:07.400> tension<00:03:07.730> going

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
right there's very little tension going

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.420 
right there's very little tension going
up<00:03:08.420> your<00:03:08.600> arm<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.320> reason<00:03:09.800> for<00:03:09.830> this<00:03:10.190> is

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
up your arm and the reason for this is

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.240 
up your arm and the reason for this is
that<00:03:10.460> most<00:03:11.150> of<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.510> load<00:03:11.750> here<00:03:12.050> is<00:03:12.290> carried<00:03:12.920> by

for playing the piano but the message is

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.260 
for playing the piano but the message is
this<00:03:23.630> if<00:03:24.620> you<00:03:24.890> want<00:03:25.190> to<00:03:25.280> play<00:03:25.490> with<00:03:25.670> freedom

and ease what you want to do is you want

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.730 
and ease what you want to do is you want
to<00:03:29.810> carry<00:03:30.560> as<00:03:30.800> much<00:03:31.100> load<00:03:31.610> in<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.870> bones<00:03:33.200> of

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
to carry as much load in the bones of

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.449 
to carry as much load in the bones of
your<00:03:33.770> hands<00:03:34.160> and<00:03:34.430> fingers<00:03:34.850> as<00:03:36.310> opposed<00:03:37.310> to

your hands and fingers as opposed to

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
carrying the load in the muscles so you

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.040 
carrying the load in the muscles so you
wanna<00:03:40.070> carry<00:03:40.280> as<00:03:40.459> much<00:03:40.700> food<00:03:41.180> in<00:03:41.510> your<00:03:41.660> bones

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
wanna carry as much food in your bones

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.040 
wanna carry as much food in your bones
as<00:03:42.440> possible<00:03:43.209> right<00:03:44.209> in<00:03:44.450> reality<00:03:44.959> you're

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
as possible right in reality you're

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.210 
as possible right in reality you're
gonna<00:03:45.170> have<00:03:45.290> a<00:03:45.320> little<00:03:45.560> bit<00:03:45.650> of<00:03:45.740> bones<00:03:45.950> a

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
gonna have a little bit of bones a

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.220 
gonna have a little bit of bones a
little<00:03:46.820> bit<00:03:46.910> of<00:03:47.030> muscles<00:03:47.420> you<00:03:47.959> want<00:03:48.080> to

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
little bit of muscles you want to

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.280 
little bit of muscles you want to
maximize<00:03:48.800> the<00:03:49.010> bone<00:03:49.220> part<00:03:49.580> and<00:03:50.090> minimize<00:03:50.959> the

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
maximize the bone part and minimize the

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.680 
maximize the bone part and minimize the
muscle<00:03:51.709> part<00:03:51.980> so<00:03:52.760> it's<00:03:52.880> quite<00:03:52.970> an<00:03:53.120> experiment

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
muscle part so it's quite an experiment

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:54.760 
muscle part so it's quite an experiment
with<00:03:53.780> that<00:03:53.900> a<00:03:53.959> little<00:03:54.170> bit<00:03:54.260> right<00:03:54.410> let's<00:03:54.650> go

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
with that a little bit right let's go

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.680 
with that a little bit right let's go
ahead<00:03:57.340> between<00:03:58.340> these<00:03:58.459> extreme<00:03:58.880> cases<00:03:59.180> you

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
ahead between these extreme cases you

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:09.759 
ahead between these extreme cases you
find<00:04:00.050> it<00:04:07.480> not<00:04:08.480> much<00:04:08.690> of<00:04:08.720> a<00:04:08.900> divergence<00:04:09.530> here

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
find it not much of a divergence here

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.220 
find it not much of a divergence here
from<00:04:10.160> our<00:04:10.340> natural<00:04:11.030> starting<00:04:11.360> point<00:04:11.510> that<00:04:12.080> we

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
from our natural starting point that we

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:21.009 
from our natural starting point that we
call<00:04:12.440> fret<00:04:16.690> and<00:04:18.370> number<00:04:19.370> four<00:04:19.810> once<00:04:20.810> you've

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
call fret and number four once you've

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.910 
call fret and number four once you've
pressed<00:04:21.320> the<00:04:21.560> keys<00:04:21.799> down

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.910 

your<00:04:26.920> arm<00:04:27.340> can<00:04:28.270> be<00:04:28.389> supported<00:04:29.110> by<00:04:29.440> both<00:04:29.680> your

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
your arm can be supported by both your

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.400 
your arm can be supported by both your
shoulder<00:04:30.520> and<00:04:31.389> the<00:04:32.110> piano<00:04:32.440> at<00:04:32.920> the<00:04:32.980> same<00:04:33.220> time

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
shoulder and the piano at the same time

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.340 
shoulder and the piano at the same time
in<00:04:35.410> fact<00:04:35.770> if<00:04:35.950> your<00:04:36.100> arm<00:04:36.370> is<00:04:36.550> relaxed<00:04:37.330> and<00:04:37.570> you

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
in fact if your arm is relaxed and you

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.010 
in fact if your arm is relaxed and you
just<00:04:38.560> let<00:04:38.680> your<00:04:38.830> shoulder<00:04:39.280> go<00:04:39.630> and<00:04:40.630> if<00:04:40.840> you

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
just let your shoulder go and if you

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.650 
just let your shoulder go and if you
have<00:04:41.260> nice<00:04:41.860> solid<00:04:42.370> support<00:04:42.550> in<00:04:42.940> your<00:04:43.090> hand<00:04:43.360> and

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
have nice solid support in your hand and

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.110 
have nice solid support in your hand and
fingers<00:04:44.139> remember<00:04:44.740> based<00:04:45.040> mostly<00:04:45.580> I'm<00:04:45.700> using

your bones and not your muscles it's

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.510 
your bones and not your muscles it's
gonna<00:04:49.540> feel<00:04:49.990> like<00:04:50.200> most<00:04:50.620> of<00:04:50.919> the<00:04:51.010> arm<00:04:51.280> weight

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
gonna feel like most of the arm weight

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.550 
gonna feel like most of the arm weight
is<00:04:52.210> going<00:04:52.450> to<00:04:52.510> be<00:04:52.630> supported<00:04:53.230> from<00:04:53.410> your

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
it's a good portion of it it's going to

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.170 
it's a good portion of it it's going to
be<00:04:58.810> transmitted<00:04:59.710> through<00:05:00.340> your<00:05:00.580> fingertips
