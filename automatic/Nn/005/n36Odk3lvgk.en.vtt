 and arab paper about family photography i 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.300
 would like to meet with some 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.379
 relatives are sick and you have a photo 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.379
 your beautiful wife 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.540
 I'm leaving here 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.119
 I could not sleep I thought our things 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.490
 talk and I decided to dunk 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.799
 someone you probably now 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:31.820
 at home you sleep you do not care for the whole world 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:31.820
 just like steve who is now 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:45.649
 here steve say hello he is humble and 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.350
 doesn't like to chat do you see steve was so 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:51.740
 good to me that released me to walk 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:55.189
 on more he does not repeat such an error i 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:02:00.640
 convinced him first he was afraid that 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:00.640
 will lose his job but I think everything to him 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:14.410
 do you see life is short sometimes shorter 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:18.430
 sound and it's weird that people wonder 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:22.910
 when they find out they won't live forever 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.269
 because one day they will remember the old 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.650
 times looking in the mirror 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:35.480
 when they are on the verge of death or when 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:41.150
 stuck at work in an insane asylum and so 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.280
 every day every day I rolled here 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.280
 him a little 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.730
 you wanted to know where I am and steve 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.670
 will show you that a real corpse is not 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:59.359
 what you see in magazines or 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:01.609
 telly but what's up you will understand everything 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:04.389
 when you find steve on your table 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:09.079
 long before you watch this video 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:11.680
 this is my gift my thanks for 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.930
 treatment 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.290
 I would have packed it but I did not find 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:23.870
 big enough box you know when 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:27.190
 see steve without thinking about me think about 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.319
 that all mortals 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.660
 focus on what you love and not on 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:36.340
 that they make you love and 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:43.540
 live every day like it's the last 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:43.540
 because who knows suddenly it has reached 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.310
 there
