be<00:01:31.350> great<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:31.799> overall<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.670> do<00:01:32.759> think<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
be great but overall I do think the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.289 
be great but overall I do think the
value<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.350> an<00:01:34.470> American<00:01:34.829> education<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.729> very

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
value of an American education is very

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.420 
value of an American education is very
high<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:37.200> eventually<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:37.890> we've<00:01:38.100> we<00:01:38.280> talked

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
high you eventually like we've we talked

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.950 
high you eventually like we've we talked
about<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.759> lesson<00:01:39.090> 5<00:01:39.270> percent<00:01:39.600> unemployment

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
about the lesson 5 percent unemployment

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.410 
about the lesson 5 percent unemployment
rate<00:01:40.140> if<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.650> degree<00:01:41.250> uh<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.360> think

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
rate if you have a degree uh and I think

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.940 
rate if you have a degree uh and I think
that<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.899> that's<00:01:43.439> kind<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.680> speaks<00:01:43.890> for

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
that that that's kind of speaks for

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.539 
that that that's kind of speaks for
itself<00:01:44.189> do<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.909> think<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.560> would<00:01:46.560> say<00:01:46.890> uh<00:01:47.130> first

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
itself do you think I would say uh first

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.760 
itself do you think I would say uh first
off<00:01:47.729> if<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.960> were<00:01:49.049> being<00:01:49.290> brought<00:01:49.500> into<00:01:49.710> this

country to go to a for-profit college
don't<00:01:51.570> do<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.869> secondly<00:01:52.799> if<00:01:52.920> you're<00:01:53.070> doing<00:01:53.280> one

factory got in some trouble for that

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.609 
factory got in some trouble for that
because<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> lot<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.570> them<00:02:00.750> were<00:02:00.930> were<00:02:01.229> outside

because a lot of them were were outside
student<00:02:02.009> workers<00:02:02.310> they<00:02:02.790> always<00:02:03.090> end<00:02:03.360> up<00:02:03.450> being

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
student workers they always end up being

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.440 
student workers they always end up being
horrible<00:02:04.259> scams<00:02:04.560> don't<00:02:04.920> do<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.189> again<00:02:06.030> we

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
horrible scams don't do that again we

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.490 
horrible scams don't do that again we
don't<00:02:06.479> know<00:02:06.689> what<00:02:06.810> country<00:02:06.930> are<00:02:07.079> coming<00:02:07.259> from

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
don't know what country are coming from

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.559 
don't know what country are coming from
but<00:02:07.829> in<00:02:08.280> general<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.819> would<00:02:08.879> say<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.270> comes<00:02:09.450> out

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
but in general I would say it comes out

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.059 
but in general I would say it comes out
of<00:02:09.660> money<00:02:09.810> if<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:09.989> can<00:02:10.200> afford<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.739> I

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
of money if you can afford it I I

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.270 
of money if you can afford it I I
remember<00:02:11.870> one

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
remember one

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.180 
remember one
probably<00:02:13.700> not<00:02:13.820> but<00:02:14.420> in<00:02:14.780> it<00:02:15.020> if<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:15.410> come<00:02:15.740> to<00:02:15.920> an

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
probably not but in it if you come to an

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.890 
probably not but in it if you come to an
American<00:02:16.640> University<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.390> you<00:02:17.540> apply

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
American University and you apply

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.150 
American University and you apply
yourself<00:02:18.050> I<00:02:18.410> think<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.710> you<00:02:18.860> can<00:02:18.950> get<00:02:19.040> as

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
yourself I think that you can get as

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.380 
yourself I think that you can get as
good<00:02:19.190> an<00:02:19.400> education<00:02:19.490> as<00:02:19.880> you<00:02:19.910> can<00:02:20.120> anywhere

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
good an education as you can anywhere

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.570 
good an education as you can anywhere
else<00:02:20.540> in<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.690> world<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.200> I<00:02:21.380> would<00:02:22.160> have<00:02:22.430> to

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
else in the world and I would have to

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.640 
else in the world and I would have to
say<00:02:22.760> in<00:02:22.910> general<00:02:23.330> I<00:02:23.450> think<00:02:23.510> that<00:02:23.750> in<00:02:24.200> terms<00:02:24.560> of

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
say in general I think that in terms of

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.530 
say in general I think that in terms of
the<00:02:24.710> culture<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.340> experience<00:02:25.880> you'll<00:02:26.030> have<00:02:26.210> I

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
the culture the experience you'll have I

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.270 
the culture the experience you'll have I
think<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.260> lot<00:02:27.380> of<00:02:27.410> a<00:02:27.530> really<00:02:27.740> fun<00:02:27.770> lot<00:02:28.190> of

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
think a lot of a really fun lot of

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.430 
think a lot of a really fun lot of
people<00:02:28.490> have<00:02:28.610> fun<00:02:28.820> at<00:02:29.240> colleges<00:02:29.660> probably

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
people have fun at colleges probably

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.380 
people have fun at colleges probably
around<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.680> world<00:02:30.860> but<00:02:31.040> I<00:02:31.100> know<00:02:31.160> here<00:02:31.640> we<00:02:32.270> have

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
around the world but I know here we have

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.210 
around the world but I know here we have
a<00:02:32.420> good<00:02:32.540> drinking<00:02:32.840> culture<00:02:33.050> and<00:02:33.440> despite<00:02:34.070> what

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
a good drinking culture and despite what

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.620 
a good drinking culture and despite what
like<00:02:34.370> Germans<00:02:34.700> might<00:02:34.850> say<00:02:35.000> about<00:02:35.090> our<00:02:35.270> beer<00:02:35.480> uh

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
like Germans might say about our beer uh

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.690 
like Germans might say about our beer uh
so<00:02:36.320> for<00:02:36.770> those<00:02:36.860> reasons<00:02:37.010> I<00:02:37.370> would<00:02:37.490> consider

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
so for those reasons I would consider

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.070 
so for those reasons I would consider
coming<00:02:37.910> here<00:02:38.180> but<00:02:38.300> again<00:02:38.360> it<00:02:38.690> comes<00:02:38.840> down<00:02:38.959> to

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
coming here but again it comes down to

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.780 
coming here but again it comes down to
money<00:02:39.290> like<00:02:39.500> whether<00:02:39.680> either<00:02:40.250> can<00:02:40.400> afford<00:02:40.640> it

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
money like whether either can afford it

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.180 
money like whether either can afford it
you<00:02:40.940> can<00:02:41.000> honestly<00:02:41.830> regardless<00:02:42.830> of<00:02:42.980> where<00:02:43.100> you

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
you can honestly regardless of where you

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.320 
you can honestly regardless of where you
come<00:02:43.370> from<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:43.610> can<00:02:43.790> imagine<00:02:43.970> a<00:02:44.150> lot<00:02:44.240> of

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
come from I can imagine a lot of

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.510 
come from I can imagine a lot of
countries<00:02:44.690> where<00:02:44.870> it's<00:02:44.990> it's<00:02:45.380> more<00:02:46.280> expensive

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
countries where it's it's more expensive

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.000 
countries where it's it's more expensive
to<00:02:47.360> go<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.480> university<00:02:47.989> so<00:02:48.200> that's<00:02:48.770> what<00:02:48.980> I

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
to go to university so that's what I

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.590 
to go to university so that's what I
would<00:02:49.250> consider<00:02:49.430> when<00:02:49.940> when<00:02:50.209> thinking<00:02:50.480> about

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
would consider when when thinking about

00:02:50.600 --> 00:03:06.940 
would consider when when thinking about
whether<00:02:50.870> or<00:02:50.989> not

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950
