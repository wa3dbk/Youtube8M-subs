 I felt the battery is selling more 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.760

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.050

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.050

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.860
 visually that's it but it was more in the background 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.450

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.170
 adjustment program before 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.090

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.989
 only had to is and roni and ipad but now 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.660
 Google has purchased and made available

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.270

 So you can open a photo there? 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.650
 I'm going to take one and practically he 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:19.610
 vertical and horizontal work or you 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:22.640
 is vertical and you change the 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.549
 standard or for example even brightness 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.420
 environment contrast saturation 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.850
 Bank 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.979
 so on and horizontally you 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.990
 choose after you chose there, right? 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:39.420
 There you horizontal you make the change there 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.780
 of adjustment 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.630
 the lille there 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.100
