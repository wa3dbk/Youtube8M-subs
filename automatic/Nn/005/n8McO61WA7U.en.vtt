which is my damnation this is a band
that<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.610> sell<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> lot<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.210> my<00:00:42.360> store<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:43.200> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
that I sell a lot in my store in the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.139 
that I sell a lot in my store in the
metal<00:00:43.559> section<00:00:43.770> it's<00:00:44.070> one<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.430> we<00:00:44.550> are

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
metal section it's one that we are

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.080 
metal section it's one that we are
constantly<00:00:45.390> getting<00:00:45.930> new<00:00:46.079> copies<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.700> and

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
constantly getting new copies of in and

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.180 
constantly getting new copies of in and
I<00:00:48.780> think<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.260> partially<00:00:49.649> because<00:00:49.770> they

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
I think this is partially because they

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.010 
I think this is partially because they
are<00:00:50.309> all<00:00:50.460> very<00:00:50.640> affordably<00:00:51.149> priced<00:00:51.239> but<00:00:51.840> also

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
are all very affordably priced but also

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.959 
are all very affordably priced but also
because<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.739> band<00:00:52.980> does<00:00:53.190> have<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.730> terrific

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
because this band does have a terrific

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.389 
because this band does have a terrific
following<00:00:54.750> myself<00:00:55.350> personally<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.890> find<00:00:56.190> their

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
following myself personally I find their

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.930 
following myself personally I find their
stuff<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.760> be<00:00:56.850> pretty<00:00:57.090> good<00:00:57.390> however<00:00:58.320> I'm<00:00:58.940> kind

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
stuff to be pretty good however I'm kind

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.729 
stuff to be pretty good however I'm kind
of<00:01:00.090> biased<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.930> hoping<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.440> Jason

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
of biased in hoping that Jason

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.650 
of biased in hoping that Jason
Richardson<00:01:02.070> sort<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.489> takes<00:01:02.730> them<00:01:03.000> over<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
Richardson sort of takes them over the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.969 
Richardson sort of takes them over the
top<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.140> makes<00:01:04.320> them<00:01:04.530> into<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.970> just<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.060> musical

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
top and makes them into a just a musical

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.120 
top and makes them into a just a musical
dynamo<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.450> fantasticness<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:10.080> with<00:01:10.830> evolve

dynamo of fantasticness and with evolve

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.500 
dynamo of fantasticness and with evolve
we're<00:01:11.430> kind<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.760> getting<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.060> taste<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.450> what

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
we're kind of getting a taste of what

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.840 
we're kind of getting a taste of what
the<00:01:12.780> potential<00:01:13.229> isn't<00:01:13.439> with<00:01:14.369> Jason

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
the potential isn't with Jason

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.490 
the potential isn't with Jason

Lilith<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.770> had<00:01:26.009> reviewed<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.490> couple<00:01:27.000> of

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
Lilith that I had reviewed a couple of

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.020 
Lilith that I had reviewed a couple of
weeks<00:01:27.450> ago<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:28.020> noticed<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:29.640> was<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.850> pretty

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
weeks ago I noticed that it was a pretty

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.760 
weeks ago I noticed that it was a pretty
darn<00:01:30.299> good<00:01:30.360> song<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.470> there<00:01:31.650> was

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
darn good song and that there was

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.260 
darn good song and that there was
definitely<00:01:32.189> steps<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.880> right<00:01:33.060> direction

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
definitely steps in the right direction

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.060 
definitely steps in the right direction
musically<00:01:34.110> there<00:01:34.320> seemed<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.680> be<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> little

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
musically there seemed to be a little

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.920 
musically there seemed to be a little
bit<00:01:35.189> more<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.549> vastness<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.450> there<00:01:36.630> was<00:01:36.869> a

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
bit more of a vastness to it there was a

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.310 
bit more of a vastness to it there was a
lot<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.320> complexity<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.579> was<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.930> done<00:01:40.229> in

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
lot of complexity that was it done in

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.380 
lot of complexity that was it done in
layers<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.890> was<00:01:41.009> very<00:01:41.250> layered<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.909> that's

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
layers it was very layered and that's

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.440 
layers it was very layered and that's
what<00:01:42.780> made<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.200> track<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.460> dense<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.060> also

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
what made the track so so dense and also

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.569 
what made the track so so dense and also
the<00:01:45.600> fact<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.049> vocals<00:01:46.439> were<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> strength

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
the fact that the vocals were a strength

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.240 
the fact that the vocals were a strength
and<00:01:47.899> it<00:01:48.899> was<00:01:49.079> not<00:01:49.229> something<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.680> was<00:01:50.070> too

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
and it was not something that was too

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.460 
and it was not something that was too
unilateral<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.119> order<00:01:51.600> for<00:01:51.899> someone<00:01:52.290> to

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
unilateral in order for someone to

of<00:03:46.480> a<00:03:46.630> CD

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
of a CD

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.250 
of a CD
maybe<00:03:48.070> sparing<00:03:48.579> the<00:03:48.730> large<00:03:49.120> change<00:03:49.570> such<00:03:49.989> as<00:03:50.019> a

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
maybe sparing the large change such as a

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.840 
maybe sparing the large change such as a
Walmart<00:03:50.500> or<00:03:51.010> a<00:03:51.040> Target

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
Walmart or a Target

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.910 
Walmart or a Target
I<00:03:51.880> think<00:03:52.810> that<00:03:52.989> going<00:03:53.170> through<00:03:53.320> smaller

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
I think that going through smaller

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.050 
I think that going through smaller
smaller<00:03:54.489> brands<00:03:55.150> is<00:03:55.450> a<00:03:55.900> risky<00:03:56.530> move<00:03:56.739> is<00:03:57.700> a<00:03:57.760> nice

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
smaller brands is a risky move is a nice

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.699 
smaller brands is a risky move is a nice
partnership<00:03:58.390> to<00:03:58.750> have<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.170> perhaps<00:03:59.350> a<00:03:59.590> little

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
partnership to have and perhaps a little

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.410 
partnership to have and perhaps a little
bit<00:03:59.860> more<00:04:00.160> they<00:04:00.700> may<00:04:00.850> feel<00:04:01.030> a<00:04:01.060> little<00:04:01.209> bit<00:04:01.360> more

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
bit more they may feel a little bit more

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.560 
bit more they may feel a little bit more
