similar<00:02:53.150> but<00:02:53.269> it<00:02:53.420> has<00:02:53.510> now<00:02:53.660> she<00:02:53.720> got<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.049> world

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
similar but it has now she got the world

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.830 
similar but it has now she got the world
the<00:02:54.590> world<00:02:54.829> is<00:02:55.070> further<00:02:55.430> back<00:02:55.730> it's<00:02:56.600> further

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
the world is further back it's further

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.229 
the world is further back it's further
back<00:02:57.140> along<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.590> edge<00:02:57.709> here<00:02:58.160> what<00:02:58.910> you've<00:02:59.030> got

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
back along the edge here what you've got

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.810 
back along the edge here what you've got
on<00:02:59.420> here<00:02:59.690> on<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.079> bottom<00:03:00.260> side<00:03:00.739> is<00:03:01.070> you've<00:03:01.640> got

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
on here on the bottom side is you've got

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.319 
on here on the bottom side is you've got
this<00:03:01.970> spring<00:03:02.329> clip<00:03:02.690> that<00:03:03.109> holds<00:03:04.010> it<00:03:04.340> nuts<00:03:04.670> so

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
this spring clip that holds it nuts so

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.240 
this spring clip that holds it nuts so
this<00:03:06.109> plate<00:03:06.440> here<00:03:06.769> has<00:03:06.890> got<00:03:07.040> these<00:03:07.130> little

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
this plate here has got these little

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.060 
this plate here has got these little
spring<00:03:07.670> clips<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.390> that<00:03:09.049> effectively<00:03:09.650> forms

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
spring clips and that effectively forms

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.360 
spring clips and that effectively forms
the<00:03:10.220> captive<00:03:10.700> nut<00:03:10.880> so<00:03:11.450> take<00:03:11.930> those<00:03:12.140> two<00:03:12.500> are<00:03:12.680> so

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
the captive nut so take those two are so

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.539 
the captive nut so take those two are so
note<00:03:13.640> that<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:14.000> nuts<00:03:14.269> sit<00:03:14.630> on<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:14.959> lower<00:03:15.170> side

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
note that the nuts sit on the lower side

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.660 
note that the nuts sit on the lower side
and<00:03:16.549> the<00:03:16.640> spring<00:03:17.000> clips<00:03:17.269> on<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.630> top<00:03:18.549> so<00:03:19.549> we'll

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
and the spring clips on the top so we'll

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.630 
and the spring clips on the top so we'll
whip<00:03:19.880> those<00:03:20.090> two<00:03:20.450> off<00:03:20.630> okay<00:03:21.280> then<00:03:22.280> we'll<00:03:22.370> fit

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
whip those two off okay then we'll fit

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.310 
whip those two off okay then we'll fit
those<00:03:22.850> onto<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.359> new<00:03:23.570> bumper<00:03:24.730> so<00:03:26.079> again<00:03:27.079> so

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
those onto the new bumper so again so

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.710 
those onto the new bumper so again so
this<00:03:27.440> is<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.769> top<00:03:27.950> side<00:03:28.220> with<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:28.549> world<00:03:28.790> and

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
this is the top side with the world and

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.410 
this is the top side with the world and
then<00:03:30.319> this<00:03:30.470> is<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.709> bottom<00:03:31.010> side<00:03:31.299> where<00:03:32.299> you

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
then this is the bottom side where you

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.309 
then this is the bottom side where you
can<00:03:32.569> just<00:03:32.750> see<00:03:32.930> it<00:03:33.079> folded<00:03:33.590> there<00:03:34.569> wait<00:03:35.569> spring

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
can just see it folded there wait spring

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:37.350 
can just see it folded there wait spring
them<00:03:36.500> out

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
them out

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.920

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
just look down to check that the holes

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.060 
just look down to check that the holes
line<00:03:47.960> up<00:03:47.990> there<00:03:48.350> you<00:03:48.410> see<00:03:48.560> there's<00:03:48.710> plenty<00:03:49.010> of

so what you've actually got at the end
of<00:04:21.140> the<00:04:21.200> chassis<00:04:21.410> leg<00:04:21.769> where<00:04:21.950> the<00:04:22.040> bumper<00:04:22.460> goes

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
of the chassis leg where the bumper goes

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.580 
of the chassis leg where the bumper goes
you've<00:04:23.300> got<00:04:23.480> these<00:04:23.600> two<00:04:23.660> little<00:04:24.290> sort<00:04:24.530> of

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
turrets and the bolts if I grab a ball

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.040 
turrets and the bolts if I grab a ball
you'll<00:04:27.680> see<00:04:27.860> passes<00:04:28.280> all<00:04:28.430> the<00:04:28.550> way<00:04:28.670> down

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
you'll see passes all the way down

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.210 
you'll see passes all the way down
through<00:04:30.050> there<00:04:30.260> and<00:04:30.470> comes<00:04:30.740> out<00:04:30.920> the<00:04:31.070> bottom

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
through there and comes out the bottom

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.790 
through there and comes out the bottom
okay<00:04:31.840> so<00:04:32.840> obviously<00:04:32.900> it<00:04:33.170> passes<00:04:33.590> straight

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
okay so obviously it passes straight

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.170 
okay so obviously it passes straight
through<00:04:33.920> but<00:04:34.220> you<00:04:34.280> can<00:04:34.400> see<00:04:34.580> how<00:04:34.700> strong<00:04:34.760> that

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
through but you can see how strong that

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.160
