side<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.489> best<00:00:32.669> thing<00:00:32.880> about<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.149> team

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
side and the best thing about this team

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.970 
side and the best thing about this team
is<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.780> can<00:00:34.020> just<00:00:34.170> change<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.590> few<00:00:34.770> players

around if you don't like them so I

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.970 
around if you don't like them so I
thought<00:00:36.540> I'd<00:00:36.840> do<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> video<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:37.800> let's

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
thought I'd do a video on it so let's

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.770 
thought I'd do a video on it so let's
get<00:00:38.129> through<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:39.059> team<00:00:39.300> we've<00:00:39.480> got<00:00:39.510> before

and<00:00:39.960> goal<00:00:40.230> right<00:00:40.739> back<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.250> had<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.820> red<00:00:42.120> card

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450

issue<00:00:42.750> because<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.500> game<00:00:43.680> was<00:00:43.710> just<00:00:43.920> lagging

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
issue because the game was just lagging

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.639

like<00:00:44.550> every<00:00:45.090> single<00:00:45.360> game<00:00:45.539> was<00:00:46.079> pretty<00:00:46.289> bad<00:00:46.620> i

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
like every single game was pretty bad i

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.319
