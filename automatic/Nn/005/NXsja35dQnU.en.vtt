check out all of this now here is the

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:39.679 
check out all of this now here is the
machine<00:03:24.360> oh<00:03:27.740> there<00:03:28.740> goes<00:03:28.980> nothing

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:39.689 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:44.129 

the<00:03:40.689> black<00:03:40.959> box<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:42.099> new<00:03:42.340> hotness<00:03:42.730> I<00:03:43.299> actually

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
the black box the new hotness I actually

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.039 
the black box the new hotness I actually
kind<00:03:44.469> of<00:03:44.499> like<00:03:44.650> these<00:03:44.829> diagonal<00:03:45.749> designs<00:03:46.749> on

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
kind of like these diagonal designs on

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.309 
kind of like these diagonal designs on
here<00:03:47.290> I've<00:03:47.560> got<00:03:47.799> that<00:03:48.040> on<00:03:48.069> on<00:03:48.939> the<00:03:48.999> top<00:03:49.329> and

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
here I've got that on on the top and

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.929 
here I've got that on on the top and
also<00:03:50.469> on<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.829> side<00:03:50.980> I<00:03:51.010> think<00:03:51.219> the<00:03:51.340> thing<00:03:51.579> looks

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:51.939 
also on the side I think the thing looks

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:56.129 
also on the side I think the thing looks
better<00:03:52.299> in<00:03:52.569> general<00:03:53.579> in<00:03:54.689> person<00:03:55.689> than<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:55.989> did

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
better in general in person than it did

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.629 
better in general in person than it did
in<00:03:56.290> pictures<00:03:56.909> look<00:03:57.909> at<00:03:58.030> it<00:03:58.180> from<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.420> side

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
in pictures look at it from the side

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.770 
in pictures look at it from the side
there's<00:04:00.639> a<00:04:00.730> look<00:04:00.819> at<00:04:00.969> it<00:04:01.090> from<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.359> back<00:04:01.569> I

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
there's a look at it from the back I

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.569 
there's a look at it from the back I
don't<00:04:01.959> know<00:04:02.049> if<00:04:02.169> that<00:04:02.349> there's<00:04:02.919> a<00:04:02.980> code<00:04:03.340> back

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
don't know if that there's a code back

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.240 
don't know if that there's a code back
here<00:04:03.879> I<00:04:03.909> don't<00:04:03.969> know<00:04:04.150> if<00:04:04.269> that<00:04:04.450> is<00:04:04.859> tied<00:04:05.859> to<00:04:05.889> the

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
here I don't know if that is tied to the

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.129 
here I don't know if that is tied to the
specific<00:04:06.400> console<00:04:07.329> so<00:04:07.510> I'm<00:04:07.569> not<00:04:07.689> gonna<00:04:07.870> share

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
specific console so I'm not gonna share

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.429 
specific console so I'm not gonna share
that<00:04:08.409> but<00:04:08.650> look<00:04:09.459> at<00:04:09.579> all<00:04:09.669> the<00:04:09.969> the<00:04:10.870> inputs<00:04:11.319> and

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 
that but look at all the the inputs and

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:14.220 
that but look at all the the inputs and
outputs<00:04:11.560> on<00:04:12.129> the<00:04:12.189> back<00:04:12.699> everything's<00:04:13.449> clean

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
outputs on the back everything's clean

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.400 
outputs on the back everything's clean
and<00:04:14.500> and<00:04:14.879> not<00:04:15.879> very<00:04:16.120> modern-looking<00:04:16.690> actually

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
and and not very modern-looking actually

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.499 
and and not very modern-looking actually
it<00:04:17.530> looks<00:04:17.680> like<00:04:17.829> it<00:04:18.519> looks<00:04:18.639> like<00:04:18.759> a<00:04:18.849> step<00:04:19.209> back

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:19.509 
it looks like it looks like a step back

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.770 
it looks like it looks like a step back
in<00:04:20.099> design<00:04:21.099> which<00:04:21.400> I<00:04:21.699> don't<00:04:22.060> know<00:04:22.210> maybe<00:04:22.599> that

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
in design which I don't know maybe that

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.540 
in design which I don't know maybe that
could<00:04:22.930> actually<00:04:23.050> be<00:04:23.229> a<00:04:23.410> good<00:04:23.949> thing<00:04:24.009> things

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
could actually be a good thing things

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.760 
could actually be a good thing things
have<00:04:24.669> gotten<00:04:24.940> too<00:04:25.120> complicated<00:04:25.360> in<00:04:26.199> more

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
have gotten too complicated in more

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.100 
have gotten too complicated in more
recent<00:04:26.979> times<00:04:27.340> but<00:04:28.030> one<00:04:28.449> thing<00:04:28.690> I<00:04:28.750> do<00:04:28.810> want<00:04:29.080> to

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
recent times but one thing I do want to

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.409 
recent times but one thing I do want to
note<00:04:29.349> is<00:04:29.530> that<00:04:29.560> this<00:04:29.860> has<00:04:30.039> a<00:04:30.070> nice<00:04:30.460> texture<00:04:31.389> to

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
note is that this has a nice texture to

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.200 
note is that this has a nice texture to
it<00:04:31.630> it's<00:04:31.900> actually<00:04:32.050> a<00:04:32.289> textured<00:04:32.800> feel<00:04:33.210> over

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
it it's actually a textured feel over

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.480 
it it's actually a textured feel over
