00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
syncopated beat that isn't so much about

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.019 
syncopated beat that isn't so much about
what<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.830> all<00:00:17.010> together<00:00:17.460> it's<00:00:17.699> more<00:00:17.760> about

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029
