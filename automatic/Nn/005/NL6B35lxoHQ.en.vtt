 Welcome to the channel dedicated to the world 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.280
 apple today we are going to teach you two 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.970
 ways to uninstall applications 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.730
 uninstall phone apps 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.530
 iphone is very easy but before 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.929
 we invite you to subscribe down there 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.119

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.279
 Your subscription is completely free and 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.260
 in that way be aware of our 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.380
 videos and can you give us questions 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.689
 comments or suggestions 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.329
 to uninstall applications there are two 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.400
 forms the first is obviously the 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.769
 we can do from directly from 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.510
 the screen and the only thing that we have to 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:37.399
 to do is to leave the sunken button on 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.079
 the application that we would like to eliminate 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.019
 for example I'm going to eliminate that is 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.809
 that is called light recorder I leave the 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.760
 sunken button with the sunken finger on 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.850
 the application immediately starts 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.769
 to dance and I do not know if they will notice that there are 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.379
 applications that have an X over 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.089
 and others that do not have an X 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.040
 above are applications that can be 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.629
 erase are applications that we 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.600
 we have installed and those that are not 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.059
 applications that come with the phone 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.830
 then I will delete this law click 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.689
 about the X, he immediately tells me 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.450
 Here he asks me what I want 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.280
 eliminate I give it away and so on 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.170
 easy we can do with all the 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.260
 applications that are currently 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.900
 dancing so easy and simple 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.430
 and the other way is to do it by adjustments 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.800
 then after we do this 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.900
 procedure on the screen we give 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.190
 click here 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.490
 leaving to dance and so they stayed 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:36.270
 now let's go for adjustments we make 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.240
 here adjustments we are going to general we look for the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.860
 option that is called accused here is not going 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.110
 to basically show the space 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.720
 available that I have the space in use and 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.390
 I'm going to the applications that I have in 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.270
 the store does the phone and here 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.770
 we can also delete applications 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.250
 let's find all that we have here 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:00.950
 the moment let's say we want to erase 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:06.650
 let's delete one that we downloaded recently 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:08.479
 know which which which which one to erase 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.900
 is 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.519
 until there is more gps data 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.069
 we select this and here I get the 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.989
 option to delete the application I give 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.060
 click on delete the application below me 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.700
 ask again and eliminate the 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.459
 application and this is simple and we erase 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.260
 another application basically that was all 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.480
