not letting your buck creek backwards on

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.090 
not letting your buck creek backwards on
the<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:28.140> takes<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.560> stress<00:01:28.890> off<00:01:29.040> your

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
the that takes the stress off your

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.740 
the that takes the stress off your
hamstring<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.030> really<00:01:30.240> making<00:01:30.659> the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
hamstring so just really making the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.440 
hamstring so just really making the
descent<00:01:31.200> slow<00:01:31.850> tensing<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.970> hamstring<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
descent slow tensing the hamstring the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.149 
descent slow tensing the hamstring the
entire<00:01:33.720> way<00:01:33.930> down<00:01:34.229> pulling<00:01:34.770> up<00:01:34.920> with<00:01:35.040> your

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
entire way down pulling up with your

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.830 
entire way down pulling up with your
hamstring<00:01:35.670> keeping<00:01:36.030> your<00:01:36.119> pelvis<00:01:36.450> for<00:01:36.689> the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
hamstring keeping your pelvis for the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.289 
hamstring keeping your pelvis for the
whole<00:01:36.960> time<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.350> not<00:01:37.670> taking<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.909> shift<00:01:39.210> to

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
whole time and not taking the shift to

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.109 
whole time and not taking the shift to
your<00:01:39.420> hips<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.869> your<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.740> guess<00:01:41.430> letting<00:01:42.000> glue

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
your hips and your I guess letting glue

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.130 
your hips and your I guess letting glue
take<00:01:42.360> over<00:01:42.600> as<00:01:42.689> well<00:01:44.390> yeah<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.420> think<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.960> key

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
take over as well yeah I think the key

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.960 
take over as well yeah I think the key
is<00:01:46.170> with<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.649> movement<00:01:46.860> like<00:01:47.369> max<00:01:47.579> said<00:01:47.670> is

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
is with that movement like max said is

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.800 
is with that movement like max said is
keeping<00:01:48.420> your<00:01:48.509> glutes<00:01:48.689> out<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.079> because

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
keeping your glutes out of it because

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.270 
keeping your glutes out of it because
and<00:01:51.810> not<00:01:51.930> trying<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.590> tear<00:01:52.740> your<00:01:52.829> hamstring

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
and not trying to tear your hamstring

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.450 
and not trying to tear your hamstring
from<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.610> bone<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.780> that's<00:01:55.770> why<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.009> stick<00:01:56.310> is

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
from the bone so that's why the stick is

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.450 
from the bone so that's why the stick is
evolved<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.689> next<00:01:57.990> exercise<00:01:58.710> we<00:01:58.860> did<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.189> try

definitely those are the triceps or we

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.280 
definitely those are the triceps or we
