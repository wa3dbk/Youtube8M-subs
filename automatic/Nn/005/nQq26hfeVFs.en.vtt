00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
characters or as an English we have a

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.990 
characters or as an English we have a

relatively small defined set of

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
characters but the words tend to be

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.410 
characters but the words tend to be
longer<00:01:05.250> because<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.700> takes<00:01:05.820> more<00:01:06.000> characters

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
longer because it takes more characters

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.990 
longer because it takes more characters
to<00:01:06.510> express<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.260> thought<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:08.189> gave<00:01:08.340> us<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> space

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
to express a thought it gave us a space

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.140 
to express a thought it gave us a space
of<00:01:09.030> 38<00:01:09.720> k<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.290> actually<00:01:10.830> put<00:01:11.159> all<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.729> text<00:01:12.030> for

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
of 38 k to actually put all the text for

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.300 
of 38 k to actually put all the text for
a<00:01:12.180> particular<00:01:12.270> section<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> game<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.530> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
a particular section of the game and the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.060 
a particular section of the game and the
English<00:01:14.520> text<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.360> get<00:01:15.720> up<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.990> 72<00:01:16.470> k<00:01:16.650> in<00:01:16.799> size

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
English text can get up to 72 k in size

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.219 
English text can get up to 72 k in size
so<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.850> had<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.000> write<00:01:18.150> data<00:01:18.450> compression<00:01:18.840> to

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
so I had to write data compression to

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.920 
so I had to write data compression to
squish<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.799> text<00:01:20.159> down<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.299> actually<00:01:21.570> fit

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
squish that text down so it actually fit

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.630 
squish that text down so it actually fit
in<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> memory<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.950> that's<00:01:23.130> been<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.460> major

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
in the memory and that's been a major

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.920 
in the memory and that's been a major
battle<00:01:23.939> for<00:01:24.299> me

we<00:02:47.800> were<00:02:47.950> filming<00:02:48.190> something<00:02:48.610> that<00:02:48.910> was

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
we were filming something that was

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.729 
we were filming something that was
supposed<00:02:49.239> to<00:02:49.269> be<00:02:49.360> choking<00:02:49.959> or<00:02:50.080> coughing<00:02:50.590> on

supposed to be choking or coughing on

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.440 
supposed to be choking or coughing on
something<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.400> we<00:02:51.880> came<00:02:52.060> up<00:02:52.090> with<00:02:52.330> this

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
something and we came up with this

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.800 
something and we came up with this
wonderful<00:02:52.690> idea<00:02:53.290> that<00:02:53.560> milk<00:02:54.360> would<00:02:55.360> do<00:02:55.630> the

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
wonderful idea that milk would do the

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.130 
wonderful idea that milk would do the
trick<00:02:55.840> and

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
trick and

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.930 
trick and
I<00:02:57.200> think<00:02:57.590> that<00:02:57.650> I<00:02:57.770> must<00:02:58.100> have<00:02:58.250> found<00:02:58.490> something

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
I think that I must have found something

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.030 
I think that I must have found something
like<00:02:59.210> a<00:02:59.240> gallon<00:02:59.540> a<00:02:59.750> half<00:03:00.080> of<00:03:00.350> milk<00:03:00.650> while<00:03:00.920> I'm

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
like a gallon a half of milk while I'm

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.670 
like a gallon a half of milk while I'm

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
trying to hack up all this sputum and

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.410 
trying to hack up all this sputum and
all<00:03:03.800> this<00:03:03.950> flam<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.610> all<00:03:04.670> this<00:03:04.850> stuff<00:03:05.030> that

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
all this flam and all this stuff that

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.970 
all this flam and all this stuff that
would<00:03:05.540> make<00:03:05.720> it<00:03:05.900> sound<00:03:06.459> perfect<00:03:08.800> that<00:03:09.800> was<00:03:09.950> a

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
would make it sound perfect that was a

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.400 
would make it sound perfect that was a
little<00:03:10.220> sick<00:03:10.370> after<00:03:10.760> that<00:03:10.910> you<00:03:11.660> come<00:03:11.930> in<00:03:12.140> and

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
all because a lot of times you have to

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.970 
all because a lot of times you have to
match<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:17.120> video<00:03:17.450> you<00:03:17.870> have<00:03:17.900> to<00:03:18.200> lip-sync<00:03:18.890> it

a lot of time that you have because the

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.360 
a lot of time that you have because the

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
in this nice big cave and so that lends

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
when we get done with it you believe

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.480 
when we get done with it you believe
that<00:05:30.450> is<00:05:30.630> the<00:05:30.690> Dragons<00:05:31.320> voice<00:05:31.500> in<00:05:32.160> case<00:05:32.310> of

line so I have to hand it to him for
that<00:06:46.469> for<00:06:46.919> being<00:06:47.159> so<00:06:47.399> patient<00:06:47.669> one<00:06:48.329> of<00:06:48.419> the

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 
that for being so patient one of the

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:50.659 
that for being so patient one of the
lines<00:06:48.719> happen<00:06:49.049> to<00:06:49.109> be<00:06:49.229> a<00:06:49.259> screaming<00:06:49.889> part<00:06:50.519> and

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:50.669 
lines happen to be a screaming part and

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:53.329 
lines happen to be a screaming part and
we<00:06:50.759> did<00:06:50.939> that<00:06:51.499> too<00:06:52.499> many<00:06:52.589> times<00:06:52.739> for<00:06:53.009> my<00:06:53.219> own

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:53.339 
we did that too many times for my own

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:54.529 
we did that too many times for my own
good<00:06:53.369> I<00:06:53.609> think<00:06:53.729> we<00:06:53.939> had<00:06:54.059> to<00:06:54.149> wait<00:06:54.299> a<00:06:54.329> while

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:54.539 
good I think we had to wait a while

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.569 
good I think we had to wait a while
because<00:06:54.719> my<00:06:54.929> voice<00:06:55.049> kind<00:06:55.379> of<00:06:55.439> went<00:06:55.589> away<00:06:55.679> we

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:56.579 
because my voice kind of went away we

00:06:56.579 --> 00:06:58.279 
because my voice kind of went away we
may<00:06:56.729> have<00:06:56.879> two<00:06:57.059> three<00:06:57.299> four<00:06:57.539> cakes<00:06:57.809> of<00:06:58.139> a

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:58.289 
may have two three four cakes of a

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:01.729 
may have two three four cakes of a
particular<00:06:58.559> line<00:06:58.889> and<00:06:59.249> then<00:07:00.349> usually<00:07:01.349> Victor
