00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
let's let's take a look at the pedal

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.420 
let's let's take a look at the pedal
it's<00:00:45.090> pretty<00:00:45.570> simple<00:00:45.870> operation<00:00:46.590> here<00:00:46.860> one

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
it's pretty simple operation here one

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.360 
it's pretty simple operation here one
knob<00:00:47.700> one<00:00:48.360> switch<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:50.370> rude<00:00:50.550> bomb<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.590> a<00:00:52.590> it's

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
knob one switch the rude bomb is a it's

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.330 
knob one switch the rude bomb is a it's
got<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.579> lot<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.879> gain<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:54.960> if<00:00:55.710> we<00:00:56.010> let's

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
got a lot of gain to it so if we let's

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:05.870 
got a lot of gain to it so if we let's
start<00:00:56.610> right<00:00:56.730> here<00:00:56.789> at<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.180> lowest<00:00:57.510> setting

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.460 

you

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.890 

so<00:01:11.470> unity<00:01:11.830> is<00:01:12.040> right<00:01:12.310> there<00:01:12.520> about<00:01:12.900> roughly

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
so unity is right there about roughly

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:23.090 
so unity is right there about roughly
five<00:01:14.260> percent<00:01:14.710> up<00:01:14.890> on<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.340> knob

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:39.240 

me

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.500
