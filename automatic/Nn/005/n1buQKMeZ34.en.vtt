00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:15.449 
my finished out helmet that I made I had

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.590 
my finished out helmet that I made I had
finished<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.049> while<00:00:16.199> ago<00:00:16.940> but<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.180> screwed<00:00:18.510> up

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
finished it a while ago but I screwed up

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.500 
finished it a while ago but I screwed up
on<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.810> paint<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.320> rankled<00:00:20.150> so<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.180> had<00:00:21.390> to

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
on the paint and rankled so I had to

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.950 
on the paint and rankled so I had to
wait<00:00:21.690> a<00:00:21.810> while<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.320> then<00:00:23.330> real<00:00:24.330> wet<00:00:24.480> sanded

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
wait a while and then real wet sanded

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:52.219 
wait a while and then real wet sanded
and<00:00:24.990> painted<00:00:25.170> again<00:00:30.140> and<00:00:49.850> this<00:00:50.850> was<00:00:51.449> pretty

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:52.229 
and painted again and this was pretty

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:54.860 
and painted again and this was pretty
hard<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.949> make<00:00:53.100> what<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.429> did<00:00:53.760> was<00:00:53.999> I<00:00:54.210> put<00:00:54.539> a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
hard to make what I did was I put a

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.689 
hard to make what I did was I put a
thick<00:00:55.289> layer<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.589> bondo<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> top<00:00:56.489> right

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
thick layer of bondo on the top right

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.090 
thick layer of bondo on the top right
there<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:57.989> had<00:00:58.139> cut<00:00:58.379> out<00:00:58.409> this<00:00:59.039> shape

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
there and then I had cut out this shape

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.950 
there and then I had cut out this shape
already<00:00:59.760> in<00:00:59.879> cardboard<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.629> pressed<00:01:00.839> it

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
already in cardboard I just pressed it

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.460 
already in cardboard I just pressed it
down<00:01:01.019> and<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.039> same<00:01:02.190> with<00:01:02.339> that<00:01:02.489> little<00:01:02.699> one

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
down and the same with that little one

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.760 
down and the same with that little one
and<00:01:04.470> then<00:01:05.630> let<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> bondo<00:01:07.110> started<00:01:07.440> to<00:01:07.500> harden

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
and then let the bondo started to harden

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.679 
and then let the bondo started to harden
a<00:01:07.829> little<00:01:08.039> bit<00:01:08.689> that<00:01:09.689> works<00:01:09.869> very<00:01:10.049> well<00:01:11.689> for

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
a little bit that works very well for

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.380 
a little bit that works very well for
the<00:01:13.229> bumps<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.649> you<00:01:14.159> see<00:01:14.399> on<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.670> back<00:01:14.850> here

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the bumps that you see on the back here

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.700 
the bumps that you see on the back here
I<00:01:16.430> used<00:01:17.430> popsicle<00:01:18.149> sticks<00:01:18.390> what<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.899> did<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.289> I<00:01:19.439> I

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
I used popsicle sticks what I did is I I

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.130 
I used popsicle sticks what I did is I I
would<00:01:20.430> put<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.850> put<00:01:20.969> some<00:01:21.390> bondo<00:01:21.689> down<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.079> I

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
would put I put some bondo down and I

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.590 
would put I put some bondo down and I
would<00:01:22.320> just<00:01:22.500> stuck<00:01:22.710> them<00:01:22.859> on<00:01:22.950> there<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.850> then

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
would just stuck them on there and then

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.429 
would just stuck them on there and then
I<00:01:24.659> put<00:01:24.899> some<00:01:24.930> more<00:01:25.109> Bonneau<00:01:25.590> around<00:01:25.829> the<00:01:25.920> edges

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
I put some more Bonneau around the edges

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:34.550 
I put some more Bonneau around the edges
that's<00:01:28.439> why<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:29.070> grate<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.640> little<00:01:29.850> corners

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.710 

and<00:01:35.160> right<00:01:35.670> there<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.880> can<00:01:36.180> see<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.420> have<00:01:36.660> a

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
and right there you can see I have a

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.400 
and right there you can see I have a
crack<00:01:38.120> and<00:01:39.120> right<00:01:39.330> there<00:01:39.510> that's<00:01:39.720> where<00:01:40.020> the

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.940 

when<00:01:43.410> I<00:01:43.440> said<00:01:43.800> it<00:01:44.250> came<00:01:44.760> through<00:01:45.830> through<00:01:46.830> the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
when I said it came through through the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.570 
when I said it came through through the
resin<00:01:47.400> and<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.480> I<00:01:48.870> didn't<00:01:49.830> get<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> chance<00:01:50.250> to

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
resin and so I didn't get a chance to

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.840 
resin and so I didn't get a chance to
put<00:01:50.880> some<00:01:50.910> bondo<00:01:51.480> there<00:01:52.520> because<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.580> kind<00:01:53.820> of

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
put some bondo there because I kind of

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.990 
put some bondo there because I kind of
just<00:01:54.060> wanted<00:01:54.480> to<00:01:54.570> get<00:01:54.690> done<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.140> know<00:01:55.260> I<00:01:55.290> don't
