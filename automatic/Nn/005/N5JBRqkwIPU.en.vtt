now<00:00:47.660> where<00:00:48.660> do<00:00:48.720> you<00:00:48.750> think<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:49.080> came<00:00:49.290> from

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
now where do you think this came from

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.510 
now where do you think this came from
right<00:00:50.880> now<00:00:51.200> so<00:00:52.200> we're<00:00:52.500> making<00:00:52.800> little<00:00:53.070> pumpkin

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
from France the name of this isn't you

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.350 
from France the name of this isn't you
see<00:01:03.840> difference<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.460> means<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.880> music

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
see difference and that means the music

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.530 
see difference and that means the music
of<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.930> lot<00:01:07.200> math<00:01:08.130> if<00:01:08.579> it<00:01:08.759> calls<00:01:08.970> for<00:01:09.149> one<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.509> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
of a lot math if it calls for one and a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.359 
of a lot math if it calls for one and a
half<00:01:09.570> cups<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:10.200> cooked<00:01:10.380> pumpkin<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.040> we're

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
half cups of cooked pumpkin and we're

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.710 
half cups of cooked pumpkin and we're
doubling<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> recipe<00:01:11.939> than<00:01:12.270> how<00:01:12.390> much<00:01:12.540> do<00:01:12.690> we

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
doubling the recipe than how much do we

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.790 
doubling the recipe than how much do we
need<00:01:13.580> 330<00:01:14.580> science<00:01:15.270> man<00:01:15.690> that<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:15.870> a<00:01:16.020> wet<00:01:16.350> we've

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
need 330 science man that is a wet we've

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.380 
need 330 science man that is a wet we've
just<00:01:17.040> been<00:01:17.159> studying<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.610> yeah<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.150> ring

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
just been studying this yeah the ring

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.780 
just been studying this yeah the ring

one min so soon good and life we're also

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.440 
one min so soon good and life we're also
gonna<00:01:25.650> add<00:01:25.770> some<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.729> manure<00:01:27.000> from<00:01:27.240> that

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
gonna add some of the manure from that

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.580 
gonna add some of the manure from that
pile<00:01:27.690> over<00:01:27.720> there

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
pile over there

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.230 
pile over there
when<00:01:30.590> you<00:01:30.710> watch<00:01:30.920> these<00:01:31.190> kids<00:01:31.490> in<00:01:31.760> the<00:01:31.880> garden

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
when you watch these kids in the garden

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.750 
when you watch these kids in the garden
classes<00:01:32.750> you<00:01:32.930> see<00:01:33.170> that<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:33.890> teachers<00:01:34.370> just

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
classes you see that the teachers just

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.170 
classes you see that the teachers just
use<00:01:35.000> every<00:01:35.600> little<00:01:36.020> drop<00:01:36.560> of<00:01:36.680> water<00:01:37.160> or<00:01:37.580> do<00:01:37.880> and

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
use every little drop of water or do and

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.710 
use every little drop of water or do and
every<00:01:38.510> plant<00:01:38.930> and<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:39.500> every<00:01:40.310> every<00:01:41.000> bed<00:01:41.270> to

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
every plant and and every every bed to

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.990 
every plant and and every every bed to
to<00:01:42.110> teach<00:01:42.320> it<00:01:42.650> likes<00:01:42.950> each<00:01:43.160> other<00:01:43.460> cuz<00:01:43.820> it's

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
to teach it likes each other cuz it's

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.300 
to teach it likes each other cuz it's
attracted<00:01:44.690> surface<00:01:45.410> tension<00:01:45.890> look<00:01:46.220> at

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
attracted surface tension look at

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.400 
attracted surface tension look at
applaud<00:01:46.580> mantra<00:01:47.240> we've<00:01:47.750> been<00:01:47.900> studying<00:01:48.110> that

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
applaud mantra we've been studying that

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.920 
applaud mantra we've been studying that
water<00:01:48.710> molecules<00:01:49.430> have<00:01:49.910> a<00:01:50.300> special<00:01:50.690> bond<00:01:50.900> that

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
water molecules have a special bond that

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.590 
water molecules have a special bond that
creates<00:01:51.470> surface<00:01:51.920> tension<00:01:52.430> and<00:01:52.610> so<00:01:53.150> we've

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
creates surface tension and so we've

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.240 
creates surface tension and so we've
been<00:01:53.750> doing<00:01:54.140> a<00:01:54.230> series<00:01:54.500> of<00:01:54.530> experiments<00:01:55.190> in

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
been doing a series of experiments in

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.550 
been doing a series of experiments in
the<00:01:55.340> classroom<00:01:55.730> so<00:01:55.970> it's<00:01:56.090> nice<00:01:56.240> to<00:01:56.410> see<00:01:57.410> if<00:01:57.500> you

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
the classroom so it's nice to see if you

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.280 
the classroom so it's nice to see if you
can<00:01:57.710> play<00:01:57.890> with<00:01:58.070> it<00:01:58.250> someplace<00:01:58.760> else<00:01:59.240> it<00:02:00.020> seems

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
can play with it someplace else it seems

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.590 
can play with it someplace else it seems
effortless<00:02:00.500> but<00:02:01.280> it<00:02:01.490> isn't<00:02:01.670> it's<00:02:02.210> a<00:02:02.360> higher

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
effortless but it isn't it's a higher

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.320 
effortless but it isn't it's a higher
art<00:02:02.930> it's<00:02:03.260> it's<00:02:03.530> almost<00:02:03.860> like<00:02:04.160> an<00:02:04.610> artist<00:02:05.119> who

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
art it's it's almost like an artist who

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.750 
art it's it's almost like an artist who
is<00:02:05.450> a<00:02:05.479> master<00:02:05.900> violinist<00:02:06.800> it<00:02:07.070> takes<00:02:07.280> years<00:02:07.490> and

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
is a master violinist it takes years and

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.540 
is a master violinist it takes years and
years<00:02:07.850> of<00:02:08.060> practice<00:02:08.690> intercept<00:02:09.260> so<00:02:10.100> this<00:02:10.369> is

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
years of practice intercept so this is

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.070 
years of practice intercept so this is
where<00:02:10.760> we<00:02:10.970> come<00:02:11.209> in<00:02:11.270> with<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:11.720> Center<00:02:12.050> for

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
where we come in with the Center for

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.770 
where we come in with the Center for
equal<00:02:12.440> literacy<00:02:12.890> we<00:02:13.040> train<00:02:13.400> teachers<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:14.209> it
