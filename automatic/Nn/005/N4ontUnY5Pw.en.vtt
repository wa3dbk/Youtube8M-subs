00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
like the flash and they actually don't

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.490 
like the flash and they actually don't
just<00:03:04.760> affect<00:03:04.880> how<00:03:05.420> my<00:03:05.600> character<00:03:06.020> moves<00:03:06.230> about

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
in in the DC Universe I also will get

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.170 
in in the DC Universe I also will get
moves<00:03:09.710> based<00:03:10.220> on<00:03:10.460> those<00:03:10.580> movement<00:03:11.000> types

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
moves based on those movement types

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.510 
moves based on those movement types
later<00:03:11.480> in<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:11.720> game<00:03:11.980> my<00:03:12.980> character<00:03:13.250> actually

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
later in the game my character actually

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.960 
later in the game my character actually
uses<00:03:14.150> acrobatics<00:03:15.020> so<00:03:15.680> I<00:03:15.710> can<00:03:16.040> scale<00:03:16.280> walls<00:03:16.550> I

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
uses acrobatics so I can scale walls I

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
around all over the place and the final

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.560 
around all over the place and the final
choice<00:03:21.500> is<00:03:21.770> what<00:03:22.580> type<00:03:22.820> of<00:03:22.850> weapon<00:03:23.330> when<00:03:23.450> my
