thing about this is the quality of the

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.090 
thing about this is the quality of the
guides<00:01:07.060> all<00:01:07.960> cleaned<00:01:08.230> up<00:01:08.350> like<00:01:08.560> this<00:01:08.680> so<00:01:08.950> that

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
guides all cleaned up like this so that

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.550 
guides all cleaned up like this so that

they won't hook up on the right and the
fact<00:01:11.770> that<00:01:11.860> it's<00:01:12.130> seven<00:01:12.520> foot<00:01:12.700> two<00:01:12.940> means<00:01:13.570> it

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
fact that it's seven foot two means it

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.860

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.620 
the thing I love about this rocket so
light<00:02:03.409> and<00:02:03.740> secretive<00:02:04.220> really<00:02:04.970> easy<00:02:05.240> to<00:02:05.479> work

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
light and secretive really easy to work

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.900 
light and secretive really easy to work
and<00:02:06.140> in<00:02:06.320> so<00:02:06.560> many<00:02:06.680> instances<00:02:06.920> we<00:02:07.430> need<00:02:07.610> to<00:02:07.729> get

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
and in so many instances we need to get

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.090 
and in so many instances we need to get
good<00:02:08.330> distance<00:02:08.780> because<00:02:09.590> of<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.860> high

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
good distance because of the high

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.310 
good distance because of the high
quality<00:02:10.160> Japanese<00:02:11.060> graphite<00:02:11.480> this<00:02:12.020> thing

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
quality Japanese graphite this thing

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.040 
quality Japanese graphite this thing
really<00:02:12.860> casts<00:02:13.520> covers<00:02:13.970> more<00:02:14.180> water<00:02:14.420> if<00:02:14.870> it's

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
really casts covers more water if it's

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.140 
really casts covers more water if it's
windy<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:15.650> goes<00:02:15.890> better<00:02:16.190> he<00:02:16.520> does<00:02:16.730> catch<00:02:16.940> more

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
windy it goes better he does catch more

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.970 
windy it goes better he does catch more
fish<00:02:17.390> what<00:02:17.900> else<00:02:18.080> would<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:18.290> want

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
fish what else would you want
