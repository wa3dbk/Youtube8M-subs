00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.939
 how are you doing, I am Carlos Miller today 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.770
 we do carlo cocina from carlo cocina 

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:08.020
 gourmet market today we are going to do 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:12.480
 a very special very fresh preparation 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.480
 very crispy based on petals of dram 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.390
 we have here the copihue petals that 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.850
 they have sent us from the region of the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.100
 araucanÃ­a to do this preparation 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.690
 notice that the petals of this flower are 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.940
 totally and absolutely edible and 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.489
 have a texture as if they were a 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.590
 envy look how they sound they are good 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.330
 crispies last a long time in the 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.580
 refrigerator so it can be a very 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.199
 good alternative are not so common 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.180
 get them but today there is no 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.650
 entrepreneurship called health for v 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.900
 double uve point number l points so that 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.809
 see and there you can get these 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.659
 spectacular petals and let's go with 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.610
 them an Asian technique that is very 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.920
 fresh very rich markets today 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.650
 Chinese can get rice leaves 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.260
 without any problem and everything they have 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.200
 what to do is to moisturize them and 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.320
 getting in cold water there until 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.600
 remain totally and absolutely flexible 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.120
 there when I am already slightly flexible 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.729
 they put it on the counter and for this it is 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.550
 very simple to have seasonal vegetables 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.550
 a little celery comes in handy 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.350
 some carrots all cut out of it 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.470
 long of course they have been methodical in 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.160
 that's a bit of cucumber 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.160
 petals 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.470
 with two is enough you can put 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:48.790
 melissa or a mint leaf 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.790
 we assume there on average 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.110
 always bend one end 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.549
 and let them be patient and 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.100
 go hydrating from one because if not 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.929
 tends to break a lot this mass is going 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.210
 doing with patience with a kind of 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.700
 rolled spring and let's make a 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.489
 sauce 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.129
 that I recommend you to put a little touch 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.709
 of sesame oil wants to give a taste 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.540
 Very good and very Asian vinegar 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.170
 rice 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:24.590
 it's me 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.210
 green chili is quite a bit of 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.550
 ciboulette 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.410
 pretty chive 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.240
 we have the sauce ready and now that 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.180
 after a few minutes we took a good 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.959
 sharp knife 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.959
 and can cut 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.240
 as possible nice added the sauce 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.930
 a little corner and what they have to do 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:03:00.330
 the guests is the and some minutes and 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.330
 after eating here in Carlos III
