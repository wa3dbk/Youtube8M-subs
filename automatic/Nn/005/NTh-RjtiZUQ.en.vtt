tool you know you know just the snow's
dumping<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.920> know<00:01:35.009> every<00:01:35.220> time<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.490> open

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
Alice in Chains or The Melvins

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.730 
Alice in Chains or The Melvins
I<00:01:44.490> listen<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> lot<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.390> grunge<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.079> it

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
I listen to a lot of grunge and it

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.060 
I listen to a lot of grunge and it
probably<00:01:47.159> partly<00:01:47.909> comes<00:01:48.240> from<00:01:48.649> just<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.829> little

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
probably partly comes from just a little

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.440 
probably partly comes from just a little
bit<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.280> local<00:01:50.579> Pacific<00:01:51.390> Northwest<00:01:51.780> pride<00:01:52.079> but

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
bit of local Pacific Northwest pride but

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.600 
bit of local Pacific Northwest pride but
I<00:01:53.480> think<00:01:54.290> it's<00:01:54.410> quite<00:01:54.890> fitting<00:01:55.190> when<00:01:55.490> you're

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
I think it's quite fitting when you're

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.490 
I think it's quite fitting when you're
going<00:01:55.790> up<00:01:55.910> climbing<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:56.480> horrendous<00:01:57.350> weather

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
going up climbing and horrendous weather

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.830 
going up climbing and horrendous weather
to<00:01:57.890> listen<00:01:58.850> to<00:01:58.940> this<00:01:59.030> music<00:01:59.480> that<00:01:59.660> was

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
to listen to this music that was

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.130 
to listen to this music that was
inspired<00:02:00.260> by<00:02:00.410> this<00:02:00.560> horrendous<00:02:00.950> weather<00:02:01.250> is

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.660 

this<00:02:06.140> year<00:02:06.350> in<00:02:06.440> Patagonia<00:02:06.980> whether<00:02:07.280> windows

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
this year in Patagonia whether windows

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.270 
this year in Patagonia whether windows
were<00:02:07.910> sparse<00:02:08.420> but<00:02:08.720> Colin<00:02:09.080> still<00:02:09.440> meant<00:02:09.800> to

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
were sparse but Colin still meant to

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.000 
were sparse but Colin still meant to
take<00:02:10.460> advantage<00:02:10.940> of<00:02:11.030> sunshine<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:12.080> solo<00:02:12.380> EMA

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
take advantage of sunshine to solo EMA

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.780 
take advantage of sunshine to solo EMA
animals<00:02:13.940> I<00:02:15.130> always<00:02:16.130> thought<00:02:16.340> things<00:02:16.640> through

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
animals I always thought things through

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.570 
animals I always thought things through
really<00:02:17.630> carefully<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:19.010> know<00:02:19.100> I<00:02:19.130> still<00:02:19.400> do

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
really carefully and you know I still do
