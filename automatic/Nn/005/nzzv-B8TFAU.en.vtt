00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
we've always tried to be on the cutting

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.610

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
edge of new developments in this field

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.920 
edge of new developments in this field
and<00:02:42.220> so<00:02:42.760> we<00:02:42.790> were<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.210> you<00:02:43.450> know<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.690> first

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
program for example and so we've always

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.670 
program for example and so we've always
tried<00:02:48.820> to<00:02:49.300> be<00:02:49.480> on<00:02:49.630> that<00:02:49.840> front<00:02:50.170> edge<00:02:50.350> the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
tried to be on that front edge the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.650 
tried to be on that front edge the
community<00:02:51.130> policing<00:02:51.640> movement<00:02:52.060> was<00:02:52.210> largely
