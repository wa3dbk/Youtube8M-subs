in store yesterday using this device and
it<00:01:30.570> got<00:01:30.720> really<00:01:30.869> hot<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.259> my<00:01:31.350> pocket<00:01:31.710> by<00:01:31.890> then

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
it got really hot in my pocket by then

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.640 
it got really hot in my pocket by then
feel<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.490> at<00:01:32.670> first<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.420> when<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.170> took<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.500> out

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
feel it at first and when I took it out

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.359 
feel it at first and when I took it out
the<00:01:35.250> one<00:01:35.430> from<00:01:35.869> fifty<00:01:36.869> percent<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.470> seven

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
the one from fifty percent to seven

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.340 
the one from fifty percent to seven
percent<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.560> self<00:01:40.560> rebooted<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:42.170> at<00:01:43.170> that

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
percent and self rebooted and at that

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.690 
percent and self rebooted and at that
point<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.860> only<00:01:43.920> lasted<00:01:44.520> five<00:01:44.759> minutes<00:01:44.790> more

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
point the only lasted five minutes more

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.770 
point the only lasted five minutes more
so<00:01:48.770> battery<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.920> not<00:01:50.159> good<00:01:50.430> enough<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.970> there

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
so battery is not good enough and there

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.380 
so battery is not good enough and there
you<00:01:51.899> go<00:01:51.930> over<00:01:52.259> here<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:53.310> can<00:01:53.490> have<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.700> icon

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
you go over here you can have this icon

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.600 
you go over here you can have this icon
let<00:01:55.290> me<00:01:55.350> tap<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:57.180> i'll<00:01:57.840> show<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.110> the

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
let me tap on it and i'll show you the

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.880 
let me tap on it and i'll show you the
details<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.850> exact<00:02:00.270> times<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.259> used<00:02:01.560> for

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
details the exact times you used for

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.720 
details the exact times you used for
each<00:02:02.070> app<00:02:02.960> so<00:02:03.960> that's<00:02:04.110> pretty<00:02:04.350> neat

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:14.080 

and<00:02:08.320> from<00:02:09.320> yesterday<00:02:10.510> or<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.720> day<00:02:11.750> before<00:02:13.090> how

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
and from yesterday or the day before how

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.150 
and from yesterday or the day before how
I<00:02:14.120> said<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.840> battery<00:02:15.350> widget<00:02:15.680> didn't

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
I said that the battery widget didn't

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.630 
I said that the battery widget didn't
appear<00:02:16.520> that's<00:02:16.880> because<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:18.170> need<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.590> pair<00:02:19.310> a

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
appear that's because you need to pair a

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.660 
appear that's because you need to pair a
apple<00:02:20.360> an<00:02:20.510> apple<00:02:20.750> watch<00:02:21.080> for<00:02:21.800> it<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.040> show<00:02:22.070> up

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:33.150 

so<00:02:25.670> these<00:02:26.000> are<00:02:26.060> pretty<00:02:26.360> cool<00:02:26.630> I<00:02:28.120> would<00:02:29.120> say<00:02:29.360> the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.910 

little<00:02:34.160> paranoid<00:02:34.750> needs<00:02:35.750> optimization<00:02:36.680> at

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
little paranoid needs optimization at

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.950 
little paranoid needs optimization at
this<00:02:37.070> point<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:38.440> nice<00:02:40.000> stacks<00:02:41.000> up<00:02:41.210> to<00:02:41.450> the

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
this point and nice stacks up to the

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.920 
this point and nice stacks up to the
