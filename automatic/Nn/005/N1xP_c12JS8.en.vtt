00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.430
 hello to all guys and well back on 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.410
 android mode today video out of the program 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.900
 requested by a user and soon 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.090
 I will explain to you why the Roma who 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.310
 I'm using it now is the mist version 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.970
 8 then a rom based on firmware 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:30.189
 samsung one important thing to note is 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.660
 that the kernel is the food version 1.3 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.670
 now let's reboot the device i 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.629
 admissions so I can explain why 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.629
 of this video 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:47.409
 expect a few seconds 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.750
 perfect this shelters and the one that 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.059
 they will mount the roms with the gibo kernel 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.090
 so not only the blue May 2000 but also 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.010
 other roms like the jans and the disaster una 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.990
 what i noticed is the even noticed one 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.450
 user and that is why I turn this around 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.810
 video is that from this type of admissions 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.210
 you cannot flash your roma osp 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.770
 let's start with a wipe so you can 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.770
 Go and flash safely 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:33.460
 perfect now let's try flashing 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.460
 precisely a rom based on android is pure 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.840
 let's go to the folder where we have it 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.240
 inserted and try to flash this 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.580
 that is, the exhaust that is one 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:55.520
 cyanogenmod with the apt and mature of the sony 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:57.409
 xperia let's go to yes we tend and 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.930
 see that you will be shown this 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.240
 message the android lying on the ground with 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.630
 the triangle and below will be you 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.269
 the written installation aborted this 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.220
 it does it on all the os os roms that i up 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:13.220
 at this moment I tried flashing 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.170
 however there is a very simple solution 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.480
 we just need to flash the kernel 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.459
 via odin and in this way we will not have 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.280
 more the recovery of the food but that of the 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.780
 both and we could flash quietly 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.610
 so now I'm going to turn off the 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.680
 device to download it 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.940
 mode and show you how to flash 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.250
 via odin ok once turned off the 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.410
 device we should restart it in 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.920
 download mode so we will have to press i 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.430
 ignition keys the home button and the 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.430
 button down 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.769
 perfect this is the download mode for 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.790
 continue you will have to press the up button 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.470
 then volume up and we will enter precisely into 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.060
 download 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.079
 meanwhile on the computer we are going to open or 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.960
 dean is a thing or only works on 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.510
 windows then in the case 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.700
 to mac download an emulator from 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.540
 windows and you can make it work at 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.330
 perfection 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.550
 at this point the one in active 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.990
 we will have to connect the device to the 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.990
 computer with usb cable 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.020
 we will have to wait for the device 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.760
 be recognized 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.800
 and one thing to use or 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.840
 you will incorrectly have the drivers 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.240
 of your device installed on the 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.490
 computer then to have this there 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.770
 just plug it in once before 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.050
 wait for the operation 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.890
 a few seconds to install i 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.660
 driver 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.450
 after which you can download 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.180
 mode and perform operations with adina 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.050
 if you have device drivers 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.270
 installed on your computer 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:59.050
 you will see that this box will become 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:01.480
 yellow and this id will not appear 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.790
 necessarily shores will be the same as mine 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.710
 so don't worry if it's different 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.020
 the important thing that becomes yellow 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.750
 at this point we are ready to flash 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:16.340
 The so we should both go to press 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:18.770
 su pda and go and choose yes a 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.520
 kernel in this case I took the 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:25.250
 version 5 which is not a beta and we will be 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:29.630
 ready to flash we'll just press 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:32.530
 on start and the procedure will really last 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.530
 very little 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.280
 perfect has already finished as you can 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.220
 see here you will be given the written pass 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.710
 in green and it took 9 seconds then 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.420
 just a very fast procedure 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.640
 meanwhile as you can see the 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.550
 device returned to shelters and 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.250
 precisely the recovery has changed this is 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:01.650
 the recovery of the kernel we are going to 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:03.390
 do another nice wipe and a recovery of 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.910
 touch type so you can move 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.910
 thanks to these four on-screen buttons 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.830
 perfect wipe done and then 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.020
 let's flash our roma osp 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:23.330
 obviously you will have to choose the folder 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.330
 within which you entered it 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:33.510
 xs bild 3 as I have already told you is a rom 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:37.010
 aosp based on the be genes and therefore 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.010
 let's go flashing 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.950
 we wait a few seconds and as you see 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.170
 the installation started without any 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.390
 kind of problems so you won't be going anymore 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:55.060
 given the installation message 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.440
 aborted and installation will proceed 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.970
 without problems 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.310
 something I forgot to 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:03.790
 tell you is that you can at this point 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:07.750
 disconnect the usb cable then let's go to 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:09.760
 remove you won't have to unplug it first 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.810
 because otherwise there will of course be gods 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.430
 problems 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.730
 meanwhile, as you can see, he has finished 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:18.880
 flash the rom but as the xs based 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:21.430
 on are already in 4.2 also requires the 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:28.570
 google flash has therefore already that there 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:32.790
 we are going to install them here 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:35.800
 google apps for android 4.2.2 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:37.890
 obviously the procedure will be more here 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.890
 fast 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:47.320
 see that it proceeds enough 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:49.510
 quickly perfect has finished 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.550
 once this is done before 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:55.210
 restart the device you will still have to 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:07:02.710
 go to the advanced section and give 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:04.479
 wilde horwill cash yes perfect at this 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.800
 point you can go back to 

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:07.800
 restart your device 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:14.110
 voila is now restarting like this 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.580
 you have also seen a preview of the rom 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:19.930
 which I will review next week 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.669
 perfect this was simply a 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.100
 videos requested by a user 

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:25.680
 to flash through odin ii for 

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.870
 solve the installation problem 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.910
 aborted so I hope the video will 

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.919
 it was useful and useful 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.210
 obviously if you liked it remember 

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:36.700
 to put a nice like and 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.160
 share it and make the channel known 

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.910
 if you want to propose a rom 

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.590
 an application you want to ask me 

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.690
 something or just let me know 

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.250
 what do you think of the videos 

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:48.400
 write well in the comments below 

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:51.400
 or on facebook or twitter the link for 

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:53.560
 download odin and both the kernel version 

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.910
 5 I leave you in the description 

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:59.610
 and then I greet you and give you an appointment 

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:59.610
