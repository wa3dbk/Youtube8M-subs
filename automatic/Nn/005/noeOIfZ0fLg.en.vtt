00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:48.090
 old 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:50.820
 if the maximum of all the natives in the necklace 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.340

 he did not have enough money to 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.729
 being thus the most likely destination 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.820
 is that they become consultations. 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.159

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.770
 gold coins and a purse to pay the 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.950

 german territory 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.250
 the figure of sinterklaas would be a fusion 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.159
 between the Catholic saint and a pagan god 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.469
 where even the father of the natal torque 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.049

 pulling trained toys and noel and 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.120

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.400
 smiling short Santa Claus 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.130

 realized in the popular imaginary and 1930 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.769
 when the illustrator radium sandro which 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.140
 created the famous coca cola campaign 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:31.019
