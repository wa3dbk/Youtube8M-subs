 dpa / TV TV Lich II 

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:13.579
 found it funny 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:16.339
 I 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:18.210
 Vienna 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.199
 many people 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.609
 b important is held 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.119
 here 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:26.109
 t 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.939
 Seibold 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.090
 it comes the exercises Seitz DAX and then the ball is against the direction 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.190
 shot 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.570
 But last place is also called 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.210
 that death does not know when the coach shoots 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.880
 there must then react 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.880
 if the coach shoots the ball and can not go earlier 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.860
 because a bit higher way to jump 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.519
 important are the small steps 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.780
 since they always have the option we can tolerate if the balcony can not 

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:59.510
 react 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.300
 you can still save him 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.300
 there 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.660
 Outliers quickly easily over it 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.720
 very well 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.720
 a flat stomach 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.200
 given 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.200
 three high 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.590
 Reasons are on site 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.980
 PopCap 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.580
 and again, be careful that the goalkeeper 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.250
 not reacting on its own not too early April starts 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.659
 he really escalated in that moment 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.760
 and 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.790
 there 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.610
 to get naked 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.850
 on a bit tired 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.770
 Naturally, this protection guide comes on a show 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.380
 boat 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.450
 try to hold each ball as optimal as possible or 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.180
 Soap to Bernd 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.180
 that the opponent is not approaching 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.849
 time and again between the shots that you take his position again 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.779
 find that you are the optimal 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:18.269
 Position has 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.269
 and then catch the balls but 8 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:24.649
 7 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:26.679
 No 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.459
 No 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.499
 there 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:32.609
 7 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.439
 9 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.539
 there 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:38.269
 9 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.329
 there 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.399
 the 

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:46.179
 Luanda 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:48.269
 7 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.309
 9 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:53.309

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:58.079
 9 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.079
 there 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.649
 wonderful 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:11.099
 These shots are already much more extreme and you usually do that 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.689
 to the end of the format 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.689
 before getting into the right training 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:21.929
 It is also important that you always take your time between the shots 

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:26.629
 seeks his position again and finds his positional play corrected and then 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.150
 One hundred percent concentrated exercise 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.120
 Dortmund 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.059
 there 

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:35.179
 7 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:37.939
 9 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:41.379
 then, of course, also sees between Auswahl to Return and the 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.299
 National goalkeeper Tim Wiese big differences and here you can see the same 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.599
 a scene where Tim Wiese optimally implement and at the last moment the ball 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.979
 still turning around the post 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:56.509
 Next come combination exercises 

00:03:56.509 --> 00:04:00.709
 To hear correlation are exercises that involve several actions 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:04.820
 He wants the game with the ball flat to the left then flat to the right 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.820
 one bite at a time, one behind the other 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:11.219
 a dropkick out want the extra margin 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:14.989
 several actions of an exercise come to mind then succeeded to us 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.669
 the belt 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:22.720
