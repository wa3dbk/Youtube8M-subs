00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
missing the emergency brake setup I can

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.089 
missing the emergency brake setup I can
show<00:00:11.130> you<00:00:11.190> on<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.400> other<00:00:11.550> side<00:00:12.530> and<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.860> get<00:00:14.009> all

see all scaly and gross nice and smooth
and<00:00:48.870> shiny<00:00:49.160> it's<00:00:50.160> not<00:00:50.370> done<00:00:50.610> yet<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:51.000> getting

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
and shiny it's not done yet it's getting

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.930 
and shiny it's not done yet it's getting
close<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.719> being<00:00:51.899> there<00:00:52.230> but<00:00:52.699> that's<00:00:53.699> why<00:00:53.879> I

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
close to being there but that's why I

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.840 
close to being there but that's why I
have<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.270> differential<00:00:55.140> covered<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:56.190> I've

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
have the differential covered so I've

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.130 
have the differential covered so I've
got<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.090> calipers<00:00:57.510> off<00:00:57.660> here

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
got the calipers off here

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:06.350 
got the calipers off here
and<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.340> the<00:01:01.100> van's<00:01:02.100> for<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:05.360> emergency

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
and this is the van's for the emergency

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.609 
and this is the van's for the emergency
brake<00:01:06.510> sorry<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.049> had<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.200> think<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.530> there

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
brake sorry I had to think of it there

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.250 
brake sorry I had to think of it there
for<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> second<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:09.180> it's<00:01:09.600> basically<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
for a second and it's it's basically the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.230 
for a second and it's it's basically the
same<00:01:10.409> as<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> drum<00:01:10.890> brake<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.760> expands

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
same as a drum brake this expands

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.520 
same as a drum brake this expands
against<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:13.290> inside<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.040> rotor<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:15.530> you

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
against the inside of the rotor and you

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.050 
against the inside of the rotor and you
can<00:01:16.619> see<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.860> back<00:01:17.009> shields<00:01:17.460> are<00:01:17.549> all<00:01:17.670> rotted

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
can see the back shields are all rotted

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.039 
can see the back shields are all rotted
on<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.659> they<00:01:18.780> need<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:18.960> be<00:01:19.049> replaced<00:01:19.350> and

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
on it so they need to be replaced and

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.060 
on it so they need to be replaced and
they've<00:01:22.049> got<00:01:22.259> some<00:01:22.439> work<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.740> do<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:23.040> it

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
they've got some work to do on it

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.920 
they've got some work to do on it
basically<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.090> calipers<00:01:24.479> are<00:01:24.600> really<00:01:24.840> easy

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
basically the calipers are really easy

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.090 
basically the calipers are really easy
on<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:26.540> back<00:01:27.540> axle<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.500> 210<00:01:28.860> millimeter

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
on this back axle it's 210 millimeter

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.999 
on this back axle it's 210 millimeter
bolts<00:01:29.670> pull<00:01:30.240> those<00:01:30.420> out<00:01:30.600> tap<00:01:31.380> two<00:01:31.530> caliper<00:01:31.860> off

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
bolts pull those out tap two caliper off

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.830 
bolts pull those out tap two caliper off
and<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:34.369> banjo<00:01:35.369> bolt<00:01:35.670> which<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.479> can<00:01:36.630> see

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
and the banjo bolt which you can see

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.330 
and the banjo bolt which you can see
here<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.320> holds<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:39.710> rubber<00:01:40.710> brake<00:01:40.950> line<00:01:41.159> on

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
here this holds the rubber brake line on

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.399 
here this holds the rubber brake line on
this<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.850> 15<00:01:42.240> millimeter<00:01:42.600> bolt<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.290> that

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
this is a 15 millimeter bolt and that

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.800 
this is a 15 millimeter bolt and that
bolts<00:01:43.680> into<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> caliper<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.750> there's<00:01:45.750> a

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
bolts into the caliper and there's a

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.630 
bolts into the caliper and there's a
bracket<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.259> I've<00:01:46.560> taken<00:01:46.799> off<00:01:47.070> which<00:01:47.310> bolts

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
bracket that I've taken off which bolts

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.639 
bracket that I've taken off which bolts
here<00:01:47.909> which<00:01:48.060> holds<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.420> whole<00:01:48.570> hose<00:01:49.049> up<00:01:49.320> and

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
here which holds the whole hose up and

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.160 
here which holds the whole hose up and
the<00:01:50.280> steel<00:01:50.490> line<00:01:50.700> comes<00:01:51.000> into<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.450> that's<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.990> 10

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
the steel line comes into it that's a 10

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.969 
the steel line comes into it that's a 10
millimeter<00:01:52.439> bolt<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.579> as<00:01:54.030> well<00:01:54.240> same<00:01:54.570> as<00:01:54.600> the

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
millimeter bolt so as well same as the

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.539 
millimeter bolt so as well same as the
caliper<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.990> these<00:01:57.990> were<00:01:58.200> fun<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.530> get<00:01:58.649> out<00:01:58.710> had

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
caliper so these were fun to get out had

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.920 
caliper so these were fun to get out had
to<00:01:59.640> tap<00:01:59.820> well<00:02:00.000> they<00:02:00.119> were<00:02:00.240> really<00:02:00.420> rusted<00:02:00.810> in

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
to tap well they were really rusted in

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.050 
to tap well they were really rusted in
there<00:02:01.110> had<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.740> tap<00:02:01.979> all<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.219> pins<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.939> use

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
there had to tap all the pins in and use

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.969 
there had to tap all the pins in and use
the<00:02:03.240> hammer<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.540> get<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.869> out<00:02:03.990> with<00:02:04.950> a

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
the hammer to get it out with a

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.770 
the hammer to get it out with a
screwdriver<00:02:05.280> because<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.270> was<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.479> there<00:02:06.630> real

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
screwdriver because it was in there real

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.330 
screwdriver because it was in there real
good

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
good

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.040 
good
this<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.670> where<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:10.640> steel<00:02:11.640> brake<00:02:11.879> line<00:02:12.060> bolts

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
this is where the steel brake line bolts

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.030 
this is where the steel brake line bolts
excuse<00:02:13.500> me<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.709> rubber

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
excuse me that rubber

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.990 
excuse me that rubber
and<00:02:14.340> bolts<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.989> axle<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.760> there<00:02:17.760> are<00:02:17.849> two

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
and bolts to the axle and there are two

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.490 
and bolts to the axle and there are two
steel<00:02:18.239> lines<00:02:18.480> one<00:02:18.719> goes<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.109> that<00:02:19.200> side<00:02:19.469> and

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
steel lines one goes to that side and

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.550 
steel lines one goes to that side and
the<00:02:19.799> other<00:02:19.920> goes<00:02:20.129> to<00:02:20.159> that<00:02:20.459> side<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:21.379> what<00:02:22.379> this

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
the other goes to that side so what this

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.349 
the other goes to that side so what this
does<00:02:22.799> what<00:02:23.040> this<00:02:23.189> special<00:02:23.609> bolt<00:02:23.939> does<00:02:24.150> though

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
does what this special bolt does though

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.110 
does what this special bolt does though
this<00:02:24.540> is<00:02:24.719> what's<00:02:25.049> called<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.859> a<00:02:26.129> breather<00:02:26.790> tube

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
this is what's called a a breather tube

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.759 
this is what's called a a breather tube
basically<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:28.290> what<00:02:28.409> the<00:02:28.500> breather<00:02:28.680> tube

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
basically this is what the breather tube

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.369 
basically this is what the breather tube
connects<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.540> so<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.720> sits<00:02:30.959> in<00:02:31.079> here<00:02:31.230> like

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
connects to so that sits in here like

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.539 
connects to so that sits in here like
this<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:32.180> what<00:02:33.180> I've<00:02:33.299> been<00:02:33.329> told<00:02:33.659> is<00:02:33.900> if<00:02:33.959> this

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
this and what I've been told is if this

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.399 
this and what I've been told is if this
gets<00:02:35.549> plugged<00:02:35.819> or<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.720> breather<00:02:36.930> tube<00:02:37.170> gets

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
gets plugged or the breather tube gets

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:41.330 
gets plugged or the breather tube gets
plugged<00:02:37.799> you<00:02:38.370> can<00:02:38.700> blow<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.870> seals<00:02:40.319> in<00:02:41.159> the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
plugged you can blow the seals in the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.949 
plugged you can blow the seals in the
axle<00:02:41.790> now<00:02:41.939> I<00:02:41.970> don't<00:02:42.120> know<00:02:42.299> if<00:02:42.389> that's<00:02:42.540> true<00:02:42.629> or

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
axle now I don't know if that's true or

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.039 
axle now I don't know if that's true or
not<00:02:42.989> but<00:02:43.260> that's<00:02:43.319> what<00:02:43.530> I've<00:02:43.620> been<00:02:43.739> told<00:02:45.049> so

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
not but that's what I've been told so

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.539 
not but that's what I've been told so
there's<00:02:46.319> a<00:02:46.379> rubber<00:02:46.560> hose<00:02:46.829> that<00:02:47.040> connects<00:02:47.370> on

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
there's a rubber hose that connects on

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.379 
there's a rubber hose that connects on
it<00:02:47.750> but<00:02:48.750> I'm<00:02:48.840> leaving<00:02:49.139> the<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.590> tooked<00:02:50.129> a

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:50.389 
it but I'm leaving the I tooked a

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:52.670 
it but I'm leaving the I tooked a
bracket<00:02:51.389> itself<00:02:51.629> well<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.989> piece<00:02:52.139> itself<00:02:52.439> off

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
bracket itself well the piece itself off

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.899 
bracket itself well the piece itself off
but<00:02:52.859> I'm<00:02:52.950> leaving<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.280> bolt<00:02:53.459> in<00:02:53.639> it<00:02:53.760> because

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
but I'm leaving the bolt in it because

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.839 
but I'm leaving the bolt in it because
I'm<00:02:54.650> cleaning<00:02:55.650> up<00:02:55.769> and<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:55.980> don't<00:02:56.040> want<00:02:56.189> dirt<00:02:56.700> to

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
I'm cleaning up and I don't want dirt to

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.670 
I'm cleaning up and I don't want dirt to
get<00:02:56.939> into<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.269> axle<00:02:57.720> even<00:02:58.500> though<00:02:58.590> I'm

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
get into the axle even though I'm

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.509 
get into the axle even though I'm
planning<00:02:58.980> on<00:02:59.780> rebuilding<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.379> you<00:03:02.310> can

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
planning on rebuilding it and you can

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.080 
planning on rebuilding it and you can
see<00:03:03.510> in<00:03:04.169> here<00:03:04.799> we're<00:03:05.189> gonna<00:03:05.310> cover<00:03:05.639> it<00:03:05.790> up<00:03:05.849> real

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
see in here we're gonna cover it up real

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.899 
see in here we're gonna cover it up real
good<00:03:07.069> but<00:03:08.069> this<00:03:08.250> is<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.609> ring<00:03:08.790> gear<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:10.909> this

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
good but this is the ring gear and this

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:16.479 
good but this is the ring gear and this
is<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:13.019> carrier<00:03:13.409> if<00:03:14.310> you<00:03:14.400> can<00:03:14.579> see<00:03:14.760> that<00:03:14.970> and

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
is the carrier if you can see that and

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.129 
is the carrier if you can see that and
basically<00:03:17.489> it<00:03:17.939> sits<00:03:18.180> in<00:03:18.359> here<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.690> pinion<00:03:19.019> is

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
basically it sits in here the pinion is

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:25.069 
basically it sits in here the pinion is
behind<00:03:19.470> here<00:03:19.879> and<00:03:21.769> yeah<00:03:23.329> so<00:03:24.329> this<00:03:24.659> is<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.900> ring

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
behind here and yeah so this is the ring

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.729 
behind here and yeah so this is the ring
gear<00:03:25.260> this<00:03:25.500> is<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.709> pin<00:03:25.919> carrier<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:27.739> these

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
gear this is the pin carrier and these

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.890 
gear this is the pin carrier and these
are<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:30.780> end<00:03:31.229> caps<00:03:31.769> basically<00:03:32.419> and<00:03:33.419> there<00:03:33.780> are

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
are the end caps basically and there are

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.469 
are the end caps basically and there are
bearings<00:03:34.260> behind<00:03:34.650> here<00:03:34.949> in<00:03:35.819> there<00:03:36.150> is<00:03:36.329> the

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:36.479 
bearings behind here in there is the

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:39.800 
bearings behind here in there is the
pinion<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.879> basically<00:03:38.879> what<00:03:39.120> happens<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:39.690> get

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
pinion and basically what happens to get

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.289 
pinion and basically what happens to get
that<00:03:40.019> this<00:03:40.199> is<00:03:40.349> an<00:03:40.440> open<00:03:40.709> differential<00:03:41.129> and<00:03:41.489> -

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
that this is an open differential and -

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.849 
that this is an open differential and -
I<00:03:43.340> can't<00:03:44.340> turn<00:03:44.519> it<00:03:44.669> but<00:03:44.879> anyway<00:03:45.840> these<00:03:46.680> have

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
I can't turn it but anyway these have

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.069 
I can't turn it but anyway these have
seat<00:03:47.129> clips<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.549> so<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.329> c-clip<00:03:48.690> sitting

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
seat clips and so the c-clip sitting

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.689 
seat clips and so the c-clip sitting
there<00:03:49.319> and<00:03:49.650> in<00:03:50.430> here<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:51.109> this<00:03:52.109> rod<00:03:52.709> holds

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:53.699 
there and in here and this rod holds

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:57.080 
there and in here and this rod holds
them<00:03:54.889> puts<00:03:55.889> pressure<00:03:56.099> on<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.489> axle<00:03:56.849> shafts

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
them puts pressure on the axle shafts

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.179 
them puts pressure on the axle shafts
otherwise<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.290> axle<00:03:58.680> shafts<00:03:58.859> would<00:03:58.979> come

00:03:59.179 --> 00:03:59.189 
otherwise the axle shafts would come

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:00.939 
otherwise the axle shafts would come
back<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.519> c-clip<00:03:59.879> would<00:04:00.030> pop<00:04:00.209> off<00:04:00.449> and

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:00.949 
back and the c-clip would pop off and

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.559 
back and the c-clip would pop off and
you<00:04:01.949> would<00:04:02.040> lose<00:04:02.189> your<00:04:02.250> axle<00:04:02.669> shaft<00:04:02.849> now<00:04:03.510> to

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
you would lose your axle shaft now to

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.319 
you would lose your axle shaft now to
get<00:04:03.780> this<00:04:03.989> rod<00:04:04.530> out<00:04:04.769> there's<00:04:05.669> a<00:04:05.760> bolt<00:04:05.970> here<00:04:06.239> you

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
get this rod out there's a bolt here you

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.729 
get this rod out there's a bolt here you
pull<00:04:06.540> this<00:04:06.659> bolt<00:04:06.900> out<00:04:07.079> I<00:04:07.229> think<00:04:07.290> it's<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.590> 10

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
pull this bolt out I think it's a 10

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:08.750 
pull this bolt out I think it's a 10
millimeter<00:04:08.010> bolt<00:04:08.370> but<00:04:08.549> I<00:04:08.609> haven't

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
millimeter bolt but I haven't

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.420 
millimeter bolt but I haven't
investigated<00:04:09.269> that<00:04:09.599> far<00:04:09.840> yet<00:04:10.040> and<00:04:11.040> then<00:04:11.159> this

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
investigated that far yet and then this

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.479 
investigated that far yet and then this
should<00:04:12.030> tap<00:04:12.299> out<00:04:12.769> then<00:04:13.769> you<00:04:13.919> can<00:04:14.069> slide<00:04:14.340> the

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
should tap out then you can slide the

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.849 
should tap out then you can slide the
axle<00:04:14.609> in<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.120> little<00:04:15.329> bit<00:04:15.449> and<00:04:15.629> pull<00:04:16.409> the<00:04:16.440> c-clip

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
axle in a little bit and pull the c-clip

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.439 
axle in a little bit and pull the c-clip
out<00:04:17.039> and<00:04:17.250> then<00:04:17.400> slide<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.759> axle<00:04:17.849> off<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.299> rest

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
out and then slide the axle off the rest

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.439 
out and then slide the axle off the rest
of<00:04:18.539> the<00:04:18.599> way<00:04:18.690> that<00:04:18.870> works<00:04:19.019> for<00:04:19.139> both<00:04:19.320> sides<00:04:19.590> and

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:20.449 
of the way that works for both sides and

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:22.820 
of the way that works for both sides and
once<00:04:21.449> you<00:04:21.570> have<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:21.840> axles<00:04:22.169> out<00:04:22.320> you<00:04:22.590> should

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
once you have the axles out you should

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.890 
once you have the axles out you should
then<00:04:22.950> be<00:04:22.979> able<00:04:23.130> to<00:04:23.400> pull<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.669> end<00:04:23.789> cap<00:04:23.900> covers

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
then be able to pull the end cap covers

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.290 
then be able to pull the end cap covers
off<00:04:25.080> I<00:04:25.380> believe<00:04:25.620> they're<00:04:25.770> called<00:04:25.950> end<00:04:26.099> caps

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
off I believe they're called end caps

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.580 
off I believe they're called end caps
that's<00:04:27.539> what<00:04:27.690> they<00:04:27.810> are<00:04:27.930> in<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.229> bottom<00:04:28.500> end

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
that's what they are in the bottom end

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.640 
that's what they are in the bottom end
of<00:04:28.680> an<00:04:28.800> engine<00:04:29.569> you<00:04:30.569> can<00:04:30.660> pull<00:04:30.840> them<00:04:30.930> off<00:04:31.139> this

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
of an engine you can pull them off this

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.740 
of an engine you can pull them off this
whole<00:04:31.830> assembly<00:04:32.069> should<00:04:32.370> pop<00:04:32.580> out<00:04:32.789> then<00:04:33.569> you

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
whole assembly should pop out then you

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.710 
whole assembly should pop out then you
can<00:04:33.960> get<00:04:34.080> at<00:04:34.259> the<00:04:34.560> pinion<00:04:35.190> and<00:04:35.539> take<00:04:36.539> that

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
can get at the pinion and take that

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
can get at the pinion and take that
apart<00:04:37.020> that'll<00:04:37.259> be<00:04:37.379> fun<00:04:37.970> so<00:04:39.020> these<00:04:40.020> are<00:04:40.229> 370

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
apart that'll be fun so these are 370

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.589 
apart that'll be fun so these are 370
