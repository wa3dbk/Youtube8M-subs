00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
off the road the graphics is really bad

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.560 
off the road the graphics is really bad
and<00:04:06.740> there's<00:04:07.340> this<00:04:07.520> monkey<00:04:08.060> what<00:04:08.210> will<00:04:08.390> come

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
and there's this monkey what will come

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.620 
and there's this monkey what will come
to<00:04:08.720> try<00:04:08.900> to<00:04:08.960> steer<00:04:09.350> the<00:04:09.530> dreads<00:04:09.800> and<00:04:10.300> if<00:04:11.300> it

to try to steer the dreads and if it

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.620 
to try to steer the dreads and if it
takes<00:04:12.050> then<00:04:12.380> nothing<00:04:12.920> happens<00:04:13.400> and<00:04:13.910> here<00:04:14.420> this

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
takes then nothing happens and here this

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.099 
takes then nothing happens and here this
cat's<00:04:15.230> spoiler<00:04:16.270> this<00:04:17.270> is<00:04:17.450> the<00:04:17.600> way<00:04:17.750> I'll

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
cat's spoiler this is the way I'll

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.990 
cat's spoiler this is the way I'll
assemble<00:04:18.680> again<00:04:19.220> and<00:04:20.090> now<00:04:20.900> all<00:04:21.260> those

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
assemble again and now all those

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.350 
assemble again and now all those
crystals<00:04:23.000> aren't<00:04:23.420> worth<00:04:23.660> anything<00:04:23.920> and<00:04:25.360> you

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
crystals aren't worth anything and you

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.670 
crystals aren't worth anything and you
have<00:04:26.540> limitless<00:04:26.960> dies<00:04:27.610> so<00:04:29.050> there<00:04:30.050> isn't<00:04:30.470> any

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
have limitless dies so there isn't any

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:40.399 
have limitless dies so there isn't any
point<00:04:30.950> in<00:04:31.250> that

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:40.409 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:42.990 

after<00:04:41.409> this<00:04:41.530> minigame<00:04:41.949> way<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:42.490> finish<00:04:42.849> the

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
after this minigame way and finish the

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.439 
after this minigame way and finish the
video<00:04:43.120> because<00:04:43.629> once<00:04:43.870> we<00:04:43.990> tried<00:04:44.349> it<00:04:44.469> and<00:04:44.830> it

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
video because once we tried it and it

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.450 
video because once we tried it and it
was<00:04:46.449> 15<00:04:47.050> minute<00:04:47.379> and<00:04:47.560> we<00:04:47.650> couldn't<00:04:47.889> put<00:04:48.189> it<00:04:48.310> on

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
was 15 minute and we couldn't put it on

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.850 
was 15 minute and we couldn't put it on
YouTube<00:04:49.030> yeah<00:04:49.689> even<00:04:50.169> if<00:04:50.289> it's<00:04:50.469> a<00:04:50.590> short

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
YouTube yeah even if it's a short

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.770 
YouTube yeah even if it's a short
segment<00:04:51.129> the<00:04:51.430> cutscenes<00:04:51.909> make<00:04:52.150> it<00:04:52.330> too<00:04:52.509> long

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
segment the cutscenes make it too long

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.350 
segment the cutscenes make it too long
so<00:04:53.500> we're<00:04:53.860> going<00:04:54.159> to<00:04:54.310> finish<00:04:54.490> off<00:04:54.819> this<00:04:55.090> way

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
so we're going to finish off this way

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.920 
so we're going to finish off this way
looks<00:04:55.870> like<00:04:56.169> them<00:04:56.349> say<00:04:57.000> yes<00:04:58.000> that's<00:04:58.689> what

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
looks like them say yes that's what

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.510 
looks like them say yes that's what
matters<00:04:59.590> right<00:04:59.620> now<00:05:00.389> the<00:05:01.830> golden<00:05:02.830> shining

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
matters right now the golden shining

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.209 
matters right now the golden shining
fruit<00:05:03.789> is<00:05:03.969> always<00:05:04.240> in<00:05:04.569> a<00:05:04.659> different<00:05:05.110> area<00:05:05.500> of

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:06.219 
fruit is always in a different area of

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:10.159 
fruit is always in a different area of
the<00:05:06.699> leaf<00:05:06.909> so<00:05:07.210> you<00:05:07.330> have<00:05:07.479> a<00:05:07.710> totally<00:05:08.710> search

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
the leaf so you have a totally search

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:19.740 
the leaf so you have a totally search
it's<00:05:11.169> totally<00:05:11.949> random<00:05:17.400> well<00:05:18.400> it<00:05:18.580> will<00:05:19.300> it<00:05:19.449> be

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
it's totally random well it will it be

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:27.839 
it's totally random well it will it be
now<00:05:20.009> last<00:05:21.009> time<00:05:21.310> it<00:05:21.550> was<00:05:21.580> over<00:05:21.879> there<00:05:26.460> and<00:05:27.460> you
