00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:45.180
 had the way to show as brothers 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.609
 in the gender dance because I'm law 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.159
 January it seems that the same is danced as one 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:52.620
 it's just the union between brothers 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.329
 Who bleeds with our good family 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.250

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:59.030

 precisely in events like that 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.069
 the truth we won six years 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.889
 dancing joropo we have participated 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:14.489

 let's get to finish with that 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.730
 message that we give to the youth of 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.200
 a way so that we do not lose 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.080
 precisely the customs of man 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.680

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:49.590
