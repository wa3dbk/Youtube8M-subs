00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
have much choice here I'm just worried

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.030 
have much choice here I'm just worried
about<00:00:38.579> his<00:00:38.760> back<00:00:39.120> row<00:00:40.040> the<00:00:41.040> set<00:00:41.280> these<00:00:41.520> two<00:00:41.820> I

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
that's pretty much all I'm worried about

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.210 
that's pretty much all I'm worried about
but<00:04:57.440> because<00:04:58.440> these<00:04:58.590> cards<00:04:58.889> can't<00:04:59.099> be

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
but because these cards can't be

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.980 
but because these cards can't be
destroyed<00:04:59.520> by<00:04:59.669> card<00:04:59.940> effects<00:05:00.210> so<00:05:00.479> it's<00:05:02.810> not<00:05:03.810> a

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
destroyed by card effects so it's not a

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.450 
destroyed by card effects so it's not a
big<00:05:04.229> issue<00:05:04.380> if<00:05:04.680> I<00:05:04.770> ran<00:05:04.919> to<00:05:05.039> like<00:05:05.159> a<00:05:05.190> mirror

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
big issue if I ran to like a mirror

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.360 
big issue if I ran to like a mirror
force<00:05:05.729> or<00:05:05.880> anything<00:05:06.090> like<00:05:06.150> that
