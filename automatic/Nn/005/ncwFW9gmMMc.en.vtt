normally<00:02:41.120> would<00:02:41.720> have<00:02:41.989> at<00:02:42.110> once

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.560

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
know what it looks like when a base has

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.740 
know what it looks like when a base has
been<00:03:10.280> left<00:03:10.670> alone<00:03:10.850> for<00:03:11.239> a<00:03:11.329> week<00:03:12.070> then<00:03:13.070> they<00:03:13.340> go

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
been left alone for a week then they go

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.280 
been left alone for a week then they go
so<00:03:15.459> yeah<00:03:16.459> unfortunately<00:03:16.820> I<00:03:17.810> can't<00:03:18.140> read<00:03:18.260> our

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
so yeah unfortunately I can't read our

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.530 
so yeah unfortunately I can't read our
mole<00:03:18.560> this<00:03:18.709> traps<00:03:19.010> because<00:03:19.519> I<00:03:20.120> don't<00:03:20.299> have<00:03:20.359> the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
mole this traps because I don't have the

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.360 
mole this traps because I don't have the
money<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:21.170> I<00:03:21.350> have<00:03:21.440> to<00:03:21.530> wait<00:03:21.650> an<00:03:21.769> hour<00:03:21.890> or<00:03:22.190> so

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
money and I have to wait an hour or so

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.759 
money and I have to wait an hour or so
well<00:03:23.329> that's<00:03:23.690> it<00:03:23.810> for<00:03:23.900> this<00:03:24.019> quick<00:03:24.230> video<00:03:24.380> guys

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
well that's it for this quick video guys

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.250 
well that's it for this quick video guys
so<00:03:25.700> it's<00:03:26.239> a<00:03:26.329> little<00:03:26.600> pointless<00:03:26.900> I<00:03:27.200> know

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
so it's a little pointless I know

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.890 
so it's a little pointless I know
because<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:28.670> know<00:03:28.790> a<00:03:29.030> lot<00:03:29.600> of<00:03:29.630> you<00:03:29.810> guys

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
because you know a lot of you guys

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.240 
because you know a lot of you guys
probably<00:03:30.049> deal<00:03:30.410> with<00:03:30.440> this<00:03:30.590> all<00:03:30.769> the<00:03:30.799> time<00:03:31.100> but

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
probably deal with this all the time but

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.470 
probably deal with this all the time but
it's<00:03:31.370> just<00:03:31.430> weird<00:03:31.700> for<00:03:31.970> me<00:03:32.090> because<00:03:32.299> I<00:03:32.420> never

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
it's just weird for me because I never

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.890 
it's just weird for me because I never
leave<00:03:33.320> my<00:03:33.350> AFK<00:03:34.120> sessions<00:03:35.120> more<00:03:35.420> than<00:03:35.630> a<00:03:35.660> day

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
leave my AFK sessions more than a day

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.020 
leave my AFK sessions more than a day
