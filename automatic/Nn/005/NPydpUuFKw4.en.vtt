so as I said this is definitely one of
the<00:00:24.180> more<00:00:24.390> balanced<00:00:24.840> guns<00:00:25.109> in<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.350> game<00:00:25.529> it

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.310 
the more balanced guns in the game it
reminds<00:00:26.310> me<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> lot<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.180> 47<00:00:27.810> black<00:00:28.019> ops<00:00:28.230> 1

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320

reminds me a lot of the 47 black ops 1
in<00:00:28.710> cod4<00:00:29.090> it's<00:00:30.109> got<00:00:31.109> pretty<00:00:31.320> much<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> good

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
in cod4 it's got pretty much a good

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.290 
in cod4 it's got pretty much a good
balance<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.040> everything<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.520> has<00:00:32.640> decent

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.260 
range it has minimal recoil the rate of
fire<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.309> about<00:00:38.309> perfect<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:38.879> not<00:00:39.000> too<00:00:39.149> high

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270

fire is about perfect it's not too high
it's<00:00:39.450> not<00:00:39.600> too<00:00:39.750> low<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.890> general<00:00:41.309> it's<00:00:41.460> just<00:00:41.610> a

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
it's not too low in general it's just a

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.190 
it's not too low in general it's just a
good<00:00:41.940> all-around<00:00:41.969> gun<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:42.930> can<00:00:43.079> take

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
good all-around gun that you can take

good all-around gun that you can take
into<00:00:43.469> almost<00:00:43.620> any<00:00:43.920> situation<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.670> do<00:00:44.760> pretty

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
into almost any situation and do pretty

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.760 
into almost any situation and do pretty
well<00:00:45.149> on<00:00:45.360> if<00:00:45.570> you're<00:00:45.989> doing<00:00:46.200> if<00:00:46.469> you're<00:00:46.620> having

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
well on if you're doing if you're having

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.560 
well on if you're doing if you're having
a<00:00:46.860> bad<00:00:46.890> game<00:00:47.039> switches<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.820> gun<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.239> you

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
a bad game switches this gun and you

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.880 
a bad game switches this gun and you
probably<00:00:48.870> start<00:00:49.140> doing<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.410> little<00:00:49.440> bit<00:00:49.739> better

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
probably start doing a little bit better

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.130 
probably start doing a little bit better
the<00:00:50.789> only<00:00:50.969> thing<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.270> really<00:00:51.390> changed<00:00:51.989> with

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
always wonder that about games why don't

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
anymore unless you're in Africa or a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.900 
anymore unless you're in Africa or a
third-world<00:01:01.410> country<00:01:01.530> everyone's<00:01:02.489> using<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
third-world country everyone's using the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.420 
third-world country everyone's using the
Russia<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.960> using<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.379> newer<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.949> case<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.339> it

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
Russia is using the newer a case so it

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.950 
Russia is using the newer a case so it
kind<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.670> confused<00:01:06.330> me<00:01:06.420> as<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.630> why<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.780> keep

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
kind of confused me as to why I keep

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.630 
kind of confused me as to why I keep
seeing<00:01:07.170> 47s<00:01:07.799> at<00:01:07.890> nothing<00:01:08.159> else<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.430> video

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
seeing 47s at nothing else in video

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.910 
seeing 47s at nothing else in video
games<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.930> thankfully<00:01:10.290> they<00:01:10.409> switch<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.740> an<00:01:10.830> a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
games so thankfully they switch to an a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.380 
games so thankfully they switch to an a
94<00:01:11.340> not<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.729> really<00:01:11.760> feels<00:01:12.180> any

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
94 not that it really feels any

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.910 
94 not that it really feels any
different<00:01:12.810> honestly<00:01:13.140> as<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.500> said<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.740> feels

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
different honestly as I said it feels

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.020 
different honestly as I said it feels
like<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.130> same<00:01:14.280> damn<00:01:14.430> thing<00:01:14.729> but<00:01:14.880> just

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
like the same damn thing but just

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.820 
like the same damn thing but just
reskinned<00:01:15.479> except<00:01:16.170> they<00:01:16.290> did<00:01:16.439> make<00:01:16.560> one

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
reskinned except they did make one

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.530 
reskinned except they did make one
difference<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.240> kind<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.420> an

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
difference and it's kind of an

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.820 
difference and it's kind of an
interesting<00:01:18.630> difference<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.439> difference<00:01:19.470> is

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
interesting difference the difference is

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.190 
interesting difference the difference is
that<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.970> first<00:01:21.210> two<00:01:21.360> shots<00:01:21.570> shoot<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.990> little

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
that the first two shots shoot a little

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.310 
that the first two shots shoot a little
bit<00:01:22.380> faster<00:01:22.770> than<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> rest<00:01:23.960> this<00:01:24.960> has<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.200> do

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
bit faster than the rest this has to do

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.170 
bit faster than the rest this has to do
with<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.530> way<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.860> barrel<00:01:26.250> moves<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
with the way the barrel moves on the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.719 
with the way the barrel moves on the
relay<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.600> 94<00:01:28.049> it's<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:29.009> know<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.430> kind<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.610> an

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
relay in 94 it's I know it's kind of an

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.270 
relay in 94 it's I know it's kind of an
interesting<00:01:29.909> change<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.659> can<00:01:30.780> lead<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.280> if

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
interesting change and it can lead to if

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.340 
interesting change and it can lead to if
you<00:01:32.549> want<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.270> make<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.810> select<00:01:34.140> fire

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
you want to you can make it select fire

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.219 
you want to you can make it select fire
and<00:01:34.619> put<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.920> two-round<00:01:35.189> burst<00:01:35.540> if<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:37.049> do

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
and put it to two-round burst if you do

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.719 
and put it to two-round burst if you do
that<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.619> can<00:01:37.740> have<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.890> faster<00:01:38.280> rate<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.549> fire

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
that you can have a faster rate of fire

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.700 
that you can have a faster rate of fire
if<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.270> learn<00:01:39.450> how<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.659> control<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.290> you

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
if you learn how to control it and you

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.140 
if you learn how to control it and you
can<00:01:40.829> definitely<00:01:41.159> be<00:01:41.280> very<00:01:41.460> deadly<00:01:41.700> doing<00:01:42.060> that

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
can definitely be very deadly doing that

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.429 
can definitely be very deadly doing that
it's<00:01:42.240> kind<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.420> an<00:01:42.540> interesting<00:01:42.630> twist<00:01:43.229> they

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
it's kind of an interesting twist they

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.580 
it's kind of an interesting twist they
threw<00:01:43.649> into<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.829> gun<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:45.290> yeah<00:01:46.290> that's

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
threw into the gun so yeah that's

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
threw into the gun so yeah that's
something<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.979> little<00:01:47.100> bit<00:01:47.250> different<00:01:47.549> about

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
something a little bit different about

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.889 
something a little bit different about
it<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:47.909> other<00:01:48.030> than<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.210> like<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.570> said<00:01:48.750> it's

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
it but other than that like I said it's

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.020 
it but other than that like I said it's
just<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.110> solid<00:01:49.500> pretty<00:01:50.159> steady<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.640> sorrowful

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
the way if I just like how it works

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.960 
the way if I just like how it works
anyway<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.009> my<00:02:08.099> first<00:02:08.310> game<00:02:08.489> back<00:02:08.729> after

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
anyway this is my first game back after

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.540 
anyway this is my first game back after
I<00:02:09.479> think<00:02:09.929> about<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.140> week<00:02:10.379> or<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.560> or<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.039> few<00:02:11.370> days

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
I think about a week or so or a few days

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.240 
I think about a week or so or a few days
or<00:02:11.760> some<00:02:11.970> like

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
or some like

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.800 
or some like
I'm<00:02:12.280> not<00:02:12.460> playing<00:02:12.520> black<00:02:12.940> ops<00:02:13.060> 2<00:02:13.270> my<00:02:13.510> name<00:02:13.570> was

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
I'm not playing black ops 2 my name was

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.350 
I'm not playing black ops 2 my name was
a<00:02:13.840> little<00:02:14.320> bit<00:02:14.410> off<00:02:14.590> I<00:02:15.060> definitely<00:02:16.060> could<00:02:16.330> have

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
a little bit off I definitely could have

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.760 
a little bit off I definitely could have
been<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.540> much<00:02:16.750> better<00:02:16.960> game<00:02:17.050> I<00:02:17.260> didn't<00:02:17.590> get<00:02:17.650> my

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
been a much better game I didn't get my

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.230 
been a much better game I didn't get my
highest<00:02:18.130> killstreak<00:02:18.340> which<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:18.760> raised<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.180> I

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
highest killstreak which I raised to I

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.360 
highest killstreak which I raised to I
think<00:02:19.330> of<00:02:19.600> eat<00:02:19.720> all<00:02:19.900> but<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:20.860> did<00:02:21.040> get<00:02:21.190> my<00:02:21.310> two

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
think of eat all but I did get my two

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.270 
think of eat all but I did get my two
ones<00:02:21.730> below<00:02:22.390> that<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:23.740> started<00:02:24.010> doing<00:02:24.100> a

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
ones below that and I started doing a

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.380 
ones below that and I started doing a
little<00:02:24.310> bit<00:02:24.580> better<00:02:24.670> later<00:02:25.000> on<00:02:25.090> in<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.360> game

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
little bit better later on in the game

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.620 
little bit better later on in the game
instead<00:02:25.780> of<00:02:25.870> dying<00:02:26.170> every<00:02:26.530> five<00:02:26.680> seconds<00:02:27.630> so

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630
