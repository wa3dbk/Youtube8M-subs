00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.060 
preparation and I think as a team will
get<00:01:34.079> better<00:01:34.369> as<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.939> season<00:01:36.090> goes<00:01:36.329> along<00:01:37.070> you

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
get better as the season goes along you

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.090 
get better as the season goes along you
have<00:01:38.189> scored<00:01:38.549> more<00:01:38.640> than<00:01:39.170> 2,700<00:01:40.170> triples<00:01:40.950> in

have scored more than 2,700 triples in
the<00:01:41.280> NBA<00:01:41.549> but<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.119> seems<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.570> with<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.049> Miami

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
the NBA but it seems that with the Miami

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.649

agonizing<00:01:51.899> thing<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.200> world<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.740> know<00:01:52.860> I

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
think is when you get put in those

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.399 
think is when you get put in those
situations<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:57.090> just<00:01:57.299> kind<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.049> your<00:01:58.170> mind

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
situations you just kind of in your mind

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.609 
situations you just kind of in your mind
you<00:01:58.649> go<00:01:58.799> back<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.250> you<00:02:00.180> know<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.530> you<00:02:01.530> know
