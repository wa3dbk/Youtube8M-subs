hi this is the rain barrel guide and
here's<00:00:10.900> today's<00:00:11.050> question<00:00:12.030> no<00:00:13.030> water<00:00:13.360> is

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:21.929 
bought a nice new hose i connected the
hose<00:00:20.499> to<00:00:20.710> the<00:00:20.739> spigot<00:00:21.189> located<00:00:21.699> at<00:00:21.789> the<00:00:21.849> bottom

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
hose to the spigot located at the bottom

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:23.759 
hose to the spigot located at the bottom
of<00:00:22.089> the<00:00:22.210> barrel<00:00:22.449> i<00:00:22.599> turned<00:00:23.349> it<00:00:23.439> on<00:00:23.529> and<00:00:23.589> i

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:23.769

longer<00:00:26.339> no<00:00:27.339> water<00:00:27.640> has<00:00:27.880> come<00:00:28.089> out<00:00:28.179> of<00:00:28.300> the<00:00:28.359> hose

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
longer no water has come out of the hose

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.139 
longer no water has come out of the hose
yet<00:00:28.779> any<00:00:29.169> suggestions<00:00:29.609> maybe<00:00:30.609> the<00:00:30.759> hose<00:00:30.909> has

00:00:31.139 --> 00:00:31.149 
yet any suggestions maybe the hose has

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:33.180 
yet any suggestions maybe the hose has
too<00:00:31.300> much<00:00:31.419> curl<00:00:31.749> maybe<00:00:32.439> it's<00:00:32.619> not<00:00:32.740> downhill

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
too much curl maybe it's not downhill

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.250 
too much curl maybe it's not downhill
enough<00:00:33.430> I<00:00:33.700> tried<00:00:34.300> sucking<00:00:34.570> on<00:00:34.840> the<00:00:34.900> hose<00:00:35.050> to

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
enough I tried sucking on the hose to

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.300 
enough I tried sucking on the hose to
see<00:00:35.380> if<00:00:35.470> that<00:00:35.620> helped<00:00:35.890> it<00:00:36.280> didn't<00:00:36.580> thanks<00:00:38.310> okay

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.310 
see if that helped it didn't thanks okay

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.740 
see if that helped it didn't thanks okay
I'm<00:00:39.400> sure<00:00:39.430> she's<00:00:39.730> joking<00:00:40.000> about<00:00:40.240> the<00:00:40.420> sucking

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
I'm sure she's joking about the sucking

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.440 
I'm sure she's joking about the sucking
on<00:00:40.840> the<00:00:40.900> hose<00:00:41.050> because<00:00:41.580> come<00:00:42.580> on<00:00:42.730> nobody<00:00:43.240> wants

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
on the hose because come on nobody wants

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.220 
on the hose because come on nobody wants
rain<00:00:43.630> barrel<00:00:43.900> water<00:00:44.080> in<00:00:44.260> their<00:00:44.380> mouth<00:00:46.230> my

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
rain barrel water in their mouth my

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.920 
rain barrel water in their mouth my
suggestion<00:00:47.740> would<00:00:47.950> be<00:00:48.010> a<00:00:48.550> first<00:00:49.480> thing<00:00:49.810> you

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
suggestion would be a first thing you

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.530 
suggestion would be a first thing you
want<00:00:50.080> to<00:00:50.110> do<00:00:50.260> is<00:00:50.500> take<00:00:50.740> off<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:50.950> hose<00:00:51.310> and<00:00:51.550> make

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
want to do is take off the hose and make

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.700 
want to do is take off the hose and make
sure<00:00:52.720> that<00:00:52.900> water<00:00:53.079> is<00:00:53.230> coming<00:00:53.350> out<00:00:53.530> of<00:00:53.590> the

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
sure that water is coming out of the

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.170 
sure that water is coming out of the
spigot<00:00:54.040> without<00:00:54.310> the<00:00:54.490> hose<00:00:54.610> connected

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
spigot without the hose connected

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.360 
spigot without the hose connected
because<00:00:56.020> you<00:00:56.200> want<00:00:56.350> to<00:00:56.440> see<00:00:56.590> and<00:00:56.860> make<00:00:57.340> sure

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
because you want to see and make sure

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.040 
because you want to see and make sure
that<00:00:57.579> you<00:00:57.850> don't<00:00:57.970> have<00:00:58.120> something<00:00:58.360> stopped<00:00:58.810> up

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
that you don't have something stopped up

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.380 
that you don't have something stopped up
that's<00:00:59.560> preventing<00:01:00.070> water<00:01:00.700> coming<00:01:01.120> out<00:01:01.210> of

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
that's preventing water coming out of

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.870 
that's preventing water coming out of
the<00:01:01.570> barrel<00:01:01.810> at<00:01:01.960> all<00:01:02.310> once<00:01:03.310> you<00:01:03.460> confirm<00:01:03.820> that

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
the barrel at all once you confirm that

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.109 
the barrel at all once you confirm that
water<00:01:04.269> is<00:01:04.539> is<00:01:04.839> coming<00:01:05.199> out<00:01:05.289> of<00:01:05.319> the<00:01:05.469> spigot<00:01:05.859> I

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
water is is coming out of the spigot I

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.469 
water is is coming out of the spigot I
think<00:01:07.119> your<00:01:07.600> issue<00:01:07.780> might<00:01:08.259> be<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:09.520> it's<00:01:10.270> not

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
think your issue might be that it's not

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.679 
think your issue might be that it's not
downhill<00:01:10.990> or<00:01:11.229> not<00:01:11.499> downhill<00:01:11.859> enough<00:01:12.689> rain

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
downhill or not downhill enough rain

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:15.389 
downhill or not downhill enough rain
barrels<00:01:14.020> do<00:01:14.170> not<00:01:14.289> generate<00:01:14.679> water<00:01:14.950> pressure

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
barrels do not generate water pressure

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.700 
barrels do not generate water pressure
like<00:01:15.909> a<00:01:16.179> like<00:01:16.719> a<00:01:16.749> water<00:01:17.020> hose<00:01:17.259> when<00:01:17.469> you<00:01:17.590> hook

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
like a like a water hose when you hook

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.399 
like a like a water hose when you hook
it<00:01:17.770> up<00:01:17.889> to<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.100> spigot<00:01:18.549> so<00:01:19.389> if<00:01:19.689> you've<00:01:20.200> got<00:01:20.229> a

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
it up to the spigot so if you've got a

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.830 
it up to the spigot so if you've got a
50<00:01:20.799> foot<00:01:20.950> hose<00:01:21.009> or<00:01:21.369> 100<00:01:21.670> foot<00:01:21.880> hose<00:01:22.060> unless

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
50 foot hose or 100 foot hose unless

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.080 
50 foot hose or 100 foot hose unless
it's<00:01:23.139> all<00:01:23.439> the<00:01:23.679> way<00:01:23.799> down<00:01:24.069> hill<00:01:24.369> the<00:01:24.700> whole<00:01:24.850> way

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
it's all the way down hill the whole way

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.730 
it's all the way down hill the whole way
the<00:01:25.719> water<00:01:25.929> is<00:01:26.079> probably<00:01:26.200> not<00:01:26.439> going<00:01:26.560> to<00:01:26.619> come

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
the water is probably not going to come

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.239 
the water is probably not going to come
out<00:01:26.829> the<00:01:27.009> end<00:01:27.899> so<00:01:28.899> you<00:01:29.740> could<00:01:29.889> either<00:01:30.009> use<00:01:30.100> a

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:30.249 
out the end so you could either use a

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:32.039 
out the end so you could either use a
shorter<00:01:30.670> hose<00:01:30.880> make<00:01:31.359> sure<00:01:31.539> your<00:01:31.689> rain<00:01:31.810> barrels

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
shorter hose make sure your rain barrels

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.330 
shorter hose make sure your rain barrels
up<00:01:32.200> high<00:01:32.380> enough<00:01:32.530> that<00:01:32.679> it<00:01:32.920> can<00:01:33.009> go<00:01:33.130> downhill

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
up high enough that it can go downhill

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.639 
up high enough that it can go downhill
or<00:01:34.079> instead<00:01:35.079> of<00:01:35.200> using<00:01:35.409> a<00:01:35.619> hose<00:01:35.829> you<00:01:36.639> can<00:01:36.880> use<00:01:37.119> a

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
or instead of using a hose you can use a

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.770 
or instead of using a hose you can use a
watering<00:01:38.649> can<00:01:38.679> or<00:01:39.159> a<00:01:39.249> bucket<00:01:39.819> and<00:01:39.909> and<00:01:40.539> get<00:01:40.689> the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
watering can or a bucket and and get the

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.480 
watering can or a bucket and and get the
water<00:01:40.959> out<00:01:41.079> and<00:01:41.229> water<00:01:41.740> with<00:01:41.979> it<00:01:42.100> that<00:01:42.310> way

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
water out and water with it that way

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.179 
water out and water with it that way
hope<00:01:43.090> this<00:01:43.270> helps<00:01:43.539> tried<00:01:44.259> sucking<00:01:44.709> on<00:01:45.069> the

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
hope this helps tried sucking on the

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.590 
hope this helps tried sucking on the
hose<00:01:45.399> to<00:01:45.789> see<00:01:45.969> if<00:01:46.090> that<00:01:46.299> helped<00:01:46.719> it<00:01:47.170> didn't<00:01:47.619> I

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
hose to see if that helped it didn't I

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.289 
hose to see if that helped it didn't I
surely<00:01:49.600> that<00:01:49.779> has<00:01:49.990> to<00:01:50.200> be<00:01:50.229> like<00:01:50.789> not<00:01:51.789> serious

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
surely that has to be like not serious

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.179 
surely that has to be like not serious
but<00:01:52.840> she<00:01:53.020> wasn't<00:01:53.170> actually<00:01:53.679> sucking<00:01:53.889> out<00:01:54.100> of

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
but she wasn't actually sucking out of
