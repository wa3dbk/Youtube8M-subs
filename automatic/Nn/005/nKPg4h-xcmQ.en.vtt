00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.040
 In 1948, Israelis and Jordan fought over 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.870
 the rule over Jerusalem 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.090
 they had to agree on a division of 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.780
 city ​​some of the west part went to 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.190
 Israel 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.110
 the eastern part with the old town on 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.839
 Jordan in Israeli 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.279
 Independence War of 1948 has 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.529
 Jordan the eastern part of the city 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.970
 Jerusalem conquered so the whole 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.859
 holy city not under the administration 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.500
 the jews only came after the 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.449
 six-day war 1967 succeeded the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.310
 Jews to the eastern part of the city of Jerusalem 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.619
 conquer and was under the administration 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.540
 the jews set after the war that 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.980
 disturbs the majority to this day 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.050
 of non-Jewish peoples and nations 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.200
 we had the feeling story too 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.200
 write 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.539
 [Music] 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.350
 all of a sudden Hierbei I heard ausgewähltenjährigen ländlichen 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.430
 I realized that the Israelis were the 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.380
 had taken city 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.180
 I had terrible victory screams 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.480
 and vociferous enthusiasm and me 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.480
 heard shots 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.740
 I saw the Israeli troops in 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.840
 haram al-sharif swarmed I saw 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.550
 how they made the uniquely clear 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.030
 recognizable as honors of the city 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.369
 were 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.690
 because here in the hair on the sharp was 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.050
 the last command post of 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.670
 governors so the civil commando with 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.680
 their amateur cameras film the 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.649
 Israeli soldiers this euphoric 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.080
 moments the conquest of the wailing wall 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.050
 Gives you the feeling of the holiest place 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.149
 to have liberated the Judaism 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.440
 thus joins the Israeli 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.630
 nationalism a new religious 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.550
 dimension added but in the immediate 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.770
 Nearby is also one of the 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.070
 holiest places of islam the haram 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.780
 Sharif the temple mountain years later 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.850
 the mixture of religious 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.530
 fundamentalism and nationalism 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.940
 both sides not only at this place 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.640
 for biggest problems 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.050
 after five days the war ends with 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.840
 Jordan and Egypt 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.569
 Moshe Dayan wins the whole line 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.369
 Israel now controls the sinai den 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:03.920
 gaza strip and the large part of the 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.410
 Westbank saw the bible scientists 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.569
 in the year 1967 after the conquest 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.550
 Jerusalem through the jews one 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.069
 possible start of the 49 years 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.840
 until the arrival of the antichrist what in 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.930
 the addition would mean that the 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.569
 antichrist in 2016 in the future 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.620
 entering the politics of the world 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.390
 at the same time other biblical ones 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.099
 personalities this year the 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.290
 world stage could enter the two 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.280
 God prophesied false prophets around 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.930
 to name a few 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.819
 the bible scientists are themselves 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.510
 agree that this thesis checks quickly 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.400
 can be 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.560
 because your exit is not very far in the 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.470
 the future lies nevertheless but is caution 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.599
 offered since several start time of the 49 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.840
 years could be possible in the future 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.940
 the guess that 1967 not as 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.620
 starting time can be selected 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.720
 among the Bible scholars as well 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.870
 recognized the near future will show 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.890
 whether at the 1967 start time theory 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.610
 what could be it 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.670
 whether 2016 is the end of the 49 years 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.310
 will come 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.110
 is not independent of this 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.370
 new gaps theory in theology 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.099
 will find her way 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.660
 finally my personal statement after 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.819
 I go from my knowledge level of 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.800
 following options out of me 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.870
 all theories have been checked in 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.610
 percentage probability I give 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.800
 you without gaps theory one 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.890
 three percent probability of 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.780
 gaps theory based on the daniel 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.940
 In 927 he is the messiah theory one 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.940
 six percent probability of 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.040
 gaps theory based on the dani 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.680
 In 927 he is the antichrist theory one 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.709
 25 percent chance of 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.690
 gap theory based on dani 927 he 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.450
 is the antichrist theory and the 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.730
 daniel nine 25 arrival of the antichrist 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.440
 theory a 66 percent 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.150
 Probability in the next part 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.569
 Let's have a look at the captain 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.569
 more exactly
