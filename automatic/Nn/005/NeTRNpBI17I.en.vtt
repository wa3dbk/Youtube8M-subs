welcome<00:00:01.560> to<00:00:01.680> a<00:00:01.709> lesson<00:00:01.890> on<00:00:02.159> complex<00:00:02.669> numbers

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
welcome to a lesson on complex numbers

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.210 
welcome to a lesson on complex numbers
the<00:00:03.990> goals<00:00:04.230> of<00:00:04.440> this<00:00:04.529> video<00:00:04.710> are<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:04.980> identify

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
the goals of this video are to identify

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.240 
the goals of this video are to identify
imaginary<00:00:06.150> and<00:00:06.299> complex<00:00:06.330> numbers<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.319> also

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
imaginary and complex numbers and also

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.970 
imaginary and complex numbers and also
to<00:00:08.309> simplify<00:00:09.830> imaginary<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:10.950> complex

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
to simplify imaginary and complex

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.140 
to simplify imaginary and complex
numbers<00:00:13.340> so<00:00:14.340> if<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.580> were<00:00:14.670> asked<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.940> solve

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
numbers so if you were asked to solve

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.740 
numbers so if you were asked to solve
the<00:00:15.389> equation<00:00:15.839> x<00:00:16.080> squared<00:00:16.410> plus<00:00:16.740> 1<00:00:17.160> equals<00:00:17.369> 0

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
the equation x squared plus 1 equals 0

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.300 
the equation x squared plus 1 equals 0
you<00:00:18.750> may<00:00:18.900> try<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.109> factor<00:00:19.439> this<00:00:19.800> but<00:00:20.189> that

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
you may try to factor this but that

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.349 
you may try to factor this but that
wouldn't<00:00:20.609> work<00:00:20.730> because<00:00:21.029> it's<00:00:21.180> not<00:00:21.330> a

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
wouldn't work because it's not a

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.480 
wouldn't work because it's not a
difference<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.840> squares<00:00:22.220> then<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:23.340> may

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
difference of squares then you may

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.330 
difference of squares then you may
resort<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.420> quadratic<00:00:24.960> formula<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.740> that

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
resort to the quadratic formula and that

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.519 
resort to the quadratic formula and that
would<00:00:26.519> work<00:00:26.789> but<00:00:27.599> we<00:00:27.720> could<00:00:27.840> also<00:00:27.960> just<00:00:28.109> solve

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
would work but we could also just solve

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.310 
would work but we could also just solve
this<00:00:28.710> equation<00:00:28.769> using<00:00:29.609> square<00:00:29.939> roots<00:00:30.320> meaning

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
this equation using square roots meaning

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.350 
this equation using square roots meaning
if<00:00:31.529> we<00:00:31.650> isolate<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.340> x<00:00:32.579> squared<00:00:33.120> by

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
if we isolate the x squared by

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.959 
if we isolate the x squared by
subtracting<00:00:33.420> 1<00:00:34.050> on<00:00:34.350> both<00:00:34.680> sides<00:00:35.010> we<00:00:35.850> would

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
subtracting 1 on both sides we would

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.490 
subtracting 1 on both sides we would
have<00:00:36.120> x<00:00:36.360> squared<00:00:37.070> equals<00:00:38.070> negative<00:00:38.430> 1<00:00:39.469> now<00:00:40.469> I

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
have x squared equals negative 1 now I

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.360 
have x squared equals negative 1 now I
can<00:00:40.800> take<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.129> square<00:00:41.340> root<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.640> both<00:00:41.820> sides<00:00:41.879> I

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
can take the square root of both sides I

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.069 
can take the square root of both sides I
may<00:00:44.370> come<00:00:44.550> up<00:00:44.610> with<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> solution<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.360> says<00:00:45.750> X

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
may come up with a solution that says X

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.950 
may come up with a solution that says X
is<00:00:46.260> equal<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.620> plus<00:00:47.520> or<00:00:47.820> minus<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.360> square

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
is equal to plus or minus the square

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.279 
is equal to plus or minus the square
root<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.200> negative<00:00:49.469> 1<00:00:49.980> or<00:00:50.250> x<00:00:51.000> equals<00:00:51.289> positive

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
negative square root negative 1 this is

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.420 
negative square root negative 1 this is
actually<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.030> new<00:01:00.270> type<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.840> solution<00:01:01.530> which

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
actually a new type of solution which

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.549 
actually a new type of solution which
leads<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.969> new<00:01:03.239> set<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.510> numbers<00:01:03.629> because

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
leads to a new set of numbers because

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.850 
leads to a new set of numbers because
we're<00:01:05.159> not<00:01:05.309> used<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.640> having<00:01:06.439> the<00:01:07.439> square<00:01:07.770> root

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
we're not used to having the square root

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.620 
we're not used to having the square root
of<00:01:07.950> negative<00:01:08.130> numbers<00:01:08.729> but<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.090> fact<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:09.510> we

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
of negative numbers but in fact if we

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.570 
of negative numbers but in fact if we
sub<00:01:09.960> these<00:01:10.140> into<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.619> original<00:01:10.740> equation<00:01:11.369> for

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
sub these into the original equation for

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.030 
sub these into the original equation for
X<00:01:11.790> remember<00:01:12.780> if<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.170> square<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.560> square<00:01:14.010> root

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
X remember if you square a square root

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.679 
X remember if you square a square root
they<00:01:14.340> undo<00:01:14.670> each<00:01:14.820> other<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.119> these<00:01:15.420> are

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
they undo each other so these are

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.950 
they undo each other so these are
solutions<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.799> equation<00:01:17.299> this<00:01:18.299> led<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.659> a

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
solutions to this equation this led to a

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.020 
solutions to this equation this led to a
new<00:01:19.200> set<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.439> numbers<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.100> two<00:01:20.850> new

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
new set of numbers and two new

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.899 
new set of numbers and two new
definitions<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:23.159> equal<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
definitions that I is equal to the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.660 
definitions that I is equal to the
square<00:01:24.240> root<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.509> negative<00:01:24.720> 1<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:26.189> squared

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
square root of negative 1 and I squared

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.380 
square root of negative 1 and I squared
is<00:01:26.850> equal<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.150> negative<00:01:27.420> 1<00:01:28.220> so<00:01:29.220> again<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:30.119> led

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
is equal to negative 1 so again this led

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.090 
is equal to negative 1 so again this led
to<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.630> new<00:01:30.930> set<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.170> numbers<00:01:31.619> called<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
to a new set of numbers called the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.550 
to a new set of numbers called the
imaginary<00:01:32.670> numbers<00:01:33.000> which<00:01:33.659> then<00:01:33.930> led<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.409> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
imaginary numbers which then led to the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.969 
imaginary numbers which then led to the
set<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:35.040> complex<00:01:35.400> numbers<00:01:36.259> first<00:01:37.259> imaginary

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
set of complex numbers first imaginary

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.830 
set of complex numbers first imaginary
numbers<00:01:38.310> are<00:01:38.549> those<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.119> form<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.659> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
numbers are those in the form of the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.710 
numbers are those in the form of the
square<00:01:39.990> root<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.619> where<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> negative

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
square root of a where a is a negative

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.580 
square root of a where a is a negative
real<00:01:43.530> number<00:01:44.329> here<00:01:45.329> are<00:01:45.479> three<00:01:45.689> examples<00:01:45.810> of

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
real number here are three examples of

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.490 
real number here are three examples of
imaginary<00:01:47.310> numbers<00:01:47.780> we<00:01:48.780> can<00:01:48.930> simplify<00:01:49.229> these

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
imaginary numbers we can simplify these

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.710 
imaginary numbers we can simplify these
very<00:01:50.220> similar<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.939> how<00:01:51.060> we<00:01:51.090> simplify<00:01:51.420> square

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
very similar to how we simplify square

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.319 
very similar to how we simplify square
roots<00:01:52.430> except<00:01:53.430> now<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:53.759> have<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> new

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
roots except now we have a new

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.440 
roots except now we have a new
definition<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:55.259> deal<00:01:55.439> with<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.860> negative<00:01:56.450> so

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
definition to deal with the negative so

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.270 
definition to deal with the negative so
we<00:01:57.540> could<00:01:57.689> rewrite<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.020> as<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.890> square<00:01:59.130> root

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
we could rewrite this as the square root

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.940 
we could rewrite this as the square root
of<00:01:59.729> negative<00:02:00.509> 1<00:02:01.049> times<00:02:01.369> 64<00:02:03.350> which<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.500> equal<00:02:04.770> to

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
of negative 1 times 64 which is equal to

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.580 
of negative 1 times 64 which is equal to
the<00:02:05.340> square<00:02:05.610> root<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.790> negative<00:02:06.060> 1<00:02:06.630> times<00:02:07.229> the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
the square root of negative 1 times the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.760 
the square root of negative 1 times the
square<00:02:07.619> root<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.039> 64<00:02:08.959> well<00:02:09.959> now<00:02:10.140> by<00:02:10.379> definition

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
square root of 64 well now by definition

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.910 
square root of 64 well now by definition
this<00:02:11.129> is<00:02:11.190> equal<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.989> this<00:02:12.989> is<00:02:13.170> equal<00:02:13.470> to

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
this is equal to I this is equal to

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.740 
this is equal to I this is equal to
eight<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.640> this<00:02:14.760> simplifies<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.360> the

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
eight so this simplifies to the

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.330 
eight so this simplifies to the
imaginary<00:02:16.230> number<00:02:16.560> eight<00:02:16.800> I<00:02:18.410> on<00:02:19.410> this<00:02:19.950> next

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
imaginary number eight I on this next

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.809 
imaginary number eight I on this next
one<00:02:20.630> this<00:02:21.630> is<00:02:21.989> negative<00:02:22.530> two<00:02:22.770> times<00:02:23.400> the

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
one this is negative two times the

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.540 
one this is negative two times the
square<00:02:24.090> root<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.239> negative<00:02:24.390> 16<00:02:25.230> it's<00:02:26.130> negative

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
square root of negative 16 it's negative

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.960 
square root of negative 16 it's negative
two<00:02:26.790> times<00:02:27.330> square<00:02:28.110> root<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.590> negative<00:02:29.400> one

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
two times square root of negative one

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.930 
two times square root of negative one
times<00:02:30.360> 16<00:02:31.080> so<00:02:31.920> really<00:02:32.069> it's<00:02:32.250> very<00:02:32.280> similar<00:02:32.790> to

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
times 16 so really it's very similar to

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.280 
times 16 so really it's very similar to
what<00:02:33.030> we've<00:02:33.150> been<00:02:33.180> doing<00:02:33.569> in<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.750> past<00:02:33.930> with

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
what we've been doing in the past with

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.720 
what we've been doing in the past with
square<00:02:34.530> roots<00:02:34.739> we<00:02:34.980> just<00:02:35.160> have<00:02:35.310> an<00:02:35.430> extra

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
square roots we just have an extra

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.420 
square roots we just have an extra
factor<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.330> negative<00:02:36.480> one<00:02:36.930> which<00:02:37.680> gives<00:02:38.010> us<00:02:38.220> an

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
factor of negative one which gives us an

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.059 
factor of negative one which gives us an
I<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:40.019> you<00:02:40.110> can<00:02:40.230> probably<00:02:40.440> see<00:02:40.739> this<00:02:40.890> would<00:02:41.040> be

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
I so you can probably see this would be

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.000 
I so you can probably see this would be
negative<00:02:41.610> two<00:02:41.880> times<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:43.380> would<00:02:43.620> be<00:02:43.739> equal

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
negative two times this would be equal

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.390 
negative two times this would be equal
to<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:44.190> this<00:02:44.400> would<00:02:44.940> be<00:02:45.060> equal<00:02:45.239> to<00:02:45.420> four<00:02:46.310> so<00:02:47.310> we'd

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
to I this would be equal to four so we'd

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.940 
to I this would be equal to four so we'd
have<00:02:47.430> negative<00:02:47.730> two<00:02:48.090> times<00:02:48.569> four<00:02:49.080> I<00:02:49.110> which<00:02:49.920> is

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
have negative two times four I which is

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.140 
have negative two times four I which is
equal<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.519> negative<00:02:50.910> eight<00:02:51.360> I<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.970> square

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
equal to negative eight I the square

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.220 
equal to negative eight I the square
root<00:02:54.299> of<00:02:54.330> negative<00:02:54.450> 27<00:02:55.549> is<00:02:56.549> equal<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:57.230> negative

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
root of negative 27 is equal to negative

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.840 
root of negative 27 is equal to negative
one<00:02:58.799> times<00:02:59.510> 27<00:03:00.680> 27<00:03:01.680> is<00:03:01.950> not<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.130> perfect<00:03:02.610> square

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
one times 27 27 is not a perfect square

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.910 
one times 27 27 is not a perfect square
so<00:03:03.239> it<00:03:03.420> would<00:03:03.510> be<00:03:03.660> three<00:03:03.989> times<00:03:04.440> three<00:03:04.890> times

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
so it would be three times three times

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.380 
so it would be three times three times
three<00:03:06.260> so<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:08.190> square<00:03:08.519> root<00:03:08.610> of<00:03:08.640> negative<00:03:08.850> one

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
three so the square root of negative one

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.289 
three so the square root of negative one
simplifies<00:03:10.019> to<00:03:10.049> I<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:11.670> square<00:03:11.970> root<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.090> nine

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
simplifies to I the square root of nine

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.710 
simplifies to I the square root of nine
simplifies<00:03:13.049> to<00:03:13.080> 3<00:03:14.030> so<00:03:15.030> this<00:03:15.180> will<00:03:15.330> give<00:03:15.450> us<00:03:15.480> a

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
simplifies to 3 so this will give us a

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.920 
simplifies to 3 so this will give us a
3i<00:03:16.350> and<00:03:17.069> then<00:03:17.730> we're<00:03:17.880> left<00:03:18.030> with<00:03:18.329> square<00:03:18.690> root

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
3i and then we're left with square root

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.970 
3i and then we're left with square root
3<00:03:20.420> now<00:03:21.420> if<00:03:21.540> we<00:03:21.660> try<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.900> solve<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.380> equation<00:03:22.769> x

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
3 now if we try to solve the equation x

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.270 
3 now if we try to solve the equation x
squared<00:03:23.340> minus<00:03:23.730> 10x<00:03:23.970> plus<00:03:24.239> 34<00:03:24.959> equals<00:03:25.290> 0<00:03:25.530> that

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
squared minus 10x plus 34 equals 0 that

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.090 
squared minus 10x plus 34 equals 0 that
also<00:03:26.310> doesn't<00:03:27.060> factor<00:03:27.530> so<00:03:28.530> we<00:03:28.650> would<00:03:28.859> apply

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
also doesn't factor so we would apply

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.729 
also doesn't factor so we would apply

the quadratic formula I've already done

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.740 
the quadratic formula I've already done
this<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:32.100> save<00:03:32.280> some<00:03:32.549> time<00:03:32.850> but<00:03:33.390> what's<00:03:33.570> new

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
this to save some time but what's new

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.090 
this to save some time but what's new
about<00:03:33.870> this<00:03:34.019> is<00:03:34.350> when<00:03:34.470> we<00:03:34.560> simplify<00:03:34.769> the

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
about this is when we simplify the

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.670 
about this is when we simplify the
discriminant<00:03:35.880> we<00:03:36.480> we<00:03:36.930> end<00:03:37.079> up<00:03:37.200> getting<00:03:37.380> the

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
discriminant we we end up getting the

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.830 
discriminant we we end up getting the
square<00:03:37.980> root<00:03:38.070> of<00:03:38.160> negative<00:03:38.310> 36<00:03:38.880> which<00:03:39.510> leads

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
square root of negative 36 which leads

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.009 
square root of negative 36 which leads
to<00:03:40.400> part<00:03:41.400> of<00:03:41.489> this<00:03:41.640> answer<00:03:42.060> being<00:03:42.390> imaginary

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
to part of this answer being imaginary

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.039 
to part of this answer being imaginary
so<00:03:43.530> we<00:03:43.620> have<00:03:43.709> 10<00:03:44.010> plus<00:03:44.640> or<00:03:44.820> minus<00:03:45.090> 6i<00:03:45.540> all

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
so we have 10 plus or minus 6i all

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.729 
so we have 10 plus or minus 6i all
divided<00:03:47.010> by<00:03:47.040> 2<00:03:47.390> we<00:03:48.390> divide<00:03:48.540> both<00:03:48.989> terms<00:03:49.410> the

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
divided by 2 we divide both terms the

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.690 
divided by 2 we divide both terms the
numerator<00:03:50.130> by<00:03:50.310> 2<00:03:50.370> we<00:03:51.030> have<00:03:51.209> 5<00:03:51.630> plus<00:03:52.140> 3i<00:03:52.700> so

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
numerator by 2 we have 5 plus 3i so

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.819 
numerator by 2 we have 5 plus 3i so
there<00:03:53.910> is<00:03:54.030> an<00:03:54.180> imaginary<00:03:54.690> number<00:03:54.780> as<00:03:55.320> part<00:03:55.709> of

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
there is an imaginary number as part of

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.009 
there is an imaginary number as part of
this<00:03:55.950> solution<00:03:56.209> but<00:03:57.209> there's<00:03:57.390> also<00:03:57.569> a<00:03:57.720> real

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
this solution but there's also a real

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.559 
this solution but there's also a real
part<00:03:58.380> and<00:03:58.560> that<00:03:59.190> led<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.489> another<00:04:00.269> set<00:04:00.480> of

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
part and that led to another set of

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.890 
part and that led to another set of

square<00:04:10.980> root<00:04:11.010> of<00:04:11.100> negative<00:04:11.280> 1<00:04:11.700> so<00:04:11.940> we<00:04:12.030> have<00:04:12.180> a

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
square root of negative 1 so we have a

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.170 
square root of negative 1 so we have a
real<00:04:12.510> part<00:04:12.870> that's<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.739> a<00:04:13.769> part<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:14.549> we<00:04:15.150> have

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
real part that's the a part and we have

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.650 
real part that's the a part and we have
the<00:04:15.569> imaginary<00:04:16.049> part<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.590> BI<00:04:16.919> part<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.700> a

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
the imaginary part the BI part and a

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.289 
the imaginary part the BI part and a
plus<00:04:18.959> bi<00:04:19.200> is<00:04:19.380> called<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.070> standard<00:04:20.549> form<00:04:20.940> of<00:04:21.120> a

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
plus bi is called the standard form of a

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.710 
plus bi is called the standard form of a
complex<00:04:21.570> number<00:04:23.300> so<00:04:24.300> if<00:04:24.360> we<00:04:24.419> wanted<00:04:24.659> to

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
complex number so if we wanted to

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.300 
complex number so if we wanted to
simplify<00:04:24.900> these<00:04:25.409> complex<00:04:26.130> numbers

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
simplify these complex numbers

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.060 
simplify these complex numbers
in<00:04:27.340> the<00:04:27.460> form<00:04:27.669> of<00:04:27.790> a<00:04:27.940> +<00:04:28.240> bi<00:04:28.620> we<00:04:29.620> still<00:04:29.860> need<00:04:30.010> to

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
in the form of a + bi we still need to

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.420 
in the form of a + bi we still need to
simplify<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.580> imaginary<00:04:31.270> part<00:04:32.280> so<00:04:33.280> we'd<00:04:33.400> have

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
simplify the imaginary part so we'd have

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.500 
simplify the imaginary part so we'd have
7<00:04:34.030> minus<00:04:35.010> square<00:04:36.010> root<00:04:36.100> of<00:04:36.220> negative<00:04:36.610> 1<00:04:37.150> times

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
7 minus square root of negative 1 times

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.610 
7 minus square root of negative 1 times
4<00:04:38.700> we<00:04:39.700> know<00:04:39.880> now<00:04:40.150> this<00:04:40.389> will<00:04:40.600> give<00:04:40.750> us<00:04:40.780> I<00:04:41.230> we

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
4 we know now this will give us I we

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.640 
4 we know now this will give us I we
know<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:41.889> square<00:04:42.070> root<00:04:42.250> of<00:04:42.310> 4<00:04:42.580> is<00:04:42.610> 2<00:04:43.470> so<00:04:44.470> this

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
know the square root of 4 is 2 so this

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:51.990 
know the square root of 4 is 2 so this
would<00:04:44.830> simplify<00:04:45.040> to<00:04:46.530> 7<00:04:47.530> minus<00:04:48.040> 2i<00:04:50.010> and<00:04:51.010> again

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
would simplify to 7 minus 2i and again

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.909 
would simplify to 7 minus 2i and again
it's<00:04:52.150> in<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.300> form<00:04:52.600> of<00:04:52.750> a<00:04:52.900> +<00:04:53.530> bi<00:04:55.740> let's<00:04:56.740> take<00:04:56.889> a

it's in the form of a + bi let's take a

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.930 
it's in the form of a + bi let's take a
look<00:04:57.160> at<00:04:57.250> one<00:04:57.400> more<00:04:57.610> here

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.830 

after<00:05:00.940> you<00:05:01.030> do<00:05:01.150> these<00:05:01.330> a<00:05:01.360> while<00:05:01.600> you<00:05:01.810> probably

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
after you do these a while you probably

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.469 
after you do these a while you probably
look<00:05:02.260> at<00:05:02.380> that<00:05:02.530> and<00:05:02.710> see<00:05:02.889> 3i<00:05:03.310> but<00:05:04.270> for<00:05:04.419> the

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
look at that and see 3i but for the

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.300 
look at that and see 3i but for the
purpose<00:05:04.780> of<00:05:04.900> showing<00:05:05.139> work<00:05:05.500> let's<00:05:06.010> go<00:05:06.220> ahead

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
purpose of showing work let's go ahead

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.310 
purpose of showing work let's go ahead
and<00:05:06.840> rewrite<00:05:07.840> this<00:05:08.050> as<00:05:08.290> negative<00:05:08.800> 1<00:05:09.070> times<00:05:09.100> 9

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
and rewrite this as negative 1 times 9

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:17.010 
and rewrite this as negative 1 times 9
all<00:05:11.320> over<00:05:11.380> 4<00:05:13.139> so<00:05:14.139> we'd<00:05:14.320> have<00:05:14.470> 6<00:05:14.860> plus<00:05:15.960> now<00:05:16.960> the

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
all over 4 so we'd have 6 plus now the

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.570 
all over 4 so we'd have 6 plus now the
square<00:05:17.440> root<00:05:17.560> negative<00:05:17.650> 1<00:05:17.950> will<00:05:18.100> give<00:05:18.250> us<00:05:18.370> I

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
square root negative 1 will give us I

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.550 
square root negative 1 will give us I
the<00:05:18.639> square<00:05:19.060> of<00:05:19.150> 9<00:05:19.240> will<00:05:19.450> give<00:05:19.479> us<00:05:19.720> 3<00:05:20.110> this<00:05:20.350> is

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
the square of 9 will give us 3 this is

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.560 
the square of 9 will give us 3 this is
equal<00:05:20.800> to<00:05:20.860> 3<00:05:21.100> I<00:05:21.130> times<00:05:21.729> 4<00:05:22.260> that<00:05:23.260> would<00:05:23.410> be<00:05:23.530> 12<00:05:23.800> I

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
equal to 3 I times 4 that would be 12 I

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.260 
equal to 3 I times 4 that would be 12 I
all<00:05:25.570> divided<00:05:26.320> by<00:05:26.350> 4<00:05:26.940> now<00:05:27.940> be<00:05:28.090> careful

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
all divided by 4 now be careful

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.450 
all divided by 4 now be careful
simplifying<00:05:29.050> here<00:05:29.169> we<00:05:29.470> cannot<00:05:29.740> just<00:05:30.010> simplify

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
simplifying here we cannot just simplify

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.029 
simplifying here we cannot just simplify
the<00:05:30.520> 6<00:05:30.910> and<00:05:31.120> the<00:05:31.180> 4<00:05:31.510> we<00:05:32.320> cannot<00:05:32.620> simplify

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
the 6 and the 4 we cannot simplify

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:35.550 
the 6 and the 4 we cannot simplify
across<00:05:33.460> addition<00:05:34.110> so<00:05:35.110> we<00:05:35.200> should<00:05:35.380> rewrite

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
across addition so we should rewrite

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.820 
across addition so we should rewrite
this<00:05:35.979> as<00:05:36.280> two<00:05:36.610> separate<00:05:36.970> fractions<00:05:37.270> 6<00:05:37.930> divided

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
this as two separate fractions 6 divided

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.320 
this as two separate fractions 6 divided
by<00:05:38.860> 4<00:05:38.950> plus<00:05:39.960> 12<00:05:40.960> I<00:05:41.229> divided<00:05:41.770> by<00:05:41.890> 4<00:05:42.280> this<00:05:42.970> gives

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
by 4 plus 12 I divided by 4 this gives

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.210 
by 4 plus 12 I divided by 4 this gives
us<00:05:43.510> three-halves<00:05:44.140> plus<00:05:45.419> 3i<00:05:47.070> again<00:05:48.070> in<00:05:48.160> the

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
us three-halves plus 3i again in the

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:27.120 
next since the complex numbers are made
up<00:06:24.940> of<00:06:25.060> a<00:06:25.900> real<00:06:26.110> part<00:06:26.440> and<00:06:26.560> imaginary<00:06:26.650> part

up of a real part and imaginary part

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.550 
up of a real part and imaginary part
these<00:06:28.090> two<00:06:28.419> sets<00:06:28.720> would<00:06:28.870> be<00:06:28.960> the<00:06:29.080> real<00:06:29.229> numbers

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
these two sets would be the real numbers

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.860 
these two sets would be the real numbers
and<00:06:29.710> the<00:06:29.800> imaginary<00:06:29.830> numbers<00:06:30.600> so<00:06:31.600> the<00:06:31.690> real

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
and the imaginary numbers so the real

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.330 
and the imaginary numbers so the real
numbers<00:06:32.229> denoted<00:06:32.560> with<00:06:32.650> a<00:06:32.740> capital<00:06:33.010> R<00:06:35.340> would

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
numbers denoted with a capital R would

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.730 
numbers denoted with a capital R would
be<00:06:36.400> here<00:06:37.030> and<00:06:37.240> the<00:06:37.900> imaginary<00:06:38.320> numbers<00:06:38.590> would

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
be here and the imaginary numbers would

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.100 
be here and the imaginary numbers would
be<00:06:38.770> over<00:06:39.190> here<00:06:39.520> they<00:06:39.729> do<00:06:39.849> not<00:06:39.880> overlap<00:06:40.150> now

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
be over here they do not overlap now

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.660 
be over here they do not overlap now
remaining<00:06:41.440> sets<00:06:41.980> are<00:06:42.160> ones<00:06:42.340> we've<00:06:42.550> already

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:42.670

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.530 
of algebra so let's go ahead and start
with<00:06:46.930> this<00:06:47.080> innermost<00:06:47.640> rectangle<00:06:48.640> if<00:06:49.450> you

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
with this innermost rectangle if you

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.360 
with this innermost rectangle if you
take<00:06:49.690> a<00:06:49.720> look<00:06:49.960> at<00:06:50.020> the<00:06:50.110> remaining<00:06:50.620> sets<00:06:50.980> here

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370 
take a look at the remaining sets here

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:52.820 
take a look at the remaining sets here
we<00:06:51.490> have<00:06:51.610> natural<00:06:52.030> numbers<00:06:52.330> whole<00:06:52.360> numbers

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:52.830 
we have natural numbers whole numbers

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.580 
we have natural numbers whole numbers

the<00:06:56.740> natural<00:06:56.950> numbers<00:06:57.430> are<00:06:57.460> 1<00:06:58.060> 2<00:06:58.300> 3<00:06:58.570> or<00:06:58.750> the

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 
the natural numbers are 1 2 3 or the

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.270 
the natural numbers are 1 2 3 or the
counting<00:06:59.140> numbers<00:06:59.260> they<00:06:59.620> would<00:06:59.770> be<00:06:59.920> the

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 
counting numbers they would be the

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.510 
counting numbers they would be the
innermost<00:07:00.550> set<00:07:01.740> next<00:07:02.740> the<00:07:03.010> only<00:07:03.220> difference

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 
innermost set next the only difference

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.680 
innermost set next the only difference
between<00:07:03.760> whole<00:07:04.030> numbers<00:07:04.060> and<00:07:04.630> natural

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:04.690 
between whole numbers and natural

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.170 
between whole numbers and natural
numbers<00:07:04.960> is<00:07:05.520> that<00:07:06.520> the<00:07:06.640> set<00:07:06.820> of<00:07:06.910> whole<00:07:07.150> numbers

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.180 
numbers is that the set of whole numbers

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.950 
numbers is that the set of whole numbers
includes<00:07:08.140> 0<00:07:08.590> so<00:07:09.040> that<00:07:09.160> would<00:07:09.310> be<00:07:09.400> the<00:07:09.520> next<00:07:09.880> set

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.290 

next<00:07:13.960> comes<00:07:14.230> the<00:07:14.320> integers<00:07:14.830> integers<00:07:15.670> consist

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:16.300 
next comes the integers integers consist

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.390 
next comes the integers integers consist
of<00:07:16.570> positive<00:07:17.290> and<00:07:17.440> negative<00:07:17.470> natural<00:07:17.950> numbers

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 
of positive and negative natural numbers

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.520 
of positive and negative natural numbers
and<00:07:18.610> zero<00:07:18.640> so<00:07:19.330> that<00:07:19.450> would<00:07:19.540> be<00:07:19.630> the<00:07:19.750> next<00:07:20.110> set

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:20.530 
and zero so that would be the next set

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:25.310 
and zero so that would be the next set
and<00:07:22.410> now<00:07:23.410> we're<00:07:23.590> left<00:07:23.710> with<00:07:23.890> two<00:07:24.130> sets<00:07:24.520> and

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:25.320 
and now we're left with two sets and

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.870 
and now we're left with two sets and
that's<00:07:26.320> going<00:07:26.470> to<00:07:26.530> consist<00:07:26.950> of<00:07:27.130> the<00:07:27.310> rational

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:27.880 
that's going to consist of the rational

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.510 
that's going to consist of the rational
and<00:07:28.090> irrational<00:07:28.270> numbers<00:07:29.220> natural<00:07:30.220> numbers

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520 
and irrational numbers natural numbers

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.810 
and irrational numbers natural numbers
whole<00:07:30.550> numbers<00:07:30.880> and<00:07:31.330> integers<00:07:31.450> are<00:07:31.840> rational

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:32.820 
whole numbers and integers are rational

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.220 
whole numbers and integers are rational
so<00:07:33.820> that<00:07:34.000> would<00:07:34.150> be<00:07:34.300> within<00:07:34.600> the<00:07:34.750> set<00:07:35.080> of

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:35.230 
so that would be within the set of

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.770 
so that would be within the set of
rational<00:07:35.650> numbers<00:07:35.980> which<00:07:36.970> leaves<00:07:37.330> this<00:07:37.600> set

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:37.780 
rational numbers which leaves this set

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.210 
rational numbers which leaves this set
over<00:07:37.870> here<00:07:38.020> to<00:07:38.470> be<00:07:38.620> the<00:07:38.890> irrational<00:07:39.730> numbers

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:41.220 
over here to be the irrational numbers

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.860 
over here to be the irrational numbers
so<00:07:42.220> it<00:07:42.340> is<00:07:42.430> important<00:07:42.970> to<00:07:43.090> know<00:07:43.270> how<00:07:43.480> the<00:07:43.540> sets

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:43.870 
so it is important to know how the sets

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.930 
so it is important to know how the sets
of<00:07:43.960> numbers<00:07:44.260> relate<00:07:44.500> to<00:07:44.650> one<00:07:44.830> another<00:07:44.880> so<00:07:45.880> you

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:45.940 
of numbers relate to one another so you

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.580 
of numbers relate to one another so you
might<00:07:46.120> consider<00:07:46.240> sketching<00:07:46.960> one<00:07:47.380> of<00:07:47.500> these

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:47.590 
might consider sketching one of these

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:51.030 
might consider sketching one of these
diagrams<00:07:48.160> into<00:07:48.490> your<00:07:48.640> notes<00:07:49.650> we<00:07:50.650> will<00:07:50.830> cover
