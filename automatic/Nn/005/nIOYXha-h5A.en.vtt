show<00:00:39.970> to<00:00:40.030> make<00:00:40.329> because<00:00:40.540> everything<00:00:40.989> has<00:00:41.079> to

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
show to make because everything has to

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.530 
show to make because everything has to
be<00:00:41.200> filmed<00:00:41.650> and<00:00:41.800> edited<00:00:41.970> within<00:00:42.970> a<00:00:43.060> week<00:00:43.270> and

be filmed and edited within a week and

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.440 
be filmed and edited within a week and
yet<00:00:43.870> it<00:00:43.989> looks<00:00:44.020> like<00:00:44.410> something<00:00:44.650> that's<00:00:44.920> made

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
yet it looks like something that's made

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.760 
yet it looks like something that's made
over<00:00:46.450> several<00:00:46.690> weeks<00:00:46.810> that<00:00:47.230> quality<00:00:47.680> of

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
over several weeks that quality of

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.170 
over several weeks that quality of
editing<00:00:48.100> because<00:00:48.250> it's<00:00:48.430> really<00:00:48.640> all<00:00:48.820> in<00:00:49.090> the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
editing because it's really all in the

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.210 
editing because it's really all in the
craft<00:00:49.450> skill<00:00:49.810> of<00:00:49.960> putting<00:00:50.290> it<00:00:50.410> together<00:00:50.530> yeah

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
craft skill of putting it together yeah

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.040 
craft skill of putting it together yeah
I<00:00:51.250> mean<00:00:51.489> and<00:00:51.670> each<00:00:51.880> show<00:00:52.210> creates<00:00:52.660> one<00:00:52.930> of

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
I mean and each show creates one of

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.569 
I mean and each show creates one of
those<00:00:53.140> watercooler<00:00:53.920> moments<00:00:53.950> when<00:00:54.460> you're

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
those watercooler moments when you're

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:55.860 
those watercooler moments when you're
talking<00:00:54.970> about<00:00:55.149> what<00:00:55.329> people<00:00:55.720> were<00:00:55.840> talking

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
talking about what people were talking

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.049 
talking about what people were talking
about<00:00:56.290> about<00:00:56.739> Asher<00:00:57.070> so<00:00:57.280> it's<00:00:57.520> it<00:00:57.760> is

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
about about Asher so it's it is

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.520 
about about Asher so it's it is
brilliant<00:00:58.329> from<00:00:58.630> that<00:00:58.780> point<00:00:58.989> if<00:00:59.140> you<00:00:59.200> did<00:00:59.410> you

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
brilliant from that point if you did you

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.560 
brilliant from that point if you did you
expect<00:00:59.950> it<00:01:00.219> to<00:01:00.430> be<00:01:00.579> as<00:01:00.700> successful<00:01:00.969> and<00:01:01.450> as

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
expect it to be as successful and as

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.130 
expect it to be as successful and as
well<00:01:01.750> received<00:01:03.059> no<00:01:04.059> because<00:01:04.420> it's<00:01:04.659> quite<00:01:04.869> hard

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
well received no because it's quite hard

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.080 
well received no because it's quite hard
to<00:01:05.259> sort<00:01:05.740> of<00:01:05.799> expect<00:01:06.220> that<00:01:06.400> from<00:01:06.549> the<00:01:06.700> off<00:01:06.850> but

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
to sort of expect that from the off but

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.380 
to sort of expect that from the off but
I<00:01:07.120> think<00:01:07.450> I<00:01:07.570> knew<00:01:07.990> when<00:01:08.920> we<00:01:09.250> were<00:01:09.460> creating<00:01:10.240> it

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
I think I knew when we were creating it

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.780 
I think I knew when we were creating it
I<00:01:10.540> knew<00:01:10.900> that<00:01:11.170> if<00:01:11.320> it<00:01:11.440> was<00:01:11.590> funny<00:01:11.860> people<00:01:12.670> would

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
I knew that if it was funny people would

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.969 
I knew that if it was funny people would
watch<00:01:13.000> it<00:01:13.330> but<00:01:13.870> what<00:01:14.020> we<00:01:14.170> got<00:01:14.380> was<00:01:14.530> a<00:01:14.590> whole<00:01:14.799> lot

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979

watch it but what we got was a whole lot
more<00:01:15.159> because<00:01:15.430> I<00:01:15.700> didn't<00:01:15.940> realize<00:01:16.210> we<00:01:16.420> get<00:01:16.630> so

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
more because I didn't realize we get so

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.350

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
fact that television still has ability

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.830 
fact that television still has ability

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
to make us laugh and cry and cry in the

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.030 
to make us laugh and cry and cry in the
way<00:01:28.960> that<00:01:29.170> you<00:01:29.229> know<00:01:29.470> there<00:01:29.680> were<00:01:29.740> grown<00:01:30.010> men

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
way that you know there were grown men

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.700 
way that you know there were grown men
on<00:01:30.400> goggle<00:01:30.729> box<00:01:30.820> bawling<00:01:31.570> at<00:01:31.810> some<00:01:32.170> things<00:01:32.200> and

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
on goggle box bawling at some things and

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.840 
on goggle box bawling at some things and
so<00:01:33.460> I<00:01:33.729> sort<00:01:34.330> of<00:01:34.390> thought<00:01:34.630> if<00:01:34.990> it<00:01:35.500> was<00:01:35.650> funny<00:01:35.890> it

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
so I sort of thought if it was funny it

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.730 
so I sort of thought if it was funny it
would<00:01:37.090> it<00:01:37.330> would<00:01:37.390> do<00:01:37.689> okay<00:01:38.080> but<00:01:38.439> we<00:01:38.560> got<00:01:38.710> a

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
would it would do okay but we got a

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.410 
would it would do okay but we got a
whole<00:01:38.920> lot<00:01:39.040> more<00:01:39.220> I<00:01:39.280> think<00:01:39.640> really<00:01:39.850> that<00:01:40.000> that

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
whole lot more I think really that that

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.020 
whole lot more I think really that that
was<00:01:40.600> the<00:01:40.720> thing<00:01:40.869> that<00:01:40.930> was<00:01:41.049> unexpected<00:01:41.590> and

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
was the thing that was unexpected and

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.490 
was the thing that was unexpected and
