00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
ends and so I wouldn't be surprised to

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.990 
ends and so I wouldn't be surprised to
see<00:00:37.469> one<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.890> those<00:00:37.980> two<00:00:38.280> we've<00:00:38.430> seen<00:00:38.640> luxury

attempted<00:00:39.390> twice<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:39.930> far<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.290> series

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
attempted twice so far in the series

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.229 
attempted twice so far in the series
well<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.250> first<00:00:41.489> game<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.850> was<00:00:41.969> definitely

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
well the first game it was definitely

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.729 
well the first game it was definitely
but<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.660> second<00:00:42.989> was<00:00:43.140> more<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.469> strange

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
but the second was more of a strange

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.799 
but the second was more of a strange
counter-attack<00:00:44.430> but<00:00:44.700> he<00:00:45.090> definitely<00:00:45.329> got<00:00:45.660> it

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
counter-attack but he definitely got it

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.569 
counter-attack but he definitely got it
the<00:00:45.899> first<00:00:45.930> game<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.620> destination<00:00:47.250> again

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the first game and on destination again

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.819 
the first game and on destination again
you<00:00:48.300> have<00:00:48.510> those<00:00:48.660> bridges<00:00:48.989> where<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.620> can

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
you have those bridges where you can

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.740 
you have those bridges where you can
defend<00:00:50.340> your<00:00:50.520> natural<00:00:50.910> fairly<00:00:51.239> easily<00:00:51.449> but

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
defend your natural fairly easily but

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.029 
defend your natural fairly easily but
your<00:00:52.079> main<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.469> just<00:00:52.649> kind<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:52.920> to

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
your main you just kind of have to

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.770 
your main you just kind of have to
defend<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.520> ramp<00:00:53.760> with<00:00:53.969> your<00:00:54.120> sim<00:00:54.329> city<00:00:54.570> but

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
defend a ramp with your sim city but

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.910 
defend a ramp with your sim city but
I'll<00:00:54.870> only<00:00:54.989> gets<00:00:55.289> going<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.710> same

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
I'll only gets going to be the same

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.490 
I'll only gets going to be the same
thing<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.969> really<00:00:57.149> only<00:00:57.390> unique<00:00:57.809> kind<00:00:58.440> of

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.290 
thing and the really only unique kind of
strange<00:00:58.890> geez<00:00:59.280> I've<00:00:59.489> seen<00:00:59.730> on<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.000> map<00:01:00.270> is

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
strange geez I've seen on this map is

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.299 
strange geez I've seen on this map is
the<00:01:00.600> borough<00:01:00.809> build<00:01:01.199> where<00:01:01.410> you've<00:01:01.530> get<00:01:02.160> about

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
the borough build where you've get about

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.100 
the borough build where you've get about
of<00:01:02.460> control<00:01:02.969> group<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.270> speedlings<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.019> then

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
of control group of speedlings and then

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.750 
of control group of speedlings and then
burrow<00:01:04.350> them<00:01:04.650> behind<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.129> minerals<00:01:05.489> among

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
burrow them behind the minerals among

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.130 
burrow them behind the minerals among
the<00:01:05.850> borough<00:01:05.970> them<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.780> haven't<00:01:07.020> actually

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
the borough them and I haven't actually

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.080 
the borough them and I haven't actually
seen<00:01:07.439> Lori<00:01:07.890> with<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.400> i<00:01:08.430> don't<00:01:08.640> think<00:01:08.850> i

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
seen Lori with that so i don't think i

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.399 
seen Lori with that so i don't think i
don't<00:01:09.630> i<00:01:09.750> don't<00:01:09.780> think<00:01:10.080> we're<00:01:10.170> going<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.380> see

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
don't i don't think we're going to see

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.320 
don't i don't think we're going to see
that<00:01:10.710> really<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.340> i<00:01:11.549> think<00:01:11.939> this<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.060> really

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
that really but i think this is really

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.760 
that really but i think this is really
too<00:01:12.540> predictable<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.439> can<00:01:13.590> get

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
too predictable on that can get

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.340 
too predictable on that can get
countered<00:01:14.159> by<00:01:14.280> single<00:01:14.700> pylons<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.420> either<00:01:16.020> way

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
countered by single pylons so either way

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.570 
countered by single pylons so either way
i'm<00:01:16.530> really<00:01:16.770> looking<00:01:16.890> forward<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.460> game

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
i'm really looking forward to this game

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.130 
i'm really looking forward to this game
what<00:01:17.939> do<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.090> think<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.450> mean<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.840> map<00:01:19.110> is

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
what do you think I mean this map is

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.020 
what do you think I mean this map is
destination<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.159> saw<00:01:20.340> light<00:01:20.580> when<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.820> came

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
destination we saw light when it came

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.660 
destination we saw light when it came
out<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.509> was<00:01:21.869> extremely<00:01:22.320> Protoss<00:01:22.890> dominated

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
out it was extremely Protoss dominated

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.550 
out it was extremely Protoss dominated
it<00:01:23.790> was<00:01:23.820> almost<00:01:24.290> seventy-five<00:01:25.290> or<00:01:25.320> eighty

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
it was almost seventy-five or eighty

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.410 
it was almost seventy-five or eighty
percent<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.250> now<00:01:26.340> we've<00:01:26.520> seen<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.820> swung<00:01:27.150> back

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
percent and now we've seen it swung back

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.899 
percent and now we've seen it swung back
in<00:01:27.689> xored<00:01:27.960> favor<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.650> zerg<00:01:29.130> one<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.460> think<00:01:29.610> like

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
in xored favor and zerg one I think like

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.390 
in xored favor and zerg one I think like
15<00:01:30.420> others<00:01:30.720> last<00:01:30.900> 20<00:01:31.350> games<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.220> don't

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
15 others last 20 games on it so I don't

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.219 
15 others last 20 games on it so I don't
really<00:01:32.549> know<00:01:32.820> what<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.020> say<00:01:34.200> about

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
really know what I you have to say about

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.050 
really know what I you have to say about
it<00:01:34.590> statistically<00:01:35.310> it's<00:01:35.340> balanced<00:01:35.909> but

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
it statistically it's balanced but

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.850 
it statistically it's balanced but
lately<00:01:36.270> zargham<00:01:36.750> just<00:01:36.960> been<00:01:37.079> dominating<00:01:37.710> on

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
lately zargham just been dominating on

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.440 
lately zargham just been dominating on
it<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.220> guess<00:01:38.430> we're<00:01:39.030> just<00:01:39.150> going<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.299> have

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
it so I guess we're just going to have

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.850 
it so I guess we're just going to have
to<00:01:39.509> wait<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.869> see<00:01:39.960> I'll<00:01:40.229> both<00:01:40.380> these<00:01:40.560> players

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
to wait and see I'll both these players

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.060 
to wait and see I'll both these players
play<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.520> know<00:01:41.579> hoja<00:01:42.119> beat<00:01:42.299> bc<00:01:42.720> when<00:01:42.899> the

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
play on and I know hoja beat bc when the

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.740 
play on and I know hoja beat bc when the
pro<00:01:44.070> league<00:01:44.130> playoffs<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.390> just<00:01:45.509> for

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
pro league playoffs in this and just for

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.469 
pro league playoffs in this and just for
st.<00:01:46.130> 10<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.490> was<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.850> most<00:01:47.970> recent<00:01:48.210> game

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
st. 10 so that was the most recent game

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.300 
st. 10 so that was the most recent game
I've<00:01:48.659> seen<00:01:48.899> this<00:01:49.049> whole<00:01:49.259> jumpers<00:01:49.619> be<00:01:49.799> super<00:01:50.189> ho

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
jaaye ended up taking out bee suit so I

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.530 
jaaye ended up taking out bee suit so I
don't<00:01:53.040> know<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.130> guess<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.030> wait<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.329> see

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
don't know I guess just to wait and see

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.209

is<00:02:13.300> proxy<00:02:14.300> gate<00:02:14.510> which<00:02:14.720> is<00:02:14.870> just<00:02:15.200> super<00:02:15.560> cheesy

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.580

that's<00:03:04.549> probably<00:03:04.970> what<00:03:05.150> will<00:03:05.269> he<00:03:05.329> be<00:03:05.359> see<00:03:05.570> from

that's probably what will he be see from

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.890 
that's probably what will he be see from
lectures<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:06.410> who<00:03:07.040> knows<00:03:07.250> also<00:03:07.970> a<00:03:08.000> really

lectures and who knows also a really

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.080 
lectures and who knows also a really
heavy<00:03:09.140> macro<00:03:09.680> style<00:03:09.950> so<00:03:10.280> long<00:03:10.459> style<00:03:10.700> has<00:03:10.910> been

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
heavy macro style so long style has been

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.509 
heavy macro style so long style has been
really<00:03:11.329> effective<00:03:11.510> on<00:03:11.930> this<00:03:12.049> map<00:03:12.260> so<00:03:13.100> I<00:03:13.130> mean

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
really effective on this map so I mean

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.150 
really effective on this map so I mean
that's<00:03:14.470> I<00:03:15.470> think<00:03:15.500> that's<00:03:15.799> what<00:03:15.920> made<00:03:16.070> the

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
that's I think that's what made the

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.530 
that's I think that's what made the
difference<00:03:16.310> on<00:03:16.609> destination<00:03:17.209> although<00:03:17.480> i

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
difference on destination although i

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.180 
difference on destination although i
still<00:03:17.660> would<00:03:18.049> hesitate<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.650> call<00:03:18.829> of<00:03:18.950> a<00:03:19.040> zerg

been<00:03:21.260> cleaning<00:03:21.650> up<00:03:21.769> lately<00:03:22.130> I<00:03:22.579> think<00:03:23.329> it's

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
been cleaning up lately I think it's

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.599 
been cleaning up lately I think it's
still<00:03:23.660> a<00:03:23.780> pretty<00:03:24.140> even<00:03:24.440> sort<00:03:24.859> of<00:03:24.980> map<00:03:25.160> I<00:03:25.400> think

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
still a pretty even sort of map I think

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.210 
still a pretty even sort of map I think
just<00:03:25.850> uh<00:03:25.910> that<00:03:26.720> Dodd<00:03:27.230> build<00:03:27.560> style<00:03:27.950> has<00:03:28.190> been

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
just uh that Dodd build style has been

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.030 
just uh that Dodd build style has been
pretty<00:03:28.910> strong<00:03:29.440> overall<00:03:30.440> I<00:03:30.470> mean<00:03:30.709> we've<00:03:30.859> seen

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040

Zuri's do well with that on every maps a
lot<00:03:32.930> of<00:03:33.019> them<00:03:33.140> it's<00:03:33.260> a<00:03:33.350> factor<00:03:33.739> of<00:03:33.769> the<00:03:33.920> map

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100

a problem because if you do Scout

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.210 
a problem because if you do Scout

something and you Scout it that's pretty

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.310 
something and you Scout it that's pretty
much<00:04:54.670> game<00:04:55.000> over<00:04:55.150> you<00:04:55.480> in<00:04:55.630> the<00:04:55.750> game<00:04:55.930> so<00:04:56.170> it's

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
much game over you in the game so it's

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.800 
much game over you in the game so it's

sacrificing<00:04:59.680> approach<00:05:00.010> just<00:05:00.370> to<00:05:00.490> even<00:05:00.640> get<00:05:00.940> a

chance at scouting that because if you

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.520 
chance at scouting that because if you

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
do scout it you would give you any way

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.750 
do scout it you would give you any way
it<00:05:05.650> is<00:05:05.740> pretty<00:05:05.950> difficult<00:05:06.040> i<00:05:06.490> think<00:05:06.669> the

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
it is pretty difficult i think the

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.670 
it is pretty difficult i think the
simcity<00:05:07.210> on<00:05:07.419> this<00:05:07.540> map<00:05:07.750> so<00:05:08.050> look<00:05:08.380> we've<00:05:08.560> got

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
simcity on this map so look we've got

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.040 
simcity on this map so look we've got
four<00:05:08.950> probes<00:05:09.220> out<00:05:09.460> already<00:05:09.760> I<00:05:10.060> don't<00:05:10.480> know<00:05:10.570> how

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
four probes out already I don't know how

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.750 
four probes out already I don't know how
safe<00:05:11.590> that<00:05:11.650> is<00:05:11.890> I<00:05:12.100> don't<00:05:12.160> know<00:05:12.310> if<00:05:12.370> I<00:05:12.520> think<00:05:12.669> it

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
safe that is I don't know if I think it

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.340 
safe that is I don't know if I think it
does<00:05:12.910> block<00:05:13.180> the<00:05:13.360> left<00:05:13.540> side<00:05:13.690> completely<00:05:13.990> and

does block the left side completely and

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.990 
does block the left side completely and
if<00:05:14.440> it<00:05:14.560> does<00:05:14.740> and<00:05:14.980> that's<00:05:15.130> a<00:05:15.220> good<00:05:15.340> SimCity<00:05:15.850> in

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.360 
Earthlings in Jamie's base right now I
just<00:05:38.200> think<00:05:38.350> he<00:05:38.440> totally<00:05:38.860> didn't<00:05:39.130> see<00:05:39.220> this

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
just think he totally didn't see this

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.590 
just think he totally didn't see this
coming<00:05:39.430> because<00:05:39.850> it's<00:05:40.030> like<00:05:40.210> something<00:05:40.540> that

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600
