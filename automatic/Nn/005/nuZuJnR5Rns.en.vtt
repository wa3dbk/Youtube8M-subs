00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
point of this video is and what gives me

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.900 
point of this video is and what gives me
an<00:02:36.730> edge<00:02:36.970> like<00:02:37.720> what<00:02:38.080> what<00:02:38.500> really<00:02:38.740> makes<00:02:39.640> you

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
an edge like what what really makes you

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.570 
an edge like what what really makes you
money<00:02:40.060> stand<00:02:40.390> out<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.660> would<00:02:40.840> say<00:02:40.870> two<00:02:41.440> things

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
money stand out I would say two things

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.150 
money stand out I would say two things
one<00:02:42.580> I<00:02:43.140> really<00:02:44.140> have<00:02:44.410> maybe<00:02:44.830> it's<00:02:44.980> more<00:02:45.100> than

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
one I really have maybe it's more than

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.940 
one I really have maybe it's more than
two<00:02:45.400> things<00:02:45.610> one<00:02:46.600> is<00:02:46.750> really<00:02:46.960> that<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.620> really

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
two things one is really that I really

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.380 
two things one is really that I really
have<00:02:48.100> nothing<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.490> lose

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
have nothing to lose

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.730 
have nothing to lose
being<00:02:50.050> that<00:02:50.290> you<00:02:50.920> know<00:02:51.010> this<00:02:51.220> isn't<00:02:51.550> a<00:02:51.820> big

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
being that you know this isn't a big

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.830 
being that you know this isn't a big
part<00:02:53.740> of<00:02:53.800> my<00:02:53.950> business<00:02:54.160> it's<00:02:55.150> it's<00:02:55.540> something

part of my business it's it's something

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.980 
part of my business it's it's something
I<00:02:55.900> do<00:02:55.960> when<00:02:56.260> I<00:02:56.290> have<00:02:56.470> time<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:58.120> can<00:02:58.660> kind<00:02:58.840> of<00:02:58.930> just

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
I do when I have time I can kind of just

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.400 
I do when I have time I can kind of just
let<00:02:59.290> loose<00:02:59.580> I<00:03:00.580> don't<00:03:01.270> have<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:01.720> rely<00:03:01.870> on<00:03:02.020> search

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
let loose I don't have to rely on search

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.650 
let loose I don't have to rely on search

accounts<00:03:05.230> for<00:03:05.320> I<00:03:05.410> think<00:03:05.650> less<00:03:06.370> than<00:03:06.400> ten

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
accounts for I think less than ten

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.150 
accounts for I think less than ten
percent<00:03:06.970> or<00:03:07.540> right<00:03:07.750> at<00:03:07.900> ten<00:03:08.110> percent<00:03:08.260> of<00:03:08.590> the

about a lot of topics I'm going talking

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.960 
about a lot of topics I'm going talking
about<00:03:27.520> how<00:03:27.820> I<00:03:28.560> am<00:03:29.560> you<00:03:30.370> know<00:03:30.400> I<00:03:30.520> used<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.880> be

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
about how I am you know I used to be

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.650 
about how I am you know I used to be
very<00:03:31.000> fat<00:03:31.570> I<00:03:31.930> talk<00:03:32.680> about<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:34.090> know<00:03:34.180> just<00:03:34.210> a

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
very fat I talk about you know just a

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.990 
very fat I talk about you know just a
lot<00:03:35.080> of<00:03:35.140> my<00:03:35.320> failures<00:03:35.800> in<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.130> past<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:36.820> I

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
lot of my failures in the past and I

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.430 
lot of my failures in the past and I
think<00:03:37.210> people<00:03:37.480> kind<00:03:37.630> of<00:03:37.750> can<00:03:38.050> connect<00:03:38.350> with

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
think people kind of can connect with

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.970 
think people kind of can connect with
you<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:38.709> appreciate<00:03:39.130> that<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.980> third

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
you and appreciate that and the third

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.260 
you and appreciate that and the third
thing<00:03:42.160> which<00:03:42.370> is<00:03:42.490> probably<00:03:42.820> accounts<00:03:43.240> for

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
thing which is probably accounts for

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.240 
thing which is probably accounts for
more<00:03:44.050> success<00:03:44.470> of<00:03:44.680> this<00:03:45.220> blog<00:03:46.030> than<00:03:47.010> I'd<00:03:48.010> like

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
more success of this blog than I'd like

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.970 
more success of this blog than I'd like
to<00:03:48.400> give<00:03:48.550> it<00:03:48.580> but<00:03:49.000> it's<00:03:49.209> true<00:03:49.540> is<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:49.840> I<00:03:50.350> have

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
to give it but it's true is that I have

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.030 
to give it but it's true is that I have
a<00:03:51.010> picture<00:03:51.790> of<00:03:52.240> me<00:03:52.480> and<00:03:52.690> a<00:03:52.840> adsense<00:03:53.680> check<00:03:53.860> for

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
a picture of me and a adsense check for

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.820 
a picture of me and a adsense check for
one<00:03:54.190> month<00:03:54.400> of<00:03:54.520> revenue<00:03:54.850> for<00:03:55.090> almost<00:03:55.830> $140,000

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
one month of revenue for almost $140,000

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.430 
one month of revenue for almost $140,000
and<00:03:59.250> while<00:04:00.250> I'm<00:04:01.000> sure<00:04:01.360> a<00:04:01.720> lot<00:04:01.990> of<00:04:02.110> people<00:04:02.320> have

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
and while I'm sure a lot of people have

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.470 
and while I'm sure a lot of people have
made<00:04:02.650> more<00:04:02.890> than<00:04:03.100> that<00:04:03.280> not<00:04:04.030> a<00:04:04.090> lot<00:04:04.150> of<00:04:04.209> people

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
made more than that not a lot of people

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
made more than that not a lot of people
have<00:04:04.600> taken<00:04:04.810> a<00:04:04.840> picture<00:04:04.959> of<00:04:05.140> them<00:04:05.320> with<00:04:05.470> a

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
have taken a picture of them with a

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.100 
have taken a picture of them with a
check<00:04:05.800> doing<00:04:06.220> it<00:04:06.480> and<00:04:07.480> putting<00:04:07.510> it<00:04:07.930> out<00:04:08.050> there

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
check doing it and putting it out there

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.610 
check doing it and putting it out there
for<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.620> world<00:04:08.650> to<00:04:08.950> see<00:04:09.130> so<00:04:10.350> those<00:04:11.350> three

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
for the world to see so those three

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.110 
for the world to see so those three
things<00:04:11.650> have<00:04:11.890> kind<00:04:12.130> of<00:04:12.160> given<00:04:12.280> me<00:04:12.430> an<00:04:12.610> edge<00:04:12.820> and

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
things have kind of given me an edge and

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.970 
things have kind of given me an edge and
I<00:04:13.420> think<00:04:13.480> account<00:04:13.959> for<00:04:14.170> why<00:04:14.380> people<00:04:14.740> come<00:04:14.920> to

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
I think account for why people come to

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.260 
I think account for why people come to
the

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
the

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.470 
the
site<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.630> get<00:04:16.370> news<00:04:17.370> even<00:04:17.850> though<00:04:17.970> that's<00:04:18.239> not

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
site to get news even though that's not

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.610 
site to get news even though that's not
what<00:04:18.660> I'm<00:04:18.780> I<00:04:19.459> got<00:04:20.459> I<00:04:20.520> hate<00:04:20.850> saying<00:04:21.120> news<00:04:21.690> but

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
what I'm I got I hate saying news but

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.110 
what I'm I got I hate saying news but
it's<00:04:22.740> like<00:04:22.980> I<00:04:23.190> mean<00:04:23.340> I<00:04:23.400> don't<00:04:23.460> really<00:04:23.760> break

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
it's like I mean I don't really break

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.660 
it's like I mean I don't really break
