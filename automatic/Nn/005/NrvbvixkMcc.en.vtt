00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:06.130
 hello how are you good we are with a 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.680
 new song to learn in the 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.750
 guitar playing us today is who 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.930
 I will go in need 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.930
 i 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.390
 here 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.710
 d 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.030
 change my life 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.579
 will understand me 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.120
 walk 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.960
 if not 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.960
 that 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.820
 plus 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.450
 Yes Yes 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.380
 single 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.380
 my words 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.150
 really 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.150
 are you 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.150
 this 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.660
 good in this song I'm not sure 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.990
 exactly where and when it ends like this 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:45.000
 that you may choose to repeat some 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.950
 again some of the parties and so on 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.780
 as for the chords 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.460
 I agreed that it's ready because it was 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.509
 when it has to do fake had 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.640
 minor instead of the complete drought 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.600
 can support with the index only in the 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.600
 third rope 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:16.120
 and the sun also a nice variation is 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:18.249
 taking out the index of the fifth string in 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.999
 the second space can tighten the 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:20.999
 third rope 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.349
 yes 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.349
 where better 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.609
 Y 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.550
 and put it too 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.550
 removing the ring finger 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.790
 galindo 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.610
 this time it 's nice if you have the 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.480
 amplified guitar to play it without 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.480
 tear so much 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.920
 looking for 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.790
 and that 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.790
 my life 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.140
 and nothing 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.040
 and 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.909
 so you try to search 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.890
 variants as I always tell them sometimes 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:51.079
 It depends a lot if we are playing 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.359
 we alone with the guitar or there 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.920
 other instruments or if we're playing 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:58.760
 with the amplified guitar or the 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.379
 guitar to the air then one goes 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.750
 looking for different sounds but 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:06.370
 it's good to play with that and as always 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.200
 I like to say if it sounds good it 's fine 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.959
 What I do here is try to give them 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.030
 just a guide I will touch it a 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.940
 time without singing trying to do the 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.250
 the most even rhythm possible so that 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.889
 who are learning what can be 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:25.620
 easier to follow so you get there 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.830
 it would be the basic rhythm 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.830
 Y 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.650
 all right 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.580
 3 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.400
 yes 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.610
 this 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.610
 yes 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.400
 and decorum is not coming 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.660
 two 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.910
 If you already hook or wait a longer time 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.820
 that also probably has 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:08.030
 different ways of singing it and you 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.680
 choose the one used in your church 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.360
 the file as I always tell you what 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.040
 You can download from the link that 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.780

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.420
 have any comments they want 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:20.060
