virtually almost all of the services
you're<00:00:48.390> going<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.719> need<00:00:48.960> way<00:00:49.350> more<00:00:49.379> space<00:00:50.070> than

you're going to need way more space than
10<00:00:50.489> gigabytes<00:00:50.969> but<00:00:51.629> those<00:00:51.809> are<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> minimum

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
10 gigabytes but those are the minimum

you're reinstalling mac OS 10 lion on a

system that shipped with it initially

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.760 
system that shipped with it initially
now<00:01:08.280> those<00:01:08.790> are<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.540> minimum<00:01:09.840> requirements

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
now those are the minimum requirements

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.050 
now those are the minimum requirements
for<00:01:10.950> lion<00:01:11.100> server<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:11.580> let's<00:01:11.760> talk<00:01:12.000> about

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
for lion server but let's talk about

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.440 
for lion server but let's talk about
reality<00:01:12.750> here<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:14.010> 64-bit<00:01:14.640> intel<00:01:14.880> processor

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
reality here the 64-bit intel processor

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.899 
reality here the 64-bit intel processor
ok<00:01:15.810> that's<00:01:15.990> fine<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.950> includes<00:01:17.369> core<00:01:17.729> 2<00:01:17.880> duo

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
ok that's fine that includes core 2 duo

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.330 
ok that's fine that includes core 2 duo
machines<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.840> if<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.530> think<00:01:19.740> about<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.979> core

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
machines and if you think about it core

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.039 
machines and if you think about it core
2<00:01:20.430> duo<00:01:20.460> machines<00:01:20.970> were<00:01:21.119> made<00:01:21.270> right<00:01:21.689> up<00:01:21.900> until

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
2 duo machines were made right up until

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.990 
2 duo machines were made right up until
we<00:01:22.380> started<00:01:22.710> chipping<00:01:22.920> things<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.610> new

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
we started chipping things like the new

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.179 
we started chipping things like the new
mac<00:01:24.180> mini<00:01:24.210> server<00:01:24.689> with<00:01:24.930> its<00:01:25.080> i<00:01:25.229> 7<00:01:25.590> processor

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
mac mini server with its i 7 processor

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.870 
mac mini server with its i 7 processor
so<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.270> core<00:01:28.020> two<00:01:28.200> duo<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.619> fine<00:01:28.890> but<00:01:29.250> think

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
so a core two duo is fine but think

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.969 
so a core two duo is fine but think
about<00:01:30.030> which<00:01:30.479> machine<00:01:30.990> you're<00:01:31.500> putting<00:01:31.860> your

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
about which machine you're putting your

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.170 
about which machine you're putting your
server<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:33.710> original<00:01:34.710> white<00:01:35.070> imac<00:01:35.939> with<00:01:35.970> a

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
server on a original white imac with a

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.810 
server on a original white imac with a
core<00:01:36.420> 2<00:01:36.659> duo<00:01:36.689> processor<00:01:36.960> had<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> 3<00:01:38.250> gigabyte

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
core 2 duo processor had a 3 gigabyte

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.030 
core 2 duo processor had a 3 gigabyte
RAM<00:01:39.150> limitation<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:40.320> you're<00:01:40.470> about<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.920> do

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
RAM limitation so if you're about to do

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.550 
RAM limitation so if you're about to do
a<00:01:41.070> profile<00:01:41.640> management<00:01:42.090> server<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:43.259> 3

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
a profile management server that 3

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.289 
a profile management server that 3
gigabytes<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.159> RAM<00:01:44.399> which<00:01:44.880> would<00:01:45.090> be<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
gigabytes of RAM which would be the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.810 
gigabytes of RAM which would be the
maximum<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.259> computer<00:01:46.680> might<00:01:47.490> not<00:01:47.670> be

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
maximum for that computer might not be

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.520 
maximum for that computer might not be
enough<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.810> want<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.170> give<00:01:49.290> some<00:01:49.500> thought

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
enough so you want to give some thought

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.289 
enough so you want to give some thought
to<00:01:49.740> what<00:01:49.950> services<00:01:50.700> you're<00:01:50.909> going<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.210> be

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
to what services you're going to be

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.510 
to what services you're going to be
installing<00:01:51.540> on<00:01:51.990> your<00:01:52.200> server<00:01:52.439> before<00:01:53.070> you

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
installing on your server before you

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.999

eight<00:02:17.069> cores<00:02:17.459> would<00:02:18.000> be<00:02:18.150> great<00:02:18.510> for<00:02:19.470> gigs<00:02:19.709> I

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
eight cores would be great for gigs I

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.800 
eight cores would be great for gigs I
think<00:02:20.220> would<00:02:20.370> be<00:02:20.489> a<00:02:20.519> good<00:02:20.670> minimum<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.360> go<00:02:21.510> for

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
think would be a good minimum to go for

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.630 
think would be a good minimum to go for
and<00:02:22.050> if<00:02:22.500> you're<00:02:22.680> doing<00:02:22.950> profile<00:02:23.310> management

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
and if you're doing profile management

and if you're doing profile management

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
again I would go for the fastest best

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.369 
again I would go for the fastest best
processor<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.519> can<00:02:26.550> get<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.840> would<00:02:27.989> go<00:02:28.140> for

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
processor you can get and I would go for

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.500 
processor you can get and I would go for
the<00:02:28.500> most<00:02:28.800> Ram<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:29.400> can<00:02:29.610> put<00:02:30.090> into<00:02:30.420> the

the most Ram you can put into the

the most Ram you can put into the

machine you're using I don't think it

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.250 
machine you're using I don't think it
would<00:02:32.640> be<00:02:32.760> overkill<00:02:33.209> at<00:02:33.599> all<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:34.110> consider

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
would be overkill at all to consider

would be overkill at all to consider
