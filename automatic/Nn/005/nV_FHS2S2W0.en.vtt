this film at twelve days of Terror are
the<00:01:10.590> only<00:01:10.950> two<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.130> can<00:01:11.430> remember<00:01:11.729> being<00:01:12.659> based

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
the only two I can remember being based

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.219 
the only two I can remember being based
on<00:01:13.350> real<00:01:13.880> occurrences<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.570> makes<00:01:15.900> them

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
on real occurrences and that makes them

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.649 
on real occurrences and that makes them
more<00:01:16.259> scary<00:01:17.130> because<00:01:17.460> if<00:01:17.909> these<00:01:18.420> things

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
more scary because if these things

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.850 
more scary because if these things
happened<00:01:19.290> at<00:01:19.500> one<00:01:20.220> time<00:01:20.640> at<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:22.350> certain<00:01:22.710> place

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
happened at one time at a certain place

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.830 
happened at one time at a certain place
they<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.310> happen<00:01:23.549> again<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:24.240> another<00:01:24.509> place

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
they can happen again in another place

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.100 
they can happen again in another place
which<00:01:25.740> makes<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.340> particularly<00:01:27.330> scary<00:01:27.840> that

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
which makes it particularly scary that

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.230 
which makes it particularly scary that
these<00:01:28.439> things<00:01:28.680> could<00:01:28.829> actually<00:01:29.070> happen<00:01:29.460> have

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
these things could actually happen have

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.899 
these things could actually happen have
happened<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:30.950> may<00:01:31.950> potentially<00:01:32.579> happen

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
happened and may potentially happen

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.679 
happened and may potentially happen
again<00:01:33.590> to<00:01:34.590> whom<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:35.070> can't<00:01:35.369> really<00:01:35.549> say<00:01:38.689> movie

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
again to whom I can't really say movie

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.710 
again to whom I can't really say movie
was<00:01:39.990> powerful<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:41.000> certain<00:01:42.000> instances<00:01:42.119> and

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
was powerful in certain instances and

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.639 
was powerful in certain instances and
even<00:01:42.990> inspiring<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:44.570> I<00:01:47.210> really<00:01:48.210> liked<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.810> but

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
even inspiring I I really liked it but

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.300 
even inspiring I I really liked it but
beyond<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:51.140> this<00:01:52.140> was<00:01:52.500> actually<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.979> really

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
beyond that this was actually a really

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.690 
beyond that this was actually a really
good<00:01:53.490> film<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:55.219> would<00:01:56.219> have<00:01:56.670> liked<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.240> if<00:01:57.659> the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
good film I would have liked it if the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.520 
good film I would have liked it if the
guy<00:01:59.700> who<00:01:59.759> did<00:02:00.270> unsolved<00:02:00.840> mysteries<00:02:01.290> had

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
guy who did unsolved mysteries had

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.039 
guy who did unsolved mysteries had
narrated<00:02:02.369> this<00:02:02.579> film<00:02:02.909> because<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.719> think<00:02:03.780> that

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
narrated this film because I think that

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.810 
narrated this film because I think that
would<00:02:04.170> have<00:02:04.290> brought<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.310> up<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.579> level

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
would have brought it up to a level

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.040 
would have brought it up to a level
awesome<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.780> would<00:02:06.930> just<00:02:07.140> be<00:02:07.429> unreal<00:02:08.989> but<00:02:09.989> I

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
awesome that would just be unreal but I

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.050 
awesome that would just be unreal but I
think<00:02:10.379> it's<00:02:10.530> because<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:11.430> would<00:02:11.580> bring<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:11.940> to

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
think it's because it would bring it to

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.830 
think it's because it would bring it to
an<00:02:12.180> unreal

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
an unreal

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.900 
an unreal
standing<00:02:13.560> up<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.800> doesn't<00:02:13.950> do<00:02:14.129> that<00:02:14.280> but

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
standing up it doesn't do that but

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.570 
standing up it doesn't do that but
nonetheless<00:02:15.360> nonetheless<00:02:16.430> there's<00:02:17.430> some

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
nonetheless nonetheless there's some

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.790
