00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.240
 so now you can already tell for one 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.750
 Consistent stars that a bit now 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.550
 become harder now you can 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.680
 roll them out and cut them out 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.000
 That's what I'm doing for helping 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.510
 I cut now times here 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.500
 half off the dough because we're here now 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.380
 gluten-free day have these from the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.279
 consistency is a bit bigger 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:39.000
 so I'll get it now 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:41.660
 between two papers 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.980
 pond should be about five millimeters 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.570
 and that he does that regularly now 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.980
 hinkriegt it can divides into those 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.899
 use here the millimeter and was 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.520
 no paper on it then I have namely 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.050
 Do not use that much anymore 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.050
 I am not at wood 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.750
 I have so many different cookouts here 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.250
 because now I'm the dough bit too 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.350
 I do not want to go fragile either 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.600
 So I move that too much 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.050
 Now just go out and take it afterwards 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.970
 direct out we see a lot easier 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.220
 is to move as the individual clicks 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.619
 you can now just here, for example 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.600
 so cut out round or so because 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.369
 that later with powdered sugar 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.369
 decorate master and then you can too 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.710
 some simple form to be very great for 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.450
 decorating that does not have to be in here now 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.520
 huge arsenal of cookie cutters 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:54.509
 set as I said I am now taking the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:55.500
 it's actually the negative of it away 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.539
 can do that again ten minutes 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.800
 that's a trick then everybody is 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.780
 cookies if we bake them 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.759
 temperature for the cows, I take now 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:08.300
 right here the baking sheet pixel on and 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.300
 off in the fridge 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.550
 so and now off in the oven depending on 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.870
 like the oven is between five and five 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.870
 They are ready for eight minutes 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.120
 so they are nice baked golden brown 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.950
 As you can see they are a bit 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.170
 got bigger during baking 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.960
 flap animals to little distance 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.060
 between the biscuits but I calculated 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.400
 think that okay class reunion 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.930
 Cool with video decoder can do 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.710
 and in the meantime areas like 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.710
 the summit
