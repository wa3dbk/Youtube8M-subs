00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.350
 so we come to the fifth combination 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.400
 same adam plant this time though 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.620
 with the nyse of thiga 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:18.410
 I have read in the forum now have you 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.410
 turn when you solve the two 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.460
 aligned horizontally what for me 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.590
 now means in this direction 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.130
 that's both on this axis 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.289
 lie 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.970
 that is about to to rather positive on 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.399
 impact that would be afterwards 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.450
 see if that's really the case 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.070
 otherwise I have the same nozzle 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.989
 mounted like me on the same 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.250
 Original lance made only one 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.870
 whole piece of rom 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.059
 because the problem everyone knows determined 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.730
 at the sedanplatz even if the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.780
 machine is not increased then have 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.940
 I am at the latest with the larger kempchen 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.920
 this problem 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.539
 I'll be bigger 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.910
 right here with the 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.920
 bigger jugs simply foam 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.590
 so you can also see how the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.979
 roll with the nozzle with a larger one 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.530
 pot works because that was too 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.030
 one of my worries 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.740
 when I ordered the nozzle by 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.200
 that you have two holes with something 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.280
 more surface it could be good 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.420
 that roll not so good 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.790
 works and you have too 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.430
 already seen the nozzle on the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.659
 Original land actually had that 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.890
 do not roll quite so spectacular 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.680
 went away 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.360
 the both silver or plant from now 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:34.320
 Here are my girls from two churches 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:39.570
 stock or 0.6 liter jug ​​and the 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.640
 Machine resumed the temperature 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.450
 little silvia this is how i got off 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.299
 made as I said then just this 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.509
 here quite up and screwed down again 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.040
 just like in the video of the first one 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.670
 Plant from the original then plant 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.409
 the kcc 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.830
 we are slowly approaching 140 degrees 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.390
 my steam evil and lamp dripping that 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.619
 has nothing to do with age too 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.270
 not katja us not quite 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.789
 Video that has only with my steam 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.789
 valve to do and off you go 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:25.930
 so ignore it for mine 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:27.790
 live time but you have also seen 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.670
 that roll with the bigger one 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.290
 Ribbon also works wonderfully 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.170
 is not so spectacular at the same time 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.970
 plant and I now have the 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.950
 Do not jet so long that's also called 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.690
 still after the ideal position in the 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.850
 champion 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.400
 but even if like me at 10 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.890
 everything happens later after the 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.100
 everything will be very homogenous 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.600
 dissolved again and if I have mine now 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.790
 milk foam enters so you can see 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.550
 here again that he very much for a very long time 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.560
 Homogeneous foamy stays here too 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.530
 So I still have the cup 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.910
 milk foam that is the mix in 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.160
 also works with every case 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.440
 evil in my view, the whole is here 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.570
 yes everything in my opinion very much 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.680
 better 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.000
 otherwise I am with the silvia ladies 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.739
 Plant always very satisfied 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.239
 been 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.560
 i will use this nozzle after my test 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.310
 but not here again 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.870
 unscrew but continue with the tiger 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.870
 steam these work
