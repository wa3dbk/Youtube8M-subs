00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 Immediately my friends with you Naur today 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.400
 would like to show you enough 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.340
 an unusual meeting that occurred with 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.820
 me in alpha testing warlords of 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.150
 draenor 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.420
 this meeting with a huge boss is a reason 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.340
 the size of someone was in the stronghold of the wing of darkness 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.050
 will remember the boss from the sea enough 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.670
 difficult for those times the boss is his 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.800
 see another reincarnation 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.260
 in that we are in front of the fiery puddle 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.060
 meet the ogres who worship 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.539
 this creature and wanted to bring in 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.260
 the victim 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:35.450
 The lasso to the assembly is ours here and we do not 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:39.840
 give it up and kill these ogres and 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:44.040
 we start feeding these ogres to this 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.230
 the worm that is our common strategy of it 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.520
 murder is not even murder is 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.910
 in the feast stern of this evil creature from on 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.590
 how evil of normal being in 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.030
 in particular, we probably donâ€™t even 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.129
 we have the opportunity to be because 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.809
 she has some level 100 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.690
 crazy amount of health is 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.400
 starting area just crazy she 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.920
 some special strategy this is just 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.869
 here it is a special strategy and so we 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.630
 kill the ogres that fit 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.970
 gradually gradually to us and begin 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.790
 feed in my opinion the battle now 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.470
 still busy enough 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.909
 what are some elements of course 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.640
 which work will normally get 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.380
 brown already which can be seen in advance that 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.040
 there happen that moment when you 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.140
 feed the ogres rise and 2 st 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.689
 throw a fire puddle and you don't 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.729
 can do i will try here 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.340
 find some ways how 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.390
 confront this madness which 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.869
 will happen here 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.920
 Well, you see the counter top you need 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.610
 feed him 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.909
 ten such games one more moment 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.460
 which happens not quite him 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.619
 controlled by me happens sometimes you 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.930
 find yourself in an area that he seems to be 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.090
 swallows you this area for now 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.430
 now it is not visible obviously it can be 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.930
 darker area next to him into it 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.030
 it may not even be possible to enter 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.860
 It seems the problem of the graph is in it 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.810
 happens in general 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.320
 it seems just a little bit more 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.820
 the battle is not completed but you understand that 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.770
 alpha is alpha here as for example now 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.820
 yes he is just without any warning 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.710
 just instantly grabbed me maybe 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.260
 somehow you need to look at the animation but 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.680
 goblin growth does not allow very high 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.430
 turn up my nose and i keep killing these 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.020
 poor unfortunate goblins alone 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.350
 of course it's not very fun all 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.450
 happens because you pass 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.430
 damage itil already in which you are constantly 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.910
 will once again throw the truth good 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.489
 and see that he does not fall damage 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.260
 passes by you may be flawed a 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.860
 may be special 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.340
 feature anyway together do it 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.709
 the event will be much more fun because 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.120
 the result of what happens here to them 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.950
 will be able to take advantage of all those who 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.890
 participated and maybe even those who 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.970
 just ran past i don't know i know 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:13.380
 exactly what people can work together 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.390
 on this on this stunt for feeding 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.400
 just look at me just touches 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.959
 this animation goblin caller 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.070
 hefty aggro on your shoulder 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.080
 yes i am trying to use here 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.900
 possible portal tricks to 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.019
 go out quickly from these puddles all this 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.459
 well any acceptance of your class 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.060
 which you need to use complex 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.080
 situations it is not interesting whether 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.549
 really so here it can be 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.670
 relatively design such that this 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.920
 the battle was just a little bit 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.680
 difficult to get you there unfairly 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.450
 stood in this pool of fire it is not clear how 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.450
 cast can be really 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.250
 such a design 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.849
 I can't do anything right now 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:59.209
 can't jump fast 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:01.550
 run away from here and you certainly don't pay 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.129
 note that there is a little 6000 is on 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:11.510
 standards there dori than it really is 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:16.880
 big enough damage and last time 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:21.520
 on my given 9 10 agro need to feed 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:27.520
 he will be the completion of this event 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:31.360
 from one now on my mind on and surrender 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:35.120
 courageously on low hp in a pool of fire 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.280
 last and what happens he 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.400
 spitting out 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:43.070
 huge stone belching from him or something 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.950
 there was a huge hefty stone 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:50.180
 which you can come up and see what 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:51.860
 there's a bunch of it all, all these pies 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.050
 which from the ogres apparently remained but also in 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.900
 particulars of useful blue shield with 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.690
 intelligence all shaman paladin and 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.370
 rejoice incredibly but I just look 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.590
 on his modelka so small 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.889
 adventure thank you for your attention 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.889
 thank you for watching with you was naur 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.889
