00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.759
 all girl presses 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.720
 today a bunch of Moscow gods he 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:33.329
 flaws that I noticed in the game 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:38.480
 these flaws are 2 cents in two ways 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:41.339
 they will help you syoss ease the game 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.790
 I'll start with you one preface all 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:47.100
 find out the situation when the right to start 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:52.379
 play you nothing muskuri again from 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:55.500
 Well, and flashlight folds and juice and cook 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.229
 already there and you meet here zone to 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.860
 will possess an atomic what to do both in 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:02.970
 these knocks 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:08.369
 Well, it's not that certain death but it 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:11.400
 difficult because yes it is difficult today 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.450
 I will show here such ways how to facilitate 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.900
 a life 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.790
 perry way 2 way of withdrawing what we 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.210
 We do come to a place that is not 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.160
 help under the zone over warmed we collect 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.710
 as many zombies as possible here 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.940
 interrupt reviews yes here on pancakes and 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:37.409
 I want to have Georgians 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:42.590
 years, I hurt everything here they are on the deputy 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:46.530
 run given they she run and what we do 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.630
 how do we tie for ourselves and run to the water 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.909
 not enough now 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.890
 they are a pretty good example of what's under 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.970
 far but still 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.610
 lie so here apt-1 is not caught up because 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.590
 the fire will be bad 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.890
 move away from the place that we 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.789
 we want to confuse and go to the water 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.039
 since zombies are well infected with it 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.549
 know how to swim 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:19.140
 we fool them we go water that's not 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:23.220
 goes for the water and all the video is no longer 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.950
 to him they are just paying shame to the place 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.660
 what do we do next we sail from them 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:34.170
 far away 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:37.680
 and so in the dream and further still more 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.680
 yet one more thing about here now at least that 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.630
 that where I sail measure to such 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.190
 distances to me just already in less 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.380
 they were not drawn 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.410
 write to draw they all lost him 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.290
 trace of the lady they just stayed the same 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.930
 that is, they will not run back to themselves and 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.680
 so you're up against these 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:05.100
 away so they just but you not 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.460
 noticed and calm duty behind tahiti and all 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:12.390
 and everything is great lifting show how it is 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:16.380
 everything looks up with help on 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:19.110
 shore all swam they sit there right there 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:24.090
 that is, I will eat 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:27.420
 I drink I went away they stand there and we all 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:31.080
 Feathers I calmly holly and the hall 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.720
 Is this butter an elephant here? 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.800
 and I just wouldn't take it today just 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.340
 stand still 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.450
 there is all what will be for the altar without 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.450
 special problems 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.640
 Here is such a first way very much like 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.870
 I am more comfortable that is if for example 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:57.960
 just started to drive you nothing and 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:04:03.170
 please feel free to make such 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:06.830
 small layouts and calm force to loot 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.830
 Ivan zone 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.480
 so what is the second way 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:19.870
 examples would fall asleep here so if 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.880
 you don't want to wait for current for too long 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:29.470
 by carefully 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:33.220
 that you can make the remnants of gold 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.710
 see that you like a zombie is a scoop 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.190
 knock out long hard from a challenge because 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:42.280
 jump on the window and the article I did 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:46.360
 called tobacco bucks but squat 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:49.060
 and what's the catch tank you stand in the center 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:54.570
 windows and zombies approach com at a distance 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:57.490
 where they can not knock you for them you 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.300
 unattainable area with midi from traffic 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.710
 the side 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:05.770
 02 mean that they fled here for 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:10.380
 at least someone you are in the middle 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:15.150
 old people and calmly can extrude whether 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:19.450
 finish off but unfortunately this may 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:26.430
 there is a small problem what is it 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:26.430
 it lies in the fact that with 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.229
 midnight zone tank triggered well 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:38.130
 fifty fifty that is creeping 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:38.130
 Zombies are lower and when to say 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:46.589
 they are lowered and they can sometimes you 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.719
 hit that is for example now let's 

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:51.539
 try 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:55.770
 he goes to us jumps up I squat 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:58.939
 so dad we pass yes take it from 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:04.939
 kill dad with zones 

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:04.939
 take it off and he's good this loser 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:11.719
 not to suffer 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:15.599
 I will say just be careful because 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:18.689
 creeping zombi bug with them 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:20.879
 does not always work not always 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:22.469
 It works and I do not know why rather 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:28.610
 just due to the fact that not just lower 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:32.459
 from see he did not hit yes enough 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:34.889
 calmly I can do myself without any special 

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:38.759
 problems and everything if you have one 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:41.369
 good which extends as much as a cup 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:43.769
 or even at least some weapons in their hands 

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:44.639
 naturally everything will be much easier 

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:50.309
 universities 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:51.629
 saw me calmly standing here to hit 

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:56.329
 I prefer for iphone 

00:06:51.629 --> 00:07:02.119
 he may not succeed calmly finish him off 

00:06:56.329 --> 00:07:07.800
 Here are two ways who showed and do not know 

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:10.829
 I don't know I just don't know whether you knew about 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:15.139
 If yes, then you need to write 

00:07:10.829 --> 00:07:15.139
 comments that he is honest way 

00:07:18.829 --> 00:07:23.749
 shevchenko thank you and bye
