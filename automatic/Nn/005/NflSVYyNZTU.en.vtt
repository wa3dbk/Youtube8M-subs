00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 Hello to you to destroy, and today I 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.330
 I want to talk about the holidays 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.690
 Treats options weapons 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.240
 who added in the update just 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.059
 same halloween and which are available as 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.960
 for loans as well as for daily entries 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.660
 the game and start with g36 kei for attack aircraft 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.100
 I always liked this gun on my 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.529
 she is full of achivka 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.439
 on the usual option so I was 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.679
 nice to run from an improved version where 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.170
 you can put all the modules where much 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.809
 best performance and 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.540
 really this gun is very good for pvp 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.300
 and for right and she has a very small 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.539
 recoil making it just machines for 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.539
 headshots given not vanshot in the head but 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.420
 hit two bullets with such recoil 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.550
 absolutely not a problem you can 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.390
 put under the barrel and run with it 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.129
 because again the recoil is small and 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.520
 I do not know what changes from absence 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.979
 pens you will hardly notice the gun really 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.200
 good yes she is not and they are bastaty 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.020
 precisely due to a small return due to 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.400
 the fact that on the head with her to walk very 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.170
 fine she's really cool and if you 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.380
 think what kind of gun to fill 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.610
 achievements here this duckling from 500 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:27.270
 kills from low weapons to pvp then i 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.400
 I advise you to take exactly g36 key especially 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.280
 if you like to play for the assault 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.100
 then we go to save the introduction 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.259
 which once again showed how 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.869
 inefficient pump shotgun and with 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.060
 low speed even the rest 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.450
 characteristics in their just beautiful 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.259
 present warface yes you can be 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.439
 skill mead you can get 10 out of 10 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.930
 but it doesn't happen anyway because of 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.299
 smoothing systems due to the fact that 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.439
 the opponent was too far or friend not 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.780
 flew there 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.119
 no one is insured against it and 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.799
 in such situations, the rate of fire 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.530
 mossberg atil because 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.929
 and even if binelli is a new tactical 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.590
 keep quiet about semi-automatic and 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.260
 automatic fractions 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.810
 help you make a second shot to 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.269
 to finish off the enemy here is no such chance 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.319
 will any normal person of you 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:25.090
 Sawed 10 times while saved recharge 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.760
 Especially if earlier we did not have 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.340
 such a large selection of pumps for example 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.610
 in the twelfth year many extended this 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.549
 saved just because there was only Hawk 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.670
 remington and saved the other shotguns not 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:42.459
 It was and at that time this saved Kholmsk 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.890
 was really cool gun now in 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.640
 the current varifese it is not relevant and 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.400
 play with him two to one without sitting on 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.680
 one point and shooting back those who 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.879
 it seems to me to pass by very 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.430
 difficult if not at all impossible g36 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.590
 compact for the engineer is very 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.950
 Unusual weapons analogues which 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.370
 Warface probably not even and all the cattle 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.500
 medium and damage and range and 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.840
 rate of fire and both and only here from 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.109
 hips she very not even bad shoots and 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.510
 for all its singularity only on 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:23.079
 efficiency leaves much to be desired and 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.980
 if you jump over the curtain or xm8 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.920
 compact 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.590
 then chances are you will have a little gun 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.190
 of course all modules are good on it 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.769
 but you can play with it hard enough 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.049
 only body imputed though over heads 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.299
 also not bad because of a small return 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:43.450
 but I still would not advise those who 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:45.150
 just wants to fill her progress 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.139
 with this weapon 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.480
 halloween sniper version 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:52.359
 rifles with l8 produced me very 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.829
 good impression first of all 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:57.430
 account of their characteristics 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:59.980
 200 damage for floor automation this is very 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.290
 even solid and for example you can put 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.019
 inspire or not afraid that you have to 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.349
 kill with three hits of the enemy and 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:10.840
 of course accuracy from hip 60 if not 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.480
 take the crown and the claim is the best 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.289
 figure in the game for all sniper 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:20.140
 rifles are very happy and makes with 8 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:21.789
 A good option for a sniper for 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.770
 whom i usually i play that is 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:24.139
 snipers that nobody ever sits 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.270
 on 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.810
 there is and which is rashid and just 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.569
 hip accuracy for this kind 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.819
 gameplay is very important to try 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:37.099
 somehow put out into the support of a man who 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:39.889
 so the cannon will jump on you 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:40.580
 liked the only minus is 10 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.159
 cartridges 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.139
 really sometimes not enough especially when 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:47.389
 kill a single few 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:50.240
 opponents in a row each titan 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:53.689
 everyone needs to remove the whole thing as far back as 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.210
 the result comes after every fraga well 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:58.550
 or two maximum to recharge 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.939
 but just so that you are not caught in the most 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:05.120
 unnecessary moment with the empty clip as a whole 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:08.389
 cannon it can be stuffed well on pvp 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.900
 on the floor and so also recommend as 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:14.560
 their assault options g36 kei and finish 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.150
 fur circuit ps and if earlier in 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.520
 thirteenth year I advised everyone 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.439
 purchase this gun because 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.860
 she had no alternative 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:27.830
 now not everything is so obvious there is a blog 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.889
 and after apa he is not even bad 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.839
 Of course if you look at the stats of a 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:36.770
 perhaps wins by most 

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:39.319
 parameters of the block but the block can be bought well 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.199
 more accurately knock out forever let 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:44.930
 even a thousand or a half thousand credits 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:47.539
 here it is necessary to extend and extend 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.509
 even if it costs you half a year 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:53.990
 quite a tidy sum a plus no 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:57.169
 achivki plus of course the block for all of it 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:00.830
 some flaws have more 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:04.569
 clip but in such weapons as 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:07.729
 automatic pistols with crazy 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:09.860
 Of course, both of them are very strong 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:14.120
 I'm 20 and decides not always rounds 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:16.669
 enough but it doesn't of a bad 20 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.029
 ammo is also very good and I'm sure 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:21.740
 there are those who will acquire it on 

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:24.020
 long enough to just 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.169
 run around who may be tired of the block 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:30.110
 or those who think that ps is better than a block 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:33.019
 general buy or not depends on your 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:35.300
 Finance if you play a sniper if 

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:35.800
 you need a very cool extra 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.530
 rouge 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:41.110
 for willing to invest in it a few 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:44.050
 thousand rubles to buy for half a year or 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.069
 year and then I advise you to buy it 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.190
 this abs 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:50.500
 This is about with the best of all who enter 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:53.470
 there is from steel there is usual 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.240
 but kholmsky has the best stats 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:59.259
 I myself am with him one time 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:02.020
 ran almost well actually almost two 

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:04.449
