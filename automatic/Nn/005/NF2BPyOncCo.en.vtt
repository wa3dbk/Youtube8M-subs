gave him he gave him problems with the
angles<00:05:11.779> he<00:05:11.929> was<00:05:12.050> producing<00:05:12.499> with<00:05:12.739> his<00:05:12.889> with

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:13.129 
angles he was producing with his with

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:14.889 
angles he was producing with his with
his<00:05:13.279> speed<00:05:13.610> around<00:05:13.819> the<00:05:14.119> ring<00:05:14.269> yeah<00:05:14.629> if

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:14.899 
his speed around the ring yeah if

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:16.749 
his speed around the ring yeah if
McAllister<00:05:15.619> can<00:05:15.889> do<00:05:16.039> something<00:05:16.369> like<00:05:16.550> that

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
McAllister can do something like that

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:18.309 
McAllister can do something like that
then<00:05:16.879> you<00:05:16.939> just<00:05:17.209> feel<00:05:17.419> you<00:05:17.989> know<00:05:18.019> the<00:05:18.169> rubber

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:18.319 
then you just feel you know the rubber

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:19.570 
then you just feel you know the rubber
fighters<00:05:18.709> out<00:05:18.830> there<00:05:18.889> that<00:05:19.159> are<00:05:19.189> bigger<00:05:19.459> than

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
fighters out there that are bigger than

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.790 
fighters out there that are bigger than
him<00:05:19.909> better<00:05:20.419> movement<00:05:20.749> in<00:05:21.019> him<00:05:21.199> stronger<00:05:21.619> than

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
him better movement in him stronger than

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.409 
him better movement in him stronger than
him<00:05:21.949> and<00:05:22.099> could<00:05:22.550> probably<00:05:22.699> last<00:05:22.969> it<00:05:23.179> better

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
him and could probably last it better

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.389 
him and could probably last it better
did<00:05:24.110> you<00:05:24.229> wonder<00:05:24.469> during<00:05:24.830> that<00:05:24.979> fight<00:05:25.159> what

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:27.259 
might have happened if McAllister had a

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:29.919 
might have happened if McAllister had a
bigger<00:05:27.499> dig<00:05:27.709> on<00:05:27.830> him<00:05:27.979> well<00:05:28.550> he<00:05:28.789> McAllister<00:05:29.629> him

puncher and fortunately for Murray
McAllister<00:05:35.809> wasn't<00:05:36.169> the<00:05:36.229> big<00:05:36.379> banger<00:05:36.709> but

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.099 
McAllister wasn't the big banger but

that fight that fight could happen you

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:00.879 
that fight that fight could happen you
know<00:05:59.149> you<00:05:59.209> can<00:05:59.329> see<00:05:59.509> the<00:05:59.629> scenario<00:06:00.110> where<00:06:00.379> con

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:00.889 
know you can see the scenario where con

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:03.459 
know you can see the scenario where con
needs<00:06:01.489> Murray<00:06:01.969> maybe<00:06:02.329> and<00:06:02.629> that<00:06:03.050> would<00:06:03.259> be<00:06:03.439> a

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:03.469 
needs Murray maybe and that would be a

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:05.529 
needs Murray maybe and that would be a
big<00:06:03.919> domestic<00:06:04.279> fine<00:06:04.699> but<00:06:04.909> I<00:06:04.969> think<00:06:05.179> that<00:06:05.240> Mary

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:05.539 
big domestic fine but I think that Mary

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:07.449 
big domestic fine but I think that Mary
will<00:06:05.719> certainly<00:06:06.050> or<00:06:06.319> McKenna<00:06:06.949> see<00:06:07.159> as<00:06:07.249> well

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:07.459 
will certainly or McKenna see as well

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:09.249 
will certainly or McKenna see as well
would<00:06:07.879> like<00:06:08.089> to<00:06:08.209> see<00:06:08.360> Murray<00:06:08.569> go<00:06:08.809> for<00:06:09.019> a<00:06:09.050> world

just finally both of your comic where is

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:51.850 
just finally both of your comic where is
a<00:06:49.069> mere<00:06:49.279> kaan<00:06:49.610> in<00:06:49.909> this<00:06:50.029> whole<00:06:50.269> mix<00:06:50.629> well<00:06:51.589> I

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
a mere kaan in this whole mix well I

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.069 
a mere kaan in this whole mix well I
think<00:06:52.189> I<00:06:52.789> think<00:06:53.029> there's<00:06:53.209> a<00:06:53.269> possibility<00:06:53.419> he

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:54.079 
think I think there's a possibility he

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:55.389 
think I think there's a possibility he
could<00:06:54.110> what<00:06:54.379> certainly<00:06:54.709> wound<00:06:54.949> up<00:06:55.129> fighting

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:55.399 
could what certainly wound up fighting

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:58.299 
could what certainly wound up fighting
Murray<00:06:55.929> so<00:06:56.929> far<00:06:57.139> as<00:06:57.349> so<00:06:57.589> far<00:06:57.739> as<00:06:57.860> the<00:06:57.949> whole<00:06:58.069> mix

00:06:58.299 --> 00:06:58.309 
Murray so far as so far as the whole mix

00:06:58.309 --> 00:07:00.790 
Murray so far as so far as the whole mix
is<00:06:58.459> concerned<00:06:58.819> if<00:06:58.969> he<00:06:59.149> beats<00:06:59.360> Barrera<00:06:59.809> then<00:07:00.469> he

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 
is concerned if he beats Barrera then he

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.169 
is concerned if he beats Barrera then he
would<00:07:00.979> argue<00:07:01.309> and<00:07:01.399> I'm<00:07:01.459> sure<00:07:01.639> Frank<00:07:01.909> Warren

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:02.179 
would argue and I'm sure Frank Warren

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:03.699 
would argue and I'm sure Frank Warren
would<00:07:02.300> argue<00:07:02.569> it's<00:07:02.689> gone<00:07:02.899> beyond<00:07:03.169> all<00:07:03.349> that<00:07:03.379> I

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:03.709 
would argue it's gone beyond all that I

00:07:03.709 --> 00:07:05.350 
would argue it's gone beyond all that I
you<00:07:03.979> know<00:07:04.039> he<00:07:04.309> then<00:07:04.550> looks<00:07:04.819> towards<00:07:05.119> a<00:07:05.179> big
