00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:07.149
Greek yoghurt sure is delicious, but boy is
it pricy.

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:10.690
You know I don’t even know if this is the
real thing.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.150
You know what I say, sometimes when you want
something done right, you just got to do it

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.150
yourself.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:31.880
Hey fit fam, if you’re a healthy foodie
like me then Greek yoghurt may be a staple

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.950
in your daily diet.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.539
It’s got tons of protein and nutrients and
it’s great for healthy cooking and baking

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:39.650
but, it can also drain your funds really quickly.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.359
I decided to get to the bottom of this nutritious
necessity and was surprised to find that making

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:48.469
your own Greek yoghurt is actually really
simple.

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.969
It takes time but it’s easy and it honestly
tastes so much better than store bought that

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.280
you’ve got to give it a whirl.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.160
Let’s take a look.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.100
For this recipe you will need.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.900
A half-gallon of milk, I use skimmed but any
fat content will work.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.800
About three ounces of Greek yoghurt as a starter.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:18.050
A large pot, spatula, thermometer, large glass
or ceramic bowl, foil, hand towels, oven,

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.250
strainer or colander, cheese cloth or an old
tee shirt.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.930
Stage one: the night before.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.630
Pour milk into a large pot and bring heat
to medium.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.890
Allow to heat until temperature reaches 180
degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.660
Stir consistently so it does not burn at the
bottom and check the temperature regularly.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.740
Once at 180 degrees, pour milk into a glass
or ceramic bowl and allow to cool to about

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.930
105 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit, I aim for 108.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.410
This should take around 45 minutes.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.240
Leave completely uncovered at this stage.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:04.920
While the milk is cooling, heat your oven
to 110 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.330
If your oven doesn’t go this low, mine doesn’t,
you can just turn to its lowest setting and

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.050
turn off when you’ve got about 15 minutes
of cooling time left.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:27.250
If your oven has a warm setting, you can use
this and leave it on all night.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.860
Once the milk reaches 108 degrees Fahrenheit,
stir in three ounces or about half of a single

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.819
serving cup of Greek yoghurt as your starter
culture.

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.730
That’s right, you need yoghurt to make yoghurt
and get those cultures working.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.150
Make sure your yoghurt contains live cultures,
it should say it on the label.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.150
Whisk to combine.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.330
Stage two: overnight.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.100
Cover the pot with a lid or foil and cover
top and sides with towels.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.710
Transfer to your warm oven.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.130
Leave in the warm oven 10 to 12 hours.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:11.880
I use this opportunity to sleep.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.890
Stage three: in the morning.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.900
12 hours later remove from the oven.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.290
Pour out the whey that’s moved to the top
and stir the remaining yoghurt.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.170
This is now regular plain yoghurt.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.959
For Greek yoghurt, place a colander or strainer
on top of a bowl or pot to catch the excess

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.180
whey and line with two to three sheets of
cheese cloth or a tee shirt, if you have one

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.849
that you don’t care about.

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.780
Transfer your stirred yoghurt into the colander
and place in the fridge.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.630
Allow to drain for about three hours removing
the whey from the bottom of the bowl as necessary.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.660
Dispose of the whey or save for another cooking
use.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.900
I recommend repeating the whey dumping process
once or twice throughout the three hours,

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.990
depending on how much your bowl will hold.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.330
After three hours, remove from the refrigerator
and stir.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.790
Your yoghurt should be smooth, thick and creamy.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:12.739
Transfer to a Tupperware or old yoghurt container
and enjoy.

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.320
So if you are going to buy your Greek yoghurt,
how can you be sure it’s the real deal?

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.039
Well, the easiest way is to simply check the
ingredients list.

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.370
Real Greek yoghurt should only contain milk
and live active cultures.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.169
Any other additives such as sugar and corn
starch can counteract many of the health benefits

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.710
Greek yoghurt has to offer.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.780
Greek yoghurt gets its thick, creamy texture
from the straining process but some brands

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.569
thicken their yoghurt with add-ins such as
corn starch, pectin and gelatin.

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:48.680
Just because it says Greek does not mean it’s
the real deal.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.590
And there you have it a healthful homemade
Greek yoghurt that’s easy, cheap and tasty.
