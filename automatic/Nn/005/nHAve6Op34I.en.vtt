00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
any stitching coming out and I have to

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.030 
any stitching coming out and I have to
say<00:03:12.750> guys<00:03:12.900> I've<00:03:13.110> been<00:03:13.230> using<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:13.590> for<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.830> while

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
say guys I've been using it for a while

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.980 
say guys I've been using it for a while
now<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.580> one<00:03:14.880> thing<00:03:15.060> that<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.209> notice<00:03:15.600> is<00:03:15.780> when

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
now the one thing that I notice is when

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.560 
now the one thing that I notice is when
you<00:03:16.110> have<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.440> use<00:03:16.650> your<00:03:17.010> camera

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
you have to use your camera

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.590 
you have to use your camera
you<00:03:19.170> basically<00:03:19.410> have<00:03:19.770> to<00:03:20.160> hold<00:03:20.520> this<00:03:21.150> up<00:03:21.420> and

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
you basically have to hold this up and

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.350 
you basically have to hold this up and
then<00:03:21.870> shoot<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.410> because<00:03:23.070> if<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:23.760> go<00:03:23.940> over

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
then shoot it because if you go over

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.090 
then shoot it because if you go over
you're<00:03:24.750> not<00:03:24.900> able<00:03:25.050> to<00:03:25.200> see<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.560> so<00:03:25.590> that's<00:03:25.890> one

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
you're not able to see it so that's one

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.500 
you're not able to see it so that's one
of<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.250> issues<00:03:26.550> that<00:03:26.580> I<00:03:26.730> had<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.209> also

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
of the issues that I had and also

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.720 
of the issues that I had and also
another<00:03:27.810> issue<00:03:28.050> that<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.320> had<00:03:28.590> was<00:03:28.920> now<00:03:29.490> for

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
another issue that I had was now for

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.160 
another issue that I had was now for
instance<00:03:30.030> when<00:03:30.180> I'm<00:03:30.300> on<00:03:30.420> my<00:03:30.570> Twitter<00:03:30.870> as<00:03:31.050> you

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
instance when I'm on my Twitter as you

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.170 
instance when I'm on my Twitter as you
can<00:03:31.320> see<00:03:31.560> it's<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.160> little<00:03:32.280> cutout<00:03:32.670> right<00:03:32.700> here

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
can see it's a little cutout right here

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.820 
can see it's a little cutout right here
and<00:03:33.360> you<00:03:33.690> kind<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:34.020> have<00:03:34.140> to<00:03:34.290> go<00:03:34.440> underneath

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
and you kind of have to go underneath

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.250 
and you kind of have to go underneath
there<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.370> get<00:03:35.490> that<00:03:35.730> that's<00:03:36.540> pretty<00:03:36.780> much<00:03:36.930> it

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
there to get that that's pretty much it

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.080 
there to get that that's pretty much it
and<00:03:37.440> if<00:03:37.830> I<00:03:37.950> have<00:03:38.100> to<00:03:38.220> push<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.550> up<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.760> little<00:03:38.850> bit

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
and if I have to push it up a little bit

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.410 
and if I have to push it up a little bit
so<00:03:39.180> I<00:03:39.240> can<00:03:39.420> reach<00:03:39.690> then<00:03:40.500> you<00:03:40.680> know<00:03:40.860> in<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.070> back

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
so I can reach then you know in the back

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.449 
so I can reach then you know in the back
the<00:03:42.420> camera<00:03:42.840> is<00:03:42.959> actually<00:03:43.320> out<00:03:43.470> of<00:03:43.500> place<00:03:43.830> so

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
the camera is actually out of place so

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.310 
the camera is actually out of place so
that's<00:03:44.700> probably<00:03:45.270> like<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.630> two<00:03:45.870> issues<00:03:46.110> that

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
that's probably like the two issues that

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.400 
that's probably like the two issues that
I<00:03:46.500> had<00:03:46.800> with<00:03:47.580> this<00:03:47.730> case<00:03:48.060> is<00:03:48.360> basically<00:03:48.990> when

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
I had with this case is basically when

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.050 
I had with this case is basically when
you<00:03:49.500> push<00:03:49.709> this<00:03:49.860> down<00:03:50.070> it's<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.430> little<00:03:50.760> bit<00:03:50.880> too

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
you push this down it's a little bit too

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.610 
you push this down it's a little bit too
down<00:03:51.300> so<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:51.720> can't<00:03:51.990> get<00:03:52.080> to<00:03:52.200> those<00:03:52.350> features

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
down so you can't get to those features

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.949 
down so you can't get to those features
right<00:03:52.950> there<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:53.520> of<00:03:54.480> course<00:03:54.750> when<00:03:54.900> you're

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
right there and of course when you're

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.420 
right there and of course when you're
taking<00:03:55.290> pictures<00:03:55.620> from<00:03:55.740> your<00:03:55.920> camera<00:03:55.980> you
