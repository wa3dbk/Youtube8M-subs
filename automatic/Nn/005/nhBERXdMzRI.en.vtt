00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
creative and thinking how can we start

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.210 
creative and thinking how can we start
fusing<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.320> together<00:01:19.470> how<00:01:19.799> can<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.100> advance

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
fusing this together how can we advance

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.669 
fusing this together how can we advance
how<00:01:20.670> can<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:20.970> be<00:01:21.179> more<00:01:21.210> appealing<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.560> these

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
this and might not appreciate it how can

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.539 
this and might not appreciate it how can
we<00:01:28.140> move<00:01:28.289> all<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.560> forward<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.069> so<00:01:29.429> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
we move all this forward and so the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.580 
we move all this forward and so the
belly<00:01:29.729> dancers<00:01:29.940> that<00:01:30.899> were<00:01:30.990> used<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.350> tiny

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
use a larger amount of space and so a

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.149 
use a larger amount of space and so a
lot<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.869> them<00:01:37.020> took<00:01:37.140> ballet<00:01:37.319> training<00:01:37.679> this<00:01:38.039> is

like back in the 20s and 30s um they

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.279 
like back in the 20s and 30s um they
started<00:01:41.310> becoming<00:01:42.299> more<00:01:42.600> aware<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.929> their

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
but this was the time during this little

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:00.819

like that the one with the bare midriff

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.120 
like that the one with the bare midriff
made<00:03:30.030> more<00:03:30.210> money<00:03:30.330> and<00:03:30.600> so<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.890> dance

costuming<00:03:32.880> started<00:03:33.240> changing<00:03:40.220> I<00:03:41.510> think<00:03:42.510> it's

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
costuming started changing I think it's

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.360 
costuming started changing I think it's
important<00:03:42.960> to<00:03:43.020> know<00:03:43.140> it<00:03:43.260> didn't<00:03:44.100> start<00:03:44.250> out

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
important to know it didn't start out

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.680 
important to know it didn't start out
that<00:03:44.430> way<00:03:44.580> it<00:03:44.790> wasn't<00:03:45.090> intended<00:03:45.360> that<00:03:45.540> way

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
that way it wasn't intended that way

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.710 
that way it wasn't intended that way
that's<00:03:46.470> a<00:03:46.740> largely<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.430> Western<00:03:47.970> influenced

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
that's a largely a Western influenced
