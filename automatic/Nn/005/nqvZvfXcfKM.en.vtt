practically all the time and but there's
a<00:01:27.509> little<00:01:27.630> caveat<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.320> because<00:01:28.590> it's

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
a little caveat to that because it's

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.770 
a little caveat to that because it's
actually<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.430> don't<00:01:30.090> know<00:01:30.150> if<00:01:30.270> it's<00:01:30.390> called<00:01:30.630> if

actually I don't know if it's called if

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.289 
actually I don't know if it's called if
it's<00:01:30.930> glitched<00:01:31.409> but<00:01:32.369> they<00:01:32.640> haven't<00:01:32.970> taken<00:01:33.060> it

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
it's glitched but they haven't taken it

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.840 
it's glitched but they haven't taken it
out<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.600> game<00:01:33.780> after<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.320> patch<00:01:34.710> or<00:01:34.920> two<00:01:35.130> but
