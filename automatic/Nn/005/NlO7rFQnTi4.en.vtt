00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.239
 little bit of my experience in the week

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.680
 flight let's that in skydiving from 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.659
 what are you on the plane until you have 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.730
 seen parachute to stay alive 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.010
 You have about 50 seconds of fall 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.710
 free people skydiving clients 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.250
 like to improve his movements in about 50 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.900
 seconds 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.780
 The fact is that they told him that of course 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.909
 improve your flight only those 50 seconds 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.310
 balance trying it is not very good 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.080
 let's say cash is more effective and I'll 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.790
 a wind tunnel it if you do not 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.530
 you know what a video tone is 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.909
 now you are going to see it from another one you see by 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.830
 coincidences of life to a friend 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.510
 shared a post on facebook where 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.060
 it said there was a wind tunnel 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.260
 chat petersburg in russia that was very 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.970
 very cheap is more 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.490
 half of what it normally costs 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.760
 do it here in Spain so we said 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.580
 we take the Christmas we take the 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.440
 suitcases and we went to san petesburg 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.990
 Russia once there we realized 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.870
 that nobody practically spoke English 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.820
 so, let's say, wrongly, to a 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.860
 recommendation that was to bring you a 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.860
 dictionary of Russian Spanish and yes no 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.450
 we arrive at the airport picks us up a 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.310
 sir the country and that we had to take 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.660
 up to the hotel and the funny thing is coming now 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.000
 when we realize that our 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.550
 Hotel is in the middle of nowhere and next door 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.260
 from a barn above the taxi left us 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.820
 in the wrong place the phone is 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.429
 that walk to what is the building 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.250
 from the hotel and we went with the suitcases and 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.260
 I say that I like more not to invoice 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.510
 because I like to go with my suitcase 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:22.220
 little girl and that's it 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.630
 and you wonder why nobody of those 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.400
 26 hotels 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.000
 in a stable where nobody spoke English 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.220
 and else 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.520
 because of the wind tunnel in the offer 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.990
 that we make rest we would have seen 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.450
 many more people and the waves of 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.760
 tunnel were quite caught so 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.650
 the waves that we had to fly already to the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.510
 one in the morning at five o'clock 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.670
 tomorrow at three in the morning so 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.459
 We usually finished at 4 in the morning 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.770
 at 6 in the morning and then we have to 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.090
 go to the hotel so if we take a hotel 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.250
 in the center of the city 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.380
 it would probably cost us a lot 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.580
 taxi from where we were it was a 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.709
 Village of North Saint Petersburg 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.840
 up there so they took us a hotel 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.840
 year of the town but that was 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.320
 and if the first day of the tunnel arrived 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.660
 wind this is the wind tunnel and I 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.330
 the truth that I was scared or 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.210
 really in jp because that had jumped 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.430
 more times so I knew that feeling and 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.530
 I was in raised I am going to give in 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.200
 Everywhere I thought it was not going to 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.650
 remain stable in the position there 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.650
 you are flying 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.840
 they told me three instructions in English 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.030
 signs because my instructor was russian russian 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.190
 and I did not know English and they put me in 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.610
 tunnel and the truth is that I loved it 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.610
 since they gave me I liked it very much 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.440
 is that life that every happiness already 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.390
 happy after the first day of the tunnel 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.630
 we go back to the hotel and what happens that the 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.090
 hotel is closed as clear yes 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.030
 what were you waiting for rock who had 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.100
 SSPE old makes least five less 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.960
 ten degrees I do not know I was isolated and of 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.950
 Suddenly the hotel was completely 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.800
 closed 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.900
 and luckily the doors had as a 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.290
 kind of hole that we change 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.180
 so we snuck into the farm I think 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.980
 that the taxi driver was saying and these 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.630
 tourists who do not even know Russians where 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.940
 they get to their last one in the morning by 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.709
 this cold there you have to take into account 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.239
 that I actually before leaving the 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.709
 hotel that same day I asked the 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.380
 lady that if the hotel was going to be 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.530
 open 24 hours as I asked 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:29.009
 because this phrase is worth pointing out here 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.620
 It says that the hotel will be open 24 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:36.960
 pity 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:38.310
 crypt and some less bad less bad that 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.430
 I read it after banging on the door 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.870
 for 15 minutes the lady opened us 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.060
 key that did not have that what to be 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.470
 open 24 hours it was really hey 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.300
 I'm going to sleep when you get there 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.100
 knocked on the door until I 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.630
 wake up the truth that the adventures 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.580
 of the first day and a little the fear that 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.620
 we went there because he did not understand anything 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.840
 then the rest of ideas was normalized 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.940
 We learned to take the subway bus 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.040
 I learned to tell the driver of 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.380
 bus please for here is the 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.870
 It is ten steps that is clear 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.330
 means you can stop here proposal jp 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:13.370
 x gets nervous and says the middle phrase 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.370
 kilometer before the stop and the fault 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.930
 the content stays like 1010 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.500
 we were there as we were going to the center 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.870
 from the city of St. Petersburg and we were going 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.570
 to museums as intellectuals that 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.790
 we are or people with common sense that 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.430
 doing minus 5 degrees on the street 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:39.310
 they prefer to see museums, of course, because 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.320
 to walk what is to walk was not enjoyed 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.510
 what I liked most about the city was 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.100
 I really like it a lot, it was really 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.520
 the wind tunnel because inside it was 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.520
 flying 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.740
 I learned to fly from the back 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.930
 a little sitting by games in the tunnel and 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.790
 only in two and a half hours for those 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.020
 that you are interested the return of san 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.510
 petesburg to spain was quite 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.220
 fun because a Russian drunk and in 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.990
 the moment in the back seat of 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.150
 plane I thought people use 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.250
 bags for this but you see that this 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.530
 Sir, well, no, it was directly 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:18.040
 what is the plane's wall and clear 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:20.640
 He left us to see the vomit of his 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.640
 body we 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:26.770
 It was a very cool trip very cool 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.509
 I recommend for those who want 109 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.419
 time to make comments but 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:34.289
 really and nothing that I see you here 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:36.460
 Friday that comes until then I give 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:37.990
 To all this we must add that neither 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.400
 I told you many things through the 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.169
 social networks because the company 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:47.639
 Spanish that I have from telephones told me 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:47.639
 that the mega cost me 12 euros in russia
