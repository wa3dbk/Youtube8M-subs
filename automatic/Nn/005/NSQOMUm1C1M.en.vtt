lawmaking and we have developed a new
strategy<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.600> new<00:00:45.840> technology<00:00:46.610> we<00:00:47.610> brought

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
strategy in new technology we brought

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.569 
strategy in new technology we brought
down<00:00:48.289> from<00:00:50.059> the<00:00:51.059> from<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> last<00:00:52.289> two<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.370> three

months to complete our project basically
we<00:00:57.030> are<00:00:57.149> working<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.410> entry<00:00:58.859> drawn

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
we are working on the entry drawn

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.549 
we are working on the entry drawn
technology<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.680> now<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:02.480> will<00:01:03.480> show<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.719> that

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
technology and now I will show you that

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:12.100 
technology and now I will show you that
what<00:01:05.159> we<00:01:05.369> have<00:01:05.549> done<00:01:07.220> in<00:01:08.220> our<00:01:08.460> project<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:11.060> ok

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
what we have done in our project and ok

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.780 
what we have done in our project and ok
let's<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.290> what<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:16.340> we<00:01:17.340> are<00:01:17.369> training

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
let's see what is this we are training

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.109 
let's see what is this we are training
our<00:01:18.060> systems<00:01:18.799> this<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.009> system<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.369> but<00:01:20.939> we

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
our systems this is a system that but we

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.600 
our systems this is a system that but we
have<00:01:21.330> developed<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:23.840> this<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.080> frequency

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
have developed and this is the frequency

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.399 
have developed and this is the frequency
this<00:01:26.610> shows<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:27.509> shows<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.869> as<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.110> can<00:01:28.229> see

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
this shows this shows you as you can see

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.399 
this shows this shows you as you can see
which<00:01:28.950> shows<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.310> frequency<00:01:29.520> let<00:01:30.390> me<00:01:30.540> let<00:01:31.290> me

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
which shows the frequency let me let me

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.840 
which shows the frequency let me let me
check<00:01:31.560> out<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:32.220> thing<00:01:32.430> there<00:01:32.939> one<00:01:33.240> if

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.380 

now<00:01:39.850> this<00:01:40.540> is<00:01:40.690> a<00:01:40.720> signal<00:01:41.170> signal<00:01:42.040> catcher<00:01:42.390> if

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
now this is a signal signal catcher if

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.000 
now this is a signal signal catcher if
we<00:01:44.290> can<00:01:44.560> place<00:01:45.220> a<00:01:45.250> hand<00:01:45.670> over<00:01:45.790> here<00:01:46.150> then<00:01:46.720> a

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
we can place a hand over here then a

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.250 
we can place a hand over here then a
frequency<00:01:48.010> came<00:01:48.550> over<00:01:48.940> here<00:01:49.180> and<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.930> reading

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
frequency came over here and the reading

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.050 
frequency came over here and the reading
came<00:01:51.040> out<00:01:51.250> from<00:01:51.550> this<00:01:52.210> frequency<00:01:52.810> reader<00:01:53.140> and

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
came out from this frequency reader and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.380 
came out from this frequency reader and
this<00:01:55.060> is<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:56.320> is<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:56.740> transistor<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
this is this is the transistor the

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.980 
this is this is the transistor the
capacitor<00:01:59.020> the<00:02:00.090> transformer<00:02:01.090> and<00:02:01.270> this<00:02:01.810> is

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
capacitor the transformer and this is

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.510 
capacitor the transformer and this is
the<00:02:02.080> fuse<00:02:03.030> when<00:02:04.030> if<00:02:04.300> if<00:02:04.840> we<00:02:05.170> place<00:02:05.520> an

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
the fuse when if if we place an

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.330 
the fuse when if if we place an
aeroplane<00:02:07.210> from<00:02:07.840> this<00:02:08.289> direction<00:02:08.830> it<00:02:09.070> will

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
aeroplane from this direction it will

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.600 
aeroplane from this direction it will
gives<00:02:10.090> you<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.450> reading<00:02:10.840> in<00:02:11.140> our<00:02:12.420> laptop<00:02:13.420> and

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
gives you the reading in our laptop and

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.940 
gives you the reading in our laptop and
now<00:02:15.610> I'll<00:02:15.910> show<00:02:16.180> you<00:02:16.209> later<00:02:16.540> that<00:02:16.870> how<00:02:17.739> it

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
now I'll show you later that how it

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.020 
now I'll show you later that how it
works<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.520> this<00:02:19.180> is<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.630> speaker<00:02:21.030> speaker

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
works and this is the speaker speaker

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.920 
works and this is the speaker speaker
that<00:02:22.780> will<00:02:23.550> that<00:02:24.550> will<00:02:24.610> generate<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.390> siren

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
that will that will generate a siren

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.400 
that will that will generate a siren
when<00:02:26.410> a<00:02:26.440> plane<00:02:26.770> comes<00:02:27.430> across<00:02:28.030> this<00:02:28.750> frequency

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
when a plane comes across this frequency

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.360 
when a plane comes across this frequency
modulation<00:02:30.690> so<00:02:31.690> all<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.260> systems<00:02:32.680> that<00:02:32.860> we

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
modulation so all the systems that we

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.820 
modulation so all the systems that we
have<00:02:33.550> seen<00:02:33.820> is<00:02:34.030> developed<00:02:35.850> totally<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:38.230> it

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
have seen is developed totally and it it

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.530 
have seen is developed totally and it it
it<00:02:39.340> has<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:39.640> it<00:02:40.360> take<00:02:40.660> it<00:02:40.959> took<00:02:41.470> I<00:02:41.920> think<00:02:44.430> it's<00:02:45.430> a

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
it has to it take it took I think it's a

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.430 
it has to it take it took I think it's a
-<00:02:46.540> two<00:02:46.900> months

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
- two months

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.620 
- two months
it's<00:02:47.830> two<00:02:48.010> months<00:02:48.190> it<00:02:48.459> take<00:02:48.670> it<00:02:49.030> took<00:02:49.269> two

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
it's two months it take it took two

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.340 
it's two months it take it took two
months<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:51.000> now<00:02:52.000> I<00:02:52.030> will<00:02:52.540> show<00:02:52.750> you<00:02:52.780> something

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
months and now I will show you something

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.370 
months and now I will show you something
that<00:02:53.739> this<00:02:54.340> is<00:02:54.400> our<00:02:54.610> plane<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.200> this<00:02:56.200> our

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
that this is our plane and this our

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.710 
that this is our plane and this our
plane<00:02:56.620> and<00:02:56.799> now<00:02:57.690> look<00:02:58.690> over<00:02:58.900> there

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
plane and now look over there

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.699 
plane and now look over there
this<00:03:01.720> is<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.900> read<00:03:02.110> on<00:03:02.610> there<00:03:03.610> what<00:03:03.820> we<00:03:04.030> have

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
this is a read on there what we have

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.319 
this is a read on there what we have
specific<00:03:05.709> in<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.190> area<00:03:06.519> now<00:03:06.730> I'll<00:03:07.000> show<00:03:07.299> you
