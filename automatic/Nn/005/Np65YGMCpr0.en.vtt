idea<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.100> they<00:00:53.190> do<00:00:53.250> not<00:00:53.489> state<00:00:53.850> really<00:00:54.570> my

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
idea and they do not state really my

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.389 
idea and they do not state really my
only<00:00:54.899> concern<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.829> they<00:00:56.160> stuff

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399

and fix the online multiplayer and it's

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.020 
and fix the online multiplayer and it's
a<00:00:58.620> real<00:00:58.890> bummer<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.309> get<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.730> not<00:00:59.820> be<00:00:59.969> able

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
a real bummer to get in and not be able

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.369 
a real bummer to get in and not be able
to<00:01:00.210> connect<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> race<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.079> that's<00:01:01.199> actually

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
to connect to a race and that's actually

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.680 
to connect to a race and that's actually
exactly<00:01:01.920> why<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.399> haven't<00:01:02.760> played<00:01:02.969> Supercross

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690

in quite a while even when you do custom
lobbies<00:01:06.810> still<00:01:07.200> sometimes<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.799> games<00:01:07.979> won't

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
start the races won't begin or it begins

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.140 
start the races won't begin or it begins
and<00:01:10.590> quits<00:01:10.860> within<00:01:11.100> 30<00:01:11.340> seconds<00:01:11.790> or<00:01:11.909> there's

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
and quits within 30 seconds or there's

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.000 
and quits within 30 seconds or there's
tough<00:01:12.360> blocks<00:01:12.630> blocking<00:01:13.470> half<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.799> track

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
tough blocks blocking half the track

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.140 
tough blocks blocking half the track
when<00:01:14.130> they<00:01:14.250> should<00:01:14.430> have<00:01:14.520> disappeared<00:01:15.030> by

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
when they should have disappeared by

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.060 
when they should have disappeared by
then<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.509> really<00:01:16.080> hope<00:01:16.200> they<00:01:16.380> focus<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
then I really hope they focus on the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.490 
then I really hope they focus on the
online<00:01:17.369> get<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.000> all<00:01:18.240> squared<00:01:18.570> away<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.990> hope

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
online get that all squared away I hope

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.320 
online get that all squared away I hope
they<00:01:19.619> don't<00:01:19.770> get<00:01:19.890> too<00:01:20.070> focused<00:01:20.280> with<00:01:20.729> grabbing

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
they don't get too focused with grabbing

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.480 
they don't get too focused with grabbing
money<00:01:21.600> from<00:01:21.930> DLC<00:01:22.380> packs<00:01:22.650> because<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.340> know

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
money from DLC packs because I know

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.950 
money from DLC packs because I know
we're<00:01:23.759> all<00:01:23.880> going<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.119> get<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.390> but<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.659> really

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
we're all going to get it but I really

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.300 
we're all going to get it but I really
wish<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.409> all<00:01:25.530> nine<00:01:25.710> would<00:01:25.830> get<00:01:26.009> fixed

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
wish that the all nine would get fixed

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.649 
wish that the all nine would get fixed
so<00:01:26.430> hopefully<00:01:26.759> they'll<00:01:26.909> take<00:01:27.240> care<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.509> that

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
so hopefully they'll take care of that

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.929 
so hopefully they'll take care of that
and<00:01:27.840> make<00:01:28.530> these<00:01:28.710> tracks<00:01:29.009> actually<00:01:29.430> worth<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
and make these tracks actually worth the

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.270 
and make these tracks actually worth the
