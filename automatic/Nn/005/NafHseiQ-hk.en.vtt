00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
computer so I didn't really have to know

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.360 
computer so I didn't really have to know

where it's really smooth and easy to

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.699 
where it's really smooth and easy to
reel<00:02:47.069> because<00:02:48.000> some<00:02:48.510> reels<00:02:48.720> I'll<00:02:49.080> be<00:02:49.349> reeling

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709

up the bait caster so I usually keep two
out<00:03:54.600> but<00:03:55.350> depending<00:03:55.769> on<00:03:55.889> how<00:03:56.069> good<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.250> angler

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609

haven't decreased the size of the sport
at<00:05:52.880> all<00:05:53.000> of<00:05:53.599> they<00:05:53.840> done<00:05:54.020> is<00:05:54.289> bring<00:05:54.680> the<00:05:54.830> frame

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:55.099 
at all of they done is bring the frame

00:05:55.099 --> 00:06:01.420 
at all of they done is bring the frame
in<00:05:55.610> and<00:05:57.340> in<00:05:58.340> here<00:05:58.820> and<00:05:59.180> in<00:06:00.050> here<00:06:00.080> and<00:06:00.530> it's<00:06:01.099> much

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
in and in here and in here and it's much

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.120 
in and in here and in here and it's much
more<00:06:01.610> compact<00:06:02.060> in<00:06:02.180> the<00:06:02.330> 287<00:06:03.139> but<00:06:03.560> it<00:06:03.650> has<00:06:03.800> just

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
more compact in the 287 but it has just

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.409 
more compact in the 287 but it has just
as<00:06:04.340> much<00:06:04.520> power<00:06:04.900> it's<00:06:05.900> just<00:06:06.530> as<00:06:06.710> good<00:06:06.740> just

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
as much power it's just as good just

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:10.870 
as much power it's just as good just
first<00:06:08.419> on<00:06:08.570> smaller<00:06:08.930> things<00:06:09.460> so<00:06:10.460> I've<00:06:10.700> seen

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
first on smaller things so I've seen

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.210 
first on smaller things so I've seen
really<00:06:11.510> high<00:06:11.930> in<00:06:11.990> professionals<00:06:12.740> use<00:06:12.949> these

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
really high in professionals use these

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.740 
really high in professionals use these
and<00:06:14.440> just<00:06:15.440> a<00:06:15.620> really<00:06:15.889> neat<00:06:16.400> little<00:06:16.750> bait

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
and just a really neat little bait

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.810 
and just a really neat little bait
caster<00:06:18.260> it<00:06:19.099> was<00:06:19.220> my<00:06:19.340> first<00:06:19.550> serious

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
caster it was my first serious

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.430 
caster it was my first serious
Manchester<00:06:20.449> I<00:06:20.479> ever<00:06:20.660> got<00:06:20.840> and<00:06:21.080> I've<00:06:21.169> had<00:06:21.320> it

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
Manchester I ever got and I've had it

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.390 
Manchester I ever got and I've had it
like<00:06:21.620> probably<00:06:22.539> six<00:06:23.539> months<00:06:23.630> and<00:06:24.050> it<00:06:24.110> hasn't

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
like probably six months and it hasn't

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.710 
like probably six months and it hasn't
no<00:06:26.400> flaws<00:06:26.970> it<00:06:27.330> hasn't<00:06:27.780> failed<00:06:28.110> once<00:06:29.720> called

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
no flaws it hasn't failed once called

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.890 
no flaws it hasn't failed once called
numerous<00:06:31.050> bats<00:06:31.349> on<00:06:32.000> and<00:06:33.000> like<00:06:33.509> the<00:06:33.659> said<00:06:33.840> of

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 
numerous bats on and like the said of

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.080 
numerous bats on and like the said of
code<00:06:34.050> the<00:06:34.139> Seneca<00:06:34.530> is<00:06:34.770> on<00:06:35.099> bike<00:06:35.400> it<00:06:35.969> has

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
code the Seneca is on bike it has

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:37.909 
code the Seneca is on bike it has
smaller<00:06:36.629> brake<00:06:36.900> tap<00:06:37.110> so<00:06:37.259> it's<00:06:37.409> kind<00:06:37.560> of<00:06:37.590> harder

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 
smaller brake tap so it's kind of harder

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:40.450 
smaller brake tap so it's kind of harder
and<00:06:38.099> easier<00:06:38.250> no<00:06:38.550> I<00:06:38.819> mean<00:06:39.419> it's<00:06:39.509> harder<00:06:39.870> to<00:06:39.960> arm

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
and easier no I mean it's harder to arm

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.429 
and easier no I mean it's harder to arm
adjust<00:06:41.460> them<00:06:41.639> but<00:06:42.180> it's<00:06:42.419> really<00:06:42.479> easy<00:06:42.750> to<00:06:43.080> pop

00:06:43.429 --> 00:06:43.439 
adjust them but it's really easy to pop

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:44.959 
adjust them but it's really easy to pop
them<00:06:43.650> out<00:06:43.770> and<00:06:43.830> lose<00:06:44.159> them<00:06:44.370> because<00:06:44.819> they're

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:44.969 
them out and lose them because they're

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:47.089 
them out and lose them because they're
so<00:06:45.000> small<00:06:45.389> and<00:06:45.449> they're<00:06:45.689> hard<00:06:45.900> to<00:06:46.020> adjust<00:06:46.139> so

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:47.099 
so small and they're hard to adjust so

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:48.920 
so small and they're hard to adjust so
if<00:06:47.159> you<00:06:47.250> just<00:06:47.430> pop<00:06:47.909> them<00:06:48.060> out<00:06:48.150> they'll<00:06:48.780> usually

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:48.930 
if you just pop them out they'll usually

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.339 
if you just pop them out they'll usually
just<00:06:49.289> come<00:06:50.189> out<00:06:50.340> by<00:06:50.520> accident<00:06:51.060> so<00:06:51.270> that<00:06:52.199> might

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:52.349 
just come out by accident so that might

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:53.570 
just come out by accident so that might
be<00:06:52.379> the<00:06:52.500> next<00:06:52.770> real<00:06:52.949> I'm<00:06:53.069> getting<00:06:53.280> the<00:06:53.370> city

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 
be the next real I'm getting the city

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.939 
be the next real I'm getting the city
could<00:06:53.849> but<00:06:54.139> I'll<00:06:55.139> probably<00:06:55.349> have<00:06:55.590> to<00:06:55.680> be<00:06:55.800> more

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:55.949 
could but I'll probably have to be more

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:57.800 
could but I'll probably have to be more
careful<00:06:56.129> with<00:06:56.460> it<00:06:56.969> on<00:06:57.090> this<00:06:57.210> little<00:06:57.419> braking

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:57.810 
careful with it on this little braking

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.559 
careful with it on this little braking
system<00:06:58.110> here<00:06:58.319> but<00:06:58.469> with<00:06:59.099> the<00:06:59.190> Corrado<00:06:59.569> the

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:00.569 
system here but with the Corrado the

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:03.230 
system here but with the Corrado the
braking<00:07:00.990> system<00:07:01.889> tabs<00:07:02.310> are<00:07:02.430> a<00:07:02.490> lot<00:07:02.639> longer<00:07:02.879> so

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 
braking system tabs are a lot longer so

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.439 
braking system tabs are a lot longer so
they're<00:07:03.389> easier<00:07:03.960> to<00:07:04.379> adjust<00:07:04.940> so<00:07:05.940> that's<00:07:06.330> a

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:06.449 
they're easier to adjust so that's a

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:11.149 
they're easier to adjust so that's a
good<00:07:06.629> feature<00:07:07.259> about<00:07:07.530> the<00:07:07.650> kata<00:07:07.889> and<00:07:09.860> it's<00:07:10.860> got

00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:11.159 
good feature about the kata and it's got

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:15.379 
good feature about the kata and it's got
um<00:07:11.840> graphite<00:07:12.840> green<00:07:13.199> on<00:07:14.069> paint<00:07:14.490> on<00:07:14.699> it<00:07:14.879> if<00:07:15.210> it

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:15.389 
um graphite green on paint on it if it

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:16.670 
um graphite green on paint on it if it
was<00:07:15.509> in<00:07:15.629> the<00:07:15.719> sunlight<00:07:16.050> right<00:07:16.229> now<00:07:16.379> you<00:07:16.440> would

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 
was in the sunlight right now you would

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.469 
was in the sunlight right now you would
really<00:07:16.889> be<00:07:17.129> able<00:07:17.219> to<00:07:17.340> see<00:07:17.520> how<00:07:17.669> fluorescent<00:07:18.360> it

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 
really be able to see how fluorescent it

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:20.570 
really be able to see how fluorescent it
is<00:07:18.690> it<00:07:19.229> just<00:07:19.500> pops<00:07:19.800> it's<00:07:20.039> got<00:07:20.219> it's<00:07:20.430> like

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:20.580 
is it just pops it's got it's like

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.019 
is it just pops it's got it's like
really<00:07:21.539> glittery<00:07:21.930> and<00:07:22.229> everything's<00:07:23.029> it's

00:07:24.019 --> 00:07:24.029 
really glittery and everything's it's

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:27.830 
really glittery and everything's it's
awesome<00:07:25.009> and<00:07:26.009> it<00:07:26.129> also<00:07:26.250> has<00:07:26.550> a<00:07:26.580> star<00:07:27.449> drag<00:07:27.569> kid

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 
awesome and it also has a star drag kid

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:28.999 
awesome and it also has a star drag kid
that's<00:07:27.990> what<00:07:28.080> I'm<00:07:28.229> talking<00:07:28.469> about<00:07:28.500> graphite

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:29.009 
that's what I'm talking about graphite

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:35.719 
that's what I'm talking about graphite
green<00:07:32.779> so<00:07:33.779> that's<00:07:34.650> my<00:07:34.860> review<00:07:35.009> on<00:07:35.310> the<00:07:35.340> Shimano

00:07:35.719 --> 00:07:35.729 
green so that's my review on the Shimano

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:38.959 
green so that's my review on the Shimano
Corrado<00:07:36.539> and<00:07:37.039> following<00:07:38.039> me<00:07:38.129> up<00:07:38.219> on<00:07:38.370> my<00:07:38.520> arm
