what<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> start<00:01:01.020> button<00:01:01.230> spork<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.770> if<00:01:02.010> it's

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
what the start button spork is if it's

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.709 
what the start button spork is if it's
actually<00:01:02.430> connected<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.850> decent<00:01:03.300> batteries

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
actually connected to decent batteries

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.090 
actually connected to decent batteries
you<00:01:03.840> just<00:01:03.870> push<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.290> start<00:01:04.559> button<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.040> this

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
you just push the start button and this

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.460 
you just push the start button and this
single<00:01:05.280> turn<00:01:05.549> into<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:06.200> motor<00:01:07.200> it's<00:01:07.380> a

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
single turn into a motor it's a

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.789 
single turn into a motor it's a

'mobile<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.619> was<00:01:22.740> something<00:01:23.009> else<00:01:23.360> could<00:01:24.360> be

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
'mobile it was something else could be

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.020 
'mobile it was something else could be
agog<00:01:24.720> oh<00:01:24.869> yeah<00:01:25.650> they<00:01:25.860> had<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> two<00:01:26.700> or<00:01:26.850> three

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
agog oh yeah they had a two or three

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.880 
agog oh yeah they had a two or three
cylinder<00:01:27.479> get<00:01:27.810> two-stroke<00:01:28.320> engine<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.829> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
cylinder get two-stroke engine in the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.649 
cylinder get two-stroke engine in the
starter<00:01:29.220> motor<00:01:29.250> also<00:01:29.759> acted<00:01:30.060> as<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> generator

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
starter motor also acted as a generator

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.749 
starter motor also acted as a generator
so<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.590> push<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.979> start<00:01:32.220> button<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.640> it

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
so you push the start button and it

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.700 
so you push the start button and it
drives<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.180> drives<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.880> DC<00:01:35.880> generator<00:01:36.360> as<00:01:36.600> a

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
drives it drives the DC generator as a

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.440 
drives it drives the DC generator as a
starter<00:01:37.710> motor<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.159> then<00:01:38.250> once<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.640> start<00:01:39.390> a

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
starter motor and then once you start a

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.030 
starter motor and then once you start a
solenoids<00:01:39.900> disengaged<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.619> turns<00:01:40.799> into<00:01:40.950> a

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
solenoids disengaged it turns into a

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.940 
solenoids disengaged it turns into a
generator<00:01:42.259> yeah<00:01:43.290> probably<00:01:43.530> as<00:01:43.590> go<00:01:43.740> goes

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
generator yeah probably as go goes

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.179 
generator yeah probably as go goes
something<00:01:44.729> like<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.860> should<00:01:46.860> go<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.040> see

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
something like that I should go and see

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:47.810 
something like that I should go and see
the<00:01:47.310> guy<00:01:47.430> yeah

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
the guy yeah

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.179 
the guy yeah
don't<00:01:48.450> bring<00:01:48.570> any<00:01:48.720> for<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.049> while<00:01:51.439> yeah<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.770> don't

seized its they've screwed the plug in
one<00:02:08.709> turn<00:02:09.099> and<00:02:09.310> just<00:02:09.459> left<00:02:09.700> it<00:02:09.940> and

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
one turn and just left it and

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.330 
one turn and just left it and
unfortunately<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.869> lot<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.590> waters<00:02:11.920> gotten<00:02:12.220> in

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
unfortunately a lot of waters gotten in

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.160 
unfortunately a lot of waters gotten in
so<00:02:12.640> I'm<00:02:13.150> gonna<00:02:13.300> whip<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.599> head<00:02:13.750> off<00:02:13.870> tonight

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
so I'm gonna whip the head off tonight

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.140 
so I'm gonna whip the head off tonight
to<00:02:14.410> see<00:02:14.620> if<00:02:14.650> it's<00:02:14.860> actually<00:02:15.239> viable<00:02:16.239> to<00:02:16.599> fix<00:02:16.840> it

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
to see if it's actually viable to fix it

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.720 
to see if it's actually viable to fix it
the<00:02:19.150> gas<00:02:19.330> tanks<00:02:19.750> not<00:02:19.930> too<00:02:20.230> bad<00:02:20.470> she<00:02:21.069> rust<00:02:21.280> spots

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
the gas tanks not too bad she rust spots

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.030 
the gas tanks not too bad she rust spots
but<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.720> could<00:02:22.900> be<00:02:23.019> worse<00:02:23.200> it's<00:02:23.680> probably

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
but it could be worse it's probably

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.040 
but it could be worse it's probably
empty<00:02:24.280> when<00:02:24.459> they<00:02:24.580> first<00:02:24.790> stored<00:02:25.300> it's<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.900> good

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050

and charging at the charging cut very
nice<00:03:02.549> I'll<00:03:03.549> get<00:03:03.730> into<00:03:03.850> this<00:03:03.970> box<00:03:04.239> later<00:03:04.510> the

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
nice I'll get into this box later the

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:05.880 
nice I'll get into this box later the
box<00:03:04.989> looks<00:03:05.170> like<00:03:05.200> it's<00:03:05.410> been<00:03:05.500> taken<00:03:05.799> off

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890

something else it's a different color
white<00:03:08.459> used<00:03:09.459> to<00:03:09.549> be<00:03:09.670> white<00:03:11.310> see<00:03:12.310> is<00:03:12.489> negative

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
white used to be white see is negative

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.670 
white used to be white see is negative
or<00:03:13.239> earth<00:03:14.310> see<00:03:15.810> there's<00:03:16.810> no<00:03:16.900> other<00:03:17.049> tags<00:03:17.410> on<00:03:17.650> it

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
or earth see there's no other tags on it

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.220 
or earth see there's no other tags on it
so<00:03:18.010> yeah<00:03:18.790> that<00:03:18.970> goes<00:03:19.150> up<00:03:19.329> to<00:03:19.359> there<00:03:19.720> looks<00:03:20.109> like

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
some modern PVC coated wiring in there

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.720 
some modern PVC coated wiring in there
whereas<00:03:26.859> this<00:03:26.950> stuff<00:03:27.160> here<00:03:27.400> feels<00:03:27.640> like

rubber there's got a charging control
rheostat<00:03:31.480> on<00:03:31.660> it<00:03:34.500> what<00:03:35.500> rating<00:03:35.829> is<00:03:36.069> that

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
rheostat on it what rating is that

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.479 
rheostat on it what rating is that
doesn't<00:03:37.930> say<00:03:38.230> I<00:03:38.500> asked<00:03:39.130> see<00:03:41.190> fairly<00:03:42.190> high

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
doesn't say I asked see fairly high

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.710 
doesn't say I asked see fairly high
wattage<00:03:42.760> well<00:03:44.760> low<00:03:45.760> resistance<00:03:46.299> high<00:03:46.420> water

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
wattage well low resistance high water

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.190 
wattage well low resistance high water
just<00:03:46.930> went<00:03:47.139> pretty<00:03:47.380> damn<00:03:47.680> course<00:03:48.269> so<00:03:49.269> 50<00:03:49.989> ohms

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
just went pretty damn course so 50 ohms

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.870 
just went pretty damn course so 50 ohms
that<00:03:50.790> many<00:03:51.790> tens<00:03:52.389> of<00:03:52.569> watts<00:03:54.090> hmm

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
that many tens of watts hmm

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.620 
that many tens of watts hmm
anyway<00:03:57.250> it's<00:03:58.250> a<00:03:58.370> little<00:03:58.670> bit<00:03:58.760> for<00:03:58.940> tonight<00:03:59.240> and

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
up and let it charge for a while and

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.800 
up and let it charge for a while and
then<00:04:50.840> turn<00:04:51.470> the<00:04:51.590> key<00:04:52.420> particularly<00:04:53.420> in<00:04:53.600> cold

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810

start and bring your batteries back up
before<00:04:58.370> you<00:04:58.460> can<00:04:58.610> start<00:04:58.850> up<00:04:59.410> pretty<00:05:00.410> damn<00:05:00.650> good

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
before you can start up pretty damn good

he<00:05:17.780> does<00:05:17.930> the<00:05:18.170> Frank<00:05:18.410> and<00:05:18.590> Briggs

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
he does the Frank and Briggs

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.720 
he does the Frank and Briggs
constructions<00:05:19.970> like<00:05:20.090> three<00:05:21.020> or<00:05:21.170> four<00:05:21.730> singles

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
constructions like three or four singles

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.820 
constructions like three or four singles
linked<00:05:23.030> together<00:05:23.240> I<00:05:23.720> think<00:05:24.290> he<00:05:24.380> was<00:05:24.530> working

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
linked together I think he was working

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.350 
linked together I think he was working
on<00:05:24.950> just<00:05:25.220> shearing<00:05:25.580> couplings<00:05:25.970> off<00:05:26.150> at<00:05:26.270> the

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
on just shearing couplings off at the

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.080 
on just shearing couplings off at the
moment<00:05:26.720> but<00:05:27.370> yeah<00:05:28.370> might<00:05:28.580> hit<00:05:28.730> him<00:05:28.850> up<00:05:28.970> with

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
moment but yeah might hit him up with

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.700

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
the Smiths and PM's and photos and just

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.110 
the Smiths and PM's and photos and just
see<00:05:30.920> what<00:05:31.040> he<00:05:31.100> says<00:05:31.720> thanks<00:05:32.720> for<00:05:32.750> watching
