00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.970
 and 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.180
 welcome to faith that guides today 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.980
 we continue with the tutorial of the 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.290
 second edition of the trip to the 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.270
 darkness in this video we will see the turn 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.840
 of the supreme lord the movement and the 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.840
 line of sight 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.740
 once all beings have played 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.990
 their respective turns it's up to him to play 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.260
 supreme lord each of his turns 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.030
 has three phases first the phase of 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.100
 Start of shift where they play 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.470
 skills or rules of the principle of his 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.960
 turn as well as the letters of the 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.870
 supreme master exhausted and steals a 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.750
 new letter from the Supreme Lord of the deck 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.280
 second the activation of the monsters 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.320
 third the phase of the end of the round 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.119
 where the lord about improves the 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.390
 skills or rules of the end of his 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.390
 turn 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.880
 just like the players which 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.710
 they had to finish their shifts completely 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.870
 before another player could act 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.450
 with monsters something similar happens 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.729
 the supreme lord must choose a group of 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.440
 monsters and activate it which implies that 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.750
 you must do the actions you want with 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.550
 every miniature of that group and that when 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.500
 finish with him will go to the next and not 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.660
 you can again handle them the rest of the 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.479
 shift unless you have a letter from 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.100
 overlord permitted the 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.140
 monsters must perform the same 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.090
 actions that the characters with the 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.070
 difference that they can only use one 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.050
 of his two actions per turn to 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.030
 make an attack and they can not 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.220
 look up or stand up or be 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.600
 reanimated because when they are defeated 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.600
 they are removed from the board 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.230
 the supreme lord has his 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.299
 monsters and lieutenants to meet 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.400
 the objectives of your mission and fight 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.260
 the players but it's important that 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.720
 manage the use of your letters very well 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.610
 of the supreme lord since it is also the 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.430
 only hidden resource available to 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.739
 the game the Supreme Lord's deck must 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.750
 have at least 15 letters of fact 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.209
 start with the 15 basic cards 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.159
 indicated in the lower part these 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.739
 cards can be played when indicated 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:49.510
 in your rules text either at the beginning 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.269
 or at the end of the shift or when 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.250
 specify if at some point it's over 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:58.260
 the deck of the supreme lord is shuffled in 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.260
 the discards and a new mallet is formed 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.920
 the monster's cards are divided into 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.150
 two parts on its front face the 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.400
 higher are the statistics 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.100
 skills of the common monsters of 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.770
 bone color and the lower one are those of 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.390
 red leaders in each of the 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.480
 cards were shown you can see the 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.340
 speed life defending the 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.460
 monster skills and his state of 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.500
 attack on the back of the letter 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.240
 you can see the two feature icons 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.850
 that determine the groups that 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:32.030
 the monster belongs to the text of the 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.620
 special rules of it the number of 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.510
 common monsters and leaders there 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.510
 depending on the number of players 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.990
 the lieutenant's letters are 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.820
 similar to those of monsters but in 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.520
 its front part can change its 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.920
 movement life and defense depending on the 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.660
 number of videos in the game 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.880
 in addition the lieutenants have 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.260
 attribute scores to the contrary 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.330
 that the monsters which are due 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.850
 perform a tax test is considered 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.200
 that automatically fail both in the 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.390
 case of monsters like that of 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.420
 Lieutenant is to take into account that 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.700
 actors each letter since the cards 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.240
 of Act 2 are more powerful than this was 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.240
 act 1 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.000
 both monsters and 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.709
 lieutenants or the heroes have 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.540
 movement points they get 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.240
 thanks to movement actions or 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.010
 other skills in this game move 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.230
 over an adjacent square costs a 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.900
 moving point even if it's a 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.990
 diagonal movement except in 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.300
 certain types of terrain 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.890
 the miniatures can not pass 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.920
 by squares occupied by others 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.510
 miniatures unless they are allies but 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.890
 in any case he can not finish his 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.400
 movement in the box of another 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.400
 miniature 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.310
 the boxes delimited with an edge 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:52.680
 red are obstacles and obstruct the 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.139
 moving the line of sight 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.539
 bounded by a blue border contain 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.020
 water and costs two points very well 30 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:02.669
 in it instead of one as usual 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.849
 the boxes delimited by an edge 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:08.099
 green are pits every miniature that falls 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.990
 in it suffers two points of damage ends 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.719
 your movement action and you must perform 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.340
 a special action to get out of it 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:17.099
 In addition, your line of vision is limited to 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:20.069
 adjacent miniatures the delimited ones 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:22.650
 by a yellow line are squares of 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:24.689
 lava moving to them represents losing 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.669
 a point of damage and finish them on 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:29.210
 turn makes the miniature 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.210
 defeated 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.590
 the movement of the big monsters 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.570
 is something special in this game at 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.250
 start moving a big monster it 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.140
 select one of the boxes where 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.390
 was located and it starts to 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.930
 tell you from this to finish the 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.930
 movement 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.919
 once the monster has completed the 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.169
 movement is placed in any 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:53.120
 place that you do always want one of 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:56.830
 the boxes that occupy the base are the 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.830
 the box where the movement ended 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.460
 the monster's base must fit 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:03.860
 perfect perfectly on the board without 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.629
 get out of it occupy obstacles or 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.629
 squares occupied by other thumbnails 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.780
 the line of sight is also quite 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.520
 special in this game so that a 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.530
 miniature have a line of sight 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.350
 until a square must be able to draw 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.729
 a straight line without interruption from 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.979
 any corner of the box or 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:25.650
 boxes of the thumbnail up to any 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:27.600
 corner of the objective square if that 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.790
 imaginary line goes through or travels a 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.419
 edge meets a door or a 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:35.400
 blocked box no line of sight 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:37.440
 for example this hero has line of 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.930
 vision with the zombie and with the archer 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.479
 double because lines can be drawn 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.190
 from one corner to another but without 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:46.700
 However, there is no line of sight 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.700
 this spider 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:51.849
 and with the explanation of the line of 

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:54.159
 vision we finished the video today on the 

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:55.989
 next video we will see the combat the 

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:58.239
 different types of attack and their 

00:06:55.989 --> 00:07:00.459
 properties the team of heroes and 

00:06:58.239 --> 00:07:02.050
 we will also talk about family members if 

00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:03.279
 you liked the video do not forget to give it 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.379
 to the option of like on youtube 

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:07.239
 subscribe to the channel and share it in the 

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:10.019
 social networks like 'facebook' 'twitter' 

00:07:07.239 --> 00:07:10.019
 until next time 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.990
 once
