in<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:18.060> root<00:01:18.240> systems<00:01:18.720> will<00:01:18.990> grow<00:01:19.170> into<00:01:19.380> it

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
in the root systems will grow into it

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.490 
in the root systems will grow into it
it'll<00:01:20.400> find<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.820> fertilizer<00:01:21.240> over<00:01:21.390> time<00:01:21.869> you

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
it'll find a fertilizer over time you

of<00:01:55.290> green<00:01:55.560> leaves<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.950> will<00:01:56.040> grow<00:01:56.219> about<00:01:56.310> two

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
of green leaves it will grow about two

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.910 
of green leaves it will grow about two
feet<00:01:56.820> tall<00:01:56.880> but<00:01:57.630> unlike<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:58.079> mustard<00:01:58.680> green

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
feet tall but unlike this mustard green

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.620 
feet tall but unlike this mustard green
and<00:01:59.130> unlike<00:01:59.369> lettuces<00:01:59.759> and<00:01:59.820> spinach<00:02:00.329> as<00:02:00.450> soon

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
and unlike lettuces and spinach as soon

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.690 
and unlike lettuces and spinach as soon
as<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.869> gets<00:02:00.930> warm<00:02:01.079> these<00:02:01.890> plants<00:02:02.340> tend<00:02:02.520> to

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
as it gets warm these plants tend to

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.969 
as it gets warm these plants tend to
flower<00:02:02.969> Swiss<00:02:03.780> chard<00:02:04.079> will<00:02:04.259> keep<00:02:04.439> on<00:02:04.590> growing

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
flower Swiss chard will keep on growing

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.709 
flower Swiss chard will keep on growing
so<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.219> will<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.579> able<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.820> harvest<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.299> all

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
so you will be able to harvest this all

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.779 
so you will be able to harvest this all
season<00:02:07.170> long<00:02:07.439> here<00:02:07.829> in<00:02:07.920> Maryland<00:02:08.250> zone<00:02:08.399> seven

season long here in Maryland zone seven

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.510 
season long here in Maryland zone seven
and<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.300> can<00:02:09.479> see<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.560> root<00:02:10.950> system<00:02:11.340> isn't

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
and you can see the root system isn't

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.820 
and you can see the root system isn't
overgrown<00:02:12.180> it's<00:02:12.480> not<00:02:12.629> overly<00:02:13.050> coiled<00:02:13.560> so

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
overgrown it's not overly coiled so

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.180 
overgrown it's not overly coiled so
about<00:02:14.190> about<00:02:15.090> four<00:02:15.450> weeks<00:02:15.690> of<00:02:15.930> time<00:02:16.620> in<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:16.920> Cell

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
about about four weeks of time in a Cell

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.430 
about about four weeks of time in a Cell
and<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:18.150> seed<00:02:18.330> starting<00:02:18.690> cell<00:02:18.900> is<00:02:19.110> what<00:02:19.290> you

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
and the seed starting cell is what you

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.400 
and the seed starting cell is what you
want<00:02:19.620> for<00:02:20.220> most<00:02:20.460> plants<00:02:20.880> so<00:02:21.660> just<00:02:22.080> you're<00:02:22.380> not

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
want for most plants so just you're not

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.300 
want for most plants so just you're not
going<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.740> bury<00:02:22.890> this<00:02:23.040> deeper<00:02:23.580> than<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.950> level

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
going to bury this deeper than the level

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.150 
going to bury this deeper than the level
that<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:30.200> chart<00:02:31.200> came<00:02:31.410> out<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.770> starting

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
that the chart came out of the starting

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.220 
that the chart came out of the starting
mix<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:32.550> want<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.000> just<00:02:33.150> make<00:02:33.930> sure<00:02:34.110> you

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
mix so you want to just make sure you

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.590 
mix so you want to just make sure you
set<00:02:34.440> up<00:02:34.590> just<00:02:34.830> like<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.180> press<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.360> in<00:02:36.450> that's

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
set up just like that press it in that's

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.930 
set up just like that press it in that's
two<00:02:36.900> plants<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.680> I'll<00:02:37.920> do<00:02:38.160> another<00:02:38.430> planting

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
two plants and I'll do another planting

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.960 
two plants and I'll do another planting
about<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.180> foot<00:02:39.450> down<00:02:39.600> there<00:02:40.160> now<00:02:41.160> for<00:02:41.220> the

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
about a foot down there now for the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.090 
about a foot down there now for the
mustard<00:02:42.360> greens<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:43.350> plant<00:02:43.650> again<00:02:43.860> like<00:02:44.010> I

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
mustard greens this plant again like I

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.430 
mustard greens this plant again like I
said<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.850> cool<00:02:45.180> other<00:02:45.330> plant<00:02:45.660> it's<00:02:46.170> not

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
said is a cool other plant it's not

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.160 
said is a cool other plant it's not
going<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:47.070> last<00:02:48.000> into<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.510> warm<00:02:48.720> season<00:02:49.080> so

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
going to last into the warm season so

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.270 
going to last into the warm season so
I'm<00:02:49.260> going<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.440> plant<00:02:49.680> this<00:02:49.800> a<00:02:49.860> little<00:02:50.190> bit

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
I'm going to plant this a little bit

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.580 
I'm going to plant this a little bit
closer<00:02:50.550> together<00:02:50.850> because<00:02:51.720> this<00:02:52.020> will<00:02:52.290> grow

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
closer together because this will grow

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.630 
closer together because this will grow
quickly<00:02:53.100> it<00:02:53.670> will<00:02:53.790> go<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.030> flower<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:55.430> it<00:02:56.430> will

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
quickly it will go to flower and it will

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.720 
quickly it will go to flower and it will
die<00:02:56.850> out<00:02:58.040> so<00:02:59.040> I'm<00:02:59.130> going<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.310> do<00:02:59.430> this<00:02:59.550> about

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
die out so I'm going to do this about

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.720 
die out so I'm going to do this about
every<00:02:59.850> six<00:03:00.300> inches<00:03:00.390> that's<00:03:00.750> one<00:03:01.050> plant<00:03:01.730> here

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
every six inches that's one plant here

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.060 
every six inches that's one plant here
are<00:03:02.970> several<00:03:03.450> plants<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.230> I'm<00:03:04.590> going<00:03:04.770> to<00:03:04.830> thin

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
are several plants and I'm going to thin

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.320 
are several plants and I'm going to thin
that<00:03:05.220> down<00:03:06.380> -<00:03:07.380> really<00:03:07.770> -<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.640> I'm<00:03:09.030> just<00:03:09.150> going

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
that down - really - and I'm just going

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.600 
that down - really - and I'm just going

half of a tablespoon that's perfectly

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.210 
half of a tablespoon that's perfectly
fine<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:33.750> just<00:03:33.810> want<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.290> go<00:03:34.410> more<00:03:34.680> than<00:03:34.739> a
