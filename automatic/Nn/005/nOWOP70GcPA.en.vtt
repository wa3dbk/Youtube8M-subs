set up the the supersize and show you
how<00:02:10.709> easy<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.280> is

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
how easy it is

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.130 
how easy it is
to<00:02:12.180> do<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:13.940> okay<00:02:14.940> here's<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.420> super<00:02:15.750> siphon

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
to do it okay here's the super siphon

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.490 
to do it okay here's the super siphon
it's<00:02:16.860> like<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.340> six<00:02:17.670> foot<00:02:17.910> hose<00:02:18.150> on<00:02:18.930> one<00:02:19.260> end<00:02:19.440> you

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
it's like a six foot hose on one end you

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.470 
it's like a six foot hose on one end you
have<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.860> valve<00:02:20.100> there's<00:02:21.090> like<00:02:21.210> a<00:02:21.270> little

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
have the valve there's like a little

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.180 
have the valve there's like a little
glass<00:02:21.720> marble<00:02:22.470> in<00:02:22.560> there<00:02:22.740> two<00:02:22.860> acts<00:02:23.010> as<00:02:23.160> a

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
glass marble in there two acts as a

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.650 
glass marble in there two acts as a
valve<00:02:23.490> where<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.880> fuel<00:02:24.060> can<00:02:24.210> only<00:02:24.330> move<00:02:24.510> one

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
valve where the fuel can only move one

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.650 
valve where the fuel can only move one
way<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:25.890> end<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.460> metal<00:02:26.910> end<00:02:27.060> goes<00:02:27.330> into

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
way the this end the metal end goes into

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.840 
way the this end the metal end goes into
the<00:02:27.750> fuel<00:02:28.020> source<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.590> this<00:02:29.220> end<00:02:29.490> goes<00:02:29.520> into

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
the fuel source and this end goes into

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:30.830 
the fuel source and this end goes into
your<00:02:29.910> tank<00:02:30.210> so<00:02:30.330> we're<00:02:30.420> going<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.600> go<00:02:30.630> ahead<00:02:30.750> and

pretty<00:02:41.459> good<00:02:42.650> ok<00:02:43.650> now<00:02:44.430> this<00:02:44.640> end<00:02:44.940> goes<00:02:45.000> into

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
pretty good ok now this end goes into

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.780 
pretty good ok now this end goes into
the<00:02:45.630> fuel<00:02:45.870> source<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:49.280> need<00:02:50.280> two<00:02:50.430> hands<00:02:50.670> for

with a gun and I supposed to have which
is<00:04:23.310> not<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.520> case

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
is not the case

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.710

state<00:04:24.580> I'm<00:04:24.790> allowed<00:04:25.030> to<00:04:25.180> carry<00:04:25.330> this<00:04:25.540> thing

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
state I'm allowed to carry this thing

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.659 
state I'm allowed to carry this thing
it's<00:04:26.380> not<00:04:26.560> illegal<00:04:26.860> I<00:04:27.100> just<00:04:27.250> don't<00:04:27.400> want<00:04:27.550> the

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
it's not illegal I just don't want the

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.730 
it's not illegal I just don't want the
unwanted<00:04:28.000> attention<00:04:28.419> oh<00:04:28.600> but<00:04:29.410> you're<00:04:29.530> running

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
unwanted attention oh but you're running

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.770 
unwanted attention oh but you're running
out<00:04:29.830> as<00:04:30.040> you<00:04:30.130> can<00:04:30.250> see<00:04:30.460> first<00:04:31.270> tanks<00:04:31.600> running

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
out as you can see first tanks running

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.830 
out as you can see first tanks running
out<00:04:32.070> we<00:04:33.070> just<00:04:33.370> quickly<00:04:33.580> switch<00:04:34.240> to<00:04:34.389> the<00:04:34.449> second

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
out we just quickly switch to the second

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.140 
out we just quickly switch to the second
tank<00:04:35.130> once<00:04:36.130> again<00:04:36.370> this<00:04:36.460> is<00:04:36.520> really<00:04:36.820> difficult

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
tank once again this is really difficult

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.310 
tank once again this is really difficult
to<00:04:37.540> do<00:04:37.690> with<00:04:37.870> one<00:04:38.110> hand<00:04:38.320> holding<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:38.710> camera

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
to do with one hand holding the camera

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.730 
to do with one hand holding the camera
but<00:04:41.320> it's<00:04:41.560> possible<00:04:43.020> just<00:04:44.020> simulate<00:04:44.440> the<00:04:44.560> one

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
but it's possible just simulate the one

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.050 
but it's possible just simulate the one
arms<00:04:44.949> broken<00:04:45.250> or<00:04:45.490> something<00:04:45.610> like<00:04:45.820> that<00:04:45.880> right

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
arms broken or something like that right

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.360 
arms broken or something like that right
now<00:04:46.240> I<00:04:46.600> can<00:04:47.260> do<00:04:47.350> that<00:04:47.530> it's<00:04:47.740> a<00:04:47.800> good<00:04:47.919> simulation

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
now I can do that it's a good simulation

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.409 
now I can do that it's a good simulation
so<00:04:49.240> we'll<00:04:49.389> stack<00:04:49.660> this<00:04:50.880> stack<00:04:51.880> this<00:04:52.060> up<00:04:52.270> here

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
so we'll stack this stack this up here

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.780 
so we'll stack this stack this up here
with<00:04:52.540> the<00:04:52.570> other<00:04:52.780> one<00:04:53.160> got<00:04:54.160> both<00:04:54.370> my<00:04:54.550> valve

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
with the other one got both my valve

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.270 
with the other one got both my valve
sitting<00:04:55.150> there<00:04:55.240> we'll<00:04:55.810> switch<00:04:56.080> this<00:04:56.290> super

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
sitting there we'll switch this super

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.530 
sitting there we'll switch this super
siphon<00:04:58.139> make<00:04:59.139> sure<00:04:59.290> all<00:04:59.380> the<00:04:59.440> all<00:04:59.889> the<00:05:00.330> fuel<00:05:01.330> is

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
siphon make sure all the all the fuel is

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.820 
siphon make sure all the all the fuel is
not<00:05:01.690> going<00:05:01.780> to<00:05:01.840> leak<00:05:02.020> everywhere<00:05:02.320> will<00:05:02.650> switch

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
not going to leak everywhere will switch

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.780 
not going to leak everywhere will switch
the<00:05:02.860> super<00:05:03.280> siphon<00:05:03.639> over<00:05:04.450> to<00:05:04.540> this<00:05:04.660> one<00:05:05.700> put<00:05:06.700> it

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
the super siphon over to this one put it

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.260 
the super siphon over to this one put it
in<00:05:06.940> and<00:05:07.780> then<00:05:07.870> shake<00:05:08.139> it<00:05:08.320> up<00:05:08.410> and<00:05:08.530> down<00:05:09.270> and

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
in and then shake it up and down and

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.330 
in and then shake it up and down and
then<00:05:10.450> next<00:05:10.600> thing<00:05:10.690> you<00:05:10.840> know<00:05:10.990> flow<00:05:11.889> in<00:05:12.070> again

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
then next thing you know flow in again

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.450 
then next thing you know flow in again
we're<00:05:13.210> going<00:05:13.300> to<00:05:13.360> get<00:05:13.540> an<00:05:13.630> extra<00:05:13.840> shake<00:05:14.050> there

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.740 

now<00:05:18.460> it's<00:05:18.639> flowing<00:05:18.970> you<00:05:19.210> can<00:05:19.360> tell<00:05:19.570> because

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
now it's flowing you can tell because

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.820 
now it's flowing you can tell because
the<00:05:19.930> sound<00:05:22.710> going<00:05:23.710> right<00:05:23.979> my<00:05:24.190> tank<00:05:24.460> hands-free

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
the sound going right my tank hands-free

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.320 
the sound going right my tank hands-free
