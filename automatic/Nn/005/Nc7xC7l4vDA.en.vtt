 fernando pérez architect former dean of 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.470
 architecture of the catholic university 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.260
 and current academic of said house of 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.780
 studies students and especially friend of 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.639
 fernando castillo velasco wrote a 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.260
 book with the legacy of the former mayor of the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.839
 queen in constructions that constitute 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.659
 urban landmarks in chile- one of its 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:23.249
 key works are the towers of tajamar 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:24.779
 located in front of the current square of 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:28.019
 the aviation that in a terrain 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.779
 relatively unique in santiago and where 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.990
 there had already been the idea of ​​making 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.960
 other projects 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.430
 worked here one games 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.530
 entertainment I think they were the 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.130
 games the towers of tajamar was 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.950
 somehow an emblematic set 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:49.910
 of santiago of the 60s was built 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:52.250
 as between 1962 and 1966 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.040
 then how do you analyze this work and 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:59.390
 also for the design that is used in 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.820
 this time to see is very interesting the 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.670
 way he builds a set 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.979
 harmonious this work 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.250
 you have to keep in mind that at that time 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.979
 It was the tallest building in Santiago with 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.140
 28 floors and it meant a whole 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.600
 technical effort to carry it forward 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.970
 be able to give accessibility conditions 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.789
 but it was not just doing four buildings 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.310
 was to make four buildings was to achieve 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:27.119
 in a sort of square or center 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.759
 commercial that will continue and finish 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:35.259
 providence and legacy leaves this project 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:37.149
 real estate to see a lot of things a 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.970
 of the things that it shows us is the 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.890
 way in which just some buildings 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.659
 can interact with a space 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.060
 public so that by putting the 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:50.319
 voltages were leaving a drawing in the 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.980
 skin of the building and you as an analyst 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:55.890
 that this place has been preserved 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.680
 I believe that it has been preserved first 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.530
 because it has a very localized 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.110
 secondly valuable by itself 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.420
 design quality that in some way 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.270
 it ends up imposing and in third place 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.930
 because it is very well built 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:16.020
 after post earthquake year 2010 of 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.820
 February the community 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.070
 the owners said make a 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.750
 study we did with the seen there was no 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.460
 structural problem look what 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.440
 fantastic the view what I said 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.150
 transparency to the north that 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.610
 It produces here with Cerro San Cristóbal 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.840
 etc. let's say 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.150
 and the way they cross these bridges 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.920
 in the different floors to produce 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.810
 this triple height is one thing 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.690
 truly unique and from this tower 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.319
 the view towards the west is incredible 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.599
 it's interesting that we are in 1960 and today 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.120
 day the famous one is developing 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.099
 green roof technology 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.540
 I just invite you to another project that 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.910
 He was also linked when Fernando 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.580
 of the castle I do not know if that project in 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.400
 regions of course he made projects 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.280
 in regions like the Chinchorro population 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.440
 of houses patio some houses low courtyards 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.230
 of social housing also put there 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.260
 in the desert with shades 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.360
 taking the local architecture of arica 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:19.040
 as a good basis I think it's the 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:22.549
 most important project of greater scope 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.670
 of housing that begins in the 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.560
 the early 50s almost and is prolonged 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.890
 until the 60s was a project of 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.440
 very very very long duration that is, this is 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.900
 develops in 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.770
 in a set a huge amount of 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:43.210
 hectares and as I say it combines more flats 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.890
 lower highs and also houses like 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.740
 during life nothing to do as 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.520
 for 50 years ago different 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.520
 totally different 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:58.780
 that nobody here was pure meadows 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.550
 greens in reality the same 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.230
 departments and still so far 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.610
 if I have contributed porcel 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.800
 I see that in the eleven are not yet plan 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.270
 unless the neighbors are still so 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.890
 enthusiasts because they have defended 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.140
 they have also defended the spaces 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.630
 open so they do not deal with 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.100
 other buildings but to recover that 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.470
 condition of space equipment 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.570
 public 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.770
 We appreciate your time and all the 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.930
 availability and very good with us 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.120
 thank you very much it's a pleasure positioning 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.020
 castles thank you very much tomás cansino
