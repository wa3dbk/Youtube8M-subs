00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.260
 hi guys so today we're getting 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.809
 found for a new video of 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.699
 gameplay i'm with for series bouquet 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.680
 everyone so this is a video of 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.030
 gameplay of har homa which is a 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.180
 member of our plan with his t71 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:29.490
 he made 5000 damage keys by 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.680
 lighting I think like that where the 4400 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.350
 precisely and you promise the 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.010
 party finally a good especially not tell me 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.460
 I propose to launch 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.019
 going so it's advantage is the fact you 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.710
 because we do not do a lot of videos 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.749
 scouts 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.030
 finally me I am very bad a scoop 

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:48.090
 so this is an opportunity why 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.680
 it really gives for a part rather 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.120
 not bad for him a little stunned be the 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.050
 map actually never from this moment airlines 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.680
 dal there he hesitates a bit like when 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.660
 He will go 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.239
 yeah at the beginning go right but he 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.500
 folds to the left was never 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.699
 really where to go with this concept but 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.930
 intense and yeah but it's not 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.760
 difficult especially for 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.340
 especially with his chariot oiled he said 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.630
 may be because in any case 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.630
 this elbow but passively obviously 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.240
 so that's fine I 'm not really that 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.470
 that he does there he goes to the articles 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.710
 not in the corner we specify we do not have 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.080
 seen life is their foot before that's it 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.080
 so the team layout by very 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.540
 badly everyone 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.160
 left to right me it is rather yes 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.900
 actually I'm not that far from play 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.700
 he only one load on the other side 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.830
 so it's very good usually ends 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.790
 on a defeat as usual I rattle a 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.110
 defense here always have fun 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.090
 so he puts himself in front of the position 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.580
 artists is to discover it 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.970
 was going to bino also to magnan remotely 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.850
 that two or more normal there the 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.630
 consumables 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:00.590
 good it starts to happen from the other 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:02.750
 side t71 scout him like a pig he 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.520
 wait, we listen and we'll wait with 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.350
 him he has a frame quite precise I 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.270
 the impression yeah that's aiming fast enough 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.340
 yes then do you see that that 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.590
 recharge in 19 seconds 58 that's it 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.130
 yeah no it's zero that bug like 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.410
 always at 19 seconds and that's pretty much 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.459
 close to that for a tea 71 altogether 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.620
 to stay normal who already has pcr mocked 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.690
 it 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.409
 but I do not know me with the minister 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.540
 cda bearish we can not see a 2nd goal 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.790
 normal to moisn black stripes a good 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.310
 little fashion bug 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.790
 So there it is France that magnifiers 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.620
 this is philippe kamanyola evening 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.680
 face the kac nothing much luck 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.950
 three missed shots yeah continues to 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.120
 miss it not rent it yet it has some 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.950
 chance moment there is a lot of luck 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:57.579
 that he takes a shot of hellcats pretty 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:03:00.430
 bad ptc not fix it he can not who 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.530
 is a blow again it's a shame he has 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.329
 repaired and a lot of chance of not 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:10.989
 to die yeah others do not have to 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:12.340
 charge the l4 magnifier and recharge for the 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.459
 moment he did kill a lot of 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.639
 people there when they were taken 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:22.859
 a house lost in the make way it will be 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:28.169
 with 24 dead and continued to advance 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:28.169
 so yes s2 and the Algerian 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.830
 gone to 6 gb / s of magnifying glass still luck the 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:42.370
 c30 that darling normally universe of 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:45.160
 padua and we steal the bottom this do 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.870
 the art normally yeah so the part 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.459
 by so well on the other side they have 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.410
 posed before it's a single Charles opens 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.120
 hold them back this is not room not 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.110
 bad luck a trip would have been 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.730
 kind in their charge and that's what makes 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:00.520
 weigh now must make him a little 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:03.010
 so before the cia people who charge 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.750
 the side that collapses but try the 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.690
 all 34 is dead it is the only one who has it 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.400
 restraint he just passed the shore 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.440
 is assaulted the gunner spatula alone 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.650
 holding this distance is to move with 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.650
 we 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.270
 six years ago damage for the moment 0 

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.370
 kills so that's very clever 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:27.240
 hard on the right I do not know if the 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:28.740
 aim and there they turn not high enough 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.790
 and in contrast France 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.140
 yeah the nashor do not miss it then there 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.900
 and what does I do not understand 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.310
 why there is no article 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.530
 he just changed his look or 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.810
 frankly and he's a neighborhood friend so 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.510
 it was so good to go get 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.680
 articulations so he goes is actually who 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.560
 this morning it's his goal it's really 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.820
 spots and no damage 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.140
 still risk taking it's a 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.140
 difficult task retouching the room 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.400
 hays france would have 51 I'm not trying to 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.080
 to shoot on 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.950
 no he withdraws in motion there with the 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.540
 size of his circle 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.480
 it's practically impossible is not it 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.890
 good we still feel that there is no 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.300
 too much the ballot habit because 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:14.200
 if we look and bear practically 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.120
 always in a straight line on the move 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.140
 before anyway yes yes yes yes no 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.840
 but here I find that he is ahead 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.740
 a lot in a straight line 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.960
 as otherwise part it has dark 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:29.850
 all right it's a bit dangerous but 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.850
 he is doing his job well and about 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.900
 yes stops 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:47.030
 so 50 cent face he continues to move forward 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:48.920
 he 's not afraid here's the last ones are the 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:52.670
 base in any case it is made 4 which 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.990
 is the 5 and the customer algeta was good 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:57.560
 he had excellent support on this 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:00.890
 part the articles are managed the the 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:03.800
 hunters as frankly there they have 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.150
 really well played it starts at cap 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.270
 but well everyone already in the process of 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:13.160
 return west for arrivals none 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:16.100
 luck on aiming is a lot this 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:19.010
 evening at 5 years skoula their allies it's 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:23.110
 unheard of and until then you avoid 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.110
 preferred to commit suicide i think it's not 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.070
 the instructions one year he believed they 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.980
 were coming the other side he's con 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.460
 are we still going to have him then he 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:38.060
 finally arrives 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:41.300
 yeah and there that 30 of 32 so here is 810 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.920
 gaza miller damage thanks to him yeah bah 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.820
 listen to a pretty effective part with 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.400
 a lot of luck 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:49.490
 yes there he frankly play well on 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.230
 this shot there yes it's true I have a good 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.870
 part so we hope you liked it 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:56.890
 and vincent finds next time 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.890
