00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:07.689
 or we are going to do it in the thermomix 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:12.280
 jam dish I have half here 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:16.090
 kilo of peeled golden apples and 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.010
 cut without seeds or anything the same 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.010
 amount of sugar is always the same 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.350
 amount of half a kilo of sugar 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.790
 I have a lemon, I take the part 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.090
 yellow to take advantage of it 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:30.360
 then for colleges whatever it says 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:35.210
 the white part of the strip 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.210
 not because of pieces of the seeds 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:43.220
 because it has all the delegates 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.220
 because lemon is an antioxidant 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.020
 then you also do for example 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.239
 fried tomato to wait for all the 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.250
 week was not that you throw him a 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.800
 trickle 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.550
 of lemon juice you can because this 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.920
 intensity 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:07.509
 it's a big two small area 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.509
 carrot pieces why because yes 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:21.009
 the Apple 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.370
 if you want to do it with pieces by 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.840
 example of apple and orange because what 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.790
 we would put in the center then to a 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.250
 very big speed we would spend a 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.350
 little bit, I already know how apple is 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.770
 I will do as the relegated 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.700
 Apple 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.700
 and here the sugar 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.759
 to 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.780
 and let's go the atp a little bit 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.310
 4 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.770
 we leave 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.770
 rest now low 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.520
 what 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.040
 and what happens then that you can come out 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.410
 areas of time once I do not remember 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.110
 would be 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.010
 61 or something like that because I put him 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.010
 too much 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.400
 well then nothing now let's catch 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.400
 let's stop 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.780
 between another 100 degrees and we go to 5 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:18.590
 and then 5 then we'll see how it has been 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:22.700
 because it depends on the fruit 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.700
 Well, we'll let it go 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.230
 another thing I've seen a lot of people that 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.069
 example is making jam from 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.069
 of strawberry 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.420
 d 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:49.330
 but the strawberry 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.420
 then it looks good when you hicierais 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:56.940
 for example the defense or a route delegates 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.940
 a lot of water instead of degrees 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.160
 to hundreds that if not what it does is 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.550
 makes an audition exiting the 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.550
 sites 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.260
 to 5 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.370
 good all the time and at the end of 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.180
 couple I left a quarter of an hour for 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.130
 it cooled a bit because it was opening 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:40.310
 when my eyes reach 5 at 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.290
 5 minutes lower it to two and a half because 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.160
 in five minutes to five it's all 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.160
 so 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.460
 arias 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.460
 the lemon 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.400
 and the 150 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.400
 ah 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.770
 i 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.540
 I have prepared another edge just in case 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.630
 now 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.030
 the week is not necessary 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.530
 100 degrees 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.010
 the lemon is antioxidant 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.199
 but I had a mouthful 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:44.400
 work because that's how it will be until 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:46.230
 tomorrow 24 hours we are going to leave them here and 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.180
 we do it the vacuum will remain 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:52.200
 closed ration and you can keep it 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.580
 pantry quietly a good year 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.830
 I hope you liked this one 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:59.440
 video and I'll be making jams and 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:02.630
 other kinds of other textures 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:05.110
 good night and until next 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.110
 ah
