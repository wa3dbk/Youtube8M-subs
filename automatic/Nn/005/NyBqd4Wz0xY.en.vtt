extremely rare to get a dragon spear

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.270 
extremely rare to get a dragon spear
because<00:02:00.600> almost<00:02:01.049> every<00:02:01.380> monster<00:02:01.590> drops<00:02:02.070> it

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280

but that would also mean that four

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.040 
but that would also mean that four
eighths<00:02:17.280> layered<00:02:17.760> levels<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.390> would<00:02:18.870> not
