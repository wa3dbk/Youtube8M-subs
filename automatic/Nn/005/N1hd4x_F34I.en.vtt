 [Music] 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:13.259
 hello how welcome are you to the video talk 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.240
 of primeriti in today's video I'm going to 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.760
 show you step by step how to make a 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.279
 4-strand braid you are going to see what is 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.900
 a braid that looks very elaborate very 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.640
 difficult to do but not really 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.500
 it is so difficult and in fact it is much more 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.849
 simple that the 5-strand braid that already 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.380
 I have seen by the comments in the video 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.939
 that some of the five ends still 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.769
 It costs a little bit since you're going to see 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.930
 as with the four ropes you learn 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.020
 right away, that's what we're going to 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.670
 need gummies obviously a brush 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.739
 to brush the hair and good and 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.539
 you know that I like it always before 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.460
 of doing any 30 apply some kind 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:45.690
 of serum that gives us that at the same time 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.300
 in is of shine in the hair and that we 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.399
 allow to handle it with ease I good 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.930
 now I'm using one of the hit room 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.719
 of liquid gold that has argan oil 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.000
 and well you are going to see that leaves the hair 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.920
 super soft which is what we're going to do 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.859
 it's not like that you see that I've picked myself up 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.510
 the hair in a side ponytail to me 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.250
 like to always work with hair 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.810
 collected in a ponytail because that's not how 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.540
 We escape the strands is easier 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.940
 control 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.160
 but if then when we finish the 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.080
 braid we want it to look like it's 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.000
 started from above and that does not 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.780
 is the cut of the rubber band we can 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.310
 use a gumdrop like these 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.710
 what are we going to put on the end of these 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.600
 of plastic we can use it for the 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.610
 pigtail and when we finish braiding 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.710
 we can cut it with scissors and 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.000
 undo the braid with my fingers to me 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.620
 like it better because I have good hair 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.510
 a little more more controlled that I have 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.430
 a lot and very long as I told you 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.990
 first thing we're going to do is brush and 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:49.330
 Apply the serum to make it easier 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:55.300
 work the braid we apply some 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:57.950
 droplets on the palm of the hands does not 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:03.110
 It takes a lot of amount 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:08.780
 we understand and apply it in everything 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:10.729
 long pigtail but also this gold 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.200
 lounge liquid hits smells great already 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.440
 that you'd better hair if you use JCE 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.050
 of wonder and we went to the realized as 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.239
 I was telling you, it's much simpler than 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.370
 5- strand braid so good that we 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.019
 It's scary to try, let's take the 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:34.670
 pigtail and we are going to divide it in two 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:36.110
 equal halves each of these 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.579
 halves in turn we're going to go back to 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.049
 divide in half to have the 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.470
 four ends exactly the same 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.470
 size 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:59.460
 [Music] 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.950
 we would have two ends in one hand and two 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.620
 the other ends, how easy is it? 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.810
 let's start braiding from within 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.459
 outward is to say and two by two 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.690
 It is very important that you have in the 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.080
 head that is two in two because 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.650
 see, we take these two ends and the 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.390
 we cross you see out we are here 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.970
 we cross we make sure there so that 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.040
 the crossing is well up but 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.180
 just that and now with both 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.250
 ends that we have in the other hand 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.790
 we do the same thing we cross out 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:37.069
 the one that is in here above 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.530
 you see we have simply done so we have 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.269
 done as a twist and now of the two 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.370
 ends that remain in the center the 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:46.990
 we are going to cross again but in a sense 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:51.280
 otherwise it is saying that this is here 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.810
 above and the other below and already 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.370
 we are again at the starting point 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.710
 with two ends in the left hand and two 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.360
 ends in the right hand I will repeat 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.250
 It's worth again step by step so you can see 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.190
 it's very easy, it seems a bit 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.140
 messy but it is not these two ends 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.560
 we crossed out like a twist 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.670
 we go around there but you know that 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.970
 is doing that without a mirror that 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.430
 has measure 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.670
 and this is from here also towards 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.670
 outside 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.220
 and now the two ends that we have left in 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:22.729
 we cross them in the center 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.729
 contrary 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.100
 and it's here 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:33.160
 you see how it is that we repeat another 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:36.569
 again these two ends out 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:43.499
 and we assure so that it does not demarcate 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:44.539
 these two outward too and now 

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:51.749
 the two that we have left in the center 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:54.719
 inward once more so that 

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:57.770
 you are taking the trick these two 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:57.770
 over there 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:06.150
 and we hold these two out 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:12.870
 we also hold yarns from the center 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:14.159
 inward we keep praying of this 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:25.229
 way until you reach the end of 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:27.090
 hair as we come in the 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:30.390
 end of the hair becomes a little 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:33.080
 more complicated thing but we remember 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.080
 outward 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.640
 outward 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:49.470
 outward and now the two center 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:50.730
 inwards, you see that nothing 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.169
 see with the difficulty of the braid of 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:06:00.169
 five ends that were much more 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:06:02.070
 convoluted when we get to the end 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:07.320
 we secure the hair with one of the 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:09.960
 gummies we have prepared we brush the 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.720
 extreme if we have been entangled 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.310
 and now if we want we can open the 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:22.050
 Braid with your fingers so there is a 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:23.639
 little bit thicker as I told you if 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.020
 we would have put one of these gummies 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:27.479
 also in the part of the tail now 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.180
 we could cut it and open up even more the 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:32.960
 braid so that we will not stay 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:35.300
 Lateral pick up even more undone 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.370
 and what you see here is the result 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.740
 Well you can see that it's a 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.810
 braid that apparently seems equal 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.419
 convoluted than that of 5 ends but that is 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.220
 much easier to make up here the 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:47.960
