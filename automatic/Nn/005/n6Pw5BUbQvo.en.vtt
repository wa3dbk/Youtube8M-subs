 here is florian friedrich von florians 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.939
 Bass lessons in this video are fine 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.830
 a special weaving technique namely the 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.019
 so-called double funding that is 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.210
 English and double means double and 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.640
 the thumb thumbs so literally 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.500
 translated twice the sounds 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.939
 spectacular in the true sense of the word 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.530
 because this technique sounds too 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.239
 but it is really special 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.370
 actually quite simple if you have the 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.290
 sides with your daumens lapsed eighth 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.600
 that you make your hand a little 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.460
 a little further back take it 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.010
 you with your thumb better under the 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.460
 On the other hand, you usually drag over 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.329
 the last bunch but you double dumping 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.160
 a little further back 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.469
 when hauling, the movement goes along 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.699
 the side down to the next / 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.739
 you have to go back to the now 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.410
 starting position and again the side 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.480
 slap you can but this way back too 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.170
 for use around the page on again 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.820
 to beat 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.590
 You can actually do that with the whole 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.020
 compare plectrum game there is 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.710
 also a downstream down 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.570
 and an abstract up and at 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.799
 double some bing you use a place 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:22.299
 Just pick it up and down 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.299
 that gives that pretty typical sound 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.380
 because you of course at the top of the 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.570
 no meat and no skin hate 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.119
 and the side in principle bopst sounds 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.969
 the imprint is different than the downstream 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.299
 and there's faster running 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:42.470
 maybe that special sound is 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.030
 It's good if you just take the 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.039
 plectrum videos on florian fun 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.509
 teaching punkt.de is watching this 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.030
 to play over several pages becomes 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.039
 example much clearer and listened too 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.780
 markus miller or victor boot 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.759
 Thieves use this technology more often 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.140
 their game around the double families too 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.209
 As always, you should practice first 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.189
 in a slow tempo starting important 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:03.200
 is that your hand and that your finger 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.509
 memorize the new moves 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.079
 that means distances and resistances 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.840
 to get to know 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.549
 So how does the side feel when you are 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.380
 she with his thumb from below to 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:15.790
 play on top how strong is that 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.930
 resistance what is the right angle 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.670
 usually slow to this new technology 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.709
 the more you play the better 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.079
 it will catch my tip first 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.829
 one side to change, so to speak 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.829
 with the thumb 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.980
 and then everything is playing scales 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:07.260
 finger exercises basslines really everything 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:09.389
 mix with double here applies completely 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.799
 just make kilometers and correct 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.090
 It will not be cool until you get it here 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.980
 and there as an effect in your game 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.840
 that is, after one can bring 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.180
 Now you are starting a normal game 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.620
 or the normal live with the double 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.209
 to decorate stamping 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.379
 here and there a link with this one 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.379
 Technique sounds very cool 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:37.109
 that time have him in your fast 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.699
 I 'll have thumbs for you again 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.620
 a few special exercises in notes and 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:42.870
 tabula tour written down and the cool 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.459
 mp3 is playing rex as always for
