stockier looking than the base body we

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.430 
stockier looking than the base body we

satin<00:05:47.889> we<00:05:48.219> integrated<00:05:48.789> a<00:05:49.029> lot<00:05:49.240> of<00:05:49.389> the<00:05:49.629> feature

00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:49.839 
satin we integrated a lot of the feature

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:52.939 
satin we integrated a lot of the feature
work<00:05:50.080> that<00:05:50.379> our<00:05:50.729> other<00:05:51.729> game<00:05:51.969> world<00:05:52.180> cup<00:05:52.539> stood

00:05:55.769 --> 00:05:55.779 
so that we get much more detailed and

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:59.429 
so that we get much more detailed and
variety<00:05:56.819> so<00:05:57.819> that<00:05:58.389> was<00:05:58.539> what<00:05:59.020> I<00:05:59.050> wanted<00:05:59.199> to

00:05:59.429 --> 00:05:59.439 
variety so that was what I wanted to
