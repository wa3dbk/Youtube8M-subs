 I can show you that now 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.660
 you need water and water for the cocoa 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.070

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.809
 Back cocoa sugar and a pinch of salt 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.020
 the total quantities I link 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.550
 as always below in the description 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.559
 Here you start with that 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.539
 water heated in a pot and as soon as 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.180
 This begins to steam gives you there 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.800
 a part of the cocoa stirs that up 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.949
 all together and then gives the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.170
 other half to it and the cocoa always 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.960
 first add in warm water so that it 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.420
 lumps are then gets even 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.250
 a pinch of salt with it the kk am 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.899
 not quite as bitter tastes and 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.050
 her accordingly, not quite so 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.330
 need to add much sugar 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.190
 is your chocolate then lump 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.070
 here releases a part of the sugar 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.140
 in the beginning all the short and can 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.990
 then add the remaining sugar 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.630
 I do not recommend you so much on 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.700
 start already to give it to you on 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.770
 can taste again and so on 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.690
 it will not be too sweet for you then 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.850
 is already the milk and then 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.710
 Let it all boil well with it 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.810
 They are called really nice in the end 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.900
 I have cocoa in the winter, too, nice 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.060
 can warm up at the end you can again 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.220
 to taste the cocoa sweet enough 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.710
 is and if you have something else 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.480
 Add milk but want more 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.880
 Milk, of course , the cocoa hard 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.500
 heavier and so you can calm down 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.080
 two cups approve 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.430
