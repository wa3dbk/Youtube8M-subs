00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.330 

so<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.420> final<00:00:06.629> term<00:00:06.839> project<00:00:07.379> was<00:00:07.560> to<00:00:07.919> design

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
so the final term project was to design

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.400 
so the final term project was to design
a<00:00:08.490> robot<00:00:08.880> which<00:00:09.269> had<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.690> be<00:00:09.780> no<00:00:09.929> bigger<00:00:10.139> than<00:00:10.260> a

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
a robot which had to be no bigger than a

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.490 
a robot which had to be no bigger than a

four by four by four inch volume to

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.560 
four by four by four inch volume to
navigate<00:00:14.009> this<00:00:14.460> maze<00:00:14.700> which<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.150> behind<00:00:15.360> me

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
navigate this maze which is behind me

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.689 
navigate this maze which is behind me
they<00:00:16.320> have<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.590> have<00:00:16.710> an<00:00:16.830> output<00:00:17.100> display<00:00:17.460> on

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
they have to have an output display on

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.210 
they have to have an output display on
the<00:00:18.240> robot<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.840> indicate<00:00:19.590> what's<00:00:19.800> going<00:00:20.070> on

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
the robot and indicate what's going on

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.740 
the robot and indicate what's going on
they<00:00:20.670> need<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.939> have<00:00:21.090> some<00:00:21.300> kind<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.480> manual

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
they need to have some kind of manual

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.509 
they need to have some kind of manual
data<00:00:22.080> input<00:00:22.500> needs<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.859> be<00:00:22.949> some<00:00:23.160> automatic

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
data input needs to be some automatic

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.429 
data input needs to be some automatic
sensor<00:00:23.939> input<00:00:24.269> on<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.480> robot<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:25.289> we<00:00:25.320> can

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
sensor input on the robot so we can

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.750 
sensor input on the robot so we can
automatically<00:00:25.830> figure<00:00:26.070> out<00:00:26.160> what's<00:00:26.340> going<00:00:26.640> on

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
automatically figure out what's going on

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.580 
automatically figure out what's going on
it<00:00:27.480> needs<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.720> be<00:00:27.810> some<00:00:28.019> actuators<00:00:28.560> and

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
it needs to be some actuators and

some of the basic major challenges that
it<00:00:53.050> will<00:00:53.140> become<00:00:53.440> this<00:00:53.589> pretty<00:00:54.250> much<00:00:54.460> is

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:54.609 
it will become this pretty much is

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:56.670 
it will become this pretty much is
program<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.149> entire<00:00:55.239> thing<00:00:55.690> and<00:00:55.899> having<00:00:56.469> all

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
program the entire thing and having all

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.139 
program the entire thing and having all
the<00:00:56.769> centuries<00:00:57.010> communicating<00:00:57.850> to<00:00:58.120> a

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
the centuries communicating to a

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.930 
the centuries communicating to a

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
microprocessor which always information

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.459 
microprocessor which always information
to<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.120> drive<00:01:01.390> motors<00:01:01.690> and<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:01.899> wheels<00:01:02.079> so<00:01:02.409> it

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
to the drive motors and the wheels so it

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.619 
to the drive motors and the wheels so it
could<00:01:02.589> navigate<00:01:02.710> through<00:01:03.039> the<00:01:03.129> course<00:01:03.629> each

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
could navigate through the course each

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.330 
could navigate through the course each
sensor<00:01:05.080> is<00:01:05.199> different<00:01:05.649> like<00:01:05.830> some<00:01:06.009> sensors

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
sensor is different like some sensors

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.029 
sensor is different like some sensors
readout<00:01:06.610> with<00:01:06.759> each<00:01:06.970> other<00:01:07.149> it's<00:01:07.390> like<00:01:07.479> very

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:08.039 
readout with each other it's like very

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:10.620 
readout with each other it's like very
resistances<00:01:09.039> so<00:01:09.399> you<00:01:09.520> know<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:09.820> properties

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
resistances so you know the properties

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:11.670 
resistances so you know the properties
of<00:01:10.750> each<00:01:10.899> sensor<00:01:11.259> and<00:01:11.409> how<00:01:11.500> is<00:01:11.560> it

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
of each sensor and how is it

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.410 
of each sensor and how is it
microcontroller<00:01:12.340> treat<00:01:12.580> that<00:01:12.729> right<00:01:13.210> now<00:01:13.360> the

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
microcontroller treat that right now the

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.930 
microcontroller treat that right now the
primarily<00:01:14.140> using<00:01:14.500> like<00:01:14.770> proximity<00:01:15.610> sensors

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
primarily using like proximity sensors

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.910 
primarily using like proximity sensors
which<00:01:16.450> propels<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:16.960> robot<00:01:17.289> like<00:01:17.409> how<00:01:17.560> far<00:01:17.830> it

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
which propels the robot like how far it

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.649 
which propels the robot like how far it
is<00:01:18.009> from<00:01:18.039> my<00:01:18.280> wallet<00:01:18.520> optical<00:01:19.240> so<00:01:19.450> we<00:01:19.539> know

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
is from my wallet optical so we know

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.570 
is from my wallet optical so we know
like<00:01:19.869> when<00:01:20.049> to<00:01:20.170> stop<00:01:20.440> they<00:01:21.069> are<00:01:21.130> also<00:01:21.220> using

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
like when to stop they are also using

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.550 
like when to stop they are also using
something<00:01:21.819> holders<00:01:22.240> for<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.750> wheels<00:01:22.960> in

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
something holders for the wheels in

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.080 
something holders for the wheels in
silico<00:01:23.950> leaders<00:01:24.190> to<00:01:24.310> council<00:01:24.610> every<00:01:24.759> time<00:01:24.940> the

silico leaders to council every time the

silico leaders to council every time the
wheel<00:01:25.240> that's<00:01:25.479> rotates<00:01:26.289> so<00:01:26.470> they<00:01:26.560> held<00:01:26.770> every

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
wheel that's rotates so they held every

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.499 
wheel that's rotates so they held every

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
time the realities that could figure out

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:38.010 
time the realities that could figure out
this<00:01:28.690> since<00:01:28.929> that<00:01:29.110> way<00:01:35.429> does<00:01:36.429> it<00:01:36.539> sense<00:01:37.539> and

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
this since that way does it sense and

to get back to the sensor using that

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.410 
to get back to the sensor using that
