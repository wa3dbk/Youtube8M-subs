right this is page 26 and the old
sailing<00:00:06.540> ship<00:00:07.790> from<00:00:09.200> piano<00:00:10.200> time<00:00:10.469> 3<00:00:10.710> so<00:00:10.860> we

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
sailing ship from piano time 3 so we

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.390 
sailing ship from piano time 3 so we
didn't<00:00:11.070> do

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
didn't do

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.610

page 26 triplets study and the twins and

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.829 
page 26 triplets study and the twins and
triplets<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.820> old<00:00:14.969> sailing<00:00:15.269> ship<00:00:15.450> at<00:00:15.780> the

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
triplets and the old sailing ship at the

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.950 
triplets and the old sailing ship at the
same<00:00:16.020> time<00:00:16.289> on<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.560> second<00:00:16.920> page<00:00:20.750> right<00:00:21.750> so

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
same time on the second page right so

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.490 
same time on the second page right so
triplets

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
triplets

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.500 
triplets
normally<00:00:23.340> in<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.460> crotchet<00:00:23.850> or<00:00:24.090> nor<00:00:24.330> mean

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
normally in the crotchet or nor mean

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.060 
normally in the crotchet or nor mean
anything<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.320> everything<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.830> divisible

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
anything it is everything is divisible

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.160 
anything it is everything is divisible
by<00:00:26.279> 2<00:00:26.460> all<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> time<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.390> crotchet<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.960> two

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
by 2 all the time so crotchet is two

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.220 
by 2 all the time so crotchet is two
quavers<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.949> minimum<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.640> crop<00:00:29.880> ships

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
quavers and minimum is to crop ships

quavers and minimum is to crop ships
assembly<00:00:31.230> breeders<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.769> minam's<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.219> quaver<00:00:32.460> is

assembly breeders to minam's a quaver is

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.020 
assembly breeders to minam's a quaver is
to<00:00:33.680> semiquavers<00:00:34.680> but<00:00:35.640> when<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.880> have

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
to semiquavers but when you have

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.100 
to semiquavers but when you have
triplets<00:00:36.300> what<00:00:36.600> you're<00:00:36.690> doing<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:36.960> you're

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
triplets what you're doing is you're

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.229 
triplets what you're doing is you're
squeezing<00:00:37.680> three<00:00:37.950> notes<00:00:38.190> into<00:00:38.730> where<00:00:38.940> two

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
squeezing three notes into where two

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.959 
squeezing three notes into where two
should<00:00:40.200> actually<00:00:40.530> belong<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.760> easiest

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
should actually belong and the easiest

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.580 
should actually belong and the easiest
way<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.180> explain<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:43.020> actually<00:00:43.170> been

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
way to explain this it's actually been

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.959 
way to explain this it's actually been
using<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.890> metronome<00:00:44.280> because<00:00:44.640> then<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.850> can

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
using the metronome because then you can

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.100 
using the metronome because then you can
hear<00:00:45.149> clearly<00:00:45.539> where<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.989> beats<00:00:47.329> right<00:00:48.329> so

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
hear clearly where the beats right so

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.610 
hear clearly where the beats right so
that's<00:00:49.350> just<00:00:49.620> every<00:00:50.610> beat<00:00:50.789> one<00:00:51.210> two<00:00:51.899> three

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
that's just every beat one two three

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.569 
that's just every beat one two three
four<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.789> twins<00:00:54.320> which<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.440> on<00:00:55.559> page<00:00:55.680> 26<00:00:56.219> one

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
four so twins which is on page 26 one

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:10.780 
four so twins which is on page 26 one
and<00:00:56.789> two<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.420> three<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.989> four<00:01:08.960> now<00:01:09.960> triplets

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
and two and three and four now triplets

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.219 
and two and three and four now triplets
and<00:01:11.790> we're<00:01:11.880> gonna<00:01:11.970> squeeze<00:01:12.330> three<00:01:12.780> into<00:01:13.080> that

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
and we're gonna squeeze three into that

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.539 
and we're gonna squeeze three into that
so<00:01:13.409> there's<00:01:13.560> gonna<00:01:13.650> be<00:01:13.770> three<00:01:13.950> notes<00:01:14.280> for

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
so there's gonna be three notes for

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.999 
so there's gonna be three notes for
every<00:01:14.790> project<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.479> instead<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.500> one<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.890> I'm

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
every project and instead of one and I'm

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.280 
every project and instead of one and I'm
gonna<00:01:17.100> say<00:01:17.250> one<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.729> A<00:01:17.970> two<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.330> A<00:01:18.869> three<00:01:19.020> and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
gonna say one and A two and A three and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:30.499 
gonna say one and A two and A three and
a<00:01:19.740> four<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:28.159> I'm<00:01:29.159> gonna<00:01:29.310> play<00:01:29.549> twins<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.299> then

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
a four and I'm gonna play twins and then

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.300 
a four and I'm gonna play twins and then
straight<00:01:30.960> into<00:01:31.200> triplets<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.130> can

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
straight into triplets so that you can

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:47.480 
straight into triplets so that you can
hear

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.280 

okaythat's<00:01:48.550> twins<00:01:48.760> or<00:01:48.940> triplets<00:01:49.290> triplets

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
okaythat's twins or triplets triplets

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.680 
okaythat's twins or triplets triplets
study<00:01:50.770> this<00:01:50.950> is<00:01:51.100> a<00:01:51.130> little<00:01:51.490> study<00:01:52.030> by<00:01:52.270> journey

study this is a little study by journey
it's<00:01:53.350> not<00:01:53.440> totally<00:01:53.890> interesting<00:01:54.280> to<00:01:54.370> be

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
it's not totally interesting to be

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.160 
it's not totally interesting to be
honest<00:01:54.640> it's<00:01:54.820> worth<00:01:55.030> going<00:01:55.300> through<00:01:55.479> just<00:01:56.020> so

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
honest it's worth going through just so

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:30.620 
honest it's worth going through just so
that<00:01:56.380> you're<00:01:56.620> aware<00:01:56.650> of<00:01:57.640> what's<00:01:57.820> going<00:01:58.120> on
