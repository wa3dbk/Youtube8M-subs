between<00:05:59.759> them<00:06:00.150> then<00:06:00.840> my<00:06:01.289> recommendation<00:06:01.469> of

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
between them then my recommendation of

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.920 
between them then my recommendation of
buy<00:06:02.430> whatever<00:06:02.669> will<00:06:03.090> make<00:06:03.120> your<00:06:03.509> friends
