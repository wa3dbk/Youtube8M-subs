00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
possible so that just gives us a bit

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.170 
possible so that just gives us a bit
more<00:01:08.079> time<00:01:08.380> to<00:01:08.439> work<00:01:08.740> with<00:01:08.770> it<00:01:09.040> all<00:01:09.909> right<00:01:09.970> so

bit of a crust and once it starts to
form<00:01:21.939> a<00:01:22.000> crust<00:01:22.240> it's<00:01:22.509> kind<00:01:22.780> of<00:01:22.840> hard<00:01:23.079> to<00:01:23.259> get

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
form a crust it's kind of hard to get

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
our nice little draw in there and then

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.250 
our nice little draw in there and then
the<00:02:51.579> next<00:02:51.790> puff<00:02:52.000> kind<00:02:52.269> of<00:02:52.390> doesn't<00:02:52.810> cover<00:02:53.049> the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
the next puff kind of doesn't cover the

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.869 
the next puff kind of doesn't cover the
join<00:02:53.500> but<00:02:53.739> meets<00:02:53.950> up<00:02:54.159> with<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:54.609> where

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
join but meets up with it and where

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.250 
join but meets up with it and where
you've<00:02:55.000> put<00:02:55.030> your<00:02:55.269> overhang<00:02:55.780> on<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.049> sides

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
you've put your overhang on the sides

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.990 
you've put your overhang on the sides
you<00:02:56.500> can<00:02:56.590> just<00:02:56.769> take<00:02:56.920> your<00:02:57.069> knife<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.609> just

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
you can just take your knife and just

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.819 
you can just take your knife and just
cut<00:02:58.209> away<00:02:58.359> you<00:02:58.989> do<00:02:59.139> want<00:02:59.349> to<00:02:59.379> make<00:02:59.530> sure<00:02:59.739> that

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
cut away you do want to make sure that

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.140 
cut away you do want to make sure that
you<00:02:59.920> can't<00:03:00.129> see<00:03:00.280> any<00:03:00.489> of<00:03:00.609> that<00:03:00.730> white

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
you can't see any of that white

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.210 
you can't see any of that white
buttercream<00:03:01.450> frosting<00:03:01.840> poking<00:03:02.470> through<00:03:02.650> but

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
buttercream frosting poking through but

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.890 
buttercream frosting poking through but
don't<00:03:03.430> worry<00:03:03.639> at<00:03:03.819> this<00:03:04.000> point<00:03:04.329> if<00:03:04.480> your<00:03:04.629> little

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
don't worry at this point if your little

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.509 
don't worry at this point if your little
joints<00:03:05.290> are<00:03:05.379> not<00:03:05.590> particularly<00:03:06.040> neat<00:03:06.250> because

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
joints are not particularly neat because

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.770 
joints are not particularly neat because
that's<00:03:06.670> where<00:03:06.819> little<00:03:07.060> ball<00:03:07.239> sprinkles<00:03:07.690> are

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
that's where little ball sprinkles are

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.729 
that's where little ball sprinkles are
going<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:07.959> come<00:03:08.109> in<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:08.349> we're<00:03:08.470> going<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.620> be

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
going to come in and we're going to be

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:09.899 
going to come in and we're going to be
able<00:03:08.799> to<00:03:08.920> fix<00:03:09.129> those<00:03:09.280> up<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.609> kind<00:03:09.790> of

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909 
able to fix those up and kind of

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:11.399 
able to fix those up and kind of
disguise<00:03:10.239> them<00:03:10.540> a<00:03:10.599> bit<00:03:10.750> alright<00:03:11.049> so<00:03:11.230> coming

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
disguise them a bit alright so coming

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.379 
disguise them a bit alright so coming
into<00:03:11.650> our<00:03:11.829> last<00:03:12.099> one<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:12.579> this<00:03:13.120> has<00:03:13.269> only

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
into our last one and this has only

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:14.910 
into our last one and this has only
taken<00:03:13.840> me<00:03:13.870> probably<00:03:13.989> about<00:03:14.349> four<00:03:14.650> or<00:03:14.680> five

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
taken me probably about four or five

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.770 
taken me probably about four or five
minutes<00:03:15.310> so<00:03:15.430> it's<00:03:15.579> not<00:03:15.639> that<00:03:16.030> hugely

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
minutes so it's not that hugely

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.199 
minutes so it's not that hugely
time-consuming<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:18.010> just<00:03:18.519> use<00:03:18.730> that<00:03:18.879> just<00:03:19.090> to

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
time-consuming and just use that just to

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.789 
time-consuming and just use that just to
kind<00:03:19.420> of<00:03:19.510> cover<00:03:19.840> in<00:03:20.049> that<00:03:20.200> last<00:03:20.500> little

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
kind of cover in that last little

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:21.900 
kind of cover in that last little
section<00:03:21.040> but<00:03:21.370> make<00:03:21.489> sure<00:03:21.609> you<00:03:21.699> come<00:03:21.849> around

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
section but make sure you come around

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.069 
section but make sure you come around
the<00:03:22.090> edges<00:03:22.299> to<00:03:22.419> make<00:03:22.480> sure<00:03:22.629> you're<00:03:22.750> really

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
the edges to make sure you're really

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.659 
the edges to make sure you're really
covering<00:03:23.500> in<00:03:23.620> all<00:03:23.799> of<00:03:23.949> that<00:03:24.069> frosting<00:03:24.549> and

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
covering in all of that frosting and

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:26.580 
covering in all of that frosting and
there<00:03:25.060> you've<00:03:25.180> got<00:03:25.209> your<00:03:25.480> basic<00:03:26.019> below

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
there you've got your basic below

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.920 
there you've got your basic below
technique<00:03:27.099> now<00:03:27.609> these<00:03:27.910> always<00:03:28.299> look<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.780> little

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
technique now these always look a little

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.629 
technique now these always look a little
bit<00:03:29.109> messy<00:03:29.410> until<00:03:29.709> you<00:03:29.799> go<00:03:29.980> in<00:03:30.129> and<00:03:30.280> add<00:03:30.400> your

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
bit messy until you go in and add your

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.009 
bit messy until you go in and add your
little<00:03:30.819> detail<00:03:31.329> so<00:03:31.569> this<00:03:31.690> is<00:03:31.810> where<00:03:31.930> the

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
little detail so this is where the

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.360 
going to kind of make an indentation
into<00:03:55.060> your<00:03:55.269> fondant<00:03:55.810> which<00:03:56.260> also<00:03:56.680> helps<00:03:57.190> your

little puff sections look like they're

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.899 
little puff sections look like they're
puffing<00:03:59.260> out<00:03:59.410> just<00:03:59.739> a<00:03:59.889> little<00:03:59.919> bit<00:04:00.159> more<00:04:00.370> but

more<00:04:01.150> than<00:04:01.329> that<00:04:01.389> they're<00:04:01.720> actually<00:04:01.870> covering

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
more than that they're actually covering

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.259 
more than that they're actually covering
up<00:04:02.560> any<00:04:02.799> of<00:04:02.919> those<00:04:03.069> little<00:04:03.280> joins<00:04:03.609> and<00:04:03.819> creases

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
and making them all look like they're

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.039 
and making them all look like they're
part<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.280> one<00:04:06.459> big<00:04:06.489> piece<00:04:07.000> of<00:04:07.060> fabric<00:04:07.359> this<00:04:07.989> is
