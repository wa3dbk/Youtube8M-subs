00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.289 
those sounds out of it and also included
in<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:55.959> software<00:03:56.139> is<00:03:56.650> um<00:03:56.910> some<00:03:57.910> pretty<00:03:58.090> cool

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
in the software is um some pretty cool

00:03:58.299 --> 00:03:59.909 
in the software is um some pretty cool
APM<00:03:58.870> lighting<00:03:59.230> like<00:03:59.349> we<00:03:59.500> mentioned<00:03:59.680> that's

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919 
APM lighting like we mentioned that's

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.759 
APM lighting like we mentioned that's
actions<00:04:00.370> per<00:04:00.579> minute<00:04:00.879> so<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.959> lights<00:04:02.620> up

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
actions per minute so the lights up

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.289 
actions per minute so the lights up
right<00:04:02.980> when<00:04:03.129> you<00:04:03.220> plug<00:04:03.430> it<00:04:03.579> in<00:04:03.669> with<00:04:03.819> a<00:04:03.849> default

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
right when you plug it in with a default

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.720 
right when you plug it in with a default
kind<00:04:04.629> of<00:04:04.720> blue<00:04:04.959> LED<00:04:05.440> lighting<00:04:05.829> but<00:04:06.040> as<00:04:06.579> you

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
kind of blue LED lighting but as you

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.729 
kind of blue LED lighting but as you
play<00:04:07.329> you<00:04:07.389> can<00:04:07.660> set<00:04:07.930> different<00:04:08.260> settings<00:04:08.560> in

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
play you can set different settings in

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.439 
play you can set different settings in
so<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.190> lights<00:04:09.459> actually<00:04:09.700> change<00:04:10.060> colors

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:10.449 
so the lights actually change colors

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.390 
so the lights actually change colors
depending<00:04:11.319> on<00:04:11.440> your<00:04:11.620> gameplay<00:04:12.010> which<00:04:12.250> is

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
depending on your gameplay which is

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.589 
depending on your gameplay which is
gonna<00:04:12.639> be<00:04:12.819> awesome<00:04:12.970> when<00:04:13.209> you're<00:04:13.329> playing<00:04:13.480> in

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
gonna be awesome when you're playing in

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:18.180 
gonna be awesome when you're playing in

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
reflected in the lighting which is

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.350 
reflected in the lighting which is
really<00:04:21.970> cool<00:04:22.740> other<00:04:23.740> than<00:04:23.979> that<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.969> sound

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
really cool other than that the sound

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.300 
really cool other than that the sound
quality<00:04:25.419> is<00:04:25.930> pretty<00:04:26.140> exceptional<00:04:26.830> in<00:04:27.010> the

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
quality is pretty exceptional in the

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.270 
quality is pretty exceptional in the
in<00:04:27.520> these<00:04:28.300> drivers<00:04:28.750> and<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.650> headphone<00:04:29.980> and

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
in these drivers and the headphone and

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.820 
in these drivers and the headphone and
microphone<00:04:30.760> itself<00:04:31.420> we<00:04:31.930> blasted<00:04:32.470> it<00:04:32.560> all<00:04:32.710> the

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
microphone itself we blasted it all the

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.140 
microphone itself we blasted it all the
way<00:04:32.920> to<00:04:32.980> the<00:04:33.160> top<00:04:33.370> of<00:04:33.520> its<00:04:33.670> volume<00:04:33.850> capacity

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
way to the top of its volume capacity

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.330 
way to the top of its volume capacity
and<00:04:34.630> we<00:04:34.720> also<00:04:34.870> played<00:04:35.710> it<00:04:35.860> from<00:04:36.010> the<00:04:36.130> very

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
and we also played it from the very

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.879 
and we also played it from the very
bottom<00:04:37.060> to<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.330> so<00:04:38.050> we<00:04:38.290> tested<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.650> full

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
bottom to the so we tested the full

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.070 
bottom to the so we tested the full
range<00:04:39.130> and<00:04:39.720> basically<00:04:40.720> there<00:04:40.870> was<00:04:40.930> no

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
range and basically there was no

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.340 
range and basically there was no
distortion<00:04:41.620> that<00:04:42.220> we<00:04:42.310> could<00:04:42.460> hear<00:04:42.669> of<00:04:42.820> and

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
distortion that we could hear of and

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.520 
distortion that we could hear of and
yeah<00:04:44.350> the<00:04:44.650> microphone<00:04:45.340> itself<00:04:45.639> is<00:04:45.880> a<00:04:45.910> nice

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
yeah the microphone itself is a nice

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.810 
yeah the microphone itself is a nice
material<00:04:47.530> like<00:04:47.680> we<00:04:47.800> said<00:04:48.010> it's<00:04:48.250> got<00:04:48.430> some

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
material like we said it's got some

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.730 
material like we said it's got some
different<00:04:49.419> flexibilities<00:04:49.570> in<00:04:50.080> here<00:04:50.470> and<00:04:50.650> you

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
different flexibilities in here and you

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.670 
different flexibilities in here and you
could<00:04:50.860> let<00:04:51.730> it<00:04:51.790> conform<00:04:52.150> to<00:04:52.330> whatever

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
could let it conform to whatever

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.470 
could let it conform to whatever
distance<00:04:53.680> you<00:04:53.800> want<00:04:53.919> from<00:04:54.160> your<00:04:54.310> mouth<00:04:54.460> or<00:04:54.970> for

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
distance you want from your mouth or for

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.879 
distance you want from your mouth or for
whatever<00:04:55.780> volume<00:04:55.990> you<00:04:56.320> want<00:04:56.410> to<00:04:56.530> speak<00:04:56.710> add

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
whatever volume you want to speak add

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.280 
whatever volume you want to speak add
