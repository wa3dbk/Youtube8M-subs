our 360 degree cases if you look here

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.549 
our 360 degree cases if you look here
you<00:00:41.489> can<00:00:41.670> see<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.300> back<00:00:42.780> cover<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
you can see that the back cover of the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.680 
you can see that the back cover of the
device<00:00:44.010> down<00:00:44.340> here<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.730> actually<00:00:44.910> made<00:00:45.270> up<00:00:45.480> of

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
device down here is actually made up of

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.369 
device down here is actually made up of
two<00:00:46.020> layers<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.950> have<00:00:47.160> an<00:00:47.370> inner<00:00:47.670> layer<00:00:48.289> if<00:00:49.289> I

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
two layers you have an inner layer if I

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.479 
two layers you have an inner layer if I
pull<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.620> down<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:50.010> see<00:00:50.039> little<00:00:50.280> butter

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
pull this down you can see little butter

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.700 
pull this down you can see little butter
you<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:50.730> an<00:00:50.820> inner<00:00:51.000> layer<00:00:51.300> here<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.530> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
you have an inner layer here that the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.549 
you have an inner layer here that the
device<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.160> actually<00:00:53.340> strapped<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.840> then

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
device is actually strapped to and then

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.220 
device is actually strapped to and then
you<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.010> outer<00:00:56.219> layer<00:00:56.969> down<00:00:57.719> here<00:00:58.020> which

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
you have the outer layer down here which

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.099 
you have the outer layer down here which
is<00:00:58.350> actually<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.800> back<00:00:58.980> cover<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.809> the<00:01:00.809> case

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
is actually the back cover of the case

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.340 
is actually the back cover of the case
in<00:01:02.180> between<00:01:03.180> these<00:01:03.780> two<00:01:04.580> k<00:01:05.580> layers<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.990> pivot

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
in between these two k layers is a pivot

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.840 
in between these two k layers is a pivot
point<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:07.740> hidden<00:01:07.979> by<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.400> little<00:01:08.640> flap

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
point it's hidden by this little flap

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.630 
point it's hidden by this little flap
right<00:01:09.119> here<00:01:09.680> but<00:01:10.680> there's<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.950> pivot<00:01:11.250> point<00:01:11.490> in

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
right here but there's a pivot point in

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.030 
right here but there's a pivot point in
there<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.970> allows<00:01:12.240> these<00:01:13.020> two<00:01:13.380> layers<00:01:13.650> to

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
there that allows these two layers to

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.060 
there that allows these two layers to
spin<00:01:14.790> around<00:01:14.939> one<00:01:15.390> another<00:01:15.530> which<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.710> can<00:01:16.890> show

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
spin around one another which I can show

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.640 
spin around one another which I can show
you<00:01:17.720> okay<00:01:18.720> what<00:01:18.960> I'm<00:01:19.049> going<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.200> do<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.380> hold

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
you okay what I'm going to do is hold

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.039 
you okay what I'm going to do is hold
the<00:01:19.799> back<00:01:20.009> cover<00:01:20.400> against<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.420> front<00:01:21.840> cover

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
the back cover against the front cover

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.510 
the back cover against the front cover
with<00:01:22.350> my<00:01:22.470> hand<00:01:22.710> like<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.130> then<00:01:23.490> just

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
with my hand like that and then just

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.789 
with my hand like that and then just
grab<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.570> part<00:01:24.780> with<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.930> device<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.650> and

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
grab the part with the device on it and

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.890 
grab the part with the device on it and
it<00:01:25.920> just<00:01:25.950> rotates<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.640> their<00:01:27.210> built-in<00:01:27.390> stops

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
it just rotates and their built-in stops

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.770 
it just rotates and their built-in stops
at<00:01:28.259> each<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.220> 90<00:01:29.520> degree<00:01:29.640> position<00:01:30.090> so

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
at each of the 90 degree position so

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.480 
at each of the 90 degree position so
there's<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.020> stop<00:01:31.259> there<00:01:31.530> there's<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.250> stop

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
there's a stop there there's a stop

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.069 
there's a stop there there's a stop
there<00:01:32.759> stop<00:01:33.060> there<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.310> a<00:01:35.310> stop<00:01:35.549> there<00:01:36.079> with
