00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
obviously the good thing about this is

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.060 
obviously the good thing about this is
with<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:24.960> miiverse<00:04:25.349> people<00:04:25.770> are<00:04:25.830> going<00:04:25.919> to<00:04:26.010> be

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
with the miiverse people are going to be

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.150 
with the miiverse people are going to be
taking<00:04:26.370> lots<00:04:26.490> of<00:04:26.640> screenshot

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
taking lots of screenshot

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.040 
taking lots of screenshot

and sharing them with each other so

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.330 
and sharing them with each other so
it'll<00:04:29.170> be<00:04:29.260> a<00:04:29.290> really<00:04:29.500> cool<00:04:29.710> way<00:04:29.890> to<00:04:29.920> kind<00:04:30.310> of

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
it'll be a really cool way to kind of

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.650 
it'll be a really cool way to kind of
show<00:04:30.520> people<00:04:30.670> what<00:04:30.880> you've<00:04:31.000> been<00:04:31.120> up<00:04:31.240> to<00:04:31.270> any

funny moments or anything like that and

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.060 
funny moments or anything like that and
then<00:04:34.660> finally<00:04:34.900> of<00:04:35.140> course<00:04:35.200> you<00:04:35.650> can<00:04:35.770> play<00:04:35.860> in

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.410 
TV off mode so if you want if someone
else<00:04:38.890> wants<00:04:39.130> to<00:04:39.220> use<00:04:39.370> the<00:04:39.520> TV<00:04:39.700> for<00:04:40.030> something

else wants to use the TV for something

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.420 
else wants to use the TV for something
you<00:04:40.690> can<00:04:40.810> just<00:04:40.960> play<00:04:41.170> the<00:04:41.530> whole<00:04:41.680> game<00:04:41.710> just<00:04:42.280> on

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
you can just play the whole game just on

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.010 
you can just play the whole game just on
your<00:04:42.580> gamepad<00:04:42.970> it<00:04:43.480> makes<00:04:43.660> it<00:04:43.780> a<00:04:43.810> little<00:04:43.870> bit

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
your gamepad it makes it a little bit

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.120 
your gamepad it makes it a little bit
more<00:04:44.140> difficult<00:04:44.530> because<00:04:44.620> you<00:04:44.800> have<00:04:44.830> to<00:04:44.920> press

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
more difficult because you have to press

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.680 
more difficult because you have to press
a<00:04:45.160> button<00:04:45.250> to<00:04:45.520> switch<00:04:45.850> to<00:04:46.030> the<00:04:46.120> map<00:04:46.270> instead<00:04:46.510> of

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
a button to switch to the map instead of

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.230 
a button to switch to the map instead of
just<00:04:46.840> looking<00:04:47.140> down<00:04:47.820> but<00:04:48.820> if<00:04:48.910> someone<00:04:49.150> else

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
just looking down but if someone else

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.000 
just looking down but if someone else
needs<00:04:49.420> the<00:04:49.660> TV<00:04:49.960> and<00:04:50.260> you<00:04:50.290> can<00:04:50.530> still<00:04:50.710> carry<00:04:50.830> on

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
needs the TV and you can still carry on

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.820 
needs the TV and you can still carry on
with<00:04:51.160> your<00:04:51.280> game<00:04:51.430> then<00:04:51.760> that's<00:04:52.210> a<00:04:52.300> bonus<00:04:52.830> but

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
with your game then that's a bonus but

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.500 
with your game then that's a bonus but
there's<00:04:53.980> also<00:04:54.130> extra<00:04:54.730> modes<00:04:54.970> to<00:04:55.270> kind<00:04:55.420> of

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
there's also extra modes to kind of

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.790 
there's also extra modes to kind of
boost<00:04:55.720> that<00:04:55.810> longevity<00:04:56.440> and<00:04:56.560> give<00:04:56.680> you<00:04:56.740> a

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
boost that longevity and give you a

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.140 
boost that longevity and give you a
reason<00:04:57.100> to<00:04:57.190> keep<00:04:57.280> coming<00:04:57.370> back<00:04:57.610> to<00:04:57.760> it<00:04:58.000> and

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
reason to keep coming back to it and

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.340 
reason to keep coming back to it and
this<00:04:58.240> is<00:04:58.300> what<00:04:58.480> my<00:04:58.600> family<00:04:58.960> liked<00:04:59.110> the<00:04:59.230> most

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
this is what my family liked the most

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.540 
this is what my family liked the most
because<00:04:59.710> it<00:04:59.800> gave<00:04:59.920> us<00:04:59.950> a<00:05:00.100> way<00:05:00.220> to<00:05:00.280> play

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
because it gave us a way to play

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.300 
because it gave us a way to play
together<00:05:00.610> and<00:05:01.240> it<00:05:02.110> seems<00:05:02.470> to<00:05:02.680> not<00:05:02.920> make<00:05:03.100> very

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
together and it seems to not make very

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.560 
together and it seems to not make very
much<00:05:03.430> sense<00:05:03.490> that<00:05:03.850> you<00:05:04.030> can't<00:05:04.270> play<00:05:04.450> the

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
much sense that you can't play the

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.120 
much sense that you can't play the
single-player<00:05:04.990> mode<00:05:05.290> and<00:05:05.440> co-op<00:05:05.710> given<00:05:06.010> that

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
single-player mode and co-op given that

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.100 
single-player mode and co-op given that
there<00:05:06.250> are<00:05:06.280> three<00:05:06.700> characters<00:05:07.210> but<00:05:07.930> maybe

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
there are three characters but maybe

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.510 
there are three characters but maybe
that<00:05:08.290> would<00:05:08.380> have<00:05:08.470> been<00:05:08.560> a<00:05:08.590> bit<00:05:08.770> too<00:05:08.920> easy

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
that would have been a bit too easy

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.270 
that would have been a bit too easy
in<00:05:10.270> the<00:05:10.360> multiplayer<00:05:10.780> game<00:05:11.050> you<00:05:11.200> can<00:05:11.740> so

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
in the multiplayer game you can so

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.010 
in the multiplayer game you can so
there's<00:05:12.460> co-op<00:05:12.790> modes<00:05:13.150> and<00:05:13.450> competitive

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
there's co-op modes and competitive

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.980 
there's co-op modes and competitive
modes<00:05:14.910> so<00:05:15.910> in<00:05:16.000> the<00:05:16.060> co-op<00:05:16.300> modes<00:05:16.540> you<00:05:16.720> go<00:05:16.840> and

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
modes so in the co-op modes you go and

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.270 
modes so in the co-op modes you go and
collect<00:05:17.080> treasure<00:05:17.440> together<00:05:17.680> and<00:05:18.070> you<00:05:18.130> work
