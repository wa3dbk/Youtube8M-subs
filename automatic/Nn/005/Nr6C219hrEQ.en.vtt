00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.450 

we'll<00:02:02.940> get<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.150> moving<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.480> little<00:02:03.630> bit<00:02:04.250> 1<00:02:05.250> mile

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
we'll get it moving a little bit 1 mile

we'll get it moving a little bit 1 mile
per<00:02:05.490> hour<00:02:05.670> increments

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:03:26.870 

I<00:03:19.790> can<00:03:20.790> get<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:21.000> going<00:03:21.030> up<00:03:25.640> keep<00:03:26.640> chugging

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
I can get it going up keep chugging

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:41.160 
I can get it going up keep chugging
faster<00:03:27.420> faster

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.349 

what's<00:03:42.170> nice<00:03:42.349> about<00:03:42.409> the<00:03:42.739> dcs<00:03:43.549> system<00:03:43.909> is<00:03:44.090> it

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
what's nice about the dcs system is it

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.800 
what's nice about the dcs system is it
give<00:03:44.599> a<00:03:44.719> train<00:03:45.079> for<00:03:45.950> power

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
give a train for power

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.270 
give a train for power
so<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:47.930> locomotive<00:03:48.379> speed<00:03:48.680> control<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.129> take

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
so the locomotive speed control to take

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.280 
so the locomotive speed control to take
over<00:03:49.489> I<00:03:49.849> can<00:03:50.450> get<00:03:50.569> this<00:03:50.780> thing<00:03:50.930> lit<00:03:51.049> earlier

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
over I can get this thing lit earlier

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.630 
over I can get this thing lit earlier
call<00:03:51.620> at<00:03:52.459> constant<00:03:53.090> speed<00:03:54.159> nice<00:03:55.159> and<00:03:55.430> slow

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
call at constant speed nice and slow

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:14.490 
call at constant speed nice and slow
nice<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:56.269> stay

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.569 

it<00:04:15.500> is<00:04:15.709> slower<00:04:15.980> now<00:04:17.709> and<00:04:18.709> I<00:04:18.889> also<00:04:19.040> have<00:04:19.340> access

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
it is slower now and I also have access

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:53.250 
it is slower now and I also have access
to<00:04:19.820> all<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:21.019> sounds

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:59.030 

so<00:04:54.260> they<00:04:54.410> bring<00:04:54.590> it<00:04:54.740> to<00:04:54.770> a<00:04:54.860> stop

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.500

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:47.139 
it up there and actually looks like

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.590

scenery going all the way around so it

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.050

right here I actually when I got this up
I<00:05:54.940> actually<00:05:55.090> didn't<00:05:55.360> even<00:05:55.389> need<00:05:55.660> this<00:05:56.169> chain

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
I actually didn't even need this chain

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.670

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
looking pretty good as it goes across

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.779 
looking pretty good as it goes across
the<00:06:05.350> gap<00:06:05.530> from<00:06:05.740> the<00:06:05.800> living<00:06:06.550> room<00:06:06.669> to<00:06:06.729> the
