00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
that will that will be a good

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.039 
that will that will be a good
performance<00:02:24.579> and<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:25.269> really<00:02:25.689> is<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:25.870> good

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
performance and it really is a good

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.410 
performance and it really is a good
performance<00:02:26.590> is<00:02:26.680> very<00:02:26.739> smooth<00:02:27.420> everything

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
performance is very smooth everything

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.629 
performance is very smooth everything
runs<00:02:28.989> very<00:02:29.230> fast<00:02:29.469> it's<00:02:29.739> got<00:02:29.889> the<00:02:30.069> really<00:02:30.370> cool

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:30.639 
runs very fast it's got the really cool

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:32.970 
runs very fast it's got the really cool
animations<00:02:31.239> when<00:02:31.389> you<00:02:31.480> open<00:02:31.840> when<00:02:32.680> you<00:02:32.769> open

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
animations when you open when you open

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.729 
animations when you open when you open
an<00:02:33.069> app<00:02:33.219> it'll<00:02:33.670> slide<00:02:34.060> in<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:34.870> out<00:02:35.109> and<00:02:35.349> it

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
an app it'll slide in and out and it

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.759 
an app it'll slide in and out and it
just<00:02:35.920> gives<00:02:36.340> it<00:02:36.459> a<00:02:36.579> lot<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:37.150> lot<00:02:38.109> smoother

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
just gives it a lot a lot smoother

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.949 
just gives it a lot a lot smoother
experience<00:02:39.159> now<00:02:40.030> in<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.359> settings<00:02:40.750> you<00:02:40.930> can

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
experience now in the settings you can

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.110 
experience now in the settings you can
also<00:02:41.319> change<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:43.049> what<00:02:44.049> you<00:02:44.079> call<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:44.439> the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
also change the what you call it the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.309 
also change the what you call it the
performance<00:02:46.120> itself<00:02:46.239> if<00:02:46.629> you<00:02:46.780> can<00:02:46.930> give<00:02:47.109> it<00:02:47.139> a

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
performance itself if you can give it a

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.589 
performance itself if you can give it a
much<00:02:47.500> more<00:02:47.739> snappier<00:02:48.220> feeling<00:02:48.879> or<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.450> can

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
much more snappier feeling or you can

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.780 
much more snappier feeling or you can
just<00:02:49.780> go<00:02:49.989> to<00:02:50.019> animations<00:02:50.799> like<00:02:51.189> the<00:02:51.370> animation

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
just go to animations like the animation

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.319 
just go to animations like the animation
speed<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.269> can<00:02:52.389> you<00:02:52.930> can<00:02:53.109> set<00:02:53.349> for<00:02:54.329> slow

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
speed you can you can set for slow

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.009 
speed you can you can set for slow
animation<00:02:55.810> are<00:02:56.019> for<00:02:56.349> more<00:02:56.620> performance<00:02:58.019> the

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
animation are for more performance the

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.479 
animation are for more performance the
slow<00:02:59.230> animation<00:02:59.680> obviously<00:03:00.129> is<00:03:00.219> going<00:03:00.430> to

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
slow animation obviously is going to

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.300 
slow animation obviously is going to
give<00:03:00.639> you<00:03:00.819> you<00:03:01.090> know<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.419> more<00:03:01.769> good<00:03:02.769> look<00:03:03.069> the

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
give you you know the more good look the

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.580 
give you you know the more good look the
more<00:03:03.489> it's<00:03:04.480> going<00:03:04.629> to<00:03:04.719> be<00:03:04.810> more<00:03:05.019> for<00:03:05.230> your<00:03:05.319> look

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
but your performance is going to be a

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.420 
but your performance is going to be a
lot<00:03:07.719> more<00:03:07.750> snappy<00:03:08.349> which<00:03:08.650> is<00:03:08.799> like<00:03:08.919> what<00:03:09.280> job

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
lot more snappy which is like what job

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.940 
lot more snappy which is like what job
which<00:03:09.760> is<00:03:09.909> what<00:03:10.120> I<00:03:10.150> like<00:03:10.419> sorry<00:03:10.719> so<00:03:11.409> like<00:03:11.859> I
