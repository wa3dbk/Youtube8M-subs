00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
has the same texture as iron block which

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.250 
has the same texture as iron block which
can<00:00:56.670> be<00:00:56.760> good<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.149> bad<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.539> some<00:00:58.079> different

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
can be good and bad in some different

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.029 
can be good and bad in some different
ways<00:00:58.670> but<00:00:59.750> first<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:01.109> all<00:01:01.230> I'll<00:01:01.530> show<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.859> how

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
ways but first of all I'll show you how

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.060 
ways but first of all I'll show you how
to<00:01:02.100> craft<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.940> take<00:01:03.180> seven<00:01:03.780> iron<00:01:04.500> ingots

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
to craft it you take seven iron ingots

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.370 
to craft it you take seven iron ingots
and<00:01:05.339> then<00:01:05.909> one<00:01:06.420> piece<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.840> redstone<00:01:07.020> which

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
and then one piece of redstone which

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.980 
and then one piece of redstone which
gives<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> shudder<00:01:08.310> case<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.659> take

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
gives you a shudder case so you take

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.109 
gives you a shudder case so you take
that<00:01:10.140> shutter<00:01:10.500> case<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.369> hook<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.850> up<00:01:12.000> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
that shutter case and you hook it up the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.450 
that shutter case and you hook it up the
redstone<00:01:12.510> i<00:01:12.750> did<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> little<00:01:13.439> red<00:01:14.100> stone<00:01:14.310> in

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
redstone i did a little red stone in
