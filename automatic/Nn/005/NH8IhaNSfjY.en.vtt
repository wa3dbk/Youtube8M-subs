00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:09.360
 So, I'm worried about trying. 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.650
 explain to you what I understand 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.969
 about what's happening now in the 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.650
 Brazil is the tense kingdom in a video 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.170
 but then I chose to record because I 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.380
 I think recording shows a little our 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.930
 beginning and experienced in the body in the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.109
 only reasoning in the word is less 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.830
 abstract is more human and human has 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.989
 pauses have no doubt have a face 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.489
 without human expression is more than just 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.160
 written word it is obvious that the video 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.989
 are also very formatted but I think 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.079
 it adds a bit more elements about 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.690
 The one who talks and says that I said it. 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.649
 I think the point is speech is that 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.050
 it's about 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:53.329
 At that moment in Brazil is where 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.329
 speech is what are the truths produced 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.719
 There is a tendency in Brazil for people to 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.730
 believe that some people know 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.460
 others do not know this the conviction that 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.500
 people share a lot of time and that's it 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.450
 that in my way of seeing can 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.000
 be broken a little now with these 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.030
 movements because a reality I 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.150
 I learned today in the march that there was 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.270
 doubt in that group of people gathered 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:26.780
 on the grass in front of the congress 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:29.960
 there was doubt this is wrong 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.909
 people were negotiating in doubt 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.909
 no one was the bearer of the truth about 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.049
 where would we go, what is the meaning of that 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:43.799
 or because we're doing that nobody 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.000
 You know exactly how much this goes for a lot. 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.180
 I think we as a drain 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.710
 protest manifesto political 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.060
 But I think we get to 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.659
 to commit the why of what people 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.799
 putting the human political dimension 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.439
 overlapping all other dimensions 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.240
 that crosses the human being and in the 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.150
 these manifestations I think there are 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.100
 other dimensions involved 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.180
 has a dimension of an affection 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.190
 shared identity of a very 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.630
 feelings of belonging that have been 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.520
 experienced in a very 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.880
 deep with me I think with a lot of 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:23.030
 people were there we were happy to 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.550
 to be together next to each other 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.430
 even if we did not know exactly 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.530
 because we were there 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.710
 this is radical being revolutionary 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:38.780
 I think this is revolutionary maybe 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:41.270
 more than if we knew and this 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.600
 very strongly counteracts the demand for 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.220
 the media of the politicians' intellectuals in 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.290
 who are the leaders and what are the 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.150
 proposals from you as if this 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.860
 feeling and experience that the 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.230
 people were living need 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.690
 necessarily submit to the 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.840
 their parameters to understand what is 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.820
 or ceases to be something observed if it is not 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.190
 so my shared experience 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:09.170
 with other Brazilian human beings have 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:12.440
 to be subject to its criteria to the 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.380
 criteria that define what is policy 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.880
 because I affirm that it is political that runs 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.290
 behind discovering what we are 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.239
 doing because experience is paramount to 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.760
 word is something goes running behind 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.810
 to make sense of organizing that 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.570
 that was experienced 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.850
 but there we won and it was good it was 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.250
 Concrete was real we were on the street 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.320
 screaming and this is what we want to do 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.700
 we were on the street with each other and 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:43.070
 This is fundamental that I think 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.590
 Perhaps the most important 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.570
 street exactly say we will not submit 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.400
 You want me to tell you why I'm in the 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.470
 street and I'll tell you I 'm not going 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.690
 answer this question why is this your 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.430
 question to set the parameters of the 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.390
 dialogue and who will define the 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.430
 the dialogue 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.510
 It's going to be a meeting that we think 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.120
 what you think 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.120
 so you learn to listen to what the 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.890
 people are talking 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.980
 learn to listen, you 're missing this 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.890
 to get out of this autistic world of 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.480
 who says he thinks he knows he understands 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.620
 something about life about the organization 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.320
 popular on 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.699
 those that stop being nobody knows 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.650
 everybody improvising 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.720
 so let's go a little more sensitive and 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.790
 listen to what the other thinks and what the other 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.250
 has proposed this improvisation not 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.590
 start dancing together instead of dancing 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:36.919
 and wanted to teach me what dance is 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:40.660
 nobody knows what that girl that is 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.660
 what is dancing in the street
