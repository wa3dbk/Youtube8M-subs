inches<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.390> think<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.200> if<00:02:53.069> you<00:02:53.220> want<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.430> try

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
inches I think that if you want to try

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.070 
inches I think that if you want to try
the<00:02:53.640> new<00:02:53.730> chicken<00:02:54.120> out<00:02:54.239> I<00:02:54.480> think<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:54.930> should

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
the new chicken out I think you should

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.500 
the new chicken out I think you should
do<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.260> sweet<00:02:55.470> onion<00:02:56.099> chicken<00:02:56.130> teriyaki
