00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.620
 at 5 years old I went with my family to 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.629
 USA 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.580
 my parents went there and it was 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:17.340
 something to follow with them 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.720
 14 years ago already and I still live there and 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.820
 we have to keep going 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.119
 I love to stay there and I started 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.699
 play with the former club there and the 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.880
 condemned be and they invited me to go to 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.829
 the third of them would be and I said no 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.329
 I still did not want to continue with the 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.149
 club that was because we're playing 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.070
 they had good equipment and I wait a year 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.690
 more and then yes I said you're now all 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.300
 the time to go and try to do everything 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.360
 what can the truth be 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.670
 complicated for me the first three 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.440
 years because I could not go to practice 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.170
 in the morning go to school in the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.940
 tomorrow then what I had to do classes 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.790
 at night to finish school and 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.560
 also do football but with the help 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.700
 Many people helped me finish 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.550
 all of you 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.720
 of 16 years with a goal was a 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:12.780
 very nice experience that I could spend more 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.479
 funny that you call in one of the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.340
 first games he wanted them to do 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.810
 27 years time I said was going to be 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.660
 professional wanted that well many 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.760
 They said that he could not and I expect every 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.260
 point inside the town hall I was with 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.260
 my parents my mother who take me to 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.570
 all the practices could and then 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.030
 it was very fast steps everything then it's 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.430
 difficult to enjoy but little by little 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.310
 every time he played more games and made 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.560
 goals and that stands out well with the family 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.020
 and with the players a very difficult league 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.600
 the truth that players are coming is 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.399
 growing but still lacking 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.340
 little that what is improving and 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.649
 I hope that they are saying it for 2026 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.000
 is going to be one of the best leagues can 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.640
 find many very big players 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.500
 then there is a very nice change 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.270
 shirt with some that are already going to 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.820
 withdraw and play on a court 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.520
 against them something huge against 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.160
 at risk against beckham donovan 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.929
 against a lot of player that a lot of people 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.870
 sometimes they do not have the chance to play and 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.580
 for me he was so young 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.470
 play against where today makes matter 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.030
 playing is something for me that I am big 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.830
 the best I think it was this year when 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.750
 we came west champion from us from 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.970
 that team has not known for a long time 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.740
 champions of the west and that was goal going 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.380
 from leaving champion and reaching everything 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.420
 the final could not win the final but 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.730
 the team keeps going forward and or for 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.360
 that is this year when next year 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.920
 2015 would be a pending year for the 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.540
 patriots of the American style where the 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.910
 game from the same team where we are there 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.739
 I like to look and I'm a hockey fan 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.390
 on ice then I like that a lot 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.430
 sport and I'm going to look at it sometimes the 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.620
 four and today and guess 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.220
 has the boston bruins called a 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.989
 terrific team to see if you're going to go 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.060
 to need august is one of the things 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.630
 I say that you have to go see why 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.820
 the fights that happen there 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:12.230
 but there he was when left 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:14.600
 the truth that he was forward that 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.910
 it matters what a position that 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.430
 I always learned to play the game 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.050
 three position then not good to me 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.810
 come in that I'm helped the team is going to be 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.840
 something good no matter the truth the group 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.700
 is a group that brings the family brings 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.110
 any player as a family 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.750
 we are all vision of the 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.090
 but also since we are all 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.430
 that session of 10 and but when it's in 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.530
 the court these works also so much 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.320
 the post but outside that are 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.690
 all decades of laughs more students and they are 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.490
 all kidding and they look different 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.550
 players when they are outside 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:54.940
 he heard those who went to the 12 games the 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.940
 selection many 22 camps I went 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.890
 and I already had my chance in a way 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:10.710
 Uruguayan selection did not leave anything until 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:13.050
 they called me and I came to play two 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.810
 friendly parties against Peru and from there 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.269
 they never called me until fabian godoy me 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.799
 He called to travel to Peru and then there 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.799
 everything started and now I'm here
