anything underneath it which did cause

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.890

me to use half the bottle over my whole

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.260 
me to use half the bottle over my whole
head<00:01:53.200> but<00:01:53.890> I<00:01:54.100> definitely<00:01:54.400> think<00:01:54.700> it's<00:01:55.030> still

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
head but I definitely think it's still

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.380 
head but I definitely think it's still
worth<00:01:55.330> it<00:01:55.840> being<00:01:56.230> that<00:01:56.620> I<00:01:56.830> normally<00:01:57.370> use<00:01:57.700> about

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
worth it being that I normally use about

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.830 
worth it being that I normally use about
three<00:01:58.980> products<00:01:59.980> to<00:02:00.130> get<00:02:00.430> the<00:02:00.970> same<00:02:01.270> results

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
three products to get the same results

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.870 
three products to get the same results
that<00:02:01.900> I<00:02:02.020> do<00:02:02.140> with<00:02:02.680> just<00:02:03.010> using<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.520> blueberry

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
that I do with just using the blueberry

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.080 
that I do with just using the blueberry
bliss<00:02:04.150> curl<00:02:04.870> control<00:02:05.290> jelly<00:02:05.590> alone<00:02:06.190> so<00:02:06.640> to<00:02:06.700> me

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
bliss curl control jelly alone so to me

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.630 
bliss curl control jelly alone so to me
it's<00:02:07.360> definitely<00:02:08.020> worth<00:02:08.230> it<00:02:08.440> but<00:02:09.190> when<00:02:09.490> you

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
it's definitely worth it but when you

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.120 
it's definitely worth it but when you
factor<00:02:09.850> all<00:02:10.060> of<00:02:10.179> that<00:02:10.450> in<00:02:10.630> of<00:02:11.170> course<00:02:11.290> my<00:02:11.860> hair

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
factor all of that in of course my hair

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.940 
factor all of that in of course my hair
is<00:02:12.430> waist<00:02:12.940> length<00:02:13.240> and<00:02:13.510> it's<00:02:13.660> thick<00:02:13.960> so<00:02:14.620> of

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
is waist length and it's thick so of

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.910 
is waist length and it's thick so of
course<00:02:15.160> you<00:02:15.460> will<00:02:15.730> use<00:02:16.030> less<00:02:16.959> if<00:02:17.260> your<00:02:17.440> hair<00:02:17.650> is

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
course you will use less if your hair is

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.020 
course you will use less if your hair is
I<00:02:18.280> guess<00:02:18.640> less<00:02:19.360> thick<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.470> shorter<00:02:21.400> than<00:02:21.670> mine

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
I guess less thick and shorter than mine

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.110 
I guess less thick and shorter than mine
so<00:02:22.450> definitely<00:02:22.870> keep<00:02:23.020> those<00:02:23.700> thoughts<00:02:24.700> in

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
so definitely keep those thoughts in

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.570 
so definitely keep those thoughts in
mind<00:02:25.450> when<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:25.989> are<00:02:26.040> purchasing<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.190> product

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
wonderfully without smashing my hair and

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.270 
wonderfully without smashing my hair and
this<00:04:04.569> is<00:04:04.750> how<00:04:04.900> I<00:04:04.959> get<00:04:05.079> my<00:04:05.290> curls<00:04:05.739> to<00:04:05.920> stretch

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
this is how I get my curls to stretch

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.699 
this is how I get my curls to stretch
overnight<00:04:06.880> and<00:04:07.209> combat<00:04:07.750> the<00:04:07.959> shrinkage<00:04:08.440> and

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
overnight and combat the shrinkage and

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.430 
overnight and combat the shrinkage and
the<00:04:09.549> next<00:04:09.790> day<00:04:09.970> I<00:04:10.000> accidentally<00:04:10.840> deleted<00:04:11.019> the

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
the next day I accidentally deleted the

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.650 
the next day I accidentally deleted the
