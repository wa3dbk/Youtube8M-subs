we<00:00:18.060> will<00:00:18.150> become<00:00:18.359> stopping<00:00:19.080> business<00:00:19.560> three

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
we will become stopping business three

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.679 
we will become stopping business three
using<00:00:20.160> numbers<00:00:21.350> and<00:00:22.350> start<00:00:23.279> with<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.820> prepare

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
using numbers and start with I prepare

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.320 
using numbers and start with I prepare
the<00:00:24.960> problem

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:39.310 

so<00:00:32.330> we<00:00:32.540> have<00:00:33.190> 59,000<00:00:34.210> 875<00:00:35.210> thymus<00:00:37.240> 87,000<00:00:38.320> 685

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
so we have 59,000 875 thymus 87,000 685

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.440 
so we have 59,000 875 thymus 87,000 685
that<00:00:39.739> will<00:00:39.920> be<00:00:40.160> solving<00:00:40.670> this<00:00:40.910> and<00:00:41.239> purrs

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
that will be solving this and purrs

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.200 
that will be solving this and purrs

next<00:01:27.850> we<00:01:28.240> have<00:01:28.330> nine<00:01:28.720> times<00:01:29.050> 5<00:01:30.000> 45<00:01:31.320> 7<00:01:32.320> times<00:01:32.560> 5

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
next we have nine times 5 45 7 times 5

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:42.600 
next we have nine times 5 45 7 times 5
past<00:01:33.550> 35<00:01:34.180> now<00:01:35.110> we<00:01:35.170> are<00:01:36.270> 4535

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
next we are by time server as 35 and a

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:38.730 
next we are by time server as 35 and a
time<00:02:29.030> Stein<00:02:30.340> 72<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:32.390> we<00:02:32.600> are<00:02:32.720> certified

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.240 

we<00:02:39.280> have<00:02:39.400> nine<00:02:39.730> times<00:02:40.060> six<00:02:40.540> us<00:02:41.110> 54<00:02:42.000> 7<00:02:43.000> times<00:02:43.270> 8

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
we have nine times six us 54 7 times 8

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:55.830 
we have nine times six us 54 7 times 8
56<00:02:45.250> so<00:02:46.180> we<00:02:46.420> have<00:02:46.540> built<00:02:46.780> before<00:02:46.960> and<00:02:48.510> 56

x8<00:02:56.840> IVC<00:02:57.499> a<00:02:58.599> 66<00:02:59.599> times<00:02:59.870> and<00:03:00.260> ask<00:03:00.859> for<00:03:01.189> the<00:03:01.340> blue

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
x8 IVC a 66 times and ask for the blue

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:10.450 
x8 IVC a 66 times and ask for the blue
so<00:03:01.879> we<00:03:02.060> have<00:03:02.180> 64<00:03:02.749> and<00:03:03.079> 32

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:17.320

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
followed by seven times 5y 30 5x5 we

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.260 
followed by seven times 5y 30 5x5 we
have<00:03:17.480> four<00:03:17.900> feet<00:03:18.230> so<00:03:18.980> we<00:03:19.160> have<00:03:19.280> certified<00:03:19.820> and

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
have four feet so we have certified and

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.600 
have four feet so we have certified and
40<00:03:21.880> followed<00:03:22.880> by<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.090> next<00:03:23.540> step<00:03:23.750> by<00:03:24.650> x<00:03:25.040> 8<00:03:25.340> we

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
40 followed by the next step by x 8 we

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.770 
40 followed by the next step by x 8 we
have<00:03:25.730> 40

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:45.350 

and<00:03:32.400> nine<00:03:33.400> times<00:03:34.110> 763

and<00:04:05.579> x<00:04:06.150> times<00:04:06.540> x<00:04:06.870> we<00:04:07.140> have<00:04:07.260> good<00:04:07.500> fight

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.470 

then<00:04:11.970> we're<00:04:12.150> going<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.450> put<00:04:12.569> a<00:04:12.750> dolly<00:04:14.480> this

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
then we're going to put a dolly this

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.060 
then we're going to put a dolly this
will<00:04:15.659> serve<00:04:15.900> as<00:04:15.930> a<00:04:16.169> step<00:04:16.440> of<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.680> business

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
will serve as a step of the business

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.670 
will serve as a step of the business
three

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.570 

and<00:04:20.970> finally<00:04:21.970> we<00:04:22.030> will<00:04:22.210> I<00:04:22.360> followed<00:04:22.900> them

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
and finally we will I followed them

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.610 
and finally we will I followed them
bring<00:04:24.580> down<00:04:24.790> line<00:04:25.120> and<00:04:25.150> then<00:04:25.900> we<00:04:26.170> are<00:04:26.320> there

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
bring down line and then we are there

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.360 
bring down line and then we are there
