00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.570 

you

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.820 

you<00:00:11.269> started<00:00:11.660> off<00:00:11.780> with<00:00:11.960> a<00:00:12.019> pretty<00:00:12.200> lofty<00:00:12.440> goal

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
you started off with a pretty lofty goal

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.530 
you started off with a pretty lofty goal
which<00:00:13.070> was<00:00:13.250> basically<00:00:13.430> to<00:00:13.820> mimic<00:00:14.240> the<00:00:14.389> human

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
which was basically to mimic the human

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.929 
which was basically to mimic the human
body<00:00:14.950> so<00:00:15.950> if<00:00:16.070> you<00:00:16.160> think<00:00:16.189> about<00:00:16.430> you<00:00:16.790> know<00:00:16.910> the

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:16.939 
body so if you think about you know the

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:18.850 
body so if you think about you know the
hundred<00:00:17.270> thousand<00:00:17.689> hairs<00:00:17.869> on<00:00:18.110> the<00:00:18.230> top<00:00:18.650> of<00:00:18.800> the

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:18.860 
hundred thousand hairs on the top of the

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.380 
hundred thousand hairs on the top of the
head<00:00:19.040> or<00:00:19.369> the<00:00:19.460> skin<00:00:19.730> tones<00:00:20.029> and<00:00:20.300> the

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
head or the skin tones and the

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.499 
head or the skin tones and the
reflections<00:00:21.020> and<00:00:21.259> light<00:00:21.740> and<00:00:21.950> so<00:00:22.160> on<00:00:22.330> that's<00:00:23.330> a

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:23.509 
reflections and light and so on that's a

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.140 
reflections and light and so on that's a
pretty<00:00:24.020> lofty<00:00:24.290> goal<00:00:24.680> that<00:00:25.099> has<00:00:25.550> been<00:00:25.910> thrown

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
pretty lofty goal that has been thrown

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.849 
pretty lofty goal that has been thrown
out<00:00:26.240> there<00:00:26.450> for<00:00:26.570> us<00:00:26.660> hardware<00:00:26.990> guys<00:00:27.140> as<00:00:27.590> well

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
out there for us hardware guys as well

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.460 
out there for us hardware guys as well
as<00:00:28.010> a<00:00:28.070> creative<00:00:28.340> folks<00:00:28.640> like<00:00:29.630> Peter<00:00:29.900> and<00:00:30.230> then

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
as a creative folks like Peter and then

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.160 
as a creative folks like Peter and then
the<00:00:31.220> folks<00:00:31.730> in<00:00:31.880> the<00:00:31.970> software<00:00:32.239> area<00:00:32.540> like<00:00:32.870> like

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
the folks in the software area like like

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.600 
the folks in the software area like like
jewels<00:00:33.500> to<00:00:33.769> really<00:00:34.010> pull<00:00:34.220> all<00:00:34.309> that<00:00:34.370> together

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
jewels to really pull all that together

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.660 
jewels to really pull all that together
to<00:00:35.120> make<00:00:35.269> it<00:00:35.300> happen<00:00:35.650> so<00:00:36.650> I<00:00:36.680> just<00:00:36.920> reflect<00:00:37.400> back

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
to make it happen so I just reflect back

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.660 
to make it happen so I just reflect back
one<00:00:38.420> siggraph<00:00:39.080> and<00:00:39.440> say<00:00:39.949> well<00:00:40.100> what<00:00:40.250> kind<00:00:40.640> of

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
one siggraph and say well what kind of

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.430 
one siggraph and say well what kind of
what<00:00:40.820> have<00:00:40.910> we<00:00:41.030> done<00:00:41.449> over<00:00:41.720> this<00:00:41.840> past<00:00:42.170> year

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
what have we done over this past year

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.500 
what have we done over this past year
let<00:00:43.190> me<00:00:43.280> think<00:00:43.460> back<00:00:43.699> a<00:00:43.729> year<00:00:44.089> ago<00:00:44.210> we<00:00:44.449> were

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
let me think back a year ago we were

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.539 
let me think back a year ago we were
pretty<00:00:44.690> proud<00:00:44.930> that<00:00:45.140> we<00:00:45.350> we<00:00:46.100> ain't<00:00:46.370> be

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:46.549 
pretty proud that we we ain't be

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:49.869 
pretty proud that we we ain't be
announced<00:00:46.909> the<00:00:47.000> first<00:00:47.150> teraflop<00:00:48.040> GPU<00:00:49.040> so<00:00:49.370> you

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
announced the first teraflop GPU so you

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.610 
announced the first teraflop GPU so you
know<00:00:49.970> with<00:00:50.089> one<00:00:50.420> trillion<00:00:50.900> operations<00:00:51.019> per

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
know with one trillion operations per

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.789 
know with one trillion operations per
second<00:00:52.549> and<00:00:52.729> as<00:00:53.629> we<00:00:53.780> look<00:00:53.930> forward<00:00:53.960> just<00:00:54.620> a

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:54.799 
second and as we look forward just a

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:57.100 
second and as we look forward just a
little<00:00:54.830> bit's<00:00:55.369> and<00:00:55.699> some<00:00:55.879> of<00:00:55.970> the<00:00:56.030> sneak<00:00:56.690> peak

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
little bit's and some of the sneak peak

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.869 
little bit's and some of the sneak peak
demos<00:00:57.500> that<00:00:57.530> we're<00:00:57.830> going<00:00:57.920> to<00:00:58.010> show<00:00:58.190> you<00:00:58.250> today

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
and the rest of this week we're on the

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.310 
and the rest of this week we're on the
cusp<00:01:01.699> of<00:01:01.909> another<00:01:02.089> major<00:01:02.510> inflection<00:01:03.110> point

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
cusp of another major inflection point

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.990 
cusp of another major inflection point
for<00:01:03.559> those<00:01:03.710> in<00:01:03.830> the<00:01:03.860> graphics<00:01:04.280> business<00:01:04.699> you

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
for those in the graphics business you

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.469 
for those in the graphics business you
know<00:01:05.089> I'm<00:01:05.180> talking<00:01:05.479> about<00:01:05.950> dx11<00:01:06.950> and<00:01:07.580> we're

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
know I'm talking about dx11 and we're

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:09.820 
know I'm talking about dx11 and we're
not<00:01:08.600> certainly<00:01:08.990> going<00:01:09.110> to<00:01:09.170> sit<00:01:09.409> with<00:01:09.560> one

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
not certainly going to sit with one

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.320 
not certainly going to sit with one
teraflop<00:01:10.310> we're<00:01:10.580> going<00:01:10.670> to<00:01:10.729> start<00:01:10.909> talking

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
teraflop we're going to start talking

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.320 
teraflop we're going to start talking
multiple<00:01:11.659> teraflops<00:01:12.320> per<00:01:12.920> GPU<00:01:13.430> which<00:01:14.000> I<00:01:14.119> think

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
multiple teraflops per GPU which I think

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.240 
multiple teraflops per GPU which I think
it's<00:01:14.479> pretty<00:01:14.780> darn<00:01:15.080> exciting<00:01:15.680> so<00:01:15.920> if<00:01:16.040> you<00:01:16.130> look

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
it's pretty darn exciting so if you look

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.520 
it's pretty darn exciting so if you look
over<00:01:16.460> just<00:01:16.730> this<00:01:17.000> decade<00:01:17.450> now<00:01:17.960> we're<00:01:18.140> talking

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
over just this decade now we're talking

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.430 
over just this decade now we're talking
a<00:01:18.620> couple<00:01:18.980> hundred<00:01:19.310> x<00:01:19.670> performance

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
a couple hundred x performance

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.990 
a couple hundred x performance
improvement<00:01:21.440> in<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.950> capabilities<00:01:22.670> between

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
improvement in the capabilities between

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.570 
improvement in the capabilities between
our<00:01:23.120> processors<00:01:23.750> and<00:01:23.960> our<00:01:24.560> GPUs<00:01:25.160> and<00:01:25.190> a

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
our processors and our GPUs and a

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.240 
our processors and our GPUs and a
relatively<00:01:26.120> short<00:01:26.210> period<00:01:26.570> of<00:01:26.930> time<00:01:27.010> and<00:01:28.010> so<00:01:28.160> I

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
relatively short period of time and so I

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.800 
relatively short period of time and so I
believe<00:01:28.400> I<00:01:28.580> can<00:01:28.610> fundamentally<00:01:29.120> change<00:01:29.450> the

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
believe I can fundamentally change the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.890 
believe I can fundamentally change the
dynamics<00:01:30.500> of<00:01:30.710> how<00:01:30.890> these<00:01:31.160> the<00:01:31.760> flow<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:32.780> the

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
dynamics of how these the flow and the

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.930 
dynamics of how these the flow and the
content<00:01:33.350> creation<00:01:33.650> is<00:01:33.980> done<00:01:34.430> because

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
content creation is done because

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.880 
content creation is done because
suddenly<00:01:35.240> what<00:01:35.570> used<00:01:35.780> to<00:01:35.900> be<00:01:35.960> an<00:01:36.200> entire<00:01:36.530> data

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
suddenly what used to be an entire data

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.180 
suddenly what used to be an entire data
center<00:01:37.190> can<00:01:38.000> now<00:01:38.120> actually<00:01:38.420> be<00:01:38.990> in<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:39.890> hands

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
center can now actually be in the hands

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.700 
center can now actually be in the hands
of<00:01:40.520> a<00:01:41.000> single<00:01:41.630> user<00:01:41.900> or<00:01:42.230> in<00:01:42.290> a<00:01:42.350> single

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
of a single user or in a single

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.060 
of a single user or in a single
workstation<00:01:43.070> in<00:01:43.550> some<00:01:44.120> of<00:01:44.240> these<00:01:44.330> previous

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
workstation in some of these previous

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.120 
workstation in some of these previous
environments<00:01:46.150> that<00:01:47.150> Peter<00:01:47.390> talked<00:01:47.720> about

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
environments that Peter talked about

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.010 
environments that Peter talked about
getting<00:01:49.130> that<00:01:49.250> instant<00:01:49.850> feedback<00:01:50.120> which<00:01:50.900> is

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
getting that instant feedback which is

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.260 
getting that instant feedback which is
very<00:01:51.230> exciting<00:01:51.730> so<00:01:52.730> the<00:01:52.850> other<00:01:52.970> exciting

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
very exciting so the other exciting

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.630 
very exciting so the other exciting
thing<00:01:53.630> that<00:01:53.960> we<00:01:54.080> have<00:01:54.290> today<00:01:54.650> is<00:01:54.800> I've<00:01:55.370> kind<00:01:55.580> of

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
thing that we have today is I've kind of

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.340 
thing that we have today is I've kind of
tease<00:01:55.820> you<00:01:56.030> with<00:01:56.060> this<00:01:56.390> this<00:01:56.659> demo<00:01:57.110> so<00:01:57.260> we're

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
tease you with this this demo so we're

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.620 
tease you with this this demo so we're
going<00:01:57.440> to<00:01:57.530> actually<00:01:57.680> tee<00:01:58.040> up<00:01:58.190> a<00:01:58.310> demo<00:01:58.820> of<00:01:58.970> our

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
going to actually tee up a demo of our

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.560 
going to actually tee up a demo of our
next-generation<00:02:00.190> GPU<00:02:01.190> so<00:02:01.640> you'll<00:02:02.060> see<00:02:02.300> kind

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
next-generation GPU so you'll see kind

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.190 
next-generation GPU so you'll see kind
of<00:02:02.659> some<00:02:02.870> firsts<00:02:03.350> here<00:02:03.440> in<00:02:04.340> a<00:02:05.200> workstation

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
of some firsts here in a workstation

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.440 
of some firsts here in a workstation
type<00:02:06.650> of<00:02:06.830> environment<00:02:07.370> now<00:02:07.880> this<00:02:08.030> is<00:02:08.090> from<00:02:08.360> our

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
type of environment now this is from our

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.949 
type of environment now this is from our
partner<00:02:08.840> dice<00:02:09.019> and<00:02:09.670> this<00:02:10.670> shows<00:02:11.000> their<00:02:11.659> next

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
partner dice and this shows their next

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.860 
partner dice and this shows their next
generation<00:02:12.560> engine<00:02:13.159> out<00:02:13.310> there<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:14.450> what

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
generation engine out there and what

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.580 
generation engine out there and what
you're<00:02:15.019> looking<00:02:15.500> at<00:02:15.620> is<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:15.890> thousand<00:02:17.590> white

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
you're looking at is a thousand white

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.550 
you're looking at is a thousand white
spots<00:02:19.330> first<00:02:20.330> time<00:02:20.630> it's<00:02:20.959> ever<00:02:21.110> been<00:02:21.230> shown

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
spots first time it's ever been shown

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.790 
spots first time it's ever been shown
this<00:02:21.950> number

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
this number

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.710 
this number
this<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.460> being<00:02:23.610> done<00:02:23.670> under<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:24.150> single

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
this is being done under a single

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.490 
this is being done under a single
next-generation<00:02:25.700> GPU<00:02:26.700> can<00:02:27.180> only<00:02:27.480> be<00:02:28.290> done

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
next-generation GPU can only be done

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.490 
next-generation GPU can only be done
with<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.190> dx11<00:02:29.760> GPU<00:02:30.540> because<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:30.990> leverages

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
with a dx11 GPU because it leverages

compete shader 5.0 course you know dx10

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.080 
compete shader 5.0 course you know dx10
was<00:02:36.210> 4.0<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:37.620> on<00:02:37.800> so<00:02:38.310> this<00:02:38.520> will<00:02:38.640> continue

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
was 4.0 and so on so this will continue

to be rolled out through the course of
2009<00:02:41.280> we<00:02:42.030> think<00:02:42.210> it's<00:02:42.330> pretty<00:02:42.510> exciting<00:02:43.290> some

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
2009 we think it's pretty exciting some

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.190 
2009 we think it's pretty exciting some
of<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.010> capabilities<00:02:44.190> in<00:02:44.960> potential<00:02:45.960> power

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
of the capabilities in potential power

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.110 
of the capabilities in potential power
that<00:02:46.710> we<00:02:47.190> can<00:02:47.340> bring<00:02:47.460> to<00:02:47.600> to<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.750> marketplace
