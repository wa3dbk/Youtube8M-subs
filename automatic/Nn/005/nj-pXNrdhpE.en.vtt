car's<00:06:59.280> battery<00:06:59.490> pack<00:07:00.980> the<00:07:01.980> aim<00:07:02.250> is<00:07:02.280> of<00:07:02.730> course

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 
car's battery pack the aim is of course

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.730 
car's battery pack the aim is of course
that<00:07:03.150> it<00:07:03.270> should<00:07:03.450> be<00:07:03.600> as<00:07:03.810> convenient<00:07:04.410> as

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 
that it should be as convenient as

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.850 
that it should be as convenient as
possible<00:07:05.060> both<00:07:06.060> to<00:07:06.480> use<00:07:06.750> and<00:07:07.020> to<00:07:07.320> own<00:07:07.530> and

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860 
possible both to use and to own and

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.130 
possible both to use and to own and
electric<00:07:08.280> vehicle<00:07:08.700> so<00:07:09.420> when<00:07:09.600> you<00:07:09.720> park<00:07:10.050> the

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:10.140 
electric vehicle so when you park the

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.610 
electric vehicle so when you park the
car<00:07:10.290> above<00:07:11.010> the<00:07:11.190> plate<00:07:12.380> energy<00:07:13.380> is

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620 
car above the plate energy is

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.890 
car above the plate energy is
transferred<00:07:14.400> from<00:07:14.820> the<00:07:14.940> plate<00:07:15.300> to<00:07:15.870> the

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:15.900 
transferred from the plate to the

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.380 
transferred from the plate to the
inductive<00:07:16.590> pick<00:07:16.890> up<00:07:17.040> in<00:07:17.280> the<00:07:17.520> vehicle<00:07:17.910> without

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:18.390 
inductive pick up in the vehicle without

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.950 
inductive pick up in the vehicle without
any<00:07:18.750> physical<00:07:19.080> contact<00:07:19.460> so<00:07:20.460> you<00:07:21.450> won't<00:07:21.690> even

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 
any physical contact so you won't even

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.360 
any physical contact so you won't even
need<00:07:22.230> this<00:07:22.440> in<00:07:22.680> the<00:07:22.830> future

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:25.370 

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.460 

another<00:07:26.120> step<00:07:26.419> is<00:07:26.600> that<00:07:26.720> Volvo<00:07:27.050> has<00:07:27.080> initiated

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:27.470 
another step is that Volvo has initiated

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.860 
another step is that Volvo has initiated
a<00:07:27.889> development<00:07:28.490> pre<00:07:28.669> study<00:07:28.970> of<00:07:29.150> a<00:07:29.300> fuel<00:07:29.540> cell

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:29.870 
a development pre study of a fuel cell

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.500 
a development pre study of a fuel cell
range<00:07:30.199> extender<00:07:30.800> that<00:07:31.550> significantly<00:07:32.300> will

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:32.510 
range extender that significantly will

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.510 
range extender that significantly will
extend<00:07:32.810> the<00:07:32.990> electric<00:07:33.380> cars<00:07:33.590> operating<00:07:34.280> range

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:34.520 
extend the electric cars operating range

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:40.200 
extend the electric cars operating range
without<00:07:35.240> any<00:07:35.570> carbon<00:07:35.960> dioxide<00:07:36.410> emissions<00:07:37.510> and

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:40.210 
without any carbon dioxide emissions and

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.730 
without any carbon dioxide emissions and
what<00:07:41.210> will<00:07:41.479> the<00:07:41.600> electric<00:07:41.990> car<00:07:42.199> look<00:07:42.440> like<00:07:42.470> in

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:42.740 
what will the electric car look like in

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.400 
what will the electric car look like in
the<00:07:42.770> future<00:07:43.240> well<00:07:44.240> the<00:07:44.600> designers<00:07:45.110> will<00:07:45.290> of

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:45.410 
the future well the designers will of

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.320 
the future well the designers will of
course<00:07:45.620> adapt<00:07:46.070> the<00:07:46.370> special<00:07:46.699> features<00:07:47.060> and

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:47.330 
course adapt the special features and

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.510 
course adapt the special features and
create<00:07:47.690> a<00:07:47.720> functional<00:07:48.350> and<00:07:48.500> attractive<00:07:48.680> Volvo

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.520 
create a functional and attractive Volvo

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:58.020 
create a functional and attractive Volvo
that<00:07:49.970> maybe<00:07:50.330> will<00:07:50.840> look<00:07:51.020> something<00:07:51.199> like<00:07:51.680> this

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:58.030 

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.460 

maybe<00:07:58.660> you

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:00.470 
maybe you

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.530 
maybe you
