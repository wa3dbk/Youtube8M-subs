the<00:01:37.680> dynamic<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.340> all<00:01:38.460> changed<00:01:38.939> okay

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
the dynamic of it all changed okay

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.240 
the dynamic of it all changed okay
however<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:40.140> do<00:01:40.290> think<00:01:40.439> one<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.040> biggest

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
however I do think one of the biggest

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.679 
however I do think one of the biggest
mistakes<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.880> wrestling<00:01:42.270> companies<00:01:42.630> like

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
mistakes that wrestling companies like

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.899 
mistakes that wrestling companies like
Deborah<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.110> don't<00:01:43.350> do<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.950> have<00:01:44.189> individual

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
Deborah we don't do is have individual

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.030 
Deborah we don't do is have individual

regions<00:01:47.549> because<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.939> think<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.299> would

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
regions because I think that that would

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.030 
regions because I think that that would
make<00:01:48.630> everything<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.560> much<00:01:49.590> more<00:01:49.740> interesting

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
I mean I'm not saying it's right or

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.770 
I mean I'm not saying it's right or
wrong<00:02:13.920> I'm<00:02:14.640> just<00:02:14.910> saying<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:15.420> is<00:02:15.660> the

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
wrong I'm just saying that is the

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.060 
wrong I'm just saying that is the

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.430 
dynamic of the wrestling business now
ten<00:02:17.550> minutes<00:02:17.910> remaining<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.690> think<00:02:19.020> that<00:02:19.200> the

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
ten minutes remaining I think that the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.720 
ten minutes remaining I think that the
television<00:02:20.070> writers<00:02:20.310> haven't<00:02:20.610> necessarily

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
television writers haven't necessarily

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.080 
television writers haven't necessarily
destroyed<00:02:21.510> wrestling<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.320> think<00:02:22.530> what<00:02:23.090> where

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
destroyed wrestling I think what where

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.460 
destroyed wrestling I think what where
the<00:02:24.120> issue<00:02:24.360> comes<00:02:24.510> with<00:02:24.780> television<00:02:25.140> y<00:02:25.230> is<00:02:25.290> for

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
the issue comes with television y is for

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.750 
the issue comes with television y is for
me<00:02:25.590> is<00:02:25.680> there's<00:02:25.890> two<00:02:26.010> things<00:02:26.220> first<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.610> all

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
me is there's two things first of all

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.550 
me is there's two things first of all
you<00:02:27.210> tend<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.570> get<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.900> bad<00:02:28.080> television

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
you tend to get the bad television

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.400 
you tend to get the bad television
writers<00:02:29.100> working<00:02:29.580> for<00:02:29.760> w/e<00:02:30.210> so<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:31.080> tends<00:02:31.290> to

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
writers working for w/e so it tends to

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.430 
writers working for w/e so it tends to
be<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.220> know<00:02:32.340> ultimately<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.900> working

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
be the you know ultimately the working

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.740 
be the you know ultimately the working
conditions<00:02:34.530> are<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.040> poor<00:02:35.280> in<00:02:35.610> WB<00:02:36.060> in<00:02:36.330> terms<00:02:36.600> of

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
conditions are so poor in WB in terms of

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.330 
conditions are so poor in WB in terms of
what<00:02:37.350> they<00:02:37.500> have<00:02:37.620> what<00:02:37.800> these<00:02:37.980> writers<00:02:38.160> have

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
what they have what these writers have

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.550 
what they have what these writers have
to<00:02:38.460> go<00:02:38.610> through<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.720> don't<00:02:39.960> tend<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.380> get

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
to go through that you don't tend to get

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.230 
to go through that you don't tend to get
good<00:02:41.250> television<00:02:41.610> like<00:02:41.910> let's<00:02:42.060> go<00:02:42.210> they're

in<00:03:52.620> that<00:03:52.770> sense<00:03:53.100> as<00:03:53.280> well<00:03:53.459> is<00:03:53.670> that<00:03:53.700> there's

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
in that sense as well is that there's

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.900 
in that sense as well is that there's
just<00:03:54.180> this<00:03:54.630> is<00:03:55.320> very<00:03:55.590> little<00:03:55.830> forward<00:03:56.370> well

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
just this is very little forward well

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.340 
just this is very little forward well
there<00:03:57.030> is<00:03:57.120> forward<00:03:57.420> planning<00:03:57.600> but<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:57.930> tends

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
there is forward planning but it tends

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.720 
there is forward planning but it tends
to<00:03:58.440> collapse<00:03:58.860> by<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.190> time<00:03:59.430> you<00:03:59.580> get<00:03:59.670> to

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
to collapse by the time you get to

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.860 
to collapse by the time you get to
Monday<00:03:59.940> afternoon<00:04:00.450> almost<00:04:00.810> so<00:04:02.510> there's<00:04:03.510> that

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
second part of it is the way that they

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.960

and<00:04:34.560> they'll<00:04:35.070> take<00:04:35.910> it<00:04:36.030> to<00:04:36.090> them<00:04:36.240> and<00:04:36.510> they'll

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
and they'll take it to them and they'll

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.150 
and they'll take it to them and they'll
go<00:04:36.840> well<00:04:37.199> that's<00:04:37.350> a<00:04:37.470> good<00:04:37.620> part<00:04:37.889> of<00:04:37.949> it<00:04:38.070> i'll

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
go well that's a good part of it i'll

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.070 
go well that's a good part of it i'll
take<00:04:38.370> that<00:04:38.400> pipe<00:04:38.760> i<00:04:38.880> won't<00:04:39.060> take<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.300> rest<00:04:39.479> and

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
take that pipe i won't take the rest and

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.210 
take that pipe i won't take the rest and
so<00:04:40.199> they<00:04:40.290> might<00:04:40.440> have<00:04:40.560> this<00:04:40.680> really<00:04:41.010> good

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
so they might have this really good

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.890 
so they might have this really good
story<00:04:41.460> line<00:04:41.580> plot<00:04:41.910> it<00:04:42.030> out<00:04:42.150> in<00:04:42.330> their<00:04:42.449> head<00:04:42.660> and

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
story line plot it out in their head and

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.930 
story line plot it out in their head and
before<00:04:43.800> they<00:04:43.889> know<00:04:44.040> it<00:04:44.070> the<00:04:44.460> first<00:04:44.699> step<00:04:44.910> of

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
before they know it the first step of

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.370 
before they know it the first step of
exchange<00:04:45.449> which<00:04:45.690> means<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:46.050> rest<00:04:46.199> of<00:04:46.290> it

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
exchange which means the rest of it

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.510 
exchange which means the rest of it
doesn't<00:04:46.590> make<00:04:46.650> sense<00:04:46.710> anymore<00:04:47.040> they<00:04:47.340> have<00:04:47.430> to

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
doesn't make sense anymore they have to

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.840 
doesn't make sense anymore they have to
rewrite<00:04:47.790> it<00:04:48.000> so<00:04:49.040> from<00:04:50.040> that<00:04:50.070> perspective<00:04:50.340> i

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
rewrite it so from that perspective i

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.520 
rewrite it so from that perspective i
just<00:04:51.120> think<00:04:51.270> this<00:04:51.449> they're<00:04:52.050> just<00:04:52.080> not<00:04:52.320> using

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
just think this they're just not using

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.500 
just think this they're just not using
them<00:04:52.590> correctly<00:04:52.650> either<00:04:53.400> they<00:04:53.699> be<00:04:53.760> they<00:04:54.180> want

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
them correctly either they be they want

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.960 
them correctly either they be they want
they<00:04:54.630> want<00:04:54.810> them<00:04:55.050> to<00:04:55.229> be<00:04:55.610> television<00:04:56.610> writers

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
they want them to be television writers

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.250 
they want them to be television writers
but<00:04:57.150> then<00:04:57.300> they<00:04:57.389> use<00:04:57.540> them<00:04:57.720> in<00:04:57.750> a<00:04:57.930> wrestling

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
but then they use them in a wrestling

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.080 
but then they use them in a wrestling
setting<00:04:58.740> which<00:04:58.860> does<00:04:59.160> always<00:04:59.430> a<00:04:59.550> mouth<00:04:59.850> for

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
setting which does always a mouth for

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.570 
setting which does always a mouth for
that<00:05:00.210> so<00:05:00.600> i<00:05:00.840> don't<00:05:01.410> know<00:05:01.530> i<00:05:01.560> think<00:05:01.800> that<00:05:02.070> it<00:05:02.430> may

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
that so i don't know i think that it may

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.920 
that so i don't know i think that it may
be<00:05:02.639> the<00:05:02.820> way<00:05:02.910> they're<00:05:03.090> being<00:05:03.240> used<00:05:03.270> what<00:05:03.810> as

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
be the way they're being used what as

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.210 
be the way they're being used what as
much<00:05:04.169> as<00:05:04.380> the<00:05:04.500> fact<00:05:04.530> that<00:05:04.740> they<00:05:04.889> are<00:05:04.919> being

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
much as the fact that they are being
