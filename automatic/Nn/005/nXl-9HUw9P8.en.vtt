got the flag glitch he said he liked ran

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.359 
got the flag glitch he said he liked ran
to<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.720> flag<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.350> didn't<00:01:16.590> return<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.250> was

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
to the flag it didn't return and I was

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.679 
to the flag it didn't return and I was
on<00:01:17.580> our<00:01:17.610> base<00:01:17.909> with<00:01:18.060> our<00:01:18.150> flag<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.509> know<00:01:18.570> what

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
on our base with our flag you know what

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.620 
on our base with our flag you know what
it<00:01:18.780> tied<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.080> up<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.830> we<00:01:19.950> went<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.369> overtime

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
it tied it up and we went to overtime

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.600 
it tied it up and we went to overtime
but<00:01:21.630> um<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.560> happened<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.130> guess<00:01:23.400> that

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
but um so that happened I guess that

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.190 
but um so that happened I guess that

yeah<00:02:13.560> top<00:02:13.980> any<00:02:14.160> type<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.490> so<00:02:15.240> after<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.290> we

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
played justice and I'm like oh I almost

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.960 
played justice and I'm like oh I almost
think<00:02:19.440> justice<00:02:19.800> do<00:02:19.890> another<00:02:20.250> best<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.730> let<00:02:20.850> the

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
think justice do another best to let the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.220 
think justice do another best to let the
event<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.240> thought<00:02:21.450> they<00:02:21.570> could<00:02:21.690> potentially

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
event I thought they could potentially

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.870 
event I thought they could potentially
want<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.560> anyone<00:02:23.400> could<00:02:23.490> have<00:02:23.550> won<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.700> event

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
want it anyone could have won that event

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.910 
want it anyone could have won that event
but<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.480> thought<00:02:24.990> they're<00:02:25.170> one<00:02:25.350> of<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.530> best

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
but I thought they're one of the best

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.880 
but I thought they're one of the best
team<00:02:26.130> that<00:02:26.250> honestly<00:02:26.610> so<00:02:27.420> we<00:02:28.140> played<00:02:28.350> them<00:02:28.590> we

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
team that honestly so we played them we

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.220 
team that honestly so we played them we
ended<00:02:29.070> up<00:02:29.130> winning<00:02:29.310> 3-0<00:02:29.850> I'm<00:02:30.750> not<00:02:30.870> sure<00:02:30.930> why<00:02:31.200> I

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
ended up winning 3-0 I'm not sure why I

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.990

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.580 
hopping nation I think we play phase and
op<00:05:05.840> nation<00:05:06.200> again<00:05:06.470> not<00:05:07.370> sure<00:05:07.550> but<00:05:08.180> um<00:05:08.390> yeah<00:05:09.350> so

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
op nation again not sure but um yeah so

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.040 
op nation again not sure but um yeah so
