00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.080
 ah 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.470
 the hostel of baths is in turn the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.470
 worst insular of gran canaria 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.650
 when arriving the animals collected from almost 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.650
 all the municipalities of the island 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.250
 every year about 4,500 are collected 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.649
 animals mostly dogs but only 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.989
 a small part of them about 1500 are 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:49.149
 adopted the rest if they are not claimed 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.149
 in 21 days they are usually slaughtered 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.170
 these facilities belong to 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.120
 great canary town hall but they are 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.629
 managed by the hostel association 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.629
 of baths 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.050
 the hostel consists of a building 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.089
 main where is the waiting room 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.979
 the reception and the veterinary consultation 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.720
 in addition to two small modules 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.720
 intended for minor hospitalization 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.950
 abroad has several cages 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.200
 pens and a common cat 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.850
 The main objective of the shelter is 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.320
 that as many animals as possible 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.860
 who get there have a second 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.860
 opportunity 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.190
 today we are going to tell the story of sailing 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.740
 for the performance they wanted 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.710
 do and a co- worker of my 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.990
 husband recommended that we buy it in 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.180
 a store but we did not like it 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.460
 much the idea and here we have heard 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.900
 talk about the greens of bathhouses and 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.260
 the problem of dropouts that 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.160
 had and we decided to go used and the 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.160
 it's really cool 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:18.040
 like my husband toning my children abi 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.040
 Jorge and I 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.230
 and they were very kind to us 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.370
 explained the procedure or the price 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.370
 who has the adoption 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.140
 first we resorted to the hostel there is a 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.349
 bunch of cages where there are different 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.190
 types of small big dogs and everything 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.190
 type of races 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.570
 and immediately we gave adela ya Jorge is that 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.570
 he loved it 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.599
 Should a vÃ©lez you believe when diaz 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.939
 I said to my mother that the earth well 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.579
 I should take care of a special race 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:04.230
 a medium communication dog we do not have 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.230
 a lot of space and we already had 4 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:19.069
 we paid a symbolic amount and I the 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:21.590
 they delivered super well vaccinated truth 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.450
 and wormed 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.810
 and the rabies vaccine also 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.849
 they put the microchip and very well in addition 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.670
 candle also told us that as it is a 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:34.840
 bitch of race because they were in charge 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.840
 to sterilize it and so it was 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.600
 having a dog means a lot 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:45.800
 responsibility to give water food ride 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:49.390
 daily give you veterinary education but 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.390
 with candles we always had a great time 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.200
 adopt a shelter dog is a 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.819
 very nice experience and you have to have 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.439
 in mind that they become a 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.710
 member of your families then you have to 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:09.560
 have several things in mind 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:12.290
 I live last for many years 12 15 years 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.150
 they need careful attention 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.639
 we must have an adequate space 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.400
 for this we must have time to 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.859
 dedicate them and have a healthy diet 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.570
 and correct they need vaccinations so 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.919
 that we must go as some 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.580
 veterinary companion so that 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.569
 attend 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:33.139
 any problem that has whatever 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:35.699
 of health always needs to be cared for 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:39.030
 we must keep in mind that we live in 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:41.370
 society then our animals 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.159
 they must be educated and educated to 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.810
 live together we can not leave excrement in 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:48.449
 the street you have to pick it up must 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.250
 be socialized our animals must 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.800
 to walk at least two or three times 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.110
 a day it is important that they go with 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.379
 strap to prevent a 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.690
 accident we must also have in 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:03.000
 has the issue of dropouts 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.070
 when we go on vacation 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.840
 they need a place to be not 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.280
 they can leave on the street then either 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.560
 you have to do Gonzalez and look for a 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.950
 residence, a companion that takes care of him 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.810
 always someone to conclude what 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.680
 more important would be to take into account that 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.750
 they are animals that will live for many years 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.380
 hopefully 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:27.980
 they need veterinary care they need 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.470
 Food need love space to be 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.940
 educated then one of the things 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.860
 important also the subject of 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.160
 consider sterilization or so 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.600
 less responsible motherhood 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.340
 that for me are the most 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.160
 important to keep in mind with the 2 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:46.910
 in normal to prevent it from coming back 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:50.320
 new but his children to a place like 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.320
 this a place of abandonment 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.280
 ah 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.880
 or not
