jigsaws traditionally a lot of people

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.490 
jigsaws traditionally a lot of people
look<00:00:17.160> quite<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> fierce<00:00:18.449> obtrusive<00:00:19.109> thing<00:00:19.320> a

look quite a fierce obtrusive thing a

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.810 
look quite a fierce obtrusive thing a
lot<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.770> people<00:00:20.009> don't<00:00:20.070> actually<00:00:20.250> like<00:00:20.520> using

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
lot of people don't actually like using

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.310 
lot of people don't actually like using
them<00:00:21.029> whatsoever<00:00:21.539> what<00:00:21.779> we've<00:00:21.900> done<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.169> we've

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
them whatsoever what we've done is we've

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.050 
them whatsoever what we've done is we've
come<00:00:22.500> out<00:00:22.529> with<00:00:22.800> what<00:00:23.009> we<00:00:23.099> call<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.400> compact

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
come out with what we call the compact

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.540 
come out with what we call the compact
range<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.110> much<00:00:25.289> much<00:00:25.529> smaller<00:00:26.279> range

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
range so it's a much much smaller range

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.790 
range so it's a much much smaller range
of<00:00:26.759> jigsaws<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.509> are<00:00:27.630> more<00:00:27.779> ergonomic<00:00:28.470> more

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
of jigsaws that are more ergonomic more

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.030 
of jigsaws that are more ergonomic more
easy<00:00:29.009> to<00:00:29.369> handle<00:00:29.759> a<00:00:29.970> little<00:00:30.359> bit<00:00:30.480> lighter

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
model the sort of thing that if you

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.360 
model the sort of thing that if you
don't<00:00:39.570> use<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> jigsaw<00:00:40.289> this<00:00:40.860> one<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.219> actually

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
don't use a jigsaw this one is actually

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.520 
don't use a jigsaw this one is actually
for<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.879> it's<00:00:42.180> all<00:00:42.329> types<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.870> things<00:00:43.110> depend

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
for you it's all types of things depend

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.810 
for you it's all types of things depend
on<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.739> blade<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.070> actually<00:00:44.340> put<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.670> it

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
on the blade you actually put in it

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.640 
on the blade you actually put in it
metal<00:00:45.390> cutting<00:00:45.570> blades<00:00:45.870> wood<00:00:46.110> cutting<00:00:46.410> blades

low<00:00:47.070> vibration<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.270> actually<00:00:48.600> written<00:00:48.750> on

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
low vibration it's actually written on

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.260 
low vibration it's actually written on
the<00:00:48.930> label<00:00:49.140> there<00:00:49.560> that<00:00:49.980> just<00:00:50.220> transfers<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
the label there that just transfers the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.460 
the label there that just transfers the
vibrations<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.110> you're<00:00:52.230> not<00:00:52.320> actually

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
vibrations so you're not actually

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.139 
vibrations so you're not actually
feeling<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:53.040> up<00:00:53.130> through<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.460> handle<00:00:53.820> that

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
feeling it up through the handle that

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.970 
feeling it up through the handle that
little<00:00:54.420> blower<00:00:54.600> symbol<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.260> stops<00:00:55.620> um<00:00:55.860> to

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
little blower symbol that stops um to

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.090 
little blower symbol that stops um to
bend<00:00:56.160> down<00:00:56.310> and<00:00:56.370> go<00:00:57.620> constantly<00:00:58.620> turn<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
bend down and go constantly turn the

bend down and go constantly turn the
blower<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.550> actually<00:00:59.910> blow<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.329> dust<00:01:00.480> away

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
blower on it actually blow the dust away

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.960 
blower on it actually blow the dust away
as<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.470> actually<00:01:01.770> saw<00:01:01.980> through<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.370> unit<00:01:02.730> on

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
as you actually saw through the unit on

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.630 
as you actually saw through the unit on
the<00:01:03.120> entire<00:01:03.480> range<00:01:03.840> we<00:01:04.290> have<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.500> STS<00:01:05.250> click

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
the entire range we have this STS click

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.550 
the entire range we have this STS click
type<00:01:05.880> system<00:01:06.390> where<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.930> just<00:01:07.110> push<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
type system where you just push the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.080 
type system where you just push the
blade<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:08.009> to<00:01:08.280> actually<00:01:08.549> click<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.880> into<00:01:08.969> place

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
blade in to actually click it into place

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.480 
blade in to actually click it into place
and<00:01:09.540> then<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.469> pull<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.829> lever<00:01:11.009> back<00:01:11.130> and

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
and then just pull that lever back and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.679 
and then just pull that lever back and
it<00:01:11.549> will<00:01:11.640> actually<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:11.939> release<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.540> blade

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
it will actually just release the blade

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.090 
it will actually just release the blade
again<00:01:12.960> I'm<00:01:13.320> going<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.500> use<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.680> universal

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
again I'm going to use a universal

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.179 
again I'm going to use a universal
jigsaw<00:01:14.909> first<00:01:15.420> has<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.259> pendulum<00:01:16.619> action

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
jigsaw first has that pendulum action

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.800 
jigsaw first has that pendulum action
and<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> zero<00:01:17.939> mode<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.420> blade<00:01:18.630> would

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
and in the zero mode the blade would

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.139 
and in the zero mode the blade would
just<00:01:19.020> go<00:01:19.170> up<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.679> down<00:01:19.859> and<00:01:20.130> as<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.909> push<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
just go up and down and as you push the

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.929 
just go up and down and as you push the
pendulum<00:01:21.659> actions<00:01:22.380> leave<00:01:22.770> around<00:01:23.219> the<00:01:23.700> blade

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
pendulum actions leave around the blade

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.090 
pendulum actions leave around the blade
would<00:01:24.149> go<00:01:24.329> slightly<00:01:24.959> further<00:01:25.319> forward<00:01:25.859> this

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
would go slightly further forward this

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.649 
would go slightly further forward this
type<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.459> thing<00:01:26.609> you're<00:01:26.700> typically<00:01:27.090> used<00:01:27.479> for

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
type of thing you're typically used for

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.559 
type of thing you're typically used for
cutting<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.560> lot<00:01:28.709> faster<00:01:29.249> roughly<00:01:29.969> about<00:01:30.060> 40%

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:30.569 
cutting a lot faster roughly about 40%

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.010 
cutting a lot faster roughly about 40%
quicker<00:01:31.200> than<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.499> normal<00:01:31.770> cut<00:01:32.659> we<00:01:33.659> all<00:01:33.779> said

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
quicker than the normal cut we all said

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.660 
quicker than the normal cut we all said
this<00:01:34.170> extra<00:01:34.560> feature<00:01:34.770> which<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.399> line

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
this extra feature which is a line

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.879 
this extra feature which is a line
control<00:01:36.179> cut<00:01:36.450> control<00:01:36.899> so<00:01:37.469> you<00:01:37.499> get<00:01:37.679> a<00:01:37.709> good

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:37.889 
control cut control so you get a good

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.859 

we're<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.030> going<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.210> stop<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.570> there<00:01:51.750> and

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
we're just going to stop it there and

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:52.880 
we're just going to stop it there and
I'm<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:51.990> going<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.289> switch<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.619> pendulum

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
I'm just going to switch a pendulum

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.709 
I'm just going to switch a pendulum
action<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.460> just<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.850> give<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.090> an<00:01:54.210> idea<00:01:54.299> how

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
action on just to give you an idea how

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:56.240 
action on just to give you an idea how
much<00:01:54.869> more<00:01:55.140> speed<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.560> actually<00:01:55.860> creates

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
much more speed it actually creates

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.069 
much more speed it actually creates

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
a metal blade in the jigsaw now I'm

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.270 
a metal blade in the jigsaw now I'm
going<00:02:18.599> to<00:02:18.660> shout<00:02:18.900> cutting<00:02:19.260> some<00:02:19.440> perspex

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
going to shout cutting some perspex

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.040 
going to shout cutting some perspex
now<00:02:20.520> traditionally<00:02:21.060> perspex<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:21.810> quite

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
now traditionally perspex is quite

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:29.790 
now traditionally perspex is quite
difficult

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.250

you<00:02:38.650> use<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:38.980> wood<00:02:39.280> cutting<00:02:39.640> blade<00:02:39.850> it's<00:02:40.180> just

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
you use a wood cutting blade it's just

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.300 
you use a wood cutting blade it's just
gonna<00:02:40.510> chip<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.200> crack<00:02:41.440> here<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:41.800> break<00:02:42.010> here
