00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:18.810
 Hello. Interface. What I 'm going to show you today . 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:23.070
 The printer you see now is an a3 printer called the Officejet k8600. 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.470
 The service station, which is one of the most troublesome symptoms in this unloading station, 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.630
 It's a problem 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.769
 Now, this printer's fault is that I have to clean the entire service station 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.670
 I did. 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:39.840
 If you wash the same symptoms 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:46.110
 If you try the effect , you will see it here. 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:48.000
 At the same time supporting the power amplifier and the media buttons blink blink blink blink lights cross 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:55.379
 Sang-hee Kim 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:00.829
 In most of these buttonless printers that do not have this liquid crystal, 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.829
 The flashing of the button and the power supply means that 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:11.200
 The motion of each part 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.369
 That part of the King, while there are some countries that are not part of the language and should not land 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.020
 It's work. 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:21.729
 In our case, we have to test the font 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:25.620
 Report an operation to put this part if you do not move the timing of the move 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:30.120
 If it's blinking, it's a problem. 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.290
 This is the case with this machine. 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.710
 It's not. 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:39.970
 The amount of the motor station station agent 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:43.990
 I did the disassembly and replaced the parts. 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.450
 It's not working . 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:52.090
 New 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:55.539
 You're ready for the motor now. I will replace this part . 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:01.540
 The two items are replaced when they are replaced. 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:04.540
 This part is not supplied separately on hp 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.920
 I have to buy it separately as a priest. 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.950
 This was about a month ago. 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:17.050
 I am a direct member to purchase through foreign countries . 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:22.780
 Yes gatgoyo will now more difficult to find steady demand geojiman write 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:24.190
 Anyway, there are a few parts left, 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.630
 It's important. 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.069
 I'll show you how to make this motor acupuncture a second time. 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.390
 It is. 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.390
 Then, 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.069
 I do not know how to do it. 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.909
 I think I can . 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:50.239
 When you are gracious, remove Enverto on page 4. 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:53.390
 Remove the cave here and then 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.420
 related to kg 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:01.340
 Related to Kenji 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:03.579
 Remove the ink tube. Then, for example, 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.579
 This questia 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.280
 When sk ace gets informed 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.280
 I will even disassemble it. 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.650
 How to disassemble 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.460
 Let's remove this connector first. 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.990
 Then 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.709
 Motherboard 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.970
 After this , 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.320
 Ah 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:52.370
 Yogeo is to pull out the connector, as earlier 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:55.400
 Raising fall'm releasing my example, I yoreotge 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.180
 It's my everything out in advance because the machines do fall 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.180
 Exceedingly high 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.349
 Ah 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.810
 So the board was removed. 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.810
 Station 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.470
 And then remove the tube. 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.289
 This system 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.110
 Press down on the main frame and push it out. 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.200
 Ah 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:11.839
 When you subtract it , you have to be careful with the state. 

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:13.229
 When you look at 

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:16.350
 Ah 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:19.820
 You can do it with absolute strength. 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.820
 You have to get rid of it 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.410
 This party will fall by 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:41.920
 This is paid up to here. 5 If you are attracting hair, subtract 1 of this bolt. 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:44.650
 After removing the cleave, replace the motor and reassemble it . 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:50.760
 You can assemble in the opposite direction. 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.760
 Because the inside of this is already cleaned up by me 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:57.740
 Now the problem is now 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.720
 Since this is a symptom that does not move from the motor to the motor, 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:05.090
 You can replace it. 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:06.920
 In the case of working time, the motor is not good at all except for the cleaning part. 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.520
 It will not take long 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.520
 Empire 1 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:20.430
 It's too short and it's only 30 minutes. 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:22.630
 Oh, one more time to turn on the testing Croce, in good faith, 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.800
 In definition 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.800
 I'll try.
