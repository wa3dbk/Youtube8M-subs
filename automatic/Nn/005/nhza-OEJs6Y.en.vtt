00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
look a little uneven like when it's

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.080 
look a little uneven like when it's
smaller<00:01:17.770> than<00:01:17.889> the<00:01:18.159> other<00:01:18.189> is<00:01:18.609> there<00:01:18.850> any<00:01:18.999> way

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
smaller than the other is there any way

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.120 
smaller than the other is there any way
to<00:01:19.119> balance<00:01:19.389> it<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:20.200> way<00:01:20.380> to<00:01:20.439> actually<00:01:20.920> create

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
to balance it the way to actually create

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.349 
to balance it the way to actually create
more<00:01:21.219> balanced<00:01:21.520> with<00:01:21.639> that<00:01:21.759> is<00:01:21.939> just<00:01:22.210> to

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:22.359 
more balanced with that is just to

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:23.940 
more balanced with that is just to
create<00:01:22.659> a<00:01:22.689> thicker<00:01:22.990> application<00:01:23.770> of<00:01:23.859> the

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
create a thicker application of the

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.639 
create a thicker application of the
contour<00:01:24.429> color<00:01:24.609> on<00:01:24.819> that<00:01:24.850> smaller<00:01:25.420> lie<00:01:25.810> and

we're going to add a little bit of

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:31.289 
we're going to add a little bit of
highlight<00:01:29.920> underneath<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.579> brow<00:01:30.850> bell<00:01:31.090> as

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
and what that's going to do is really

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.660
