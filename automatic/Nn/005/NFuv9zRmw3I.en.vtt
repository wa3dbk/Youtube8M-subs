00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
think we harp on hasbro a lot which we

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.740 
think we harp on hasbro a lot which we
should<00:05:53.070> you<00:05:53.580> know<00:05:53.610> saying<00:05:53.940> cuz<00:05:54.120> we<00:05:54.270> r<00:05:54.300> we<00:05:54.600> are

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
should you know saying cuz we r we are

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.960 
should you know saying cuz we r we are
fans<00:05:55.110> you<00:05:55.920> know<00:05:55.950> we're<00:05:56.370> collectors<00:05:56.820> were

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
fans you know we're collectors were

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.810 
fans you know we're collectors were
picky<00:05:57.330> but<00:05:57.930> at<00:05:58.080> the<00:05:58.170> same<00:05:58.410> time<00:05:58.650> I<00:05:58.710> think<00:05:58.920> the

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
picky but at the same time I think the

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.970 
picky but at the same time I think the
quality<00:06:00.030> that<00:06:00.240> they're<00:06:00.510> giving<00:06:00.660> out<00:06:00.900> now<00:06:01.230> is<00:06:01.920> a

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:01.980 
quality that they're giving out now is a

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.800 
quality that they're giving out now is a
lot<00:06:02.280> better<00:06:02.550> than<00:06:02.820> when<00:06:02.940> they<00:06:03.060> started<00:06:03.090> it<00:06:03.660> is

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
lot better than when they started it is

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.200 
lot better than when they started it is
getting<00:06:04.020> better<00:06:04.260> and<00:06:04.670> you<00:06:05.670> know<00:06:05.790> all<00:06:06.030> I<00:06:06.060> can

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
getting better and you know all I can

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.420 
getting better and you know all I can
say<00:06:06.510> is<00:06:06.540> that<00:06:06.750> they're<00:06:06.930> improving<00:06:07.260> and<00:06:07.740> it

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
say is that they're improving and it

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.010 
say is that they're improving and it
just<00:06:08.640> seems<00:06:08.850> like<00:06:08.940> they<00:06:09.240> can<00:06:09.390> only<00:06:09.600> go<00:06:09.840> up<00:06:09.870> from

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020
