00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.930
 Hey everyone , everything is good, welcome. 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.859
 Another one of mine on Tuesday 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.859
 it's more a concussion 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.279
 as you may have seen by the spark 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.590
 apps marvel universe is being committed 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.050
 once again for a mega event that 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.330
 promises once more the word 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.820
 Leave an episode today I'm going 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.759
 explain to you what are the wars 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.680
 nice bastards that is good to stress has nothing 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.480
 to do with the secret wars in the finals 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.190
 from the 80's 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.260
 to understand this new mega event that 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.640
 promises to put order in the house of ideas 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.410
 We should start with the 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.550
 first the multiverse concept 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.950
 so what is very different science 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.800
 says that the universe is a set 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.980
 infinite of possible universes or 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.739
 includes the universe in which we live 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.809
 skirts the various universes within the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.570
 universe are called universes 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.330
 parallel universes and the alternative 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.640
 together they understand everything that exists 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.860
 As you know, there are multiple 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.049
 parallel universes call it diverse 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.750
 stories have already been told in each 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.450
 of these universe the main universe 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.659
 when then the spider man the website 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.119
 member of mondono the avengers 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.930
 finally the universe where all the 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.150
 heroes and more known is the universe 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.280
 616 other universe and therefore for 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.200
 marvel is the ultimate universe that is the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.689
 number 1610 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.110
 it is in this universe that the quartet 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.439
 fantastic also the last spider man 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.479
 month in the most moral and supreme case 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.079
 that the alternative version of the avengers 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.090
 of the 616 universe and served as the 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:56.189
 for the movie theaters 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.710
 these two universes 1 616 in 1610 as well 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.689
 like everyone else there is 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.399
 simultaneously in different planes but 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.780
 we know that this is all of 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.380
 a large injection 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.690
 machine use is kind it tried ws 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.700
 parallel but actually because it 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.830
 was created simply because 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.450
 there was a need for everyone and 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.030
 stories using the characters that 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.310
 We already know but with an assembly 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.350
 more contemporary without having to take 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.150
 consideration of all existing technology 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.250
 in the regular universe 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.230
 It's beauty fair but then you want it all. 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.450
 this has to do with the secret wars 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.489
 What happens outside is that now everyone 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.110
 this universe are merging and will become 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.209
 make only one 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.190
 the responsible for this is the friend jonas 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.080
 like hickmann who has been preparing the 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.300
 land for this lot for more than three 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.410
 years in the pages of avengers and 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.420
 new winners 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.390
 there is another key concept that people 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.459
 if you understand are the incursions in the context 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.830
 of the secret incursion wars is a 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.569
 clash between two parallel universes 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.580
 when this happens through two universes 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.530
 destroyed and the only way to ensure 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.310
 survival of an event of the universe 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.140
 other 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.180
 in history created by the vehicle 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.819
 Avengers create groups to stop 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.620
 but this idea of ​​destroying the 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.470
 universe to ensure the survival 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.170
 of his own moral lion heroes 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.700
 fujiro that divides them in the same way 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.340
 that made the civil war a few years ago 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.829
 after we get to a point where 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.829
 The last two existing universes are 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.170
 singular universe and ultimate universe 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.239
 without going into too much detail what happens 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.549
 It's a terrible crap that we come 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.739
 Here's career are secret and miguel 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:36.390
 which combines with the end of the two universes 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:38.430
 and the creation of the neighborhood for the web as a 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.170
 large patchwork quilt where 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.290
 different realities that exist 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.060
 next to each other in a 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.709
 well-defined territory 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.320
 these territories are called 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.540
 domains and each of these domains is 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.579
 led by Baron and commands the 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.060
 victor rondon's permission 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:59.700
 the lord and messiah of the second halted 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.519
 map released by marra that most seems 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.820
 a board of 6 there are more than 40 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.400
 domains between them hillary that the zone 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.489
 from the man puc planet to his mouth free 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.519
 whether the zone of the apocalypse era or 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.710
 that the civil war zone in 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.500
 2009 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:23.270
 as the delivery name is the zone of the universe 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:26.450
 marvel 2099 from monark paper the area to 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.640
 energy and give me conditions that the 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.460
 of the old logan among others 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.920
 basically a download is as if it were 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.410
 a cd from the bar networks 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.510
 I do not have the slightest idea how it's going 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.000
 be the format of the publication of this saga 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.830
 in Brazil but as shopping malls here in 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.490
 North America for the next four 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.950
 months 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.280
 besides my main series in eight 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:52.010
 parts in which two have already left and more 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.460
 zero emission that came out in the free comic book 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.620
 day 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.150
 we will find three categories of 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.820
 bi being published 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.400
 the first one is if it is water less 10 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.890
 As it already says, the name is about the last ones. 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.410
 days of the marvel universe through the 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.420
 view of some characters such as 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.700
 you do if you knew that this is 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.370
 your last day on earth so we'll have 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.490
 there the last days of the black widow 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.040
 the last days of the last vigilante 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.500
 days of miss marvel among others 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.660
 then we have five hours for the 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.300
 roto whose stories take place and 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.460
 multiple territory of the new planet 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:32.390
 one of the most awaited titles of this 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:35.570
 category is hors extortion type police 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.880
 neighborhood clothes are the bottlenecks of 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.440
 order in bagaga claims another title 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.420
 interesting is the website 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.300
 in this new world as well as in the 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:47.330
 franz there is a wall that has as 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:51.110
 isolate the infested domains from 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:53.600
 zombies and other of the rest of the city 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.970
 the ball then the life on the wall who are 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.130
 the guardians of this wall of sound 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:01.130
 finally a last group of titles is 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.530
 five orders more sounds with stories from 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.020
 individual neighborhood as little games 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.630
 then you will have new plamta stories 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.720
 hulk and the christmas civil war 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.590
 there the gain was the apocalypse only for 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.230
 to name a few 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:18.020
 If you're a little fuckin ' Provence 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:20.750
 Just cool, so I recommend that 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.790
 you read the titles of the sun are simple 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.250
 even new stories within the universe 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.080
 that we already know the titles of the 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.480
 organ is an excellent 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.640
 opportunity for new readers to 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.900
 familiarize with the main sagas of the 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.790
 marvel universe 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.430
 worth remembering that the mark reached 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:39.110
 33 of its irregular titles and that 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.720
 nobody knows yet which new ones 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.340
 securities issued will remain after the 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.720
 end of secret wars 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.490
 the only certainty that we have to 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.350
 lack of money to buy some 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.270
 from the outside that come around 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.280
 so this is personal, I hope you have 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.400
