00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.420
 good afternoon friends welcome you to 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.810
 the channel i am not a carpenter today 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.029
 I want to tell you about the crack repair and one 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.320
 of the ways we apply for 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.570
 fishing rod 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.820
 the fact is that here it happens different 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.770
 an orange crack in the tree in the very 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.779
 there are cracks here by gluing 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.419
 to pieces once the table was a stand 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.210
 smooth fugu he was taken outside to 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.290
 terrace well and he went but ask us and 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.050
 stable 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.730
 how do i patch up similar cracks in 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.130
 this case was decided 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:48.840
 to seal the cracks and that's it 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:51.690
 wedge wedge insert 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.850
 and before you put this bet here 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.890
 in this to be inserted speak immediately from two 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.580
 parties to meet each other 1 and immediately 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.059
 same 2 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:03.320
 I am so plump enough shilov 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:08.010
 specially designed for this i 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:11.550
 Spreading this fiber with an awl I spend 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.820
 several times along this crack along this 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.630
 crack 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.439
 and 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.789
 what does it give fibers are moving apart a 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.789
 after insertion 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:30.250
 This brush will be like to say and 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.030
 smearing glue sliver I egged it 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.910
 you will now see 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.410
 happens that under the action of moisture 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.780
 I spit these 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.870
 crumpled fibers they start 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.900
 straighten up and squeeze this 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.600
 here's the splinter how is happening more 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.820
 tight bonding 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:54.500
 here this two-side insert 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.500
 this is his subscriber 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.060
 Oh 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.060
 without fingers 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.480
 then drink I pick metal 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.000
 hammer 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.920
 because the rubber chamber spring 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.590
 You can sing along with a wooden mallet 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:58.530
 you need to try what it takes to not 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:01.100
 break called sliver 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.500
 the depth of this seam 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.950
 even if there is the will but fossa 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.880
 so that's how feelings and leave in 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.940
 it's all time 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.210
 after the glue is dry enough 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:20.250
 I cut here such cod as I call 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.250
 or here is such a nail file amazing 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.050
 Emily knife shoal 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.370
 above 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.370
 at the base to drop by 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:49.299
 at 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.780
 and after that she speaks a little or 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:54.489
 a little clean up 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.069
 plane trimming turnover nick here 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.970
 so here's a little bit how to clean it well 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.600
 everything must be done neatly 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.660
 gordon proshpaklevat little 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.830
 sanded 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.440
 but 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.660
 or here are at least a bank too 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.569
 I must say that the turnover is nickname 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.419
 I get a little bit 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:19.120
 but here is the result of our labors 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:22.919
 this here this light strip this 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:28.419
 sliver inserted in 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:30.940
 Well, well, I didnâ€™t guess the color 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:35.080
 a little bit but let's talk so this 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:39.699
 table which by the way is 15 years old fifteen 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:43.139
 For years, he, too, has been carrying and already cleared 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:45.669
 from varnish and workout as you see 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.900
 surface and this surface is far from 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:51.460
 uniform in color 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:55.710
 quality so i hope that under 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:58.150
 tinted here these cracks can be seen sometime 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.389
 I must say that seven or eight years ago 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:04.229
 I restored the church door and had to 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:07.180
 since they were non-separable had to 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.910
 panels to restore fileko crack 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.070
 Here in the same way, but they are worth while. 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.680
 the doors are fine for seven years now 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.740
 and one of the doors is on the sun 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.740
 to the side 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:30.650
 you are so strong you undress 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:35.229
