about comic books that to really embrace

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.000

you hope happens in the next season as

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.939 
you hope happens in the next season as
far<00:00:54.539> as<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.930> aspect<00:00:55.410> what<00:00:55.620> would<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.829> like

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
far as that aspect what would you like

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.189 
far as that aspect what would you like
to<00:00:56.070> see<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.370> never<00:00:56.579> happens<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.059> TV<00:00:57.239> but<00:00:57.960> only

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
to see that never happens on TV but only

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.160 
to see that never happens on TV but only
happens<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.559> comic<00:00:58.829> books<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.390> think<00:01:00.390> part<00:01:01.050> of

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
happens in comic books I think part of

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.090 
happens in comic books I think part of
the<00:01:01.410> appeal<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.250> our<00:01:02.940> show<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.840> they<00:01:04.799> come

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
the appeal of our show is that they come

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.890 
the appeal of our show is that they come
up<00:01:05.280> with<00:01:05.430> stuff<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.760> they<00:01:06.270> never<00:01:06.510> even

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
up with stuff that they never even

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.719 
up with stuff that they never even
thought<00:01:07.350> was<00:01:07.650> possible<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.189> know<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.400> mean<00:01:08.610> and

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
thought was possible you know I mean and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.039 
thought was possible you know I mean and
so<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:08.970> ends<00:01:09.150> up<00:01:09.180> being<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.630> sort<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.869> surprise

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
so it ends up being a sort of surprise

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.980 
so it ends up being a sort of surprise
and<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:11.220> know<00:01:11.369> if<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:12.119> think<00:01:12.570> every<00:01:12.810> time<00:01:12.960> I

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
and so you know if I think every time I

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.330 
and so you know if I think every time I
read<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.260> script<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.650> see<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> new<00:01:13.979> villain

read the script and I see a new villain

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.460 
read the script and I see a new villain
and<00:01:14.520> their<00:01:14.700> powers<00:01:15.180> I'm<00:01:15.600> always<00:01:15.869> thinking<00:01:16.140> how

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
and their powers I'm always thinking how

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.380 
and their powers I'm always thinking how
are<00:01:16.619> they<00:01:16.740> going<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.979> manifest<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:18.060> but

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.390 
that's in some ways I think more of an
exciting<00:01:36.960> comic<00:01:37.290> book<00:01:37.439> reveal<00:01:37.710> than<00:01:37.920> anything

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
exciting comic book reveal than anything

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.149 
exciting comic book reveal than anything
in<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.700> first<00:01:38.850> season<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.479> think<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:40.320> agree<00:01:40.860> I

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
in the first season I think I agree I

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.740 
in the first season I think I agree I
think<00:01:41.220> that's<00:01:41.549> why<00:01:41.670> our<00:01:41.700> show<00:01:42.150> does<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.540> well

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
think that's why our show does so well

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.330 
think that's why our show does so well
and<00:01:42.960> andrew<00:01:43.229> said<00:01:43.409> this<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.680> many<00:01:43.710> times<00:01:44.070> we

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
and andrew said this so many times we

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.060 
and andrew said this so many times we
don't<00:01:44.369> save<00:01:44.939> ideas<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:46.110> if<00:01:46.530> there's<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.799> great

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
don't save ideas so if there's a great

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.469 
don't save ideas so if there's a great
idea<00:01:47.399> Andrews<00:01:47.820> like<00:01:47.939> let's<00:01:48.149> put<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:48.450> a

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
idea Andrews like let's put it in a

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.210 
idea Andrews like let's put it in a
script<00:01:48.780> we'll<00:01:48.960> think<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.290> better<00:01:49.439> idea<00:01:49.590> next

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
script we'll think of a better idea next

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.469 
script we'll think of a better idea next
episode<00:01:50.579> because<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.939> see<00:01:51.149> there's<00:01:51.360> no

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
episode because you see there's no

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.520 
episode because you see there's no
reason<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.810> save<00:01:51.960> ideas<00:01:52.259> with<00:01:52.380> this

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
reason to save ideas with this

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.819 
reason to save ideas with this
characters<00:01:52.979> cuz<00:01:53.369> there's<00:01:53.610> unlimited

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
characters cuz there's unlimited

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.569 
characters cuz there's unlimited
possibilities<00:01:55.829> for<00:01:56.070> where<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.280> go<00:01:56.399> with<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
possibilities for where to go with the

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.340 
possibilities for where to go with the
story<00:01:56.729> exactly<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.570> think<00:01:57.899> that's<00:01:58.140> really<00:01:58.259> true

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
story exactly I think that's really true

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.620 
story exactly I think that's really true

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
into flash via arrow I think maybe if

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.440 
into flash via arrow I think maybe if
it's<00:02:45.080> just<00:02:45.380> through<00:02:45.710> Barry<00:02:46.490> at<00:02:46.730> times<00:02:47.060> with

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
it's just through Barry at times with

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.660 
it's just through Barry at times with
the<00:02:47.570> way<00:02:47.690> he's<00:02:48.230> kind<00:02:48.500> of<00:02:48.560> his<00:02:48.890> heroes<00:02:49.280> he's<00:02:49.640> a

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
the way he's kind of his heroes he's a

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.010 
the way he's kind of his heroes he's a
much<00:02:49.850> different<00:02:50.120> hero<00:02:50.300> than<00:02:50.480> he<00:02:50.540> was<00:02:50.720> at<00:02:50.960> the

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
much different hero than he was at the

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.680 
much different hero than he was at the
beginning<00:02:51.140> season<00:02:51.620> 1<00:02:51.860> yeah<00:02:52.190> sure<00:02:52.610> and<00:02:52.940> I<00:02:53.480> think

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
beginning season 1 yeah sure and I think

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.480 
beginning season 1 yeah sure and I think
that<00:02:53.810> was<00:02:53.960> influenced<00:02:54.320> by<00:02:54.380> Oliver<00:02:54.770> some<00:02:55.070> in

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
that was influenced by Oliver some in

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.030 
that was influenced by Oliver some in
some<00:02:55.730> way<00:02:55.940> yeah<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.440> Internet's<00:02:57.740> blowing
