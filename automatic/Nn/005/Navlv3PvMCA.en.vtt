which<00:00:15.630> can<00:00:15.839> convert<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.199> triangulated<00:00:16.770> mesh

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
which can convert a triangulated mesh

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.750 
which can convert a triangulated mesh
into<00:00:17.699> quad<00:00:18.740> you<00:00:19.740> might<00:00:19.920> have<00:00:20.130> seen<00:00:20.340> this

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
into quad you might have seen this

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.939 
into quad you might have seen this
situation<00:00:21.359> at<00:00:21.539> times<00:00:21.810> when<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.500> download

some free 3d object from Internet it
comes<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.830> triangular<00:00:29.340> trade<00:00:29.490> form<00:00:29.849> like<00:00:30.810> I

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
comes in triangular trade form like I

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.740 
comes in triangular trade form like I
have<00:00:31.740> downloaded<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.610> fish<00:00:33.090> model<00:00:33.480> from

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
have downloaded this fish model from

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.090 
have downloaded this fish model from
knit<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:35.570> let's<00:00:36.570> see<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:37.070> wireframe<00:00:38.070> view

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
knit and let's see it's wireframe view

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.750 
knit and let's see it's wireframe view
and<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.270> see<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:40.440> has<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> trial<00:00:41.370> little

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
and you can see it has a trial little

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.380 
and you can see it has a trial little
pieces<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.950> the<00:00:43.950> writer<00:00:44.160> feel<00:00:44.670> some<00:00:44.879> problems

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
pieces and the writer feel some problems

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.720 
pieces and the writer feel some problems
while<00:00:45.660> working<00:00:45.899> with<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.530> such<00:00:47.070> triangulated

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
while working with the such triangulated

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.729 
while working with the such triangulated
meshes<00:00:48.620> it<00:00:49.620> may<00:00:49.829> give<00:00:50.010> your<00:00:50.550> problems<00:00:51.239> while

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
meshes it may give your problems while

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.360 
meshes it may give your problems while
ragging<00:00:52.739> skinning<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.000> animation<00:00:55.190> you<00:00:56.190> might

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
ragging skinning and animation you might

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.630 
ragging skinning and animation you might
not<00:00:56.550> get<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.030> smoothness<00:00:57.629> also<00:00:58.340> but<00:00:59.340> here<00:00:59.520> is

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
not get it smoothness also but here is

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.750 
not get it smoothness also but here is
the<00:00:59.789> solution<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.570> problem<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:02.129> found

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
the solution to this problem and I found

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.899 
the solution to this problem and I found
a<00:01:03.059> very<00:01:03.510> useful<00:01:03.840> script<00:01:04.500> on<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> script<00:01:05.100> spot

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
a very useful script on a script spot

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.260 
a very useful script on a script spot
calm<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:07.890> name<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.400> strip<00:01:08.790> is

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.710 

quadrangle<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:14.250> download<00:01:14.760> URL<00:01:15.119> has<00:01:15.540> been

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
quadrangle it the download URL has been

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.740 
quadrangle it the download URL has been
given<00:01:15.990> here<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.229> just<00:01:16.830> click<00:01:17.610> on<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.119> save

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
given here so just click on it to save

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.280 
given here so just click on it to save
the<00:01:18.930> script

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
the script

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.530 
the script
so<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> strip<00:01:23.160> and<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.880> comes<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.330> am

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
so this is the strip and it comes in am

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.010 
so this is the strip and it comes in am
JP<00:01:25.230> form<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.790> can<00:01:27.030> easily<00:01:27.270> open<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.810> with

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
again now the first thing you will see

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.230 
again now the first thing you will see
that<00:02:07.540> the<00:02:08.540> standoff<00:02:08.960> triangulated<00:02:10.240> meshes

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
that the standoff triangulated meshes

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.150 
that the standoff triangulated meshes
come<00:02:11.480> an<00:02:11.990> editable<00:02:12.950> mesh<00:02:13.250> for<00:02:13.730> MIT<00:02:14.170> so<00:02:15.170> first

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
come an editable mesh for MIT so first

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.320 
come an editable mesh for MIT so first
of<00:02:16.310> all<00:02:16.459> convert<00:02:16.970> it<00:02:17.120> into<00:02:17.300> editable<00:02:17.810> poly

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330

quadrangle it dot IMS a script and just

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.900 
quadrangle it dot IMS a script and just
after<00:02:34.570> that<00:02:34.780> you'll<00:02:35.260> see<00:02:35.680> your<00:02:35.920> triangulated

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
after that you'll see your triangulated

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.660 
after that you'll see your triangulated
mesh<00:02:36.970> converts<00:02:37.690> into<00:02:37.960> quad<00:02:38.290> all<00:02:39.220> the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
mesh converts into quad all the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.300 
mesh converts into quad all the
triangles<00:02:40.180> become<00:02:40.630> caught<00:02:40.900> it's<00:02:41.800> truly

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
triangles become caught it's truly

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.350 
triangles become caught it's truly
awesome<00:02:43.140> just<00:02:44.140> like<00:02:44.350> this<00:02:44.820> click<00:02:45.820> this<00:02:46.000> pin

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
awesome just like this click this pin

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.730 
awesome just like this click this pin
and<00:02:46.950> run<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.070> script<00:02:48.220> once<00:02:48.700> again<00:02:49.000> and

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
and run the script once again and

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.790 
and run the script once again and
triangles<00:02:50.740> become<00:02:51.100> caught<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:53.470> now<00:02:53.590> just

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
triangles become caught so now just

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:01.950 
triangles become caught so now just
select<00:02:54.040> all<00:02:54.340> other<00:02:54.880> parts<00:02:55.270> and<00:03:00.840> run<00:03:01.840> the
