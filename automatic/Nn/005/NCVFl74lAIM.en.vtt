a lot in there they're really a fine
powdered<00:01:06.240> pigments<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.290> little<00:01:07.560> bit<00:01:07.770> goes<00:01:07.920> a

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
powdered pigments so a little bit goes a

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.340 
powdered pigments so a little bit goes a
long<00:01:08.250> way<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.729> then<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.140> lid

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
long way and then this is so this lid

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.830 
long way and then this is so this lid
comes<00:01:10.650> off<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.189> then<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.210> closed<00:01:12.570> as

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
comes off and then that is closed as

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.660 
comes off and then that is closed as
well<00:01:13.580> so<00:01:15.110> you<00:01:16.110> just<00:01:16.140> flip<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.100> open<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:19.670> then

well so you just flip this open and then

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.480 
well so you just flip this open and then
you<00:01:21.119> can<00:01:21.479> dispense<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:22.049> into<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> lid<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.280> what

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
back a little bit because with the

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.129 
back a little bit because with the
powder<00:03:41.239> consistency<00:03:42.239> at<00:03:42.359> least<00:03:42.540> until<00:03:42.870> I<00:03:42.989> get

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
powder consistency at least until I get

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.229 
powder consistency at least until I get
the<00:03:43.259> hang<00:03:43.379> of<00:03:43.530> it<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:44.639> just<00:03:44.819> kept<00:03:45.030> me<00:03:45.120> from

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
the hang of it it just kept me from

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.809 
the hang of it it just kept me from
getting<00:03:45.419> too<00:03:45.720> messy<00:03:46.019> so<00:03:46.409> that's<00:03:47.250> kind<00:03:47.609> of<00:03:47.669> the

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
getting too messy so that's kind of the

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.089 
getting too messy so that's kind of the
heads<00:03:48.030> up<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.299> would<00:03:48.449> give<00:03:48.599> you<00:03:48.750> on<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:49.199> but
