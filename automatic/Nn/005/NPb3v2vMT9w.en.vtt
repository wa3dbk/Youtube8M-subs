00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
it's really the video not really the

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.159 
it's really the video not really the
audio<00:03:18.200> because<00:03:18.440> i<00:03:18.650> won't<00:03:18.799> be<00:03:18.950> mentioning<00:03:19.370> much

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
audio because i won't be mentioning much

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:28.390 
audio because i won't be mentioning much
stuff<00:03:21.169> like<00:03:21.349> that<00:03:21.380> and<00:03:25.120> yeah<00:03:26.120> so<00:03:27.160> if<00:03:28.160> you're

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
stuff like that and yeah so if you're

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.210 
stuff like that and yeah so if you're
watching<00:03:28.819> this<00:03:29.060> video<00:03:29.359> you<00:03:29.859> obviously<00:03:30.859> know

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
watching this video you obviously know

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.250 
watching this video you obviously know
about<00:03:31.489> my<00:03:31.639> channel<00:03:32.440> so<00:03:34.510> check<00:03:35.510> it<00:03:35.540> out<00:03:35.750> it's

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
about my channel so check it out it's

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.460 
about my channel so check it out it's
pretty<00:03:36.680> cool<00:03:36.980> in<00:03:37.250> my<00:03:37.519> opinion<00:03:37.730> but<00:03:38.379> you<00:03:39.379> know

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
pretty cool in my opinion but you know

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.559 
pretty cool in my opinion but you know
just<00:03:39.680> check<00:03:39.919> it<00:03:40.040> out<00:03:40.160> I've<00:03:40.459> got<00:03:40.699> like<00:03:40.879> as<00:03:41.299> I'm

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
just check it out I've got like as I'm

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.759 
just check it out I've got like as I'm
making<00:03:41.690> this<00:03:41.959> I<00:03:42.109> have<00:03:42.230> 70<00:03:42.680> ish<00:03:43.480> subscribers<00:03:44.480> I

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
making this I have 70 ish subscribers I

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.740 
making this I have 70 ish subscribers I
think<00:03:45.769> it's<00:03:45.889> suddenly<00:03:46.160> exactly<00:03:46.639> if<00:03:47.269> no<00:03:47.510> one<00:03:47.629> on

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
think it's suddenly exactly if no one on

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.030 
think it's suddenly exactly if no one on
subscribe<00:03:48.230> or<00:03:48.530> subscribe<00:03:49.269> but<00:03:50.269> yeah<00:03:50.889> so<00:03:51.889> I'm

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
subscribe or subscribe but yeah so I'm

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.770 
subscribe or subscribe but yeah so I'm
filming<00:03:52.280> mrs.<00:03:52.669> audio<00:03:53.000> so<00:03:53.269> there's<00:03:53.449> probably

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
filming mrs. audio so there's probably

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.530 
filming mrs. audio so there's probably
going<00:03:53.930> to<00:03:53.989> be<00:03:54.049> lag<00:03:54.319> or<00:03:54.650> something<00:03:54.949> like<00:03:55.069> that

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
going to be lag or something like that

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.119 
going to be lag or something like that
so<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:57.049> audio<00:03:57.349> is<00:03:57.410> probably<00:03:57.739> going<00:03:57.889> to<00:03:57.949> cut

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
so the audio is probably going to cut

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:00.909 
so the audio is probably going to cut
off<00:03:58.160> early<00:03:58.609> from<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:58.879> video<00:03:59.150> to<00:03:59.930> that<00:04:00.620> that

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
off early from the video to that that

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:07.770 
off early from the video to that that
could<00:04:01.160> happen<00:04:01.989> so

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.530 

just<00:04:08.780> fighting<00:04:09.170> we're<00:04:09.350> getting<00:04:09.560> to<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:09.710> point

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
just fighting we're getting to the point

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.110 
just fighting we're getting to the point
around<00:04:11.540> this<00:04:12.080> point<00:04:12.470> just<00:04:13.400> in<00:04:13.580> a<00:04:13.670> bit<00:04:13.880> we're

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
around this point just in a bit we're

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.990 
around this point just in a bit we're
going<00:04:14.210> to<00:04:14.300> be<00:04:14.420> starting<00:04:14.870> to<00:04:15.020> fight<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.410> boss

my lego batman walkthrough because a lot

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.250 
my lego batman walkthrough because a lot
of<00:04:38.450> work<00:04:38.660> is<00:04:38.870> going<00:04:39.140> into<00:04:39.440> it<00:04:39.590> and<00:04:41.080> stuff<00:04:42.080> like

of work is going into it and stuff like

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.070 
of work is going into it and stuff like
that<00:04:42.670> so<00:04:44.950> it's<00:04:46.030> hmm<00:04:47.030> a<00:04:47.210> lot<00:04:47.450> of<00:04:47.480> these<00:04:47.690> levels<00:04:47.870> i

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
that so it's hmm a lot of these levels i

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.000 
that so it's hmm a lot of these levels i
figured<00:04:48.410> out<00:04:48.500> by<00:04:48.650> myself<00:04:49.000> really<00:04:50.000> a<00:04:50.150> lot<00:04:50.390> I

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
figured out by myself really a lot I

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.710 
figured out by myself really a lot I
already<00:04:52.010> beat<00:04:52.370> it<00:04:52.550> I<00:04:52.790> already<00:04:53.150> beat<00:04:53.330> the<00:04:53.390> game

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
already beat it I already beat the game

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.470 
already beat it I already beat the game
but<00:04:53.960> then<00:04:54.800> I<00:04:54.920> tried<00:04:55.160> it<00:04:55.280> again<00:04:55.370> on<00:04:55.670> a<00:04:55.700> ps2

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
but then I tried it again on a ps2

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.540 
but then I tried it again on a ps2
because<00:04:56.870> I<00:04:57.170> had<00:04:57.710> it<00:04:57.830> for<00:04:57.980> a<00:04:58.010> wee<00:04:58.130> bit<00:04:58.280> and<00:04:58.490> i

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
because I had it for a wee bit and i

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.700 
because I had it for a wee bit and i
sold<00:04:58.820> it<00:04:58.910> because<00:04:59.060> I<00:04:59.330> beat<00:04:59.480> it<00:04:59.630> and<00:04:59.900> I<00:05:00.050> had<00:05:00.620> it

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
sold it because I beat it and I had it

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.100 
sold it because I beat it and I had it
on<00:05:00.770> to<00:05:00.980> game<00:05:01.160> systems<00:05:01.610> so<00:05:01.940> and<00:05:02.270> a<00:05:02.630> we<00:05:02.780> want<00:05:02.990> is

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
on to game systems so and a we want is

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.100 
on to game systems so and a we want is
obviously<00:05:03.580> more<00:05:04.580> valuable<00:05:05.000> than<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.390> ps2<00:05:05.930> one

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
obviously more valuable than the ps2 one

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.290 
obviously more valuable than the ps2 one
so<00:05:06.950> I<00:05:06.980> thought<00:05:07.370> why<00:05:07.880> not<00:05:09.100> so<00:05:10.100> I'm<00:05:10.850> doing<00:05:11.210> this

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
so I thought why not so I'm doing this

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.180 
so I thought why not so I'm doing this
on<00:05:11.510> ps2<00:05:11.750> but<00:05:12.200> my<00:05:12.890> friend<00:05:13.160> as<00:05:13.370> we<00:05:14.000> so<00:05:14.930> and<00:05:15.260> here

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
on ps2 but my friend as we so and here

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.470 
on ps2 but my friend as we so and here
we're<00:05:16.340> going<00:05:16.430> to<00:05:16.550> get<00:05:16.640> to<00:05:16.790> the<00:05:16.880> boss<00:05:17.060> battle

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
we're going to get to the boss battle

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.400 
we're going to get to the boss battle
and<00:05:17.919> just<00:05:18.919> starting<00:05:19.600> sorry<00:05:20.600> again<00:05:20.960> because

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
and just starting sorry again because

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.320 
and just starting sorry again because
that<00:05:21.620> will<00:05:21.800> probably<00:05:22.100> lag<00:05:22.610> and<00:05:25.090> head<00:05:26.090> to<00:05:26.300> the

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
that will probably lag and head to the

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.950 
that will probably lag and head to the
boss<00:05:26.570> battle<00:05:27.050> it's<00:05:27.260> pretty<00:05:28.220> easy<00:05:28.960> because

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
boss battle it's pretty easy because
