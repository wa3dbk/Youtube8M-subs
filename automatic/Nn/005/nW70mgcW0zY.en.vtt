and<00:02:47.959> you're<00:02:48.230> scared<00:02:48.709> and<00:02:49.010> you're<00:02:49.069> so<00:02:49.720> worried

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
and you're scared and you're so worried

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.569 
and you're scared and you're so worried
of<00:02:50.959> what<00:02:51.200> people<00:02:51.530> are<00:02:51.620> gonna<00:02:51.739> think<00:02:51.829> and<00:02:52.250> how

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
of what people are gonna think and how

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.370 
of what people are gonna think and how
you're<00:02:53.000> gonna<00:02:53.060> do<00:02:53.420> at<00:02:53.599> it<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:53.959> that's<00:02:54.170> when

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
you're gonna do at it and that's when

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.710 
you're gonna do at it and that's when
you<00:02:54.470> got<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.739> best<00:02:54.920> response<00:02:55.280> even<00:02:55.459> if<00:02:55.609> you

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
you got the best response even if you

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.599 
you got the best response even if you
don't<00:02:56.720> worth<00:02:56.870> you<00:02:57.079> absolutely<00:02:58.040> because<00:02:58.370> the

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
don't worth you absolutely because the

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.039 
don't worth you absolutely because the
universe<00:02:59.030> is<00:02:59.150> saying<00:02:59.359> you<00:02:59.510> know<00:02:59.630> what<00:02:59.780> you've

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
universe is saying you know what you've

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.900 
universe is saying you know what you've
hidden<00:03:00.500> for<00:03:00.829> two<00:03:00.920> years<00:03:01.220> that's<00:03:01.459> right<00:03:01.639> and<00:03:01.849> I

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
hidden for two years that's right and I

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.849 
hidden for two years that's right and I
was<00:03:02.030> a<00:03:02.060> kid<00:03:02.299> nothing<00:03:02.840> was<00:03:02.989> ever<00:03:03.019> handed<00:03:03.620> to<00:03:03.769> me

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
was a kid nothing was ever handed to me

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:05.680 
was a kid nothing was ever handed to me
I'd<00:03:03.980> worked<00:03:04.280> so<00:03:04.370> hard<00:03:04.609> I<00:03:05.150> always<00:03:05.359> had<00:03:05.480> to<00:03:05.569> work

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
I'd worked so hard I always had to work

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.150 
I'd worked so hard I always had to work
harder<00:03:06.019> than<00:03:06.139> my<00:03:06.230> classmates<00:03:06.739> because<00:03:06.980> I<00:03:07.010> was

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
harder than my classmates because I was

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.210 
harder than my classmates because I was
younger<00:03:07.489> that's<00:03:07.849> something<00:03:08.299> that<00:03:08.569> I<00:03:09.220> still

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
younger that's something that I still

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.979 
younger that's something that I still
see<00:03:10.519> and<00:03:10.760> a<00:03:10.790> lot<00:03:10.970> of<00:03:11.000> people<00:03:11.389> I<00:03:11.480> see<00:03:11.660> that<00:03:11.840> they

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
see and a lot of people I see that they

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.140 
see and a lot of people I see that they
were<00:03:12.590> never<00:03:12.769> taught<00:03:13.040> to<00:03:13.069> work<00:03:13.459> really<00:03:13.849> hard

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
were never taught to work really hard

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.420 
were never taught to work really hard
and<00:03:14.510> I<00:03:14.630> think<00:03:14.690> that<00:03:14.989> too<00:03:15.260> many<00:03:15.380> people<00:03:15.500> grow<00:03:16.400> up

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
and I think that too many people grow up

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.099 
and I think that too many people grow up
counting<00:03:16.880> on<00:03:17.000> things<00:03:17.239> to<00:03:17.450> be<00:03:17.540> handed<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:17.989> them

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
counting on things to be handed to them

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:19.659 
counting on things to be handed to them
or<00:03:18.349> to<00:03:18.470> be<00:03:18.560> given<00:03:18.950> we<00:03:19.160> just<00:03:19.400> finished

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:19.669 
or to be given we just finished

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.580 
or to be given we just finished

a lot of Michael Bay films he has this
interesting<00:03:30.290> method<00:03:30.829> where<00:03:31.069> for<00:03:31.489> like<00:03:31.639> a<00:03:31.790> year

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
interesting method where for like a year

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.509 
interesting method where for like a year
at<00:03:32.329> a<00:03:32.419> time<00:03:32.660> he<00:03:33.380> meets<00:03:33.739> with<00:03:33.829> his<00:03:33.980> actors<00:03:34.280> and

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
at a time he meets with his actors and

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.069 
at a time he meets with his actors and
creates<00:03:34.880> these<00:03:35.030> characters<00:03:35.569> from<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.810> ground

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
creates these characters from the ground

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:37.839 
creates these characters from the ground
that<00:03:36.349> happened<00:03:36.709> so<00:03:36.919> we<00:03:37.069> basically<00:03:37.370> did<00:03:37.669> that

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
that happened so we basically did that

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:38.790 
that happened so we basically did that
but<00:03:38.030> in<00:03:38.120> like<00:03:38.389> a

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
but in like a

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.980 
but in like a
the<00:03:38.950> time<00:03:39.160> so<00:03:39.430> for<00:03:39.550> three<00:03:39.790> months<00:03:40.270> we<00:03:40.780> have

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
the time so for three months we have

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.380 
the time so for three months we have
non-stop<00:03:41.500> rehearsals<00:03:42.370> and<00:03:42.730> we<00:03:42.880> created<00:03:43.270> these

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
non-stop rehearsals and we created these

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.600 
non-stop rehearsals and we created these
characters<00:03:43.960> and<00:03:44.320> we<00:03:44.800> just<00:03:45.010> I<00:03:45.160> mean<00:03:45.310> these<00:03:45.430> are

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
characters and we just I mean these are

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.550 
characters and we just I mean these are
like<00:03:45.760> three<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:46.300> four<00:03:46.480> hour<00:03:46.660> ourselves<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:47.500> we

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
like three to four hour ourselves and we

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.470 
like three to four hour ourselves and we
have<00:03:47.650> like<00:03:47.800> four<00:03:48.100> of<00:03:48.190> them<00:03:48.400> a<00:03:48.430> week<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:48.970> we

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
have like four of them a week and we

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.610 
have like four of them a week and we
would<00:03:49.630> just<00:03:49.660> create<00:03:50.020> these<00:03:50.080> characters<00:03:50.290> and

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
would just create these characters and

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.930 
would just create these characters and
that<00:03:50.740> eventually<00:03:50.980> we<00:03:51.310> introduce<00:03:51.760> the

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
that eventually we introduce the

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.760 
that eventually we introduce the
characters<00:03:52.390> and<00:03:52.750> then<00:03:52.870> do<00:03:53.020> that<00:03:53.230> created<00:03:53.680> a

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
characters and then do that created a

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.830 
characters and then do that created a
story<00:03:54.070> I<00:03:54.400> feel<00:03:54.700> like<00:03:54.820> having<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.300> luxury<00:03:55.630> to

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
story I feel like having the luxury to

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.710 
story I feel like having the luxury to
spend<00:03:56.140> time<00:03:56.410> by<00:03:56.470> yourself<00:03:57.010> is<00:03:57.190> amazing<00:03:57.760> and<00:03:58.630> I

spend time by yourself is amazing and I

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.790 
spend time by yourself is amazing and I
don't<00:03:58.780> take<00:03:59.140> that<00:03:59.260> for<00:03:59.320> granted

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
don't take that for granted

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.340 
don't take that for granted
