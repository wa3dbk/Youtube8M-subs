00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.779 
scene and na it's been played a few
times<00:02:00.420> fiddle<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.319> really<00:02:01.739> good<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.099> plan<00:02:02.429> as<00:02:02.759> a

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
times fiddle is really good I plan as a

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.389 
times fiddle is really good I plan as a
port<00:02:03.149> often<00:02:03.840> just<00:02:04.140> not<00:02:04.319> in<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.500> LCS<00:02:04.890> FN<00:02:05.310> him

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
port often just not in that LCS FN him

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.699 
port often just not in that LCS FN him
yet<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:05.969> fears<00:02:06.420> like<00:02:06.630> three<00:02:07.110> seconds<00:02:07.560> I'm

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
yet this fears like three seconds I'm

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:10.580 
yet this fears like three seconds I'm
mag<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.310> retarded<00:02:08.549> and<00:02:08.910> um<00:02:09.630> this<00:02:10.079> silence

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
mag so it's retarded and um this silence

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.680 
mag so it's retarded and um this silence
bounces<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.370> can<00:02:11.730> potentially<00:02:12.209> get<00:02:12.480> like

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
bounces so you can potentially get like

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.930 
bounces so you can potentially get like
multiple<00:02:13.470> bounces<00:02:13.920> will<00:02:14.220> like<00:02:14.549> stacking

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
multiple bounces will like stacking

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.210 
multiple bounces will like stacking
silences<00:02:15.900> on<00:02:16.049> the<00:02:16.140> AP<00:02:16.349> carry<00:02:16.590> which<00:02:16.769> is<00:02:16.920> huge

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
silences on the AP carry which is huge

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.430 
silences on the AP carry which is huge
so<00:02:17.519> it's<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.150> really<00:02:18.360> good<00:02:18.510> support<00:02:18.989> I<00:02:19.170> was

to be in Percy has a lot more followers
than<00:03:07.709> me<00:03:07.889> I<00:03:08.010> just<00:03:08.280> came<00:03:08.430> into<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:08.700> scene

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
than me I just came into the scene

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.290 
than me I just came into the scene
so<00:03:10.710> it<00:03:10.770> was<00:03:10.890> expected<00:03:11.430> he's<00:03:11.640> a<00:03:11.670> good<00:03:11.880> support

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
so it was expected he's a good support

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.880 
so it was expected he's a good support
he<00:03:12.510> does<00:03:12.690> he<00:03:12.990> definitely<00:03:13.290> has<00:03:13.530> international
