00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:08.590
 Rich as the clinical ketchup uc san 

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:08.590
 carlos de apoquindo 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.840
 pizzi for many the best cuisine of the 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:19.360
 world 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.360
 tortillas tie rosa number 1 in Mexico 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.890
 and fight up to breast 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.619
 we present 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.560
 so many tapas doors 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.090
 How are you doing? I'm Esther Carlos. 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.950
 member that I invite you to bring what 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.690
 possible today we are going to make soups 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.400
 because it is raining suddenly the 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.809
 climate in our country is finally a 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.820
 little more rainy than better than eating 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.390
 a rich soup but they know that from 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.390
 cauliflower looks 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.750
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.430
 explain the leek as thin as possible and 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.600
 remember that to know that a dog 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.489
 it's good we've started it and in the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.770
 half but you have to be flexible and 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.720
 as they are fixed are all the leaves and 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.460
 perfect and does not have the middle stem 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.299
 when they have gone up they are a little 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.940
 old an excellent flavor to the soup and what 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.270
 We are going to sauté but cut as I said 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.190
 very much then what are we going to do to put a 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.530
 frying pan with anti-stickness put a 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.670
 shock with good olive oil and 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.360
 add the chopped leek 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.340
 add pepper 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.659
 the vegetable broth 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.299
 a little chopped green chili 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.840
 we continue to alter then we add 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.840
 milk then 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.259
 and it's going to be right here where we're going to 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.790
 put to cook the cauliflower we make 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.600
 with cauliflower the important thing is that 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.579
 have an even size and that is not with 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.130
 different colors does not arise by any 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:00.500
 part they fix is ​​pretty pretty 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.659
 couple we are going to cut it into sizes 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.220
 regular you know that there are more 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.030
 of 3,000 different varieties of 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.369
 cauliflower and broccoli is one of them what 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.019
 we put here to cook then if the 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.519
 nutritional properties that the 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.709
 cauliflower are really spectacular 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.470
 because they take away properties 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.819
 anticancer in addition to being rich in 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.829
 vitamin C 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.319
 let's make to accompany this soup 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:26.239
 of cauliflower some eggs so that those who 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.400
 they want so a little curve 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.989
 inside and I have this hen more 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.639
 little one here that gets a little 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.639
 water and put the eggs on top 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.180
 we cover and when 100% of the 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.210
 water this is cut because it has a 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.180
 thermostat and eggs are turning off the 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.540
 fire and now I'm going to bring this pot that 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.790
 that is not so high 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.120
 we can read quietly the 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.120
 cauliflowers 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.959
 let's leave there then to fire very 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.940
 Slowly continue to cook a 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.000
 little bit more the flower and now I'm going to see 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.170
 how the eggs go we cover them I want 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.540
 show them how they are percent because 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.120
 the idea is that the yolk that does not so cook 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:23.129
 we take them out then we put them there in 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.129
 the water I will serve the soup then 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.220
 but my means more or less a portion 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.430
 so now I can manipulate the 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.380
 eggs because the shell would be 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.310
 split them in half and you can split 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.310
 then the 2 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.350
 take them out by spoon 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.650
 then we put the limit to the clear 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:53.020
 well so that a little bit higher and the 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.020
 game is seen from the surface 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:02.890
 we put a bit of sure a little touch 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:05.280
 of cream in low calories a little bit of 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.920
 and now that you have to be obviously 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.660
 Try an easy soup to make rich in 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.660
 nutrients that I see here in Carlos III 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.349
 get you hellmann's healthy as the tomato 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:35.129
 Rich as the clinical ketchup uc san 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:35.129
 carlos de apoquindo 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.400
 auschwitz and for many the best cuisine 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:46.190

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.130
 we present 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.650
 extraction here says clarito low in 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:04.730
 glycemic index calculates and naturally 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.740
 low and a great advice but I'm just 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.080
 the same paste of certain 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.720
 his lucchetti pastas always come 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.240
 with seal pro alone since they are low 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.750
 glycemic index and naturally low in 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.940

 lucchetti are low glycemic index 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.320
