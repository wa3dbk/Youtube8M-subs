play the best match of the tournament or

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.620 
play the best match of the tournament or
else<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:16.080> was<00:00:16.260> going<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.529> be<00:00:16.680> out<00:00:17.000> you<00:00:18.000> know<00:00:18.600> I

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
else I was going to be out you know I

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.679 
else I was going to be out you know I
think<00:00:19.050> she<00:00:20.039> just<00:00:20.070> was<00:00:20.939> just<00:00:21.119> hitting<00:00:21.270> winners

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
think she just was just hitting winners

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.529 
think she just was just hitting winners
like<00:00:22.410> left<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.890> right<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.400> every<00:00:24.090> shot<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.300> hit

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
like left and right and every shot I hit

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.750 
like left and right and every shot I hit
you<00:00:24.689> just<00:00:24.869> basically<00:00:25.019> hit<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.470> winner<00:00:25.769> on<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:26.460> I

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
you just basically hit a winner on so I

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.419 
you just basically hit a winner on so I
had<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.359> change<00:00:27.779> my<00:00:28.529> approach<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:29.130> was<00:00:29.220> hitting

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
had to change my approach I was hitting

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:38.060 
had to change my approach I was hitting
a<00:00:29.519> little<00:00:30.000> bit<00:00:30.090> too<00:00:30.269> much<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.720> her<00:00:36.980> when<00:00:37.980> that

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
a little bit too much to her when that

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.910 
a little bit too much to her when that
happens<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.270> conscious<00:00:39.870> thing<00:00:40.230> do<00:00:40.860> you

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
happens is it a conscious thing do you

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.190 
happens is it a conscious thing do you
know<00:00:41.040> where<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.250> comes<00:00:41.399> from

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
know where that comes from

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.540
