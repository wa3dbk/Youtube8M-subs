00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
friendzone offer a real drink so the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.470 
friendzone offer a real drink so the
idea<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.100> you're<00:00:38.399> getting<00:00:38.489> her<00:00:38.760> more<00:00:39.030> drunk

idea is you're getting her more drunk
and<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.879> implies<00:00:42.110> you<00:00:43.110> know<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.620> she

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
and that is implies you know that she

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.310 
and that is implies you know that she
behavior<00:00:44.820> she<00:00:45.210> won't<00:00:45.360> be<00:00:45.450> coherent<00:00:45.750> enough<00:00:46.110> to

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
behavior she won't be coherent enough to

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.080 
behavior she won't be coherent enough to

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
a real drink so yeah actually when I

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.120 
a real drink so yeah actually when I
first<00:01:09.720> read<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.260> ad<00:01:10.380> that's<00:01:10.680> what<00:01:10.979> I

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
first read the ad that's what I

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.539 
first read the ad that's what I
initially<00:01:11.820> thought<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.590> so<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.250> thing<00:01:14.430> is

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
initially thought of so it the thing is

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.100 
initially thought of so it the thing is
it<00:01:14.700> could<00:01:14.820> be<00:01:14.939> interpreted<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.630> both<00:01:15.840> ways

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
it could be interpreted in both ways

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.960 
it could be interpreted in both ways
which<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.590> why<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.890> company<00:01:17.189> decided<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.790> let

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
which is why the company decided to let

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.060 
which is why the company decided to let
GG<00:01:18.180> take<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.990> down<00:01:19.259> yeah<00:01:19.409> look<00:01:19.799> they<00:01:19.920> got

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
GG take that down yeah look they got

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.350 
GG take that down yeah look they got
heat<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:20.759> they're<00:01:20.880> gonna<00:01:20.970> take<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.180> down

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
heat for so they're gonna take it down

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.640 
heat for so they're gonna take it down
immediately<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.900> doesn't<00:01:22.140> matter<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.470> but

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
immediately it doesn't matter so but

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.950 
immediately it doesn't matter so but
what's<00:01:23.130> your<00:01:23.310> take<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.759> let's<00:01:23.970> assume<00:01:24.450> that

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
what's your take on it let's assume that

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.770 
what's your take on it let's assume that
it<00:01:25.500> meant<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:26.040> pyre<00:01:26.310> by<00:01:26.820> her<00:01:27.000> strong<00:01:27.390> drink

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
it meant like pyre by her strong drink

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.060 
it meant like pyre by her strong drink
does<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.560> lean<00:01:28.920> towards<00:01:29.549> suggesting<00:01:30.180> rape

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
does that lean towards suggesting rape

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.399 
does that lean towards suggesting rape
if<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.340> if<00:01:32.610> they<00:01:32.850> are<00:01:33.090> specifically<00:01:34.020> saying

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
if it's if they are specifically saying

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.069 
if it's if they are specifically saying
buy<00:01:34.770> her<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> strong<00:01:35.520> drink<00:01:36.000> then<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.570> think<00:01:36.960> that

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
buy her a strong drink then I think that

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.840 
buy her a strong drink then I think that
it<00:01:37.170> could<00:01:37.290> be<00:01:37.350> suggestive<00:01:38.009> definitely<00:01:38.579> yeah

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
it could be suggestive definitely yeah

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.730 
it could be suggestive definitely yeah
no<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.150> don't<00:01:39.420> agree<00:01:39.570> with<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.840> at<00:01:39.990> all<00:01:40.110> Matt

looks okay look I think maybe realistic

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.830

so<00:01:43.560> look<00:01:43.710> here's<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.220> thing<00:01:44.310> right<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.090> if<00:01:45.420> you

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
so look here's the thing right so if you

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.069 
so look here's the thing right so if you
if<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.170> woman<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:47.420> incapacitated<00:01:48.420> or<00:01:48.720> well

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
if a woman is incapacitated or well

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.530 
if a woman is incapacitated or well
anywhere<00:01:49.470> near<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.090> go<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.420> that

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
anywhere near it and you go in that

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.910 
anywhere near it and you go in that
direction<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.960> don't<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.320> real<00:01:52.470> consent

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
direction you don't have real consent

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.920 
direction you don't have real consent
everybody<00:01:53.340> agrees<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:53.880> rape<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.270> totally<00:01:54.899> a

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
everybody agrees it's rape and totally a

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.539 
everybody agrees it's rape and totally a
million<00:01:55.320> percent<00:01:55.470> unacceptable<00:01:56.280> that's

million percent unacceptable that's

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.179 
million percent unacceptable that's
obvious<00:01:57.210> right<00:01:57.409> but<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.590> flipside<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:59.040> that

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
obvious right but the flipside to that

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.010 
obvious right but the flipside to that
is<00:01:59.520> it's<00:01:59.880> not<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> really<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.360> flipside<00:02:00.630> it's

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
is it's not a really a flipside it's

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.910 
is it's not a really a flipside it's
everything<00:02:01.530> but<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.250> doesn't<00:02:02.850> mean<00:02:03.030> that
