00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.479 

yeah<00:03:31.569> there's<00:03:32.080> got<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.319> be<00:03:32.349> a<00:03:32.409> better<00:03:32.500> easier

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
yeah there's got to be a better easier

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.880 
yeah there's got to be a better easier
way<00:03:33.790> something<00:03:34.540> that<00:03:34.659> one<00:03:34.870> guy

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:04:03.869 

since<00:03:38.890> you<00:03:39.010> take

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:14.559 

survival

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:20.729 

this<00:04:15.109> is<00:04:15.260> going<00:04:15.409> to<00:04:15.499> work

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.570 

so<00:04:21.400> I<00:04:21.669> had<00:04:21.970> some<00:04:22.690> comb<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:23.349> was<00:04:23.830> flicking<00:04:24.190> some

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
so I had some comb and was flicking some

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.150 
so I had some comb and was flicking some
B's<00:04:24.759> off<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.240> rushing<00:04:25.690> into<00:04:25.840> the<00:04:26.289> top<00:04:26.650> bar<00:04:29.160> and

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
B's off the rushing into the top bar and

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.360 
B's off the rushing into the top bar and
I<00:04:30.940> noticed<00:04:31.930> a<00:04:32.050> few<00:04:32.380> of<00:04:32.530> them<00:04:32.680> not<00:04:32.860> many<00:04:33.160> but

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
I noticed a few of them not many but

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.740 
I noticed a few of them not many but
just<00:04:33.580> a<00:04:33.639> few<00:04:33.669> of<00:04:33.910> them<00:04:34.060> were<00:04:34.150> doing<00:04:34.240> Fanning

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
just a few of them were doing Fanning

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.260 
just a few of them were doing Fanning
behavior<00:04:35.199> which<00:04:35.800> is<00:04:35.979> a<00:04:36.009> sort<00:04:36.729> of<00:04:36.849> little<00:04:37.030> way

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
behavior which is a sort of little way

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.499 
behavior which is a sort of little way
of<00:04:37.300> saying<00:04:37.449> queen<00:04:37.960> is<00:04:38.139> here<00:04:38.169> Venice<00:04:38.970> and<00:04:39.970> you

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
of saying queen is here Venice and you

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.270 
of saying queen is here Venice and you
go<00:04:40.720> so<00:04:41.259> I<00:04:41.289> thought<00:04:41.440> well<00:04:41.590> maybe<00:04:41.650> had<00:04:41.979> a<00:04:42.009> queen

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
go so I thought well maybe had a queen

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.779 
go so I thought well maybe had a queen
but<00:04:42.840> then<00:04:43.840> I<00:04:43.870> found<00:04:44.110> her<00:04:45.810> did<00:04:46.810> not<00:04:46.930> happen<00:04:47.789> i

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
but then I found her did not happen i

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.870 
but then I found her did not happen i
think<00:04:49.590> and<00:04:50.590> i<00:04:50.740> was<00:04:50.889> looking<00:04:51.160> at<00:04:51.190> this<00:04:51.280> Jesus

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
think and i was looking at this Jesus

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:52.920 
think and i was looking at this Jesus
for<00:04:52.090> you

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
for you

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.140 
for you
so<00:04:53.530> I<00:04:53.560> guess<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:53.889> Fanning<00:04:54.820> behavior

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
so I guess the Fanning behavior

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:02.040 
so I guess the Fanning behavior
sometimes<00:04:56.190> for<00:04:57.190> no<00:04:57.729> no<00:04:58.180> real<00:04:58.419> reason<00:05:01.050> baby

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
sometimes for no no real reason baby

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.999 
sometimes for no no real reason baby
bees<00:05:02.340> all<00:05:03.340> right<00:05:03.580> wish<00:05:04.570> me<00:05:04.720> luck<00:05:04.770> go<00:05:05.770> put<00:05:05.889> these

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009 
three back in the top bar and bring some

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:17.580 
three back in the top bar and bring some
more<00:05:12.130> comb<00:05:12.340> back<00:05:12.490> in<00:05:12.669> here<00:05:14.580> okay<00:05:15.580> so<00:05:16.590> finally

00:05:58.959 --> 00:05:58.969 
accidentally about that high above the

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:02.499 
accidentally about that high above the
top<00:05:59.389> bars<00:05:59.689> it's<00:06:00.559> kind<00:06:00.769> of<00:06:00.919> open<00:06:01.339> but<00:06:02.089> I<00:06:02.119> didn't

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:02.509 
top bars it's kind of open but I didn't

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:04.419 
top bars it's kind of open but I didn't
even<00:06:02.629> see<00:06:02.749> where<00:06:03.080> she<00:06:03.229> went<00:06:03.259> I<00:06:03.860> was<00:06:04.129> I<00:06:04.309> was

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:04.429 
even see where she went I was I was

00:06:04.429 --> 00:06:06.459 
even see where she went I was I was
looking<00:06:04.699> at<00:06:04.759> the<00:06:04.879> handle<00:06:05.209> part<00:06:05.419> i<00:06:05.689> looked<00:06:06.259> back

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:06.469 
looking at the handle part i looked back

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:08.979 
looking at the handle part i looked back
there<00:06:07.399> there<00:06:07.759> was<00:06:07.879> a<00:06:07.909> bee<00:06:08.239> that<00:06:08.449> was<00:06:08.569> pinched

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:08.989 
there there was a bee that was pinched

00:06:08.989 --> 00:06:10.570 
there there was a bee that was pinched
in<00:06:09.139> there<00:06:09.289> so<00:06:09.559> i<00:06:09.589> was<00:06:09.769> trying<00:06:10.009> to<00:06:10.039> let<00:06:10.249> that<00:06:10.369> be

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
in there so i was trying to let that be

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.669 
in there so i was trying to let that be
out<00:06:10.789> and<00:06:11.029> somehow<00:06:11.300> i<00:06:11.389> let<00:06:11.719> the<00:06:11.839> other<00:06:11.989> I<00:06:12.289> let

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:12.679 
out and somehow i let the other I let

00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:17.919 
out and somehow i let the other I let
the<00:06:12.769> Queen<00:06:12.949> out<00:06:14.379> anyway<00:06:15.379> so<00:06:16.089> maybe<00:06:17.089> there<00:06:17.839> will

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:17.929 
the Queen out anyway so maybe there will

00:06:17.929 --> 00:06:19.869 
the Queen out anyway so maybe there will
be<00:06:17.989> a<00:06:18.110> little<00:06:18.469> cluster<00:06:19.039> if<00:06:19.189> she's<00:06:19.369> not<00:06:19.550> inside

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:19.879 
be a little cluster if she's not inside

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:21.339 
be a little cluster if she's not inside
i'm<00:06:20.059> going<00:06:20.479> to<00:06:20.539> hoping<00:06:20.779> i<00:06:20.869> can<00:06:20.929> go<00:06:21.139> back<00:06:21.319> and

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:21.349 
i'm going to hoping i can go back and

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:23.409 
i'm going to hoping i can go back and
get<00:06:21.739> a<00:06:21.800> little<00:06:21.919> cluster<00:06:22.699> of<00:06:22.729> bees<00:06:23.029> and<00:06:23.209> put<00:06:23.329> him

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419 
get a little cluster of bees and put him

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:27.639 
get a little cluster of bees and put him
back<00:06:23.449> in<00:06:23.800> whatever<00:06:24.800> it<00:06:25.759> was<00:06:25.879> so<00:06:26.059> hot<00:06:26.649> honeycomb

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:30.909 
back in whatever it was so hot honeycomb
was<00:06:27.829> falling<00:06:28.399> it<00:06:29.149> was<00:06:29.300> it<00:06:29.689> was<00:06:29.919> very

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 
was falling it was it was very

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:34.029 
was falling it was it was very
challenging<00:06:30.979> but<00:06:31.969> I<00:06:32.800> think<00:06:33.800> it's<00:06:33.889> going<00:06:33.949> to

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:34.039 
challenging but I think it's going to

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:36.040 
challenging but I think it's going to
work<00:06:34.239> seems<00:06:35.239> like<00:06:35.360> they're<00:06:35.509> staying<00:06:35.719> in<00:06:35.839> there

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
work seems like they're staying in there

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.969 
work seems like they're staying in there
and<00:06:37.989> hopefully<00:06:38.989> they<00:06:39.289> can<00:06:39.349> fix<00:06:39.469> all<00:06:39.860> the

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:39.979 
and hopefully they can fix all the

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:42.220 
and hopefully they can fix all the
damage

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:42.230 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:52.500 

you

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:52.510
