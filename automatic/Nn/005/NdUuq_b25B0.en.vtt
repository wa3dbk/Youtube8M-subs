metal ring here actually extended out
past<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.780> crystal<00:00:52.170> like<00:00:52.320> cup<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.890> crystal<00:00:53.250> it

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
past the crystal like cup the crystal it

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.880 
past the crystal like cup the crystal it
actually<00:00:54.059> doesn't<00:00:54.300> if<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.260> can<00:00:55.410> see<00:00:55.530> here<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
actually doesn't if you can see here the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.010 
actually doesn't if you can see here the
crystal<00:00:56.219> kinda<00:00:56.610> sticks<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.000> past<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.809> I

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
crystal kinda sticks that past it and I

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.380 
crystal kinda sticks that past it and I
sure<00:00:58.170> how<00:00:58.379> clear<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.070> but<00:00:59.460> the<00:01:00.030> crystal

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
sure how clear that is but the crystal

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.660 
sure how clear that is but the crystal
actually<00:01:00.620> comes<00:01:01.620> up<00:01:01.770> above<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.250> bezel<00:01:02.579> it

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670

and<00:01:37.369> I'll<00:01:38.369> try<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.670> get<00:01:38.850> as<00:01:38.970> close<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.329> king

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
and I'll try to get as close to the king

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.649 
and I'll try to get as close to the king
of<00:01:39.570> having<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.990> fade<00:01:40.320> out<00:01:40.530> here<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:42.390> center

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
of having it fade out here the center

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.420 
of having it fade out here the center
hand<00:01:42.899> as<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.290> can<00:01:43.409> see<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.680> down<00:01:43.860> here<00:01:44.220> it's

almost<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.390> think<00:01:45.509> that's<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.899> 1300<00:01:46.619> I

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
almost to the I think that's the 1300 I

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.440 
almost to the I think that's the 1300 I
haven't<00:01:47.100> looked<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.399> while<00:01:47.549> yeah<00:01:48.270> it's

haven't looked in a while yeah it's
almost<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.780> 1300<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:50.100> at<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.549> bottom<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
almost a 1300 so at the bottom of the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.520 
almost a 1300 so at the bottom of the
little<00:01:51.299> 24-hour<00:01:51.810> dial<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.110> see<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.290> little

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
little 24-hour dial you see the little

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:06.860 
the date so it's just a very interesting

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.490 
the date so it's just a very interesting
setup<00:07:07.860> this<00:07:08.130> movement<00:07:08.580> kind<00:07:08.699> of<00:07:09.500> behaves

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 
setup this movement kind of behaves

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.110 
setup this movement kind of behaves
strangely<00:07:10.770> from<00:07:11.460> what<00:07:11.610> I've<00:07:11.729> dealt<00:07:12.060> with

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 
strangely from what I've dealt with

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.540 
strangely from what I've dealt with
before<00:07:12.300> so<00:07:12.539> I<00:07:13.110> hope<00:07:13.590> that<00:07:13.889> made<00:07:14.070> some<00:07:14.280> kind<00:07:14.460> of

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:14.550 
before so I hope that made some kind of

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.120 
before so I hope that made some kind of
sense<00:07:14.810> I<00:07:15.810> guess<00:07:16.410> that's<00:07:16.590> about<00:07:16.710> it<00:07:16.830> for<00:07:17.070> today

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.130 
sense I guess that's about it for today

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.930 
sense I guess that's about it for today
