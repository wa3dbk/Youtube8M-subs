once the trave them layer and you need

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.270 
once the trave them layer and you need

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
to put the oven on the lowest

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.359 
to put the oven on the lowest
temperature<00:01:32.270> you<00:01:32.539> can<00:01:32.689> get<00:01:32.899> out<00:01:33.649> in<00:01:33.979> our<00:01:34.130> case

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
temperature you can get out in our case

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.910 
temperature you can get out in our case
that's<00:01:34.700> 50<00:01:35.450> degrees<00:01:35.750> centigrade<00:01:35.990> one<00:01:36.679> or<00:01:36.799> two

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
that's 50 degrees centigrade one or two

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.859 
that's 50 degrees centigrade one or two
ovens<00:01:37.070> around<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:37.700> get<00:01:37.789> a<00:01:37.820> little<00:01:38.000> clever<00:01:38.329> but

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
ovens around and get a little clever but

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.660 
ovens around and get a little clever but
generally<00:01:39.259> covered<00:01:39.770> as<00:01:39.859> a<00:01:39.890> lower<00:01:40.250> temperature

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
generally covered as a lower temperature

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.410 
generally covered as a lower temperature
as<00:01:41.329> you<00:01:41.509> can<00:01:42.399> or<00:01:43.399> drying<00:01:43.670> time<00:01:43.939> is<00:01:43.969> about<00:01:44.149> 15

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
as you can or drying time is about 15

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.099 
as you can or drying time is about 15
hours<00:01:44.810> but<00:01:45.740> they<00:01:46.159> won't<00:01:46.340> all<00:01:46.609> dry<00:01:47.060> at<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:47.899> same

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:48.109 
hours but they won't all dry at the same

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.050 
hours but they won't all dry at the same
rate<00:01:48.409> so<00:01:48.649> what<00:01:49.399> you've<00:01:49.549> got<00:01:49.579> to<00:01:49.670> do<00:01:49.789> is<00:01:49.880> just

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
rate so what you've got to do is just

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.959 
rate so what you've got to do is just
check<00:01:50.390> every<00:01:51.109> so<00:01:51.289> often<00:01:51.499> and<00:01:51.920> take<00:01:52.490> out<00:01:52.700> those

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
check every so often and take out those

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.660 
check every so often and take out those
that<00:01:53.570> you<00:01:53.689> think<00:01:53.719> already<00:01:54.679> well<00:01:55.399> it's<00:01:55.520> no

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
that you think already well it's no

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.209 
that you think already well it's no
other<00:01:55.850> day<00:01:56.030> after<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:56.679> yesterday<00:01:57.679> after

about<00:01:58.490> 11<00:01:59.270> to<00:01:59.630> 12<00:01:59.869> hours<00:02:00.319> of<00:02:00.560> heating<00:02:01.399> in<00:02:01.549> the

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
about 11 to 12 hours of heating in the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.239 
about 11 to 12 hours of heating in the
oven<00:02:01.969> we<00:02:02.479> checked<00:02:02.810> them<00:02:03.049> we<00:02:03.530> decided<00:02:03.710> at<00:02:04.189> that

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:04.249 
oven we checked them we decided at that

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.639 
oven we checked them we decided at that
point<00:02:04.369> they<00:02:04.969> were<00:02:05.030> fine<00:02:05.390> we<00:02:06.049> turned<00:02:06.409> off<00:02:06.619> the

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
point they were fine we turned off the

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.029 
point they were fine we turned off the
heat<00:02:07.069> and<00:02:07.310> we<00:02:08.270> left<00:02:08.509> them<00:02:08.780> in<00:02:08.960> the<00:02:09.619> oven

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
heat and we left them in the oven

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.699 
heat and we left them in the oven
overnight<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.630> this

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
overnight and this

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.959 
overnight and this
is<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.849> result<00:02:15.290> as<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.319> can<00:02:16.500> see<00:02:16.769> all<00:02:17.489> nicely

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:17.969 
is the result as you can see all nicely

drying Tomatoes is as we have here this
is<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.870> set<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.620> tomatoes<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.040> we<00:02:56.250> put<00:02:56.400> in<00:02:56.519> the

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
is a set of tomatoes that we put in the

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.000 
is a set of tomatoes that we put in the
oven<00:02:56.939> last<00:02:57.359> night<00:02:57.659> at<00:02:58.230> 50<00:02:58.530> degrees<00:02:58.799> centigrade

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
oven last night at 50 degrees centigrade

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.920 
oven last night at 50 degrees centigrade
but<00:02:59.579> we<00:02:59.700> only<00:02:59.819> gave<00:03:00.030> them<00:03:00.120> about<00:03:00.269> four<00:03:00.689> hours

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
but we only gave them about four hours

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.559 
but we only gave them about four hours
in<00:03:01.469> the<00:03:02.010> oven<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:02.489> about<00:03:02.669> a<00:03:02.849> third<00:03:02.909> of<00:03:03.299> the<00:03:03.359> time

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
in the oven so about a third of the time

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.720 
in the oven so about a third of the time
that<00:03:03.780> you'd<00:03:03.870> really<00:03:04.200> need<00:03:04.379> to<00:03:04.859> dry<00:03:05.040> them<00:03:05.250> right

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
that you'd really need to dry them right

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.970 
that you'd really need to dry them right
away<00:03:05.879> through<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.569> the<00:03:07.019> point<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:07.379> that<00:03:07.650> these

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
away through and the point is that these

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.750 
away through and the point is that these
came<00:03:08.459> out<00:03:08.609> still<00:03:09.209> slightly<00:03:09.480> moist<00:03:09.840> and

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
came out still slightly moist and

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.449 
came out still slightly moist and
they're<00:03:11.760> going<00:03:11.879> to<00:03:11.939> be<00:03:12.000> preserved<00:03:13.219> in<00:03:14.219> olive

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
they're going to be preserved in olive

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:22.550 
they're going to be preserved in olive
oil<00:03:19.819> so<00:03:20.819> that's<00:03:21.389> the<00:03:21.659> end<00:03:21.810> result<00:03:21.989> that<00:03:22.409> our

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
oil so that's the end result that our

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.710 
oil so that's the end result that our
inter<00:03:22.859> just<00:03:23.129> give<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.400> bit<00:03:23.519> of<00:03:23.549> a<00:03:23.790> wiggle

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
inter just give it a bit of a wiggle

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.280 
inter just give it a bit of a wiggle
around<00:03:25.040> to<00:03:26.040> make<00:03:26.340> sure<00:03:26.549> that<00:03:26.729> any<00:03:26.879> air<00:03:27.750> bubbles

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
around to make sure that any air bubbles

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.659 
around to make sure that any air bubbles
are<00:03:28.560> released

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
are released

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:31.369 
are released
now<00:03:30.120> difference<00:03:30.659> between<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.019> two<00:03:31.169> different

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
now difference between the two different

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.599 
now difference between the two different
drawings<00:03:31.949> Drive<00:03:32.639> styles<00:03:33.030> is<00:03:33.180> that<00:03:33.590> these

the<00:03:44.430> way<00:03:44.549> through<00:03:44.939> you<00:03:45.509> need<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:45.840> rehydrate

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:46.259 
the way through you need to rehydrate

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:49.249 
the way through you need to rehydrate
them<00:03:46.799> in<00:03:47.129> warm<00:03:47.790> water<00:03:48.120> for<00:03:48.329> about<00:03:48.810> half<00:03:49.049> an
