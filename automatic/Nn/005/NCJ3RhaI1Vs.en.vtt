got<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.780> scene<00:00:09.960> set<00:00:10.110> up<00:00:10.200> with<00:00:10.290> an<00:00:10.410> empty<00:00:10.500> game

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
got the scene set up with an empty game

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.410 
got the scene set up with an empty game
object<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.519> cube<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:11.910> we're<00:00:12.090> going<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.330> be

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
object and a cube that we're going to be

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.640 
object and a cube that we're going to be
using<00:00:12.630> for<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.929> purposes<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.469> this

using for the purposes of this

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.070 
using for the purposes of this
experiment<00:00:14.190> so<00:00:15.000> let's<00:00:15.179> add<00:00:15.389> on<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.719> finite

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
experiment so let's add on the finite

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.470 
experiment so let's add on the finite
state<00:00:16.199> machine<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.830> add<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.699> game<00:00:18.029> object

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
state machine and add in the game object

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.060 
state machine and add in the game object
action<00:00:18.869> now<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.500> first<00:00:19.710> thing<00:00:19.800> you're<00:00:19.949> going

action now the first thing you're going
to<00:00:20.160> notice<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.520> it's<00:00:20.670> going<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.910> give<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.180> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
to notice is it's going to give you the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.029 
to notice is it's going to give you the
game<00:00:21.510> object<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.170> want<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.500> use<00:00:22.740> now<00:00:23.010> you

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
game object that you want to use now you

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.759 
game object that you want to use now you
can<00:00:23.279> use<00:00:23.490> itself<00:00:24.150> by<00:00:25.019> leaving<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.439> as<00:00:25.529> use

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
can use itself by leaving it as use

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.650 
can use itself by leaving it as use
owner<00:00:25.980> or<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.250> can<00:00:26.609> pull<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.060> drop<00:00:27.269> down<00:00:27.449> to

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
owner or you can pull the drop down to

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.630 
owner or you can pull the drop down to
specify<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> game<00:00:28.529> object<00:00:28.740> now<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.460> can

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
specify a game object now you can

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.580 
specify a game object now you can
control<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.150> one<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.480> two<00:00:30.660> ways<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.470> can

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
control this one of two ways you can

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.440 
control this one of two ways you can
either<00:00:31.710> manually<00:00:32.489> drag<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.850> drop<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.149> object

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
either manually drag and drop the object

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.430 
either manually drag and drop the object
that<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.630> want<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.899> activate<00:00:34.290> or<00:00:34.410> deactivate

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
that you want to activate or deactivate

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.280 
that you want to activate or deactivate
in<00:00:35.130> there<00:00:35.730> or<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.690> control<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.140> with<00:00:37.170> a

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
in there or you can control it with a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.209 
in there or you can control it with a
game<00:00:37.530> object<00:00:37.739> variable<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:42.739> add<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:44.040> in

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
game object variable so add that in

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.389 
game object variable so add that in
there

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.639 

like<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.270> now<00:00:51.750> for<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.960> purposes<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.410> this

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
like so now for the purposes of this

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.340 
like so now for the purposes of this
experiment<00:00:53.160> let's<00:00:53.640> just<00:00:54.000> manually<00:00:54.840> drag<00:00:55.199> and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
experiment let's just manually drag and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.009 
experiment let's just manually drag and
drop<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.489> next<00:00:56.699> few<00:00:56.879> frames<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.480> activate

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
drop in the next few frames the activate

00:00:58.019 --> 00:00:59.930 
drop in the next few frames the activate
is<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.410> checkbox<00:00:58.949> which<00:00:59.250> means<00:00:59.519> that<00:00:59.699> if<00:00:59.820> you

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
is a checkbox which means that if you

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.579 
is a checkbox which means that if you
want<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.210> control<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.660> with<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> variable<00:01:01.350> it's

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
want to control it with a variable it's

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.450 
want to control it with a variable it's
a<00:01:01.739> boolean<00:01:02.600> so<00:01:03.600> for<00:01:03.989> example<00:01:04.460> let's

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
a boolean so for example let's

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.399 
a boolean so for example let's
deactivate<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.570> I'll<00:01:06.810> show<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.020> what<00:01:07.290> it

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
deactivate it and I'll show you what it

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.980 
deactivate it and I'll show you what it
does<00:01:07.619> alright<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:08.729> as<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.450> can<00:01:09.540> see<00:01:09.750> right<00:01:09.930> now

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
does alright so as you can see right now

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.080 
does alright so as you can see right now
the<00:01:10.409> game<00:01:10.590> object<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.070> active<00:01:11.550> in<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.759> scene

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
the game object is active in the scene

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.859 
the game object is active in the scene
but<00:01:12.600> as<00:01:12.720> soon<00:01:12.960> as<00:01:13.110> we<00:01:13.320> click<00:01:13.619> play<00:01:14.540> it<00:01:15.540> will<00:01:15.750> go

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
but as soon as we click play it will go

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.050 
but as soon as we click play it will go
to<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.110> action<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:17.550> will<00:01:17.610> fire<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:17.970> off

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
to this action and it will fire it off

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.800 
to this action and it will fire it off
and<00:01:18.360> as<00:01:18.659> you'll<00:01:18.840> see<00:01:18.899> it's<00:01:20.030> disappeared<00:01:21.030> now

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
and as you'll see it's disappeared now

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.270 
and as you'll see it's disappeared now
this<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> good<00:01:22.290> way<00:01:22.440> of<00:01:22.470> controlling<00:01:23.009> which

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
this is a good way of controlling which

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.330 
this is a good way of controlling which
items<00:01:23.940> in<00:01:24.119> your<00:01:24.270> scene<00:01:24.570> are<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:25.380> screen<00:01:26.070> at<00:01:26.310> any

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
items in your scene are on screen at any

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.160 
items in your scene are on screen at any
given<00:01:26.729> point<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:27.000> time<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.420> say<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:27.660> example

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
given point in time so say for example

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.810 
given point in time so say for example
you<00:01:28.350> have<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.860> vast<00:01:30.080> huge<00:01:31.100> huge<00:01:32.100> screen<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.670> you

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
you have a vast huge huge screen and you

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.510 
you have a vast huge huge screen and you
only<00:01:33.000> want<00:01:33.300> to<00:01:33.479> tell<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.929> to<00:01:34.080> render<00:01:34.470> what<00:01:35.310> is

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
only want to tell it to render what is

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.440 
only want to tell it to render what is
visible<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.780> player<00:01:36.990> right<00:01:37.619> now<00:01:37.679> as<00:01:38.640> you

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
visible to the player right now as you

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.060 
visible to the player right now as you
well<00:01:39.840> basically<00:01:40.050> if<00:01:40.380> you've<00:01:40.530> got<00:01:40.710> like<00:01:40.860> for

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
well basically if you've got like for

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.490 
well basically if you've got like for
example<00:01:41.159> clipping<00:01:41.759> planes<00:01:42.030> or<00:01:42.539> if<00:01:43.050> you<00:01:43.409> don't

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
example clipping planes or if you don't

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.770 
example clipping planes or if you don't
want<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.890> render<00:01:44.069> what<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.490> can't<00:01:44.850> see<00:01:45.149> you

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
want it to render what you can't see you

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.590 
want it to render what you can't see you
can<00:01:45.929> use<00:01:46.050> this<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.380> control<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.770> like<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.600> now

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
can use this to control it like that now

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.969 
can use this to control it like that now
the<00:01:48.690> next<00:01:48.750> thing<00:01:48.960> you'll<00:01:49.110> see<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.380> recursive

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
the next thing you'll see is recursive

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.980 
the next thing you'll see is recursive
what<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:50.729> basically<00:01:50.880> means<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.479> if<00:01:51.659> there

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
what this basically means is if there

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.380 
what this basically means is if there
are<00:01:52.020> objects<00:01:52.950> for<00:01:53.399> example<00:01:53.729> let's<00:01:54.030> create<00:01:54.210> a

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
are objects for example let's create a

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.919 
are objects for example let's create a
few<00:01:56.030> so<00:01:57.030> sphere<00:01:58.130> put<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.310> there<00:01:59.720> let's<00:02:00.720> drag

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
few so sphere put that there let's drag

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.089 
few so sphere put that there let's drag
that<00:02:01.140> as<00:02:01.319> a<00:02:01.380> child<00:02:02.099> in<00:02:02.660> the<00:02:03.660> stack<00:02:03.869> now<00:02:04.410> with

00:02:05.089 --> 00:02:05.099 
that as a child in the stack now with

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:07.070 
that as a child in the stack now with
recursive<00:02:05.489> set<00:02:05.910> to<00:02:06.119> checked<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.869> will

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
recursive set to checked it will

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.139 
recursive set to checked it will
basically<00:02:07.259> go<00:02:07.709> through<00:02:07.739> the<00:02:08.220> object<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.819> any

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
basically go through the object and any

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.750 
basically go through the object and any
children<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.750> are<00:02:09.840> parented<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.470> and

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
children that are parented to it and

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.589 
children that are parented to it and
deactivate<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.879> but<00:02:12.030> if<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.270> turn<00:02:12.540> off

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
deactivate it but if you turn off

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.210 
deactivate it but if you turn off
recursive<00:02:14.300> it<00:02:15.300> will<00:02:15.930> only<00:02:16.140> handle<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.920> parent

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
recursive it will only handle the parent

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.059 
recursive it will only handle the parent
object<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.720> will<00:02:18.750> disable<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.379> like<00:02:19.739> so

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
object and it will disable it like so

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.070 
object and it will disable it like so
and<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.760> can<00:02:20.910> see<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.270> it's<00:02:21.480> action<00:02:21.840> is

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
and you can see that it's action is

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.530 
and you can see that it's action is
reflected<00:02:22.800> in<00:02:22.920> here<00:02:23.250> see<00:02:24.180> this<00:02:24.300> little

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
reflected in here see this little

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.610 
reflected in here see this little
checkbox<00:02:24.720> here<00:02:25.319> let<00:02:26.010> me<00:02:26.780> by<00:02:27.780> default<00:02:28.230> it's<00:02:28.410> set

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
checkbox here let me by default it's set

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.770 
checkbox here let me by default it's set
to<00:02:28.650> active<00:02:32.030> okay<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.360> next<00:02:33.569> thing<00:02:33.690> you're

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
to active okay so the next thing you're

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.180 
to active okay so the next thing you're
going<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.019> be<00:02:34.140> looking<00:02:34.410> at<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.650> reset<00:02:35.040> on

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
going to be looking at is the reset on

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.770 
going to be looking at is the reset on
exit<00:02:35.550> that<00:02:35.879> basically<00:02:36.239> means<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.510> if<00:02:36.629> you

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
exit that basically means that if you

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.400 
exit that basically means that if you
want<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.680> control<00:02:38.069> it<00:02:38.129> so<00:02:38.459> that<00:02:38.720> an<00:02:39.720> object<00:02:40.260> is

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
want to control it so that an object is

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.550 
want to control it so that an object is
active<00:02:40.890> or<00:02:41.209> deactivated<00:02:42.239> while<00:02:43.050> this<00:02:43.230> action

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
active or deactivated while this action

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.949 
active or deactivated while this action
is<00:02:43.680> running<00:02:43.980> if<00:02:44.099> you<00:02:44.129> want<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.489> reset<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.840> the

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
is running if you want to reset to the

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.720 
is running if you want to reset to the
state<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.560> was<00:02:46.739> initially<00:02:47.160> in<00:02:47.430> when<00:02:47.610> it

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
state that it was initially in when it

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.670 
state that it was initially in when it
entered<00:02:48.060> into<00:02:48.180> this<00:02:48.420> state<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:49.379> what<00:02:49.560> you

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
entered into this state that is what you

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.920 
entered into this state that is what you
would<00:02:49.800> check<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.700> course<00:02:50.940> every<00:02:51.390> frame<00:02:51.660> so

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
would check and of course every frame so

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.990 
would check and of course every frame so
if<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.170> want<00:02:52.349> it<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.650> do<00:02:52.800> this<00:02:52.980> every<00:02:53.430> frame<00:02:53.790> or

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
if you want it to do this every frame or

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.050 
if you want it to do this every frame or
if<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:54.930> just<00:02:54.959> want<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.319> to<00:02:55.349> fire<00:02:55.590> once<00:02:56.060> you

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
if you just want it to fire once you

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.800 
if you just want it to fire once you
have<00:02:57.239> that<00:02:57.390> option

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
have that option

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.899 
have that option
now<00:02:58.379> both<00:02:58.530> recursive<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.219> activate<00:02:59.730> are

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
now both recursive and activate are

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.009 
now both recursive and activate are
controlled<00:03:00.299> by<00:03:00.450> boolean's

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
controlled by boolean's

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:11.069 
controlled by boolean's
so<00:03:01.439> let's<00:03:01.739> look<00:03:01.980> into<00:03:02.189> that

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:19.850 

okay<00:03:12.079> and<00:03:12.409> the<00:03:12.560> next<00:03:12.590> one

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.550 

so<00:03:20.860> the<00:03:21.520> state<00:03:22.090> and<00:03:22.569> whether<00:03:22.989> or<00:03:23.080> not<00:03:23.110> children

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
so the state and whether or not children

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.170 
so the state and whether or not children
are<00:03:23.709> going<00:03:23.890> with<00:03:24.069> it<00:03:24.190> now<00:03:24.310> if<00:03:24.430> you<00:03:24.459> notice<00:03:24.790> the

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
are going with it now if you notice the

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.910 
are going with it now if you notice the
activation<00:03:25.690> state<00:03:25.840> is<00:03:26.020> false<00:03:26.290> but<00:03:26.770> the

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
activation state is false but the

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.650 
activation state is false but the
recursive<00:03:27.370> state<00:03:27.550> is<00:03:27.670> also<00:03:27.940> false<00:03:28.180> so<00:03:28.420> as<00:03:28.540> you

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
recursive state is also false so as you

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.420 
recursive state is also false so as you
can<00:03:28.810> expect<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:29.410> cube<00:03:29.680> should<00:03:29.830> disappear<00:03:30.280> but

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
can expect the cube should disappear but

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:37.080 
can expect the cube should disappear but
the<00:03:30.550> sphere<00:03:30.819> should<00:03:31.000> stay<00:03:32.730> like<00:03:33.730> so<00:03:35.910> okay<00:03:36.910> so<00:03:36.970> I

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
the sphere should stay like so okay so I

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.280 
the sphere should stay like so okay so I
hope<00:03:37.270> that's<00:03:37.480> answered<00:03:37.600> a<00:03:37.780> few<00:03:37.870> questions<00:03:38.050> you

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
hope that's answered a few questions you

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.420 
hope that's answered a few questions you
may<00:03:38.410> have<00:03:38.440> had<00:03:38.620> about<00:03:38.650> this<00:03:38.920> particular
