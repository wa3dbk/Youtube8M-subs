00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:08.180
 the ingredients for our salad 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:11.400
 purifying are dandelion thresholds 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.710
 just take beautiful washed and look at that 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.049
 wonder 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.870
 all colored with buds 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.449
 inside you can't see them but eat them 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:26.160
 absolutely in quantity you owe 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:30.779
 to consume let's say I chose this 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.000
 pebble that's why we will be many 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:39.710
 people today to exquisite arches of this 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.710
 Delights three beautiful stems of chives 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:47.070
 2000 acidulous these I am not sure of what 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.100
 variety is because we don't take them 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.360
 from the farmer that variegated ceneda 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.870
 species and breeds so I don't know 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.620
 distinguishes but I'm quite civil the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.580
 juice of a lemon or half of pella la 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:10.830
 amount of thought you want to do 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:16.970
 I will also add some myth of rice and that 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:21.689
 it is a fermented food starting from 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:26.700
 organic soy brown rice salt room 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:32.310
 marine water so aspergillus oryza ori 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:36.210
 ohrid no moritz and yes it is a food 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.870
 highly nutritious but if you have to 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.900
 go buy it or 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.810
 you have months alternatives from 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.420
 supermarket with bad ingredients 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.730
 this is not pasteurized avoid 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:56.940
 add it and soy sauce 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.400
 also this soy sauce contains between 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.670
 its ingredients simply water 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.880
 soy and wheat sea ​​salt ours 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.330
 Aspergillus friend so he has no 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:13.530
 added aroma type is also a 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.350
 very large salt content and will be 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.470
 however our only saline source 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:24.080
 then I would go for extra virgin olive oil 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:28.350
 organic cold-pressed olive e 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.770
 an advance of pumpkin seeds and 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:35.640
 sunflower to give a bit of joy 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.560
 fatty color I recommend chew the 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.580
 good this salad because to be able to 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.090
 assimilate you need to reduce it to 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:47.520
 Pappetta we prepare the seasoning 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:54.510
 first of all these are not ingredients 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:55.750
 randomly but they are various nutrients they do 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.390
 yes that the 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:03.140
 properties of the salad that we will go to 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.970
 let them be assimilated to 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.970
 perfection 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.540
 first we have the presence of various 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.549
 tastes 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:20.959
 the acidity of the lemon is his 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:23.060
 rich source of vitamin C which 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:38.420
 we have our soy sauce there 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:42.739
 will give the flavor and as I said the face 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:47.660
 of this face is developed from 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:50.500
 unrefined brown rice like 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:54.349
 usually used is a pasta that 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.599
 needs to be dissolved in one part 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:01.220
 liquid in this case so our 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:06.500
 lemon destroyer force is a food 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:11.060
 very nutritious and gives us that umami taste 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:16.070
 which is another is another Chinese flavor 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:20.829
 or in any case of the oriental culture it is 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:24.849
 a mixture of sweet civita does anyway 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:28.689
 you know that every flavor goes to work 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:32.500
 on an organ and this is important 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:36.270
 also because when we go to prepare 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.780
 a product a finished dish would be 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.150
 good thing 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:45.400
 being able to calibrate all the flavors 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.330
 why no one prevails over the other in 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.240
 any way 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.610
 doing so we are going to feed the 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.509
 our organs 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:58.900
 I recommend only joined at the end i 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:03.099
 oily liquids otherwise we will not succeed 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.419
 to create an emulsion once created 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:06.870
 the right emotion 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:11.340
 let's add 2 tablespoons of oil 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.340
 extra virgin olive oil 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.190
 let's see I love you 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.540
 we just have to cut our own 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.520
 ingredients 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.940
 I'm going to leave the apple peels 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.920
 because they are a thousand untreated and have 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.670
 also in a beautiful color then dandelion 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.540
 minimum chives we see result 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:51.870
 the final 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:56.360
 and add the seasoning rhythm after 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.360
 a nice splash of ends
