 today again for the point 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.599
 climax of the ch and so you speak so 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.130
 in fact the xbox one jedir xbox 720 or 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.269
 xbox infiniti it's true that this is 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.940
 weird in any case not be called the 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.090
 xbox one since we will say yesterday we were able to 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.859
 so have a kind of little two 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.480
 small meetings about microsoft 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.800
 have unveiled the console so whatever 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.090
 completely official thing I'm going 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.279
 give you information that has been 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.990
 data since this rsa is in English 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.510
 little like we may not have necessarily 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.070
 understood it's true though if we could 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.559
 see the object design put you some 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.149
 pictures of the console in itself a 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.710
 srec three levels the playstation 4 on 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.510
 could not really have an image did 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.950
 more voice actually fout the console 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.559
 I'm sure it's great me to see a 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.789
 craft a box gone but good so 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.079
 I will see you the information should 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.840
 start right away confessed so from the 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.090
 xbox one already the name for me uh it's 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.430
 true I really thought I saw the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.989
 xbox infiniti but the lightbox one 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.789
 pretty special things I do not see that 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.620
 you actually they come out know it's 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.300
 sure it's the first real console 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.799
 heads that will make appear like this 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.330
 I do not know at all 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.240
 true that the press that it will be xbox or 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.350
 xbox wii xbox for once that 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.770
 happens it's true that it looks pretty 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.240
 thing 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.520
 while it's true enough that I 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.990
 nothing against conches lightbox one but we 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.580
 will say that everything is this information 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.900
 that I noted for the moment I 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.460
 would also like other information 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.860
 it is true that it can not seem 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.810
 pretty negative why I do not know 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.100
 hungry and that you see after me I 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.479
 not want to influence thur then this 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.220
 that you have to know is that there will be 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.570
 an internet connection that will be 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.640
 mandatory that is to say that it is necessary 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.079
 they are connected 24/7 if 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.820
 we do not know too much about playing your 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.400
 console you know it all and neither so 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.250
 why they made this system there I 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.049
 do not really know the only reason 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.460
 worth it because they already want 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.930
 to have connected so that's for 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.220
 a story of two flows and it's with 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.290
 style and especially in fact he wade me to 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.720
 who they are afraid down that down 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.950
 going on again we're going to say lose some 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.539
 money that's really theirs 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.329
 main purpose of putting a connection to 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.950
 4,524 on to updates like that that 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.869
 will ask at the level of acts all this 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.909
 it would be almost impossible to 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.530
 crack the console so for them that's them 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.789
 also arranges from those who had not 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.830
 in what also needs to be known is that 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.970
 if it takes you a collection 24 24 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.069
 people let's say it's between 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.540
 normal quotation marks that is to say they 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.459
 are often traveling or what they are going 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.780
 not simple week I'm their 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.000
 grandparents and they had brought 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.380
 their consoles bah it's true that it's okay 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.519
 look pretty complicated so I know 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.840
 not at all how the system is going 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.819
 walk that eventually there will be a mode 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.349
 orly I hope because if it's a big 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.150
 con and annecy it really requires 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.760
 a console finally those no if that 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.170
 really requires a connection 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.880
 internet that's it would be really 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.530
 pity of their pacs all that really 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.599
 finally we imitate tristan does that they 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.180
 do it really have to put it there 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.769
 an offline mode but otherwise bah 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.810
 if not actually low that's what you and 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.860
 sometimes play with us if you finally 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.079
 you move you evokes 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.209
 if remove the opportunity market 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.890
 that is, it is enclosed in quotation marks 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.420
 under the buy a player your mates to 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.700
 a vote you want to buy a game 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.530
 used in a store it will be more 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.790
 really possible finally if you go 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.319
 to be able to do it but will have to give 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.209
 microsoft money ie that at 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.590
 present I take you an example I 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.299
 I'm interested in a game that's my 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.739
 buddy over there I think I would like bah 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.480
 will buy you 15 euros I buy him 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.069
 fifteen days to my friend and that's it 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.630
 at the game cowardly 15 euros finally I 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.060
 do a buddy but not make it to play 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.769
 on my console and we'll have to 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.750
 I pay microsoft an example ben voila 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.370
 I pay the license of the game ie 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.079
 I think it's about $ 10 or 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.060
 I do not know if it's that but brief 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.290
 it's about 10 dollars I think my 10 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.630
 euros we're going to say that like that whose 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.069
 flower that I see 10 euros for 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.540
 can play the game while you 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.950
 buy 15 euros and already my friend I 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.389
 find that a little disgusting that too 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.100
 on the other hand so that is to say that the game 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.710
 in fact finally I would have paid 25 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.030
 euros then for sure you 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.320
 in the end will miss will win 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.390
 earns money because people him 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.800
 same is well worth more than 25 euros but I 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.150
 am in my calculation and one goes like 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.570
 if you bought it new otherwise it's worth 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.640
 not the shot 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.930
 but it's true that this little request 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.830
 so basically flora really bought the 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.390
 license for sure we actually 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.280
 finally not that your righteous will be 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.810
 all cases you are not able to them 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.520
 lend to marcy to the swords squarely a 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.840
 iv license after well that's actually 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.910
 big when you go buy a game 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.410
 Well, it will be for the profile itself 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.570
 for your profile and sometimes did 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.280
 shared the young man in the look and a 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.540
 os x all that's a shame part if 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.580
 you buy it rooney exists after the 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.200
 case it will not be able to replay in fact the 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.820
 game so I find that too 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.310
 pity so you say it's true that this 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.960
 which will also assume is that the games 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.660
 expression 60 are not compatible 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.060
 on the xbox web after that is that to 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.500
 appear positive or negative 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.239
 it's up to you to see what's true 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.040
 shame I could but barca that's for sure 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.360
 present as the playstation 3 they get 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.470
 are realized so in the beginning me 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.660
 I had the protest 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.210
 3 if you want and so after they have 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.050
 put the ps2 games on it and who 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.430
 had surely said they were happy 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.560
 were losing a lot of money and 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.170
 so they had to actually stop the beginning 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.630
 under the playstation sets 3 bah 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.200
 you can play playstation games 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.610
 excuse me 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.260
 after that they stopped selling 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.760
 consoles name of playstation 3 which 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.590
 could play playstation 2 games so 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.910
 the sat the same thing basically they have 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.230
 afraid to really lose a lot 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.640
 money that people buy 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.590
 finally light vote either but with a 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.930
 game since the games will cost enough 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.370
 dear and then said to himself finally here I 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.780
 put a lot of perfect game gfr no 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.760
 so lenient in the middle of a box 360 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.950
 on it so there will not be that for now 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.740
 there is no price you have to know what 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.700
 who will see the player blu ray I 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.320
 stationed at this good news is 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.760
 one of the bombs to one of the best 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.110
 news may speak to you about it 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.310
 done about it soon 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.140
 skype that will be connected 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.910
 if I heard correctly if you feel pain 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.040
 including this wheat you will be able to see 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.480
 skype but without really slipping and 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.430
 falls to hautmont via on skype this is 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.139
 with microsoft or sand of course it's ok 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.719
 super good market 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.430
 at sony at sony noya not skype but 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:28.319
 in any case really the skype platform 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.699
 will be very very suitable for the console will be 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:30.870
 even better suited more at sony 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.759
 before I tell you right now 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.249
 so that's really a positive would be 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:36.719
 playing with your friends and 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:38.789
 two to talk to them their cat and without 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:40.199
 to have real worries or even 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.120
 chat in a group without having 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.080
 the computer aside I find it's 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.939
 a very good thing 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.909
 what you should know also his cigs the 

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:50.039
 the console will make 500 giga species of a 

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:52.229
 crowd on the hard drive then 500 giga 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.759
 this success is just huge compared to the 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:55.889
 first xbox that I need is I think 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:56.879
 what not the b10 a giga but what it 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:58.949
 must know also it is the games 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:00.539
 unfortunately are going to be very 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:01.830
 heavy already put the pig they go 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:03.629
 to be super bourba of course it's okay 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.919
 ask for even more space because 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:06.509
 it requires a lot more quality 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:07.050
 unpacking at the graphics level etc 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:08.819
 etc. 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.529
 and that's for sure that and this bridge are wondering 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:13.289
 now are those 500 giga 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:13.889
 for really really going to be enough for 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:16.110
 console 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.219
 I think that yes sutil what it takes 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.000
 know that in fact you do not have 

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:20.039
 can change 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.589
 the space of the hard disk that is to say you 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:24.210
 you can not add space 

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:25.889
 dob in your console no that risk 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.759
 to be quite complicated on it if you 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:28.740
 have made spas are full 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:29.699
 removed from the games in the passage that it takes 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.129
 know also is that simply 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.569
 the games actually when you go bye 

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:35.550
 sometimes play before they actually 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:36.930
 install on the console ie 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.339
 you put the disc apart 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.259
 really reinstall on the console 

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:41.729
 noci risk to take a little bit eventually 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:43.349
 so I know it will take a lot 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:45.149
 of time but basically that's okay 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:47.009
 fill the hard drive fast enough 

00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:48.810
 it 's not that even if you tell me that 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:50.189
 I'm even if you put the game well 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.629
 actually install it on a sculpture the 

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:53.399
 game so that may be enough 

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:54.629
 complicated if it's to have a bus a 

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:56.159
 bigger attachment actually to your 

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:56.699
 profile ie you put the game 

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:59.339
 bam 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:01.560
 the game will be that finally bad at the adisq is 

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:03.000
 will be recorded on your profile 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.099
 is like that you sometimes have the 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.509
 share with your colleagues all this for 

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:08.310
 that they come to enjoy it so that's 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:09.960
 true that in a way it's disgusting 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.250
 In short, it may be that we are going 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.500
 maybe no longer need finally 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:15.330
 to play with the discs so that's it 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.649
 to see in any case thank you for having the 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.939
 bellagio it's great fun there will be 

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:19.349
 still a lot of information that will 

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:20.099
 appear on my channel about 

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:21.300
 the former boxer 

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:22.740
 thank you for putting a little chama video 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.149
 it is really fun and above 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.589
 on my page at home personally 

00:07:24.149 --> 00:07:27.089
 without pictures that I wanted to 

00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:28.919
 next fall heats then that where you are 

00:07:27.089 --> 00:07:33.349
 just before the embarrassment that I'm not telling you 

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:33.349
 that I hope it went up 

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.160
 it was really weird the end of the 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.020
 video 

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:45.190
 I lost 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:47.430
 not mine no problem I can not 

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:50.080
 I like is like that the emir board 

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.970
 I would like but after we remove the see 

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.590
 how is it true that the fact of 

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:56.680
 smoke all abortions actually but me 

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:58.600
 it shocks me so that makes it more 

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.450
 we are great we forget ourselves I wait 

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.920
 let's show you we're here we see 

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.750
 actually actually I'm in 

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:07.180
 experiencing good and reliable 

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.950
 neighbors if I go there it's completely 

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:12.060
 open nas still a lot of people 

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:12.060
 were impressive like that
