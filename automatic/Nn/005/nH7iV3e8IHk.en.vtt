00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.920
 Not bad this drum beat, right? Well, in this tutorial I'll show you how to do it! 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.660
 well, let's start from scratch ... 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.180
 ... first we set the VCO1 to NOISE 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.240
 and close the low pass filter 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.520
 now we will use the filter tracking function to make the cutoff frequency change according to the notes played 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.200
 to do this we need to link [KB CV OUT] to the filter input [CUTOF FREQ] 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.140
 and increase the intensity of the EXT modulation. at most 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.800
 as you hear, the filter closes as we descend towards the lower keys 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.920
 now we create the cash sound using EG1 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.400
 then, take EG1 [REV OUT] and connect it to the [TOTAL] input 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.380
 then we raise the PEAK of the Low pass filter to the maximum ... 

00:00:55.593 --> 00:00:58.173
 let's raise the T.EXT intensity. at most... 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.340
 ... and set the Attack time of the EG1 to get a fast and hard response 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:14.780
 we must also adjust the EG2 to have the right decay for both the case and the snare drum 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.240
 ok ... so it should be good ... 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.340
 now we use the Hi pass filter to adjust the tuning of the snare drum ... 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.860
 nice but ... we can go further ... 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.060
 we use the ESP channel, as seen in the previous tutorial, to get some OVERDRIVE! 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.540
 so let's take the [SIGNAL OUT] and connect it to the [SIGNAL IN] input of the ESP ... 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.620
 ... and from the [OUT] exit of the ESP we go back to the main mixer 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.320
 raise the signal level ... 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.600
 ... until we clip the channel and distort it! 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.840
 ok! ... now that's it! 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:16.420
 ... now let's add some Delay effect and our Drum Kit is ready to be played! 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.060
 pretty bad, can't you find? : P 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.420
 well ... that's all for now ... 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.480
 next time we will calm down a bit and do something softer ... how about a PAD? 

00:02:40.913 --> 00:02:47.113
 ...what do you think? Will it be possible to create a PAD sound using a monophonic synth? 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.420
 stay tuned and find out!
