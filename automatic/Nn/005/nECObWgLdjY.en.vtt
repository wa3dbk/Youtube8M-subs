00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
I think it's a significant question I

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.830 
I think it's a significant question I
think<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.730> group<00:00:32.940> meant<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.390> us<00:00:33.570> as<00:00:33.750> a

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840

kind of carry on the expectations of

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.860 
kind of carry on the expectations of
every<00:00:38.579> student-athlete<00:00:39.000> we<00:00:39.300> have<00:00:39.450> over<00:00:39.690> there

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
every student-athlete we have over there

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.619 
every student-athlete we have over there
you<00:00:40.290> look<00:00:40.469> at<00:00:40.590> what<00:00:40.680> they<00:00:40.829> were<00:00:40.890> able<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.219> do

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
you look at what they were able to do

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.030

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
not only this year's group but as a two

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.270 
not only this year's group but as a two
year<00:00:44.250> period<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.879> they<00:00:45.750> kind<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.710> embodied

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
year period and they kind of embodied

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.799 
year period and they kind of embodied
what<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.489> student<00:00:47.760> athletes<00:00:48.239> should<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.600> I

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
what a student athletes should be I

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.729 
what a student athletes should be I
think<00:00:49.379> we<00:00:49.530> won<00:00:50.329> what<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.510> 73<00:00:52.170> games<00:00:52.350> over

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
think we won what is it 73 games over

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.130 
think we won what is it 73 games over
the<00:00:52.829> last<00:00:52.860> two<00:00:53.160> years<00:00:53.660> some<00:00:54.660> academic

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
the last two years some academic

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.709 
the last two years some academic
recognition<00:00:55.320> but<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.969> group<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.570> particular

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
recognition but this group in particular

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.900 
recognition but this group in particular
I<00:00:58.199> think<00:00:58.289> they<00:00:58.649> handled<00:00:58.890> adversity<00:00:59.190> more<00:00:59.789> than

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
I think they handled adversity more than

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.880 
I think they handled adversity more than
any<00:01:00.030> group<00:01:00.210> we've<00:01:00.420> ever<00:01:00.539> had<00:01:00.809> we<00:01:01.739> have<00:01:01.859> a

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
any group we've ever had we have a

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.110 
any group we've ever had we have a
little<00:01:02.070> bit<00:01:02.160> more<00:01:02.280> ups<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.640> downs<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.969> deal

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
little bit more ups and downs to deal

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.240 
little bit more ups and downs to deal
with<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.780> don't<00:01:04.350> want<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.530> say<00:01:04.650> ever<00:01:04.920> but

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250

get off those clothes store you get hot

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.810 
get off those clothes store you get hot
as<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.390> could<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.080> then<00:01:13.680> you're<00:01:14.520> kind<00:01:14.729> of

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
as you could be and then you're kind of

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.340 
as you could be and then you're kind of
without<00:01:15.090> three<00:01:15.390> huge<00:01:15.659> pieces<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.200> puzzle

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
without three huge pieces of the puzzle

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.080 
without three huge pieces of the puzzle
I<00:01:16.680> mean<00:01:16.860> they<00:01:17.189> had<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.430> find<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.790> lot<00:01:17.970> about

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
I mean they had to find a lot about

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.999 
I mean they had to find a lot about
themselves<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.900> really<00:01:19.290> think<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.650> they

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
themselves and I really think that they

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.560 
themselves and I really think that they
meant<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.520> us<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.970> they<00:01:21.090> were<00:01:21.119> extremely

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
meant to us that they were extremely

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.800 
meant to us that they were extremely
tough<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.049> resilient<00:01:22.200> group<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.770> kids<00:01:23.810> him

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
tough and resilient group of kids him

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.149 
tough and resilient group of kids him
happy<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.229> do<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.409> through<00:01:25.710> some<00:01:25.860> hard<00:01:26.070> times

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
happy to do it through some hard times

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.330 
happy to do it through some hard times
really<00:01:26.640> showed<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.180> think<00:01:27.479> they<00:01:27.630> were

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
really showed that I think they were

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.859 
really showed that I think they were
they<00:01:29.340> were<00:01:29.400> exactly<00:01:29.939> what<00:01:30.060> we<00:01:30.210> needed<00:01:30.479> them<00:01:30.689> to

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
they were exactly what we needed them to

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.429 
they were exactly what we needed them to
be<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:32.000> don't<00:01:33.000> want<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.270> say<00:01:33.450> was<00:01:33.689> disappointing

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
be I don't want to say was disappointing

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.780 
be I don't want to say was disappointing
but<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.799> know<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:35.070> didn't<00:01:35.280> finish<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.670> way

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
but you know we didn't finish the way

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.480 
but you know we didn't finish the way
that<00:01:35.939> we<00:01:36.030> wanted<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.390> regardless<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.490> injuries

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
that we wanted to regardless of injuries

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.280 
that we wanted to regardless of injuries
whatever<00:01:38.880> maybe<00:01:39.150> but<00:01:39.540> while<00:01:39.960> these<00:01:40.079> young

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
whatever maybe but while these young

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.289 
whatever maybe but while these young
players<00:01:40.470> really<00:01:40.950> learn<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.369> think<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
players really learn to think the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.850
