00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
lately and uh I feel like I've gotten

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.269 
lately and uh I feel like I've gotten
weaker<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:30.359> I'm<00:00:30.420> gonna<00:00:30.570> test<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.099> theory<00:00:32.099> of

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
weaker so I'm gonna test that theory of

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.350 
weaker so I'm gonna test that theory of
mine<00:00:32.579> by<00:00:32.880> getting<00:00:33.840> on<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.930> bench<00:00:34.579> so<00:00:35.579> at<00:00:36.210> the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
mine by getting on the bench so at the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.420 
mine by getting on the bench so at the
225<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.870> 315<00:00:37.829> which<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.219> gonna<00:00:39.120> be<00:00:39.210> my<00:00:39.420> max<00:00:39.750> here

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
225 of 315 which is gonna be my max here

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.450 
225 of 315 which is gonna be my max here
it<00:00:41.430> was<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.809> lot<00:00:43.350> harder<00:00:43.379> than<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.070> thought<00:00:44.309> it

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
it was a lot harder than I thought it

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.880 
it was a lot harder than I thought it
would<00:00:44.579> be<00:00:44.670> yes<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.940> didn't<00:00:45.210> see<00:00:45.469> my<00:00:46.469> form<00:00:46.770> is

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
would be yes you didn't see my form is

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.069 
would be yes you didn't see my form is
not<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.190> great<00:00:47.370> but<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.579> did<00:00:47.879> get<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.210> up<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.570> I

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
not that great but I did get it up and I

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.299 
not that great but I did get it up and I
decided<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.469> do<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.590> again<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.860> see<00:00:49.980> if<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.160> can

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
decided to do it again and see if I can

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.490 
decided to do it again and see if I can
get<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.489> cleaner<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.899> about<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.230> same

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
get it cleaner and it's about the same

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.180 
get it cleaner and it's about the same
result<00:00:53.090> I'm<00:00:54.090> gonna<00:00:54.300> work<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:55.170> lot<00:00:55.770> more
