00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:13.709
 Serious advantages to the lot today we find ourselves 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:17.849
 for a new scudetto after a fairly long period of absence 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.599
 on fifa 11 again 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.060
 today I'm going to teach you a little technique for the arena mode 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.490
 how are markets by far ie how to get to the other part of the 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.079
 training ground 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.690
 so first of all you're going to make a penalty 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.070
 and at the moment of pulling it and you change empty side that is to say that you 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.330
 make a choice pick to listen to and you put yourself as a guardian 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.670
 at that moment you will grab the ball 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.900
 with the guardian as you saw 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.170
 alas the goalkeeper does a little anything so you'll have to wait 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.020
 for a moment why he throws the ball off the surface 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.850
 that's done 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.970
 now you're going to be tapped 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.820
 the the way balloon 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.810
 to what happens on the other side of the field 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.870
 that is to say that you will bring the ball to the place where you want and 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.040
 hit the ball with this mode players 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.450
 docu% there currently 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.920
 think I'll leave 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.540
 that's done 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.700
 I think I'm going to leave there 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.350
 toklas you come back with the guardian for a lot is the keeper who walks pretty 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.160
 weirdly do not forget that it's still 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.550
 a stutter who exploited 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.850
 so you bring it back% in the surface I do not choose the subway warned 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.530
 for not that they then stop my shot 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.160
 and there you go in attack however you are in attack you 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.760
 just tap this day 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.510
 you want to continue you platform 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.360
 and to mark 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.880
 then as I do you scoring a goal 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.170
 to have access to slow motion 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.450
 you have about 10 to have the idle to be able to see the goal that you 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.440
 have scored previously 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.099
 you put the camera on three orbiters wearing to see your goal 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.909
 you go slow 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:14.659
 early as you press delhaize politeness plants you chose 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.930
 expand change the camera and putting the myth and you select the balloon 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.279
 that you are going to follow the fifth is rare 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:24.309
 and there let you unwind and normally you will see your beginnings 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:27.889
 on the other end of the field that you put in arena 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:31.650
 so you can see now with lionel messi I put 

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:35.589
 a foot dish and the balloon that goes the levit excrement and directly into 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:36.389
 the bus 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.389
 others with this effect you can put pretty bubbles 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.279
 so here it's just a little blooper she saw the lucentis joke is 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:46.539
 happened when casting spells and techniques 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:48.559
 for 100 th the moment m 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:53.559
 the summer period will allow us to get you trapped but for those 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:56.809
 which you are you are well 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:03:00.979
 so first see you shoot your penalty when you go to hit 

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:04.779
 the ball just before you change players you take the keeper 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:08.099
 you're going to hurt at the other end of the field you come back to change 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.340
 job
