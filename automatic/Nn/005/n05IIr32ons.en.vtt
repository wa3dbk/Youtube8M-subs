 our region is actively developing 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.279
 rabbit breeding this was convinced alla 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.529
 Shatoy visited the Volkhov district 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.670
 where he has been working successfully for years 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.440
 farm 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.440
 headed by igor pillars 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.859
 Volkhov district is a peasant 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.470
 household 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.670
 Igor stolbovana this farm for breeding 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.910
 rabbits 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.300
 total livestock large three thousand 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.239
 animals for industrial production 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.550
 best breeds are used such as 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:38.010
 california and new zealand white in 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.829
 houses that are called mini farms 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.940
 rabbits of different breeds and different color and 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.340
 this male 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.430
 Viennese blue in recent years we 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.020
 were able to create 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.879
 tribal core of our farm 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.000
 roughly crush the core consists of 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.219
 European industrial breeds of rabbits 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.800
 which allowed us to achieve high 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.289
 results on when we weigh and we implement 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.690
 all the products we produce on 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.100
 our farm especially on the market 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.250
 St. Petersburg, Leningrad region 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.400
 there is a huge shortage all volume 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.280
 the market of our region is estimated order 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.610
 12 thousand tons per year today 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.710
 we make less than 500 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.939
 tons per year today we 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:27.530
 we sell about a thousand pounds of meat 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.240
 rabbits a month there is still room for growth 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.180
 nature rabbits offspring two 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.360
 once a year pedigreed animals breed 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.479
 often four times for each female in 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.490
 average is 8 rabbits leader 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.950
 Europe is Italy it produces 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.799
 about 300 thousand tons of meat per year 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.729
 rabbit meat then goes france spain 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.770
 it's somewhere around 150 thousand tons per year 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.130
 so it is now actively increased 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.579
 production hungary czech republic poland 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.040
 Yes, and they are already actively expanding in 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.960
 including our market leader of course 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.200
 Generally in the world is China by 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.349
 production does not produce about 500 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.600
 600 thousand tons of rabbit meat per year 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.150
 china manufactures 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.700
 rabbits a little bit not other breeds 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.500
 there is no meat and skins whom direction 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.640
 that is, so -called rex and 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.250
 i.e. meat quality but of course 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.650
 there is no weight at all 3 kilograms 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.250
 rabbit of course with good feed 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.240
 gaining over 90 days are needed and others 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.060
 conditions 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.700
 these animals love clean and fresh 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.850
 air smell tobacco alcohol or 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.860
 cologne for rabbit is harmful and unpleasant 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.080
 today in our region exist 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.020
 family development program 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.550
 livestock farms here we would like to 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.980
 her get there i try your own 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.290
 forces for today we prepared everything 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.020
 necessary documents and now we will 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.600
 submit to the commission we 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.360
 we want to create in our region tribal 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.100
 rabbit breed reproducer ie we 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.840
 We will not only produce meat 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.820
 rabbits but we will produce 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.930
 tribal animals that is, we would like to 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.590
 be so 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.050
 impetus for the development of rabbit breeding as 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.470
 branches in our region are born 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.900
 rabbits weighing 50 grams and for the first 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.680
 a month of life increases six times 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.770
 body weight 35 days rabbit gets 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.530
 nutritious breast milk feeding 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.600
 Once a day these animals are arranged 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.120
 for our economy is very important that for 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.310
 Recently, the state subsidizes 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.180
 feed costs since the last 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.960
 a year or two feed seriously went up 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.280
 state at the moment 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.680
 compensate 4 rubles per kilogram as well 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.140
 we are compensated for our expenses 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.870
 vehicle acquisition is 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.250
 for us all very serious support 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.910
 Of course it is interesting to engage in rural 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.340
 farm 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.450
 this work with animals we see our 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.580
 results 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.440
 we produce high quality 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.050
 products our products enjoy 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.720
 in great demand you have your own brand 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.239
 under which we sell in the city and in 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.760
 areas and buyers and know and with 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.590
 gladly buy rabbit breeding 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.440
 profitable and promising direction 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.590
 in agriculture to the difficulties you can 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.940
 attributed to the fact that in the northwest 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.790
 there is no manufacturing enterprise 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.669
 tribal young before and in the country with us 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.729
 only ten large industrial farms 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.950
 although the need for dietary products 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.410
 in the consumer market is very high 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.389
 meat output let's say rabbit specifically 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.790
 here is one working enough 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.220
 tall and they may well compete 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.620
 with any industrial enterprises where 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.419
 there is a huge mass of management 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.139
 technical staff absurd all 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:54.479
 the rest is therefore difficult to say what 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:57.000
 the future and in the whole country will be 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.340
 stand for it but share 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.560
 peasant service to protect must 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.190
 still be high enough 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.039
 what is it 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.580
 and high production and 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:10.260
 performance three high returns and 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.560
 there is also employment that 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.889
 wore unfortunately very 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.470
 work like soul because 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:20.710
 specialty is minimal here unfortunately 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.150
 enterprise social education 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.700
 means administration and rural 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.320
 household that well someone mechanic 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.050
 someone's driver is farther what is all 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.550
 so here you can beekeeping 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.710
 develop her blood to lead and 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.810
 poultry and everything that wants to land on 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.669
 Weakly enough we are ready to provide 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.010
 we were only willing for this and 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.230
 need all the same relevant conditions 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:45.260
 believe while we hold the belly on 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.770
 enthusiasts of some peasant development 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.970
 family farms task 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.220
 national importance because from 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:55.160
 successful operation of the rural sector 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:58.240
 farming in the outback depends on life and 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.240
 people's well-being
