00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
some future baseman comes out with a

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.990 
some future baseman comes out with a
critical<00:03:15.799> fix<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:16.340> won't<00:03:16.519> be<00:03:16.639> able<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:16.849> update

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
critical fix you won't be able to update

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.819 
critical fix you won't be able to update
it<00:03:17.299> to<00:03:17.329> a<00:03:17.419> different<00:03:17.630> mains<00:03:17.900> down<00:03:18.169> in<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:18.590> five

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
it to a different mains down in the five

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.879 
it to a different mains down in the five
so<00:03:19.130> basically<00:03:19.639> that<00:03:19.700> means<00:03:19.819> if<00:03:20.569> a<00:03:20.989> something

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
so basically that means if a something

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.159 
so basically that means if a something
goes<00:03:22.099> massively<00:03:22.609> wrong<00:03:22.880> with<00:03:23.419> the<00:03:23.720> iphones
