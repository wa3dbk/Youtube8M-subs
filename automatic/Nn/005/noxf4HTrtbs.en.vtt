game of capture the flag on highrise
this<00:00:06.240> is<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.509> game<00:00:06.660> I<00:00:06.810> talked<00:00:07.080> about<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.680> few

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
this is the game I talked about a few

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.540 
this is the game I talked about a few
videos<00:00:08.760> ago<00:00:08.910> where<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:10.130> well<00:00:11.130> essentially

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
videos ago where I a well essentially

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.400 
videos ago where I a well essentially
someone<00:00:12.330> on<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.509> other<00:00:12.540> team<00:00:12.690> was<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.019> network

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
someone on the other team was a network

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.140 
someone on the other team was a network
manipulating<00:00:14.130> so<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:14.460> everyone<00:00:14.700> except<00:00:15.000> in

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
manipulating so that everyone except in

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.460 
manipulating so that everyone except in
wasn't<00:00:15.420> liking<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.870> can<00:00:15.990> seem<00:00:16.199> they're

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
wasn't liking you can seem they're

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.300 
wasn't liking you can seem they're
already<00:00:16.800> with<00:00:17.070> full<00:00:17.400> grain<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:18.600> was<00:00:18.779> lmc<00:00:19.740> RS

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
already with full grain it was lmc RS

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.960 
already with full grain it was lmc RS
and<00:00:21.859> the<00:00:22.859> reason<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.160> think<00:00:23.369> he<00:00:23.519> was<00:00:23.640> now<00:00:23.820> at

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
and the reason I think he was now at

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.529 
and the reason I think he was now at
manipulating<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:25.699> because<00:00:26.699> look<00:00:27.119> what<00:00:27.359> is

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
manipulating is because look what is

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.519 
manipulating is because look what is
happening<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:29.510> normally<00:00:30.510> when<00:00:31.019> stuff<00:00:31.439> like

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
happening and normally when stuff like

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.229 
happening and normally when stuff like
this<00:00:31.619> happens<00:00:31.769> on<00:00:32.099> one<00:00:32.250> more<00:00:32.399> for<00:00:32.610> two<00:00:32.790> it's

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
this happens on one more for two it's

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.360 
this happens on one more for two it's
not<00:00:33.390> nearly<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.840> bad<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.710> kicks<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
not nearly this bad and it kicks the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.690 
not nearly this bad and it kicks the
person<00:00:35.850> whose<00:00:36.630> host<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.579> can

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
person whose host it is so that it can

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.540 
person whose host it is so that it can
give<00:00:38.850> someone<00:00:39.059> else<00:00:39.270> who's<00:00:39.480> but<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:40.050> was<00:00:40.230> just

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
give someone else who's but it was just

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.670 
give someone else who's but it was just
unbearable<00:00:41.550> lag<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.300> all<00:00:43.110> he<00:00:43.260> was<00:00:43.379> doing<00:00:43.440> was

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
unbearable lag and all he was doing was

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.910 
unbearable lag and all he was doing was
capturing<00:00:44.399> flags<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.230> yeah<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.289> can<00:00:46.590> see<00:00:46.710> that

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
capturing flags so yeah you can see that

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.720 
capturing flags so yeah you can see that
everyone<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:47.940> red<00:00:48.539> bar<00:00:48.750> except<00:00:49.590> em<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.700> I

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
everyone is red bar except em and so I

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.180 
everyone is red bar except em and so I
was<00:00:51.079> sitting<00:00:52.079> here<00:00:52.289> waiting<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.739> see<00:00:52.920> if<00:00:52.949> I

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
was sitting here waiting to see if I

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.799 
was sitting here waiting to see if I
could<00:00:53.250> like<00:00:53.579> kidnap<00:00:54.210> as<00:00:54.300> he<00:00:54.390> grabbed<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> flag

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
could like kidnap as he grabbed the flag

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.439 
could like kidnap as he grabbed the flag
but<00:00:55.199> i<00:00:55.230> think<00:00:55.469> i<00:00:55.699> failed<00:00:56.699> twice<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.360> then

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
but i think i failed twice and then

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.920 
but i think i failed twice and then
eventually<00:00:57.859> cuz<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.520> was<00:00:59.670> lagging<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.570> hard

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
eventually cuz it was lagging so hard

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.319 
eventually cuz it was lagging so hard
i'm<00:01:01.590> only<00:01:01.770> read<00:01:01.980> by<00:01:02.129> there<00:01:02.340> but<00:01:02.520> no<00:01:03.059> one<00:01:03.180> else

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
i'm only read by there but no one else

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.859 
i'm only read by there but no one else
on<00:01:03.449> my<00:01:03.510> team<00:01:03.539> could<00:01:03.870> move<00:01:04.080> either<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.820> i<00:01:05.869> know

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
on my team could move either so i know

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.469 
on my team could move either so i know
that<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.950> wasn't<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.490> me<00:01:08.670> lagging<00:01:09.210> plus

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
that it wasn't just me lagging plus

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.719 
that it wasn't just me lagging plus
because<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.560> was<00:01:10.890> going<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.549> off<00:01:11.700> and

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
because it was going on and off and

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.280 
because it was going on and off and
nothing<00:01:12.360> else<00:01:12.479> was<00:01:12.659> happening<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:13.049> my<00:01:13.140> house

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290

internet rated anyway i do get a
european<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.290> game<00:01:16.439> without<00:01:16.530> dying<00:01:16.860> which<00:01:17.250> i

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
european this game without dying which i

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.649 
european this game without dying which i
thought<00:01:17.460> was<00:01:17.549> pretty<00:01:17.670> good<00:01:17.909> that's<00:01:18.420> why<00:01:18.540> i'm

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
thought was pretty good that's why i'm

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.350 
thought was pretty good that's why i'm
posting<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.430> though<00:01:20.430> i<00:01:20.460> do<00:01:20.580> eventually<00:01:20.909> die

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
posting it though i do eventually die

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.969 
posting it though i do eventually die
and<00:01:21.570> i<00:01:21.630> cough<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.259> video<00:01:22.500> after<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.799> get<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
and i cough the video after you get the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.560 
and i cough the video after you get the
EMP<00:01:23.310> because<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.610> just<00:01:23.700> comes<00:01:23.939> boy<00:01:24.150> after<00:01:24.330> i

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
EMP because it just comes boy after i

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.030 
EMP because it just comes boy after i
get<00:01:24.750> like<00:01:24.840> eight<00:01:25.080> more<00:01:25.229> kills<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.680> four

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
get like eight more kills and four

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.080 
get like eight more kills and four
deaths<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.729> um<00:01:27.770> anyway<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.700> reason<00:01:29.820> I'm<00:01:30.060> using

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
deaths so um anyway the reason I'm using

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.510 
deaths so um anyway the reason I'm using
EMP<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.869> what<00:01:31.770> some<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.310> are<00:01:32.400> probably

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
EMP is what some of you are probably

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.179 
EMP is what some of you are probably
aware<00:01:32.759> from<00:01:33.210> previous<00:01:33.900> videos<00:01:34.170> but<00:01:34.409> i<00:01:34.829> was

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
aware from previous videos but i was

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.310 
aware from previous videos but i was
getting<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.460> EMP<00:01:35.909> emblem<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.840> prestige<00:01:37.290> that

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
getting the EMP emblem the prestige that

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.380 
getting the EMP emblem the prestige that
this<00:01:37.619> was<00:01:38.400> recorded<00:01:38.579> which<00:01:38.970> are<00:01:39.090> second<00:01:39.420> and

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
this was recorded which are second and

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.940 
this was recorded which are second and
so<00:01:42.390> that's<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.960> only<00:01:43.079> reason<00:01:43.170> I'm<00:01:43.380> using<00:01:43.409> EMP

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
so that's the only reason I'm using EMP

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.170 
so that's the only reason I'm using EMP
I<00:01:43.979> don't<00:01:44.220> know<00:01:44.340> what<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.460> use<00:01:44.579> them<00:01:44.759> cuz<00:01:44.880> Nathan

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
I don't know what I use them cuz Nathan

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.310 
I don't know what I use them cuz Nathan
yeah<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.450> already<00:01:45.720> see<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:45.990> everyone's

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
yeah you already see that everyone's

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.840 
yeah you already see that everyone's
quitting<00:01:46.710> because<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.920> like<00:01:47.189> some<00:01:47.430> barrel<00:01:47.729> but

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
quitting because I like some barrel but

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.899 
quitting because I like some barrel but
it's<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.000> 2v2<00:01:48.329> number<00:01:49.159> and<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:51.060> just<00:01:51.299> doesn't

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.270 
it's a 2v2 number and you just doesn't
I<00:01:52.969> someone<00:01:53.869> fun<00:01:54.109> is<00:01:54.229> it<00:01:54.409> finally<00:01:54.710> finishes<00:01:55.069> him

I someone fun is it finally finishes him
and<00:01:55.520> I<00:01:55.549> think<00:01:55.609> this<00:01:55.880> is<00:01:55.939> where<00:01:56.210> kind<00:01:57.109> of<00:01:57.229> stops

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
and I think this is where kind of stops

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.809 
and I think this is where kind of stops
and<00:01:57.590> lagging<00:01:57.920> a<00:01:58.159> bit<00:01:58.189> oh<00:01:58.520> no<00:01:59.479> oh<00:02:00.460> now<00:02:01.460> he's<00:02:01.609> dead

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
and lagging a bit oh no oh now he's dead

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.410 
and lagging a bit oh no oh now he's dead
so<00:02:02.509> yeah<00:02:02.859> pretty<00:02:03.859> epic<00:02:04.069> lag<00:02:04.460> unless<00:02:05.090> we<00:02:05.240> said

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
so yeah pretty epic lag unless we said

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.400 
so yeah pretty epic lag unless we said
said<00:02:05.990> no<00:02:06.649> hey<00:02:07.009> MP<00:02:07.490> it<00:02:07.729> I<00:02:08.599> think<00:02:09.170> it<00:02:09.259> should<00:02:09.379> be

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
said no hey MP it I think it should be

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.490 
said no hey MP it I think it should be
on<00:02:09.590> our<00:02:09.739> way<00:02:09.769> less<00:02:10.489> kill<00:02:11.030> Street<00:02:11.330> Gordon<00:02:11.840> 15<00:02:12.200> or

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
on our way less kill Street Gordon 15 or

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.589 
on our way less kill Street Gordon 15 or
should<00:02:12.980> be<00:02:13.190> better<00:02:13.370> like<00:02:13.849> last<00:02:14.150> longer

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
should be better like last longer

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.229 
should be better like last longer
because<00:02:15.530> still<00:02:16.459> really<00:02:16.700> easy<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:17.090> shoot

number at the end of my youtube username

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.949 
number at the end of my youtube username
is<00:02:40.579> my<00:02:40.819> year<00:02:40.970> but<00:02:41.299> i<00:02:41.480> am<00:02:42.010> 17<00:02:43.010> because<00:02:43.459> someone

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
is my year but i am 17 because someone

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.150 
is my year but i am 17 because someone
recently<00:02:44.959> thought<00:02:45.319> I<00:02:45.349> was<00:02:45.470> 15<00:02:45.829> for<00:02:46.040> some

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
recently thought I was 15 for some

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.410 
recently thought I was 15 for some
reason<00:02:46.459> only<00:02:47.209> because<00:02:47.420> of<00:02:47.599> where<00:02:48.440> I<00:02:48.470> sound<00:02:48.769> but

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
reason only because of where I sound but

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.150 
reason only because of where I sound but
don't<00:02:50.420> have<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.870> particularly<00:02:51.560> high<00:02:51.680> voice<00:02:51.890> and

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
don't have a particularly high voice and

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.550 
don't have a particularly high voice and
if<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.400> sounds<00:02:52.730> like<00:02:53.239> I<00:02:53.390> do<00:02:53.450> at<00:02:53.629> all<00:02:53.810> then<00:02:54.200> I

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
if that sounds like I do at all then I

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.250 
if that sounds like I do at all then I
guess<00:02:55.220> that's<00:02:55.579> just<00:02:55.810> because<00:02:56.810> you're<00:02:57.049> hearing

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
guess that's just because you're hearing

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.900 
guess that's just because you're hearing
me<00:02:57.290> through<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.650> internet<00:02:57.980> people's<00:02:58.760> voice

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
probably aware pretty much the most

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.690 
probably aware pretty much the most
powerful<00:04:38.570> man<00:04:38.750> in<00:04:38.810> the<00:04:38.930> game<00:04:39.190> you<00:04:40.190> can<00:04:40.370> kill

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
powerful man in the game you can kill

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.320 
powerful man in the game you can kill
him<00:04:40.850> across<00:04:41.030> map<00:04:41.300> with<00:04:41.450> it<00:04:41.570> this<00:04:41.840> anyway<00:04:42.200> and

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
him across map with it this anyway and

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.150 
him across map with it this anyway and
it's<00:04:44.330> just<00:04:44.630> so<00:04:45.020> problem<00:04:45.350> but<00:04:45.620> i<00:04:45.650> don't<00:04:45.890> really

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
it's just so problem but i don't really

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.390 
it's just so problem but i don't really
isn't<00:04:46.820> that<00:04:46.910> much<00:04:47.000> because<00:04:47.270> it<00:04:47.800> I<00:04:48.800> think<00:04:49.280> it's

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
isn't that much because it I think it's

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.750 
isn't that much because it I think it's
tiny<00:04:50.240> bit<00:04:50.390> overpowered<00:04:51.490> but<00:04:52.490> then<00:04:52.640> again

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
tiny bit overpowered but then again

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.980 
tiny bit overpowered but then again
there's<00:04:53.060> quite<00:04:53.180> a<00:04:53.240> lot<00:04:53.330> of<00:04:53.480> stuff<00:04:53.780> in<00:04:53.900> this

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
there's quite a lot of stuff in this

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.980 
there's quite a lot of stuff in this
game<00:04:54.200> it's<00:04:54.380> still<00:04:54.560> broken<00:04:54.950> and<00:04:55.220> overpowered

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
game it's still broken and overpowered

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.260 
game it's still broken and overpowered
and<00:04:56.990> he<00:04:57.740> started<00:04:58.070> know<00:04:58.700> it<00:04:58.850> when<00:04:58.940> it<00:04:59.060> appears

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
and he started know it when it appears

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.610 
and he started know it when it appears
again<00:04:59.510> I<00:04:59.660> honestly<00:04:59.990> don't<00:05:00.110> think<00:05:00.230> it<00:05:00.410> was<00:05:00.500> just

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
again I honestly don't think it was just

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.160 
again I honestly don't think it was just
lag<00:05:00.860> because<00:05:01.360> here<00:05:02.360> we<00:05:02.420> haven't<00:05:02.600> kicked<00:05:02.780> for

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
lag because here we haven't kicked for

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.920 
lag because here we haven't kicked for
having<00:05:03.410> a<00:05:03.470> terrible<00:05:03.710> connection<00:05:04.130> and<00:05:04.810> it<00:05:05.810> was

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
having a terrible connection and it was

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.510 
having a terrible connection and it was
going<00:05:06.200> on<00:05:06.350> and<00:05:06.530> off<00:05:06.680> it<00:05:06.950> was<00:05:07.160> going<00:05:07.370> between

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
going on and off it was going between

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.540 
going on and off it was going between
like<00:05:08.210> a<00:05:08.420> very<00:05:08.750> very<00:05:09.080> nice<00:05:09.320> connection<00:05:09.740> very

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
like a very very nice connection very

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.300
