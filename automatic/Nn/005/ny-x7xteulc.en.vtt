00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.620
 yes hello martin we are here 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.179
 pannoniaring 2000 at skate of mine 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.490
 baby or in front of our baby for the 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.509
 season 2013 2014 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.980
 we have some 6000 for 1000 ps 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.410
 editorial fleet was the requirement 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.630
 Clearly we needed a vehicle that 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.880
 tire tests is easy to drive 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.010
 less effort is needed anyway 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.840
 the performance I have from the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.779
 rescue there is machine buys from 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.619
 to you and you to performance 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.690
 brought 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.480
 you then set up the vehicle and 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.969
 almost victorious where they are the essential 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.739
 points where you attend start project 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.540
 become so important in such 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.399
 Motorcycles especially in the upper 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.260
 kubatur in the area is always the 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.059
 driveability the performance is actually 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.940
 so always a bit in the background 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.800
 because the normal driver with this 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.960
 These engines are more than overtaxed 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.090
 This is usually important 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.100
 that the driver knows well what 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.170
 passes under one and all is well, the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.670
 each put on the actual value 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.680
 so you also the most diverse 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.189
 Test and try tire systems well 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.780
 can 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.670
 Of course it is all the more important that 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.130
 It is a good mobile property 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.950
 shows the motorcycle in the chassis 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.590
 In the end, not great 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.409
 we have conjured behind all sticks 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.479
 shock absorber installed with a special 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.540
 vote inside on ours 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.070
 fast nils was tuned exactly 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.930
 have front fork on the series 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.720
 put on and have only the inner ones 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.970
 revised we have here the 30 mm 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.720
 patrick system for oil incorporated in the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.850
 have a very very good one 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.000
 Adjustment range or very good 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.619
 technically we have performance engine 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.990
 a vote made 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.360
 we have a complete system of 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.280
 akrapovic mounted on it knows us 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.049
 Immediately on the test bench that also the mixture 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.850
 then in an area not wander the 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.560
 really optimal, it is lean heavily cs 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.360
 then will be very cordial to drive 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.380
 again with the corresponding vote 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.360
 our test bench with the power 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.799
 commander is capable of a complete 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.049
 map in a very short time too 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.670
 Generate around the drivability 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.140
 to do very well again that we have 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.969
 not just an increase in performance 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.490
 achieved with it but also a very 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.860
 very good driveability and that 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.420
 good responsiveness of motor in the 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.800
 The end effect is that around and on is special 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.959
 on race tracks as you have the 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.640
 pannonia ring here completely from very 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.709
 tight curves out and here it is 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.209
 responsiveness actually around and 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.800
 on for around quickly be 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.810
 thus actually have completely great 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.840
 package put on the feet what 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.580
 actually exactly ideal for everyone 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.080
 hobby riders and fun riders we have 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.599
 work very well controllable 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.459
 is very very uncomplicated in the 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.650
 Handling We have a motor of 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.420
 Vorhauser at the Suzuki very pleasant 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.519
 to drive it with refined again 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.200
 the vote with open breakout 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.269
 have made accordingly adjusted the 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.620
 Lighter the motorcycle performance 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.510
 of course, has risen again 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.890
 and we have it especially for you 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.769
 will be more comfortable one more 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.420
 automatic switching machines built in the 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.310
 end effect does not represent much effort 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.890
 if you have the power commander inside 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.420
 you need in the end only one 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.130
 Breaker sensor in the switching point 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.200
 install and thus has in the end a 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.549
 tunable automatic switch in power 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.680
 Commander already included 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.530
 ok and the pictures yesterday so 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.360
 driven 40 and west 10 15 rounds today 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.100
 and I have had to say I'm scared 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.239
 many have been traveling since june 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.049
 I had the problem that makes me 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.370
 very tired 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.989
 at exactly the partial load bayha 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.049
 Catastrophes and I fall on the 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.290
 dish area why do not do that 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.260
 all the users logically that 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.060
 important is I am your motorcycle 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.849
 drove is so good but the top out 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.170
 still super soft at 10% 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.480
 Actually, we speak the better 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.859
 serial machine you have to say that 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.510
 so vote throughout 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.819
 teillastbereich to talk always of 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.709
 complete map is the generate 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.840
 very much effort is needed 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.099
 in the end corresponding test bench 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.599
 equipment under the corresponding 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.790
 software equipment i have 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.750
 Automatic calibration chair with me 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.170
 those with the power commander 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.689
 communicate and I can always speak 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.700
 in the current driver of the motorcycle at 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:59.920
 the operating states the mapping online 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.109
 Immediately update that means I have 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.150
 I put a dimension on it 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.010
 Immediately detect the exhaust gas levels and can 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.540
 while driving through in the dynamic 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.609
 accelerate at each throttle 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.650
 adjust the mapping immediately 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.870
 means I have a realtime bidding and 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.479
 We have invested a lot in this regard 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.349
 with us for this voting result 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:22.449
 also to have with us and that is why it is 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:24.599
 us possible complete sequence and 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:27.070
 complete polls within 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:28.630
 two and a half hours to drive out 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.130
 and not just the publishing area 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.409
 to vote but by far 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.720
 more important part- load area at 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:36.400
 Stammtisch the 180 ps you im in me 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.500
 Of course, her background is the same 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.300
 important but counting on the track is 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.820
 what you test chart only partially 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.860
 can recognize if you maybe to 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.690
 chassis was there'm surprised 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.220
 now driven the british formula 1 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.020
 the new slicks from the war stood the 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.240
 first work for the g6 in the tire test 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.830
 and tarek is in austria was fix and 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.400
 completed but never such a beautiful mature 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.690
 seen 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.220
 So I myself have the tool 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.630
 attacked the vehicle you're never 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.610
 driven as it is tuned 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.620
 either what luck or how it is 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.789
 he succeeds after having many 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.440
 manufacturer very intense 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:07.720
 also worked in the 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.090
 of course , I have a lot of development 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.039
 a lot of data and experiences about the 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.300
 current sport motorcycles that is me 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.510
 I'm basically in a position 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.460
 away from the stain is pretty good 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.810
 to be able to install dingler without that 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.980
 now myself rider I have a lot 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.740
 many data very many records 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.820
 I'm with the GSX over the winter 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.420
 I also very many test drives 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.070
 done 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.200
 This already knows which geometry 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.310
 works well as the place of the motorcycle 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.470
 in front of house that it was already from 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.510
 Handling well fits this basic data 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.060
 are in and of course ahead of course 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.530
 every driver as well as his idiosyncrasies 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.610
 then in the end in retrospect 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.330
 still from eating to rectify and 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.850
 readjust 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:45.000
 but mostly at least that's in the 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.800
 from the ground already a setting out 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.080
 to ask where the normal driver think 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.390
 I'm pretty happy and very good 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.710
 comes clearly and you say that yourself 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.360
 it in and of itself very pleasant too 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.120
 drive is and I think that the clock 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.680
 something very meaningless is something 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.320
 you have a very large bandwidth 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.200
 drivers in the end he embodies the 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.480
 meaningful lap times like right 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.130
 do you have four called modules with the 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.920
 You have the development stage last year 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.840
 tried 155 currently heard 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.980
 possible the Rhaetian theoretically 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.560
 build gaza building office 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:19.080
 we have something with another 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.280
 remember in my last before two 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.770
 years in raidwangen quite big 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.030
 made a comparative test and then there must 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.560
 you try to the top too 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.540
 we have the first step 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.430
 the series bike compared with each other 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.530
 second stage was slight revision 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.600
 of landing gear and tuning of engine 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.270
 and then we went on 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.820
 especially with the kawasaki because it 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.290
 at the time it worked well and still 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.660
 once tried how can how far can 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:44.430
 such a vehicle without a big one 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.800
 actually bring in from the intervention 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.080
 lap time and bite in the end 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.870
 with the kawasaki with the stem 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.340
 Optimized landing gear and made it 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.680
 not made motors optimized 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.660
 engine with power commander tuning in 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.030
 end up around 154 times here 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.290
 come down and it is I have to say
