 evil revelations 2 after that in the 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.960
 The first part will try to recover the 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.090
 essence of the classic horror survival 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.640
 the sequels remedy some errors 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.160
 to satisfy the fans get ready 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.260
 for scares more exploration and a 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.560
 story that leaves you on fire until the 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.560
 final 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:03.970
 but not yours is all you need 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.970
 this resentful to succeed 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.899
 hey that's a guard daughter 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.210
 claire redfield returns to the room with 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.189
 resident evil revelations 2 from 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.799
 resident evil code veronica not the 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.240
 we saw in action now works for the 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.069
 organization against bioterrorism 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.960
 terra safe have done your homework 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.020
 other invasions of privacy we have 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.420
 I have to take care of terrassa 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.789
 we have enemies does not come back alone too 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.100
 appears on scene barry burton an old 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.439
 known to the team stars how it 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.479
 relate these two characters believe 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.970
 who is kidnapped next to moira, daughter of 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.700
 barry at a party are brought to a 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.039
 island to submit them to an experiment in 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.890
 As for Burton, he goes to the island looking for 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.140
 of his daughter on his arrival he meets natalia 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.319
 an abandoned girl who hides a 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.319
 secret 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.909
 because if the game was commercialized in 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.010
 digital format and deliveries there 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.560
 that you have opted for a structure of 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.869
 chapters now the title is sold in 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.120
 disk with all the downloadable extras 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.490
 thanks to this system you get 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.440
 keep interest and intrigue the 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.050
 The only problem with this saga is that the 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.750
 history is so entangled that in the end it is 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.820
 difficult to understand it in this case the plot 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.240
 is between the fifth and the sixth 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.240
 part 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.780
 opt for an improved system that already 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.120
 used in resident evil hero and that supposed 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.640
 a new direction in the gameplay the 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.980
 plot is played by teams clair and moira 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.830
 they form one while barry and natalia 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.660
 another redfield and burton are used in the 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.640
 moments of action while dying and 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.400
 natalia are employed for exploration 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.680
 very it uses its lever to open doors 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.050
 and trunks and their flashlight to find 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.880
 Hidden objects and blind enemies 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.400
 natalia thanks to his special powers 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.800
 apart from finding elements in the 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.319
 darkness also detects the zombies and 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.959
 perceive their weaknesses both also 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.269
 help in critical moments attack and 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.970
 Sanan there is no doubt that this mechanics 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:19.060
 gives a certain strategic touch to the 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:23.140
 delivery of the saga resident and vossloh 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.940
 understand without solving riddles 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.800
 they abound more than in the first delivery 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.440
 but they are too easy if you 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.780
 compare with the classic titles other 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.340
 of the pillars is the exploration 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.410
 the pasillero effect persists but it is 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.110
 true that you have to dig deeper into 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.990
 wider scenarios we face 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.420
 prisons factories sewers towns 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.400
 abandoned and forests there is variety of 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.650
 sites but the problem is that 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.900
 the places we visit are repeated 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.750
 when the chapter is played with barry and 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.430
 natalia notwithstanding some actions that 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.650
 we take although minimal can 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.360
 influence our other two 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.959
 companions when they go through the same 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.959
 site 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.420
 What we like most is that we have chosen 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.400
 by zombies that look like those 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.739
 we saw in the first deliveries of 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.739
 playstation in this case they are called 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.320
 afflicted move and attack faster 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.360
 with basic weapons as you move 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.910
 so new enemies appear with 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.620
 rare and more difficult mutations but not 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.870
 they become as rare as those that 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.180
 they appeared in resident evil revelations 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.280
 to combat them we have the 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.229
 well-known workshop tables to improve 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.240
 our armament with pieces there 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.610
 variety of weapons but nothing out of the 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.710
 normal our skills are also 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.960
 can improve thanks to careful 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.960
 hidden or prizes that grant us 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.920
 and the game is arguably ere 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.020
 playable to the maximum part of overcoming 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.630
 our game time against the clock 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.390
 find hidden objects and graffiti 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.700
 point out the challenges the extra content 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.920
 unlockable and extra game modes 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.680
 as assault mode with a quantity 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.110
 unimaginable extra content can be 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.640
 play both online and offline quality 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.190
 that you can not say that you have the 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.020
 cooperative adventure in this case only 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.040
 you can play from the living room 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.040
 for the same 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.250
 a graphic portent and the 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.200
 new generation especially noticeable in 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.970
 the quality of the videos that approve 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.430
 with a note but they do not get the 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.290
 outstanding although there is one other 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.720
 scare we lack a more environment 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:42.840
 terrifying what does help for 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.030
 get it is the soundtrack 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.400
 recent and you revelations two is approaching 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.830
 what we expected to be the return of 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.290
 the Sardinians value this delivery incorporates 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.900
 more puzzles more exploration and a touch 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:57.150
 scary but innovation is the 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.310
 leaves on the way pity that has not been 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.590
 boosted online cooperative in the 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.660
 adventure when other deliveries and what 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.210
 incorporate and that the graphic quality of 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.720
 the new generation are not exploited as 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.720
 It's due 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.150
 Y 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.960
 of zombies and characters from the saga what 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.960
 will star 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.680
 how
