00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.060
 windows 8 control panel 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.630
 and we go to where it says sources 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.450
 if they can not seek it from up here 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.700

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:16.080
 100% tells us that I already download it we look 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.140
 and as they see the right charges open it 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.990
 from your browser you can preferably 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.290
 be culturally flórez mozilla like 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.290

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.290
 x 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.050
 introduction 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:38.220
 then let's give it right click 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.320
 extract seen impact if they do not have winrar 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.890
 I also leave you so that you 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.860
 do in a way so that it leaves in the 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.810
 wing rar as you want 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.500
 what 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.500
 load 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.700
 and here we have it for you while 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.620
 sources we go here and here we have them 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.620
 as I told you there are two ways to do it 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.670
 in the control panel and the other one is 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.490
 activating 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.490
 let's get it 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.900
 double click to see what kind of font 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.079
 It is our 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:26.700
 as in this wait I can do it 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:30.790
 dragging it to start installing 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.530
 and here in the future we will look for it 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.549
 and here in boots I can write 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.549
 anything 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.790
 as you see it is in the type of source 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.370
 pink dog let's make an example of 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.930
 how can we also do the other 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.550
 how to install it 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:57.820
 it's like I said let's look at what kind 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:01.540
 from sources ok if we like we click 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:03.850
 right and where it says install remember 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.120
 he said two packages one thousand and one of 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.120
 500 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:20.090
 he is the true god 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.090
 and the uncertain 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:31.979
 and here they have it is the same so 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.259
 can do with all these sources that 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.479
 I leave you below if you want 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:39.449
 do it with all simply controls 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:42.000
 and drag it to this package or control and 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:44.159
 if you want to install these videos them 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.020
 has been of your interest and that we see 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:48.449
 in social networks they can write 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.639
 by facebook twitter google + or by 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:54.289
