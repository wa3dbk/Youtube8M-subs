00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.500
 daughter brand of annual food today 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:14.950
 Let's make a chili con carne sauce 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.870
 That's how chili con carne is 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.490
 One can use well too hot dogs too 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.200
 you can do it on chips 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.120
 You can also have it for chili cheese 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.640
 Making noodles as a kind of polonaise 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.990
 Replacement very quickly 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.990
 and that's why I want them once 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:33.760
 make before and as always at the bottom 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.530
 me for our quick chili con carne 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.640
 sauce I have here a pot with hot 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.640
 Fat is a shock 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:02.440
 sautÃ© with normal oil 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:17.090
 at the beginning of the more common if you 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:26.780
 After a long trend in the direction of getting enough fat 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:31.130
 from which then did not happen and super 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.640
 now two small cut ones 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.640
 pure onions 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.190
 the sun seemed to be searing and 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:52.670
 at the same time a bit of her juice 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.670
 give up on their liquid 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.470
 The meat already has if I have 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.979
 get it enough for me now it works 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.979
 spice up 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:15.800
 since we talk about a genius I have 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:27.000
 Here chillies are bells and come 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:29.569
 then you need three nice tablespoons 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.569
 we salt 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.060
 a teaspoon teaspoon of salt 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.980
 We manufacture all a bit 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.390
 put down now on 2 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:24.670
 we also need a teaspoon 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:27.540
 garlic powder and here it comes 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.540
 tomatenmark 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.209
 three tablespoons 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:53.810
 and 250 milliliters of water and let that 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:04:03.189
 We now lead now and let 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:03.189
 then simmer for 10 to 15 minutes 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.900
 but that's not enough for me 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.590
 red color so I'm doing good again 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.590
 it afterwards 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:47.530
 and another 50 milliliters of water 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:50.970
 that would be 300 are always this one 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:56.919
 little matter of taste 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:57.970
 How fluent it was to be able to do 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.410
 I will be with me again later 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.539
 but you do not have to cover up 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.729
 absolutely the whole now as I said 15 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.509
 Simmer for 20 minutes on a low heat 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.030
 to let 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:11.229
 and then the chili con carne sauce 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.789
 already finished the sauce has now 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.340
 the consistency as I have the one I have 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.840
 would like to prepare chili con carne so 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.580
 Not so change is the right one 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.900
 chili con carne do not read any soil in it 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.520
 this is his spicy minced meat sauce 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.500
 Keep chili con carne sauce because you 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.090
 very sharp has the right one 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.099
 consistency for example then 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.780
 wonderful to eat noodles or how 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:34.570
 I did it for the sauce now 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.360
 for a key lock so a hot dog 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.910
 with chilli sauce on top or for chili 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.720
 I'll make both of these cheese pommes again 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:46.570
 to prepare the chili there as well as the 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:49.630
 chili cheese pommes and this is it 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:51.400
 Sauce ideally suited or 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.409
 to noodle again or just 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.110
 for dipping with bread in the evening with friends 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:58.270
 or with friends at the table 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:02.260
 TV watching a football game when watching 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:04.870

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.520
 carne as fast as I have shown 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.930

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.120
 goes and you can do it universally 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.449
 use as I said to noodle and 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:16.510
 Here's a chili there 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:20.770

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:26.099
