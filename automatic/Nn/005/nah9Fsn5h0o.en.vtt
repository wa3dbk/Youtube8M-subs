00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.680
 chapter 16 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.520
 today a great voice that said from the temple to the seven angels and branches 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:10.519
 above the earth the seven bowls of God's wrath 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:21.189
 he was the first and poured out his cup on the earth and there came a malignant ulcer and 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.409
 pestilent about men who had the mark of the beast and who adored their 

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:28.409
 image 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.350
 the second angel poured out his cup on the sea 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.050
 that became blood as dead and died every living thing that had 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.050
 at sea 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.240
 they will be near your bouquets over the rivers 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.760
 and over the sources of the waters and they turned into blood 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.630
 and today the angel of the waters that said just he was the one who 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.910
 heresi you were 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.960
 because to his degree these things 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.820
 because they shed the blood of the saints and the prophets I also had 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.820
 you have given them to drink blood because they deserve it 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.710
 there was also another who from the altar said 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.810
 certainly lord almighty god 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.010
 his judgments are true and just 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.670
 the fourth angel poured out his cup on the sun which was given to burn the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.670
 men with fire 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.979
 the men were burned with the great heat and blas burned the name of god 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.480
 who has power over these plagues and did not repent to give him glory 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.530
 the fifth angel poured out his cup on the throne of the beast 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.259
 murray was not covered with darkness and his tongues did not see him in pain and 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.400
 blasphemed against the god of heaven for his pains and for his ultras 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.400
 and they did not repent of their works 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.980
 the angel sex shed his cup on the great euphrates river and the water of this 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.590
 cease so that the way to the kings of the east was prepared 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.969
 and I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and from the mouth of the 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:40.609
 and from the mouth of the false prophet 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:45.459
 three unclean spirits like frogs because they are spirits of demons 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.779
 they make signs they went to the kings of the earth all over the world to 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:53.069
 gather them to the battle of that great day of the Almighty God 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.679
 here I come as a thief 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:05.689
 Blessed is he who watches and keeps his clothes 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:09.019
 so that he does not walk naked and see his shame 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.269
 and he gathered them in the place that in Hebrew is called armageddon 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:19.339
 the seventh angel poured his cup through the air 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:23.759
 came out a great voice from the temple of the throne heaven saying I've done this 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:29.979
 there was lightning and voices and thunder and a great earthquake an earthquake 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:34.059
 so great which was never there since men have been on the 

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:37.059
 land 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.790
 and the big city was divided into three parts 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.109
 and the cities of the nations fell 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:49.869
 and the great vilonia came in memory of them before giving it the chalice of the 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:51.799
 it came from the ardor of his life 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.089
 and every island fled and the mountains were not found 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:00.180
 and an enormous hail fell from heaven upon men, as of the weight of a 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.109
 talent 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:05.930
 and men blaspheme a contradict by the plague of hail because their plaque 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:06.799
 it was exceedingly
