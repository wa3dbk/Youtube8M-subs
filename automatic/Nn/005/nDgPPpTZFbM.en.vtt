there's<00:00:48.930> just<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.230> few<00:00:49.440> rules<00:00:49.500> when<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.129> grow

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
there's just a few rules when you grow

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.189 
there's just a few rules when you grow
them<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.149> should<00:00:51.329> follow<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:52.050> it's

totally<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.140> dying<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.949> has<00:00:56.100> done<00:00:56.760> its<00:00:56.910> time

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
totally it's dying it has done its time

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.119 
totally it's dying it has done its time
it<00:00:57.360> was<00:00:57.510> planted<00:00:57.989> late<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> summer<00:00:58.890> that's

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
it was planted late in the summer that's

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.250 
it was planted late in the summer that's
the<00:00:59.280> great<00:00:59.489> part<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.850> can<00:01:00.000> put<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> seeds<00:01:01.050> out

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
the great part you can put the seeds out

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.650 
the great part you can put the seeds out
as<00:01:01.590> late<00:01:01.859> as<00:01:01.890> even<00:01:02.340> July<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.180> if<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.359> live<00:01:03.539> in

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660

as late as even July and if you live in
a<00:01:03.780> milder<00:01:04.619> climate<00:01:04.799> like<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.339> Northwest<00:01:05.760> you

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
a milder climate like the Northwest you

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.940 
a milder climate like the Northwest you
can<00:01:06.030> get<00:01:06.150> blooms<00:01:06.479> into<00:01:06.869> October<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.530> November

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
can get blooms into October in November

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.940 
can get blooms into October in November
and<00:01:08.369> as<00:01:09.119> soon<00:01:09.330> as<00:01:09.450> they<00:01:09.630> die<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.260> just<00:01:10.500> let<00:01:10.710> them

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
and as soon as they die I just let them

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.890 
and as soon as they die I just let them
die<00:01:11.130> back<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:11.909> starting<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.210> freeze<00:01:12.570> too

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
die back and it's starting to freeze too

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.010 
die back and it's starting to freeze too
but<00:01:13.860> I'd<00:01:14.220> like<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.700> let<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.119> plant<00:01:15.360> go<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.659> seed

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
but I'd like to let the plant go to seed

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.649 
but I'd like to let the plant go to seed
but<00:01:16.710> saying<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.280> even<00:01:17.490> as<00:01:17.820> they<00:01:18.030> die<00:01:18.360> back

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
but saying that even as they die back

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.719 
but saying that even as they die back
each<00:01:19.500> one<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.070> these<00:01:20.330> little<00:01:22.340> seeds<00:01:23.340> these<00:01:23.610> are

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
each one of these little seeds these are

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.399 
each one of these little seeds these are
actually<00:01:24.119> seeds<00:01:24.420> they<00:01:24.659> haven't<00:01:24.990> dried<00:01:25.110> up

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
actually seeds they haven't dried up

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.200 
actually seeds they haven't dried up
they<00:01:25.590> haven't<00:01:25.799> turned<00:01:25.920> black<00:01:26.220> yet<00:01:26.520> but

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
they haven't turned black yet but

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.550 
they haven't turned black yet but
they're<00:01:27.420> still<00:01:27.689> going<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.020> create<00:01:28.170> another

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
they're still going to create another

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.219 
they're still going to create another
plant<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.610> will<00:01:29.909> let<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.329> plant<00:01:30.689> just<00:01:30.930> go<00:01:31.170> to

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
plant so I will let the plant just go to

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.899 
plant so I will let the plant just go to
seed<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.860> that's<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.189> best<00:01:32.369> thing<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.759> you

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
seed and that's the best thing that you

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.460 
seed and that's the best thing that you
can<00:01:33.150> do<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.840> leave<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.320> your

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
can do is just to leave it in your

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.319 
can do is just to leave it in your
garden<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.220> you'll<00:01:35.400> drop<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.640> seeds<00:01:36.000> for<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
garden and you'll drop the seeds for the

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.230 
garden and you'll drop the seeds for the
next<00:01:36.600> year<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.110> they<00:01:37.650> are<00:01:37.860> annual<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.000> fact

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
next year so they are annual in the fact

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.149 
next year so they are annual in the fact
that<00:01:39.540> they'll<00:01:39.720> come<00:01:39.930> back<00:01:40.110> every<00:01:40.560> year<00:01:40.590> from

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
that they'll come back every year from

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.340 
that they'll come back every year from
the<00:01:41.369> seeds<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.090> they're<00:01:42.720> hearty<00:01:43.170> they're

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
the seeds and they're hearty they're

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.399 
the seeds and they're hearty they're
Hardy<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.799> zones<00:01:44.100> 4<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.790> zone<00:01:45.030> 9<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:46.170> they<00:01:46.290> can

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
Hardy to zones 4 to zone 9 so they can

Hardy to zones 4 to zone 9 so they can
handle<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.770> lot<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:47.040> cold<00:01:47.220> cold<00:01:48.000> temperatures

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600

they can reach up to 12 feet tall too on
certain<00:01:51.780> different<00:01:52.229> varieties<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.640> have

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
certain different varieties so you have

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.399 
certain different varieties so you have
to<00:01:53.880> be<00:01:54.000> careful<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.689> sometimes<00:01:55.079> they<00:01:55.200> need<00:01:55.350> to

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
to be careful and sometimes they need to

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.560 
to be careful and sometimes they need to
be<00:01:55.500> staked<00:01:55.799> or<00:01:56.490> they'll<00:01:56.670> fall<00:01:56.909> over<00:01:56.939> if

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
be staked or they'll fall over if

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.120 
be staked or they'll fall over if
there's<00:01:57.810> too<00:01:58.049> much<00:01:58.079> Sun<00:01:58.590> hitting<00:01:58.829> them

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
there's too much Sun hitting them

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.029 
there's too much Sun hitting them
sunflowers<00:02:00.060> need<00:02:00.270> full<00:02:00.570> hot<00:02:00.600> Sun<00:02:00.930> all<00:02:01.710> day

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
sunflowers need full hot Sun all day

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.789 
sunflowers need full hot Sun all day
they<00:02:02.369> don't<00:02:02.579> like<00:02:02.759> any<00:02:03.030> shade<00:02:03.329> at<00:02:03.509> all<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
they don't like any shade at all and the

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.800 
they don't like any shade at all and the
best<00:02:04.979> way<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.250> stardom<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.850> by<00:02:06.030> seed<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.689> the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
best way to stardom is by seed in the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.889 
best way to stardom is by seed in the
summer<00:02:07.079> or<00:02:07.619> in<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.220> spring<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.880> then<00:02:09.690> they'll

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
summer or in the spring and then they'll

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.750 
summer or in the spring and then they'll
come<00:02:10.080> right<00:02:10.289> up<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.709> they'll<00:02:10.890> bloom<00:02:11.130> quite

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
come right up and they'll bloom quite

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.759 
come right up and they'll bloom quite
quickly<00:02:12.060> they're<00:02:12.540> really<00:02:12.930> an<00:02:13.019> amazing<00:02:13.260> plant

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
quickly they're really an amazing plant

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.979 
quickly they're really an amazing plant
and<00:02:14.160> they'll<00:02:14.700> grow<00:02:14.910> from<00:02:15.150> zones<00:02:15.390> four<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.810> nine

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
and they'll grow from zones four to nine

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.470 
and they'll grow from zones four to nine
so<00:02:16.950> wherever<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.580> grow<00:02:17.790> they'll<00:02:18.060> do<00:02:18.239> really

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
so wherever you grow they'll do really

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.870 
so wherever you grow they'll do really
well<00:02:18.690> if<00:02:18.959> you<00:02:18.989> live<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.470> really<00:02:19.650> windy<00:02:20.040> windy

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
well if you live in a really windy windy

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.030 
well if you live in a really windy windy
area<00:02:21.269> sometimes<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.260> have<00:02:22.349> to<00:02:22.440> stake<00:02:22.709> them<00:02:22.890> or

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
area sometimes you have to stake them or

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.530 
area sometimes you have to stake them or
put<00:02:23.220> them<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.550> side<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.000> house<00:02:24.180> where

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
put them to the side of the house where

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.290 
put them to the side of the house where
the<00:02:24.569> wind<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.440> little<00:02:25.590> bit<00:02:26.010> more<00:02:27.000> moderate

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
the wind is a little bit more moderate

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.640 
the wind is a little bit more moderate
because<00:02:27.420> it's<00:02:27.630> being<00:02:27.750> protected<00:02:28.019> by<00:02:28.590> the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
because it's being protected by the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.040 
because it's being protected by the
house<00:02:28.980> but<00:02:29.370> other<00:02:29.910> than<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.360> they'll<00:02:30.840> grow

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
house but other than that they'll grow

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.600 
house but other than that they'll grow
on<00:02:31.260> their<00:02:31.440> own<00:02:31.470> they<00:02:31.709> really<00:02:31.980> don't<00:02:32.190> need<00:02:32.370> you

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
on their own they really don't need you

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.080 
on their own they really don't need you
and<00:02:32.819> they're<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:32.970> great<00:02:33.150> garden<00:02:33.630> addition
