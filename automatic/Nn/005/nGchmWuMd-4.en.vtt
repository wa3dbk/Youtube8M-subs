00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
so those are just going to be planting

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.190 
so those are just going to be planting
over<00:02:12.750> time

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
over time

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.979 
over time
the<00:02:13.680> thing<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:13.920> in<00:02:14.400> this<00:02:14.640> game<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.450> have<00:02:15.480> money

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
the thing is in this game you have money

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.470 
the thing is in this game you have money
but<00:02:16.650> I<00:02:17.099> don't<00:02:17.489> really<00:02:17.610> see<00:02:17.700> much<00:02:18.000> point<00:02:18.209> just

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
but I don't really see much point just

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.790 
but I don't really see much point just
saving<00:02:18.780> it<00:02:18.840> forever<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.319> I'm<00:02:19.410> really<00:02:19.590> not

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
saving it forever and I'm really not

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.229 
saving it forever and I'm really not
into<00:02:20.129> getting<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.489> best<00:02:20.610> gear<00:02:20.819> or<00:02:20.940> anything

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
into getting the best gear or anything

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.780 
into getting the best gear or anything
so<00:02:21.959> what<00:02:22.319> I<00:02:22.349> decided<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.769> do<00:02:22.890> instead<00:02:23.040> is<00:02:23.310> spend

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
so what I decided to do instead is spend

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.630 
so what I decided to do instead is spend
a<00:02:23.879> ton<00:02:23.970> skills<00:02:24.360> so<00:02:24.629> this<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:24.989> what<00:02:25.170> I'm<00:02:25.290> doing

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
a ton skills so this is what I'm doing

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.790 
a ton skills so this is what I'm doing
other<00:02:26.640> than<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:26.879> I'm<00:02:27.599> probably<00:02:28.260> going<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.709> be

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
other than that I'm probably going to be

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.280 
other than that I'm probably going to be
spending<00:02:29.069> any<00:02:29.580> money<00:02:29.940> in<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.239> feature<00:02:30.450> on<00:02:30.780> I

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.750 
times because they'll take a few hours
to<00:04:40.830> use<00:04:40.980> them<00:04:41.130> all<00:04:41.220> up<00:04:41.370> but<00:04:41.490> I'll<00:04:41.640> definitely

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
to use them all up but I'll definitely

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.810 
to use them all up but I'll definitely
be<00:04:42.060> playing<00:04:42.300> after<00:04:42.450> that<00:04:42.890> what<00:04:43.890> I<00:04:43.920> think<00:04:44.610> I'll

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
be playing after that what I think I'll

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.620 
be playing after that what I think I'll
probably<00:04:45.180> do<00:04:45.720> is<00:04:46.110> either<00:04:46.500> some<00:04:46.860> fire<00:04:47.070> making

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
probably do is either some fire making

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.030 
probably do is either some fire making
and<00:04:48.630> I<00:04:48.750> would<00:04:48.900> do<00:04:49.020> that<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.410> Judean<00:04:49.680> co<00:04:49.830> layer

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
and I would do that the Judean co layer

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.130 
and I would do that the Judean co layer
or<00:04:50.280> I'll<00:04:50.850> do<00:04:51.030> see<00:04:51.270> to<00:04:51.420> fishing<00:04:51.870> and<00:04:51.990> wood

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
or I'll do see to fishing and wood

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.840 
or I'll do see to fishing and wood
cutting<00:04:52.470> and<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:53.070> reason<00:04:53.370> I<00:04:53.460> do<00:04:53.520> that<00:04:53.670> is

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
cutting and the reason I do that is

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.850 
cutting and the reason I do that is
because<00:04:54.090> those<00:04:54.450> are<00:04:54.570> all<00:04:54.690> skills<00:04:54.930> I<00:04:55.110> want<00:04:55.740> to

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
because those are all skills I want to

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.770 
because those are all skills I want to
get<00:04:55.950> all<00:04:56.070> my<00:04:56.100> skills<00:04:56.460> like<00:04:56.670> 20<00:04:56.970> million<00:04:57.240> XP<00:04:57.540> and

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
get all my skills like 20 million XP and

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.390 
get all my skills like 20 million XP and
those<00:04:57.900> are<00:04:58.020> skills<00:04:58.320> I<00:04:58.530> don't<00:04:58.800> those<00:04:59.280> are

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
those are skills I don't those are

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.010 
those are skills I don't those are
activities<00:04:59.850> I<00:05:00.150> don't<00:05:00.330> particularly<00:05:00.750> enjoy

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
activities I don't particularly enjoy

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
doing so that's probably what i'll do a

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.630 
doing so that's probably what i'll do a
let's<00:05:03.900> go<00:05:03.960> do<00:05:04.710> some<00:05:04.890> fire<00:05:05.100> making<00:05:05.340> than
