00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.320
[Rage Quit intro music]

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.300
You like fighting games? You like unicorns?

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.180
This is the fucking game for you.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.280
We got unicorns, we got lipstick, we got rainbow colored butterflies

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.780
What the fuck else do you want?

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.860
We have five sluts to choose from.  We have Horny, Lusty, Shady, and, uh-

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.980
Oh! That's it, there's only four. Why'd I say five? I can't fucking count.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.560
There's not even four, it's two! you have two fucking unicorns

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.440
And it's the exact same ones they're just wearing different shit.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.500
Wow, two whole options! Who do I fucking pick?

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.540
Alright, going with Brosef- that was a fucking sweet Nintendo voice there

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.580
"Brosef"

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.940
I guess it's like street fighter like we're going across the world, uh I'm flying on this paper airplane

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.600
To go fight Horny in God knows where. I think Podunk, Equestria.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.580
Holy shit, alright, super zoomed in, so this is it. Ready? Make out!

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.460
Fucking Chr-oh my God.  I'm getting my ass made out!

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.040
with

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.040
Or something!

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.680
I d- I dunno- ok.  I'm getting fucking destroyed here.  The power of love is kicking my ass.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.680
Yeah, take my tongue, bitch! Oh God. Ohhh yeah, ohhh, she's going down on me.  Mmmmohhh yeah.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.220
oh, Oh, OH!  Not in that way! I am friends- woah! Woahwoahwoahwoah!

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.860
Fucking uppercut.  Fucking geT OUTTA THERE!

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.660
What is this doing?  This isn't- oh, is this- is this block?  Oh, I found guard.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.400
I found fucking guard! You're in for it now, ya fucking bitch.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.280
Put your tongue in her nose.  Put it in her mouth.  Put it in her ass!

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.280
I hope we can still be friends tho you are dead.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.940
Dead from what?  From kissies? That's pretty brutal.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.960
[cue terrible Japanese accent] Ready? Make outuka!  Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua!

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.080
So there's a lot of variation in this game, as you can see.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.960
You got the X-button, which is the tongue.  That's like your long attack.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.020
Er-I guess that's your melee.  Ah, shit.  Fuck!  I got tongued.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.760
Left wins.  You didn't even say her name.  I'm facing someone that has a name!

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.740
69 seconds!

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.120
So X is like the melee tongue attack, Y is the lazerbeam from your fucking eyeballs,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.340
B trows yo han- B trow- B- FUCK!  Get off of my shit!

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.640
And the A-button just gives a little, uh, smoochie-smooch.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.720
Ooohhh, yeah, mmmm, mmmmmm

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.960
Why do my eyeballs keep rolling in the back of my fucking head every time I get hit?

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.520
HOLY SHIT!  I fucking decapitated her!

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.960
I won but at what cost?  At the cost of your fucking head coming off and flying away.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.020
It also looks like we keep going to the exact same fucking spot.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.440
Are we fighting all these people in one area?  Is this just like a throwdown?

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.680
Is it a royal rumble?  Are there chairs involved?  Who has the table?  CAGE MATCH!

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.560
I there like a finisher where I can, like, shoot unicorn jizz out of my fucking horn?  Like all over someone's face?

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.540
Or is that basically what the Y-button is?

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.100
Fucking sweet happy rainbow in the background that does not represent

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.300
the fierce fucking battle that is going on right now

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.660
I am just destroying EVERYONE!

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.720
I licked you good, bitch.  You like it?

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.520
Really, you just mash the X-button - there's no reason to do anything else -

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.280
and you just lick the shit outta the opposition

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.840
and you're fucking dead!  Perfection!  Untouchable!

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.840
Gimme your hat.  I'm wearing two hats now!  I took it, bitch.  It's my trophy!

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.060
L-M-O-O-O-O  Why d'you say L-M-O?  What the fuck does that mean?

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.000
You forgot the A!  Laughing my off?  What does that mean?!

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.600
We got some sweet, like, neck tattoos going on

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.680
Oooouuuhh what the fuck?

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.860
Uuuung!  Oh no, oh no, okay, competition is getting fierce - no - little defense

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.560
Oh shit, I tried to block.  Defend!  Block!  Block!

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.960
Get her in the face, get her in the face - allll over your face

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.100
I just love how they slowly go down and then your unicorn bobs its head

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.940
Like, you know what's going on under the screen.  I know.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.760
Fucking unicorn fellatio.  Suck my horn!  My lower horn.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.420
My mashing X-button is failing - nope, never mind, it's fine.  It's fine!  Brought it back.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.060
I'm the strongest unicorn in the world.  You've done it!  Is that it?  Did I win?  Nope, apparently not.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.440
Oh, I'm gonna fight Lusty next.  I think I've fought everyone already and I'm gonna fight her again

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.900
cause there's fucking FOUR different selectable characters!

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.480
Yeah, so they're mixing it up!  Now we've got green Lusty

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.000
That rainbow's still just chillin in the background

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.980
Oooh, I'm kissing you on the mouth.  I'm kissing you on the mouth!  How do you like that?!

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.200
I guess I'm in like a "finish her" mode but she won't die from the smoochies

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.640
So I can just basically have my way with this fucking unicorn forever!

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.000
[not-so-sexy garbling]  Oooh yeah, oooh yeah, ohhh

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.820
When the fuck does this game end?  Is it over yet?  I've licked my way to the top.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.200
The same way I got this job [Geoff in the background: "Good job!"]

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.440
Oh, God damnit you fuck.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.000
gOD stop fucking doing that!  It's still fucking annoying.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.660
I mean, the game's fucking bullshit, but, you know, just don't - don't hit me.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.960
come on am I flying on the paper airplane?!  You couldn't draw an actual fucking plane

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.460
going from location to location?  I-I'm just a unicorn I'm jumping on top of it?

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.380
Bitch, you have a hundred points.  I have 27,000.  Suck my unidong!

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.500
Who need VS when you have this?

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.420
Oh shit!  Alright, we're fighting fucking ender-unicorns now.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.140
I imagine, uh, now everything's gonna change.  And by that I mean nothing will change

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.220
and it's gonna be the exact same game that it's been for the last several minutes.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.860
Go-stop, stop, stop, stop, NO!  Oh my God!  Fucking almost got me there.  But you didn't!

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.660
Pegasisters rule, broneys drool.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.740
And then that's it!  It's over!  Are you serious?!

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.940
And with that final smooch, the evil Shadowhoof army and its- God damnit, I don't give a fuck.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.960
So this is still going, like, I beat the game and this has been going longer than the fucking game has!

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.060
Maybe you should've put some story at the beginning.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.940
Game over.  Get the fuck out.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.140
[unicorn moan]  oh my god

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:42.940
