ladder this is my third or sit my second
rock<00:01:16.650> bed<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.130> actually<00:01:17.610> got<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:19.070> hydrated

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
rock bed I actually got the hydrated

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.820 
rock bed I actually got the hydrated
clay<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:21.299> some<00:01:21.479> really<00:01:22.259> great<00:01:22.470> stuff

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
clay and that is some really great stuff

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.460 
clay and that is some really great stuff
the<00:01:23.430> comparison<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.720> took<00:01:24.930> two<00:01:25.110> bags<00:01:25.259> of

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
the comparison this took two bags of

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.280 
the comparison this took two bags of
clay<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.710> do<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.400> bed<00:01:26.670> which<00:01:27.479> ran<00:01:27.720> about<00:01:27.869> 30

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
clay to do this bed which ran about 30

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.620 
clay to do this bed which ran about 30
bucks<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.650> bag<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.100> was<00:01:29.220> 60<00:01:29.579> bucks<00:01:29.759> these

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
bucks a bag so it was 60 bucks these

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.170 
bucks a bag so it was 60 bucks these
other<00:01:30.840> beds<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.409> use<00:01:31.650> pea<00:01:31.920> gravel<00:01:32.130> which<00:01:33.000> was

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
other beds I use pea gravel which was

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.230 
other beds I use pea gravel which was
about<00:01:33.450> six<00:01:33.750> bucks<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:34.079> bag<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.500> took<00:01:34.680> four<00:01:34.979> bags

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
about six bucks a bag it took four bags

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.569 
about six bucks a bag it took four bags
so<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.509> took<00:01:36.720> about<00:01:37.110> 24<00:01:37.619> bucks<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.159> fill<00:01:38.400> that

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
so it took about 24 bucks to fill that

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.300 
so it took about 24 bucks to fill that
and<00:01:39.259> you<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.350> see<00:01:40.560> how<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.740> sides<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.280> that

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
and you can see how the sides on that

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.999 
and you can see how the sides on that
aren't<00:01:41.700> going<00:01:42.060> out<00:01:42.259> it's<00:01:43.259> just<00:01:43.350> easier<00:01:43.860> to

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
aren't going out it's just easier to

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.609 
aren't going out it's just easier to
work<00:01:44.159> with<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.930> think<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.079> worth<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.409> money

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
work with I think it's worth the money

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.530 
work with I think it's worth the money
look<00:01:46.829> at<00:01:46.950> how<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.399> bowing<00:01:47.729> out<00:01:47.880> it's<00:01:48.210> I

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
look at how this is bowing out it's I

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.080 
look at how this is bowing out it's I
would<00:01:48.869> never<00:01:49.140> be<00:01:49.380> able<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.619> lift<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:49.950> thing

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
would never be able to lift this thing

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.429 
would never be able to lift this thing

from<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.990> other<00:02:01.110> bed<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:02.040> was<00:02:02.159> getting

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
from the other bed it was getting

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.590

crowded<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.850> count<00:02:03.000> looks<00:02:03.149> like<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.390> green

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
crowded it count looks like the green

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.600 
crowded it count looks like the green
flame<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.590> that'll<00:02:04.979> be<00:02:05.070> interesting<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.520> see

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
flame and that'll be interesting to see

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.930 
flame and that'll be interesting to see
what<00:02:05.729> happens<00:02:06.030> with<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.509> then<00:02:07.469> the

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
what happens with that and then the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.050 
what happens with that and then the
float<00:02:08.940> bed<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.599> doing

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
float bed is doing

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.620 
float bed is doing
just<00:02:11.050> took<00:02:11.170> that<00:02:11.380> out<00:02:11.410> and<00:02:11.709> cleaned<00:02:12.010> it<00:02:12.099> and

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
just took that out and cleaned it and

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.000 
just took that out and cleaned it and
you<00:02:13.630> have<00:02:13.780> another<00:02:13.989> video<00:02:14.319> of<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.709> friend<00:02:14.950> of

peppers<00:02:21.459> are<00:02:21.610> slow<00:02:21.790> growers<00:02:22.150> but<00:02:22.300> they're

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
peppers are slow growers but they're

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.040 
peppers are slow growers but they're
coming<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:24.150> watermelons<00:02:25.150> just<00:02:25.330> not<00:02:25.540> really

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
doing much and I'm not exactly sure why

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.170 
doing much and I'm not exactly sure why
but<00:02:29.260> I<00:02:29.500> want<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.190> just<00:02:30.220> let<00:02:30.400> it<00:02:30.459> go<00:02:30.550> who<00:02:31.000> knows

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
but I want to just let it go who knows

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.240 
but I want to just let it go who knows
it<00:02:31.480> works<00:02:31.660> it<00:02:31.810> works<00:02:31.900> it<00:02:32.140> doesn't<00:02:32.349> no<00:02:32.920> problem

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
it works it works it doesn't no problem

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.559 
it works it works it doesn't no problem
I<00:02:33.810> keep<00:02:34.810> working<00:02:34.989> on<00:02:35.230> this<00:02:35.380> swirl<00:02:35.650> filter<00:02:35.890> I

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
I keep working on this swirl filter I

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.100 
I keep working on this swirl filter I
think<00:02:37.569> this<00:02:37.750> is<00:02:37.930> working<00:02:39.450> it's<00:02:40.450> not<00:02:40.599> fantastic

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
think this is working it's not fantastic

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.030 
think this is working it's not fantastic
I<00:02:41.620> need<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:42.010> change<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.120> few<00:02:43.269> things<00:02:43.299> around<00:02:43.690> but

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
I need to change a few things around but

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.770 
I need to change a few things around but
it's<00:02:45.040> a<00:02:45.190> start<00:02:45.489> and<00:02:45.850> that's<00:02:46.120> all<00:02:46.299> flowing<00:02:46.569> back

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
it's a start and that's all flowing back

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.509 
it's a start and that's all flowing back
into<00:02:46.810> my<00:02:47.170> sump<00:02:47.440> and<00:02:48.540> that's<00:02:49.540> about<00:02:49.780> it<00:02:49.959> so<00:02:50.950> that

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
into my sump and that's about it so that

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.940 
into my sump and that's about it so that
is<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.620> hydroponic<00:02:53.620> hot<00:02:53.769> tub<00:02:53.980> for<00:02:54.549> May<00:02:54.670> first
