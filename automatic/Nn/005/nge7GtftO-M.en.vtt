 your serve in another video that 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.780
 truth this time is a tutorial that I 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.379
 I'm teaching you how to change version so 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.740
 ali craft is in lao chi - you play 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.320
 in 1.642 normal and if you heard a 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.480
 noise as strange as the construction that 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.390
 on the side, I 'm sorry 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.330
 I'm getting along better if more in 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.250
 relation to pac is how you do to 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.329
 change version of microsoft can play on 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.579
 any version 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.350
 This is really cool, you come here. 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.690
 in new profile 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.640
 Here, this is just a name for you. 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.559
 know conversion you are in which 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:50.030
 profile you are right 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:54.510
 the father or obvious arrives is the iac has is 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.309
 Can you read if the version is there for you? 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.390
 choose which version you want 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.640
 come here 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:08.220
 So who are you can play in the last 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:10.409
 version has the a 1.652 this here is a 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.950
 folder so you are in the folder 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.530
 you create the folder with the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.259
 mold and tals and tals 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.650
 Then who the other versions and you can 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:26.640
 choose from 1 1 point zero to 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.290
 last of course I think it's cool them 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.890
 added 1.2 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:36.329
 the 1.6 points 2 sorry 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:40.770
 Today I 'm messing around too much, but it's 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:44.280
 This is where you come from, choose, I do not know where it is. 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.189
 You also have these free and 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.079
 something here that I still do not mess with them 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:55.470
 I just think it's still here. 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:02:01.850
 I did not have to use them to do 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:04.920
 no test but here you will have 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.049
 suppose you want to play in a 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.039
 server even though you have not updated yet 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.750
 is in a point 5.2 you come here choose 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.050
 to version 1.5 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.480
 because it gives the name for you to want it 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.300
 no matter right 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.730
 it is not import anything will not 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.580
 modify the game will only modify your 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.700
 profile here so you know what the 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.820
 game that any manufacturer which 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.040
 Exactly how did you get another name? 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:39.090
 You come here, I know why you do not. 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.420
 Then you know I was not going to do it. 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:46.440
 now because I already have it here but you 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.770
 Just a profile and you're getting married, I'm going to do this. 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:56.959
 with another version 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:03:00.600
 another version is a 2.56 profile point 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.560
 Okay, I got this name because I 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.310
 I'm an idiot 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:11.040
 then when you play it will of the Paxar 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:14.070
 version is to take this one you have chosen 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.260
 l is already low and will be ready to 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:21.110
 You play in this version with you can 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.950
 see here in the corner 1.2 point 5 and 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.840
 basically this is it 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.970
 only this is what you have to do 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.940
 easy it is hope I have 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.610
 Some people studied this. 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.459
 I think you're little known by the 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.950
 people me and my friends my friends still 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:42.239
 do not know where the existence of this 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:45.269
 possibility of exchange since it will pass 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.820
 several programs to change the version of 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.380
 microsoft however if that is much better 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.680
 because you do not have to download the 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.650
 some program is within the manÃ­ craft a 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.810
 own mpf countries where part the version 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:02.579
 so you can play 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:04.620
