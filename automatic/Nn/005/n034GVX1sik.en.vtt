00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
of its usually there will be if there is

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.880 
of its usually there will be if there is
a<00:01:15.659> soul<00:01:15.869> in<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.170> song<00:01:16.350> it'll<00:01:16.590> be<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.799> the

put<00:01:29.640> there<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.560> away<00:01:31.560> from<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.770> song<00:01:32.090> so<00:01:33.090> once

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
put there and away from the song so once

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.760 
put there and away from the song so once
you<00:01:33.420> have<00:01:33.570> all<00:01:33.780> these<00:01:33.960> parts<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.439> can<00:01:34.470> start

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
you have all these parts you can start

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.260 
you have all these parts you can start
putting<00:01:34.920> together<00:01:35.280> just<00:01:35.700> fill<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.119> those

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
putting together just fill in those

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.429 
putting together just fill in those
spots<00:01:36.600> intro<00:01:37.560> verse<00:01:38.340> chorus<00:01:39.290> pre-course<00:01:40.290> in

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
spots intro verse chorus pre-course in

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.950 
spots intro verse chorus pre-course in
there<00:01:40.590> if<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.740> like<00:01:40.890> verse<00:01:41.610> pre-chorus<00:01:42.509> if

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
there if you like verse pre-chorus if

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.399 
there if you like verse pre-chorus if
you<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.170> chorus<00:01:43.740> bridge<00:01:44.840> solo<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.170> like

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
you like chorus bridge solo you like

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.600 
you like chorus bridge solo you like
chorus<00:01:47.399> outro<00:01:48.030> it's<00:01:48.720> relatively<00:01:49.439> simple<00:01:49.610> the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
chorus outro it's relatively simple the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.160 
chorus outro it's relatively simple the
bit<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:50.880> gets<00:01:51.149> complicated<00:01:51.540> as<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.930> risk

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
bit that gets complicated as the risk

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.550 
bit that gets complicated as the risk
themselves<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.040> transitions

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
themselves and the transitions

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.620 
themselves and the transitions
so<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.189> transition<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.000> know<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.149> haven't<00:01:57.360> talked

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
so a transition I know I haven't talked

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.690 
so a transition I know I haven't talked
about<00:01:57.720> this<00:01:57.840> yet<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.740> separation<00:01:59.670> between

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
about this yet is a separation between

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.240 
about this yet is a separation between
any<00:02:00.390> part<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.960> song<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.070> purchase

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
any part of the song and you to purchase

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.940 
any part of the song and you to purchase
the<00:02:02.430> song<00:02:02.750> it<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:03.869> be<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> pre-chorus<00:02:04.530> which<00:02:04.799> is

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
the song it can be a pre-chorus which is

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.249 
the song it can be a pre-chorus which is
a<00:02:04.979> pretty<00:02:05.310> generalized<00:02:05.939> transition<00:02:06.840> or<00:02:07.020> it

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
a pretty generalized transition or it

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.960 
a pretty generalized transition or it
can<00:02:07.409> be<00:02:07.439> like<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.160> difference<00:02:08.459> between<00:02:08.640> an

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
can be like the difference between an

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.900 
can be like the difference between an
intro<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.450> verse<00:02:10.009> you'll<00:02:11.009> probably<00:02:11.489> want

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
intro and verse you'll probably want

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.030 
intro and verse you'll probably want
them<00:02:12.239> if<00:02:12.510> you're<00:02:12.870> doing<00:02:13.349> a<00:02:13.500> more<00:02:13.709> advanced

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
them if you're doing a more advanced

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.860 
them if you're doing a more advanced
song<00:02:14.310> but<00:02:14.670> if<00:02:14.790> you're<00:02:15.000> starting<00:02:15.450> it's<00:02:15.690> not

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
song but if you're starting it's not

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.930 
song but if you're starting it's not
really<00:02:16.319> necessary<00:02:16.410> but<00:02:17.069> I<00:02:17.130> told<00:02:17.730> them<00:02:17.819> in

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
really necessary but I told them in

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.120 
really necessary but I told them in
because<00:02:18.060> they<00:02:18.300> sound<00:02:18.540> good<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:19.830> just<00:02:20.040> to

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
because they sound good so just to

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.770 
because they sound good so just to
demonstrate<00:02:20.310> my<00:02:20.760> point<00:02:20.970> I'm<00:02:21.239> going<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.569> play<00:02:21.750> a

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
demonstrate my point I'm going to play a

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.839 
demonstrate my point I'm going to play a
really<00:02:22.200> simple<00:02:22.530> one<00:02:22.709> I'm<00:02:22.920> just<00:02:23.220> going<00:02:23.550> to<00:02:23.610> play

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
really simple one I'm just going to play

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.360 
really simple one I'm just going to play
one<00:02:24.120> riff<00:02:24.420> one<00:02:24.810> time<00:02:25.080> through<00:02:25.319> then<00:02:26.160> I'm<00:02:26.220> going

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
one riff one time through then I'm going

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.250 
one riff one time through then I'm going
to<00:02:26.400> play<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.580> transition<00:02:27.269> then<00:02:27.870> something<00:02:28.170> that

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
to play a transition then something that

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.050 
to play a transition then something that
is<00:02:28.380> going<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.560> sound<00:02:28.709> like<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:28.980> course<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:29.850> here

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
is going to sound like a course so here

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:41.370 
is going to sound like a course so here
so<00:02:30.930> here's<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.319> Rick

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.650 

here's<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.430> course

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.870 

and<00:02:48.100> here's<00:02:49.100> what<00:02:49.220> it's<00:02:49.340> going<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.490> sound<00:02:49.670> like

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
and here's what it's going to sound like

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.610 
and here's what it's going to sound like
all<00:02:50.150> together<00:02:50.360> this<00:02:50.810> is<00:02:50.960> just<00:02:51.170> me<00:02:51.260> playing<00:02:51.410> it

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
all together this is just me playing it

00:02:51.620 --> 00:03:22.310 
all together this is just me playing it
through

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.680 

that's<00:03:23.320> that<00:03:24.030> so<00:03:25.030> now<00:03:25.150> you're<00:03:25.270> pretty<00:03:25.630> much

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
that's that so now you're pretty much

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.830 
that's that so now you're pretty much
done<00:03:25.990> writing<00:03:26.320> a<00:03:26.470> simple<00:03:26.710> song<00:03:27.690> you<00:03:28.690> can

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
done writing a simple song you can

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.940 
done writing a simple song you can
always<00:03:28.960> go<00:03:29.200> a<00:03:29.230> lot<00:03:29.530> farther<00:03:29.800> like<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.580> lot<00:03:31.330> but

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
always go a lot farther like a lot but

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.290 
always go a lot farther like a lot but
right<00:03:32.950> now<00:03:33.130> I'm<00:03:33.310> not<00:03:33.460> really<00:03:33.970> going<00:03:34.090> to<00:03:34.150> do

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
right now I'm not really going to do

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.720 
right now I'm not really going to do
that<00:03:34.330> I<00:03:34.510> might<00:03:34.870> get<00:03:35.080> that<00:03:35.350> in<00:03:35.920> another<00:03:36.040> video

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
that I might get that in another video

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.230 
that I might get that in another video
but<00:03:37.530> one<00:03:38.530> thing<00:03:38.740> that<00:03:38.860> is<00:03:38.890> hard<00:03:39.280> is<00:03:39.790> teaching

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
but one thing that is hard is teaching

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.330 
but one thing that is hard is teaching
your<00:03:40.330> band<00:03:40.540> how<00:03:40.660> to<00:03:40.690> play<00:03:40.900> these<00:03:41.050> songs<00:03:41.290> a<00:03:41.680> lot

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
your band how to play these songs a lot

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.440 
your band how to play these songs a lot
of<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.520> time<00:03:42.730> they<00:03:42.910> just<00:03:42.940> won't<00:03:43.270> pay

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
of the time they just won't pay

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.090 
of the time they just won't pay
attention<00:03:43.960> because<00:03:44.140> while<00:03:44.800> you're<00:03:44.950> teaching

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
attention because while you're teaching

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.010 
attention because while you're teaching
one<00:03:45.520> guy<00:03:45.700> had<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.030> play<00:03:46.180> a<00:03:46.210> song<00:03:46.510> for<00:03:46.540> half<00:03:46.900> an

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
one guy had to play a song for half an

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.780 
one guy had to play a song for half an
hour<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:47.320> other<00:03:47.650> guys<00:03:47.890> in<00:03:48.100> the<00:03:48.190> band<00:03:48.370> aren't

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
hour the other guys in the band aren't

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.820 
hour the other guys in the band aren't
going<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.090> be<00:03:49.150> interested<00:03:49.660> I'm<00:03:50.560> going<00:03:50.740> to

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
going to be interested I'm going to

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.420 
going to be interested I'm going to
explain<00:03:51.100> two<00:03:51.370> ways<00:03:51.550> that<00:03:51.790> work<00:03:52.260> pretty<00:03:53.260> well

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
explain two ways that work pretty well

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.210 
explain two ways that work pretty well
first<00:03:54.430> is<00:03:54.700> to<00:03:55.630> use<00:03:55.750> guitar<00:03:56.080> pro<00:03:56.320> and<00:03:56.470> make<00:03:57.070> sure

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
first is to use guitar pro and make sure

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.830 
first is to use guitar pro and make sure
your<00:03:57.430> band<00:03:57.610> all<00:03:57.790> have<00:03:57.970> guitar<00:03:58.330> pro<00:03:58.360> they'll

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
your band all have guitar pro they'll

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.390 
your band all have guitar pro they'll
hear<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.590> song<00:03:59.770> they'll<00:03:59.980> be<00:04:00.070> able<00:04:00.130> to<00:04:00.220> play

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
hear the song they'll be able to play

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.090 
hear the song they'll be able to play
along<00:04:00.730> with<00:04:00.910> it<00:04:01.050> the<00:04:02.050> second<00:04:02.410> is<00:04:02.500> to<00:04:02.590> record<00:04:02.890> it

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
along with it the second is to record it

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.360 
along with it the second is to record it
and<00:04:03.280> give<00:04:04.030> them<00:04:04.210> tabs<00:04:04.540> or<00:04:05.200> music<00:04:05.920> whatever

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
and give them tabs or music whatever

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.760 
and give them tabs or music whatever
they<00:04:06.490> like<00:04:06.750> both<00:04:07.750> these<00:04:07.990> ways<00:04:08.200> work<00:04:08.500> pretty

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
they like both these ways work pretty

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.620 
they like both these ways work pretty
well<00:04:08.860> I'd<00:04:09.220> probably<00:04:09.790> recommend<00:04:10.030> the<00:04:10.390> guitar

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
well I'd probably recommend the guitar

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.780 
well I'd probably recommend the guitar
pro<00:04:10.780> just<00:04:11.020> because<00:04:11.170> it's<00:04:11.320> easier<00:04:14.670> alright<00:04:15.670> so

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
pro just because it's easier alright so

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.940 
pro just because it's easier alright so
that's<00:04:15.880> pretty<00:04:16.270> much<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:16.510> basic<00:04:17.080> guy<00:04:17.500> done

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
that's pretty much the basic guy done

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.729 
that's pretty much the basic guy done
I'm<00:04:18.390> gonna<00:04:19.390> come<00:04:19.630> back<00:04:19.750> to<00:04:19.900> the<00:04:20.019> part<00:04:20.230> 3<00:04:20.530> but

I'm gonna come back to the part 3 but

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
don't wait on it because it's going to

shouldn't use this formula more than a
couple<00:04:39.040> times<00:04:39.430> just<00:04:39.580> to<00:04:39.760> learn<00:04:40.000> there's<00:04:40.900> no

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
really simple I wouldn't do that if I

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.230 
really simple I wouldn't do that if I
were<00:04:47.050> you<00:04:47.370> one<00:04:48.370> more<00:04:48.610> thing<00:04:48.790> you<00:04:48.910> have<00:04:49.000> to<00:04:49.060> keep
