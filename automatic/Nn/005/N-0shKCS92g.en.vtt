00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:06.970
 when you arrive at the pavilion anaitasuna already 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.160
 I could see that we were facing a game 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.710
 special soccer room magna jack 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.259
 received before his audience to inter movistar 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.490
 the gay leader of the championship and undefeated 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.900
 till the date 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.420
 Sota wanted to end the unbeaten 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.880
 of the people of Malaga and put a lot of effort 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.950
 for this however in the 6th minute of 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.170
 match came the first inter inter 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.480
 a goal by ricardinho sota what 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.000
 I tried to hit again and again 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.280
 they found with the interim defense that 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.559
 it came out with a lot of speed when 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.410
 they did in their usual possessions 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.780
 long there was tension and added as 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.149
 that on the track hit again another 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.699
 good move by inter movistar ended with 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.760
 goal to the quarter of hour of the party of 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.050
 rivillos opposed in a row 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.350
 immediately after and after an error 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:56.230
 in defense put towards 0 3 in favor 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.629
 of the visitors what forced imanol 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.449
 arregui has asked for a timeout to 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.699
 avoid the bleeding of goals and wine watching 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.110
 because in the absence of two minutes for the 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.350
 rest in rajoy cinetecas a play 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.440
 suddenly put the 1 to 3 with a nice 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.600
 auction to a and all the inter could not 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.510
 do the room twice in the 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.540
 last minute hitting one of them to the 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.910
 stick after rest imagine jack did 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.920
 a great job both in defense and 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.390
 coming out on the counter as generating 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.820
 football and saga in attack with the 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.250
 positions loads a second part very 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.410
 would be means endeavor his hand and the 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.410
 award for good work came jesusito 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.600
 put 2 to 3 at 24 minutes of play 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.310
 with this sensational play 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.770
 once again the gaditano of that is 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.140
 demonstrating its speed and mastery of 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.750
 ball in this type of actions 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.150
 jack was better though nano modrego ex 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.970
 of the river renewable already I could also 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.430
 make a goal for his team each arrival of 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.170
 interest generated fear but security 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.180
 de sota was a lot 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.790
 Sota was an equalizer had 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.340
 managed to cut back an adverse 0-3 and 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.869
 I wanted more for it and hand added it gave 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.850
 entrance to carts or as 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.470
 goalkeeper-player to get 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.660
 numerical superiority 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.030
 missing three minutes it would turn off the 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.120
 conclusion and in that space of time the 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.640
 marker left until 2 to 5 2 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.070
 ricardinho's goals finished by 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.560
 sentence the match that ended with 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.960
 a marker too broad for something 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.880
 seen on the coast imanol arregui 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.340
 highlighted in the locker room tunnel the 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.500
 great wear of your team before the leader 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.050
 of the championship also had words 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.140
 for the next cup match between 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.110
 week the first part has already 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.940
 missing a tad of confidence in attack 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.370
 what happens that they also take away the 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.040
 ball and is a team that plays very 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.230
 fast with great intensity we have had 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.050
 a couple of mistakes that we have 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.080
 cost two goals and good with the third 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.370
 the 3-1 goal helped us the second 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.490
 part I think that with the 3-2 we have had 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.730
 options for 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.980
 to tie but look then we have not 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.730
 stuck and them when we go risk 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.110
 good goalkeeper 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.450
 a play 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.400
 a couple of rejections have made us the 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.070
 fourth and fifth already do not count 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.830
 because we were all going to slaughter but 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.240
 well the team has shown its face and has 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.850
 fought has not lowered his arms with the 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.590
 3-0 of many positive things in the 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.510
 party the team is dead they 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.650
 surround with 10 we have rolled with 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.480
 8 and people are busted we've had 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.120
 that running the game a lot has been very 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.150
 intense and the team is dead we are going to 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.680
 see how we are on Monday but how to be 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.560
 that change things a lot I do not think that 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.450
 let's all go there another of the 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.370
 protagonists winning bike came 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.950
 player of the inter movistar who 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.170
 highlighted the push of the local fans and 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.780
 that is very close and up- to-date 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.590
 renewable energies and those of your paste their 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.590
 previous what type 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.730
 It's a pleasure to come here and play with 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.980
 this environment last year I already had the 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.050
 great luck to live two matches 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.090
 with a lot of rivalry and with a lot of atmosphere 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.200
 between the two teams and this year because 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.360
 come with interest then also the 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.010
 very good environment is that it's fun to play 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.870
 in fields like that it's nice to play with 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.250
 hobbies that are overturned with your team and 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.380
 It is always nice for the player 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.320
 come and enjoy minutes 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.410
 so good they are happening now a 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.150
 bad results run I think not 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.290
 they have a template to be more 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.480
 above what they are yes that is true 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.540
 which is that losing matches at home 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.940
 like with ivory or with the other day 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.580
 with burela because maybe that's what has 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.960
 a little bit of trust because it is 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.630
 I light the match was the 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.120
 national coach venancio lopez is 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.950
 sure he took note of the good work of 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.950
 rafa usÃ­n and jesulito
