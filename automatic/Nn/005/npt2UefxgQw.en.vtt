00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
really pretty doll I don't think I think

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.749 
really pretty doll I don't think I think
our<00:01:54.540> hair<00:01:54.750> would<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:55.020> easy<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.320> manage<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:56.460> far

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
our hair would be easy to manage so far

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.130 
our hair would be easy to manage so far
I<00:01:56.790> haven't<00:01:57.030> had<00:01:57.240> any<00:01:57.420> problems<00:01:57.450> with<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.899> and

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
I haven't had any problems with it and

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.380 
I haven't had any problems with it and
it<00:01:58.229> does<00:01:58.409> curl<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.860> nicely<00:01:59.149> see<00:02:00.149> how<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.270> kind

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
it does curl in nicely see how it kind

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.450 
it does curl in nicely see how it kind
of<00:02:00.479> frames<00:02:00.750> her<00:02:00.930> face<00:02:00.990> on<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.770> shoulders<00:02:02.159> I

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
of frames her face on the shoulders I

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.060 
of frames her face on the shoulders I
think<00:02:03.390> it's<00:02:03.479> really<00:02:03.630> pretty<00:02:03.899> I'll<00:02:04.590> pull<00:02:04.860> down

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
think it's really pretty I'll pull down

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.310 
think it's really pretty I'll pull down
so<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.640> can<00:02:05.759> get<00:02:05.850> an<00:02:05.969> idea<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.930> how<00:02:07.049> long

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
so you can get an idea this is how long

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.669 
so you can get an idea this is how long
and<00:02:07.590> actually<00:02:07.740> without<00:02:08.129> but<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.940> almost<00:02:09.060> goes

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
and actually without but it almost goes

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.920 
and actually without but it almost goes
her<00:02:10.679> waist<00:02:10.890> would<00:02:11.099> be<00:02:11.250> here<00:02:11.690> but<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.780> goes

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
her waist would be here but it goes

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.140 
her waist would be here but it goes
pretty<00:02:13.080> long

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
pretty long

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.790 
pretty long
and<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.540> doesn't<00:02:15.750> seem<00:02:16.019> to<00:02:16.170> fall<00:02:16.379> in<00:02:16.500> her<00:02:16.620> eyes

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
and it doesn't seem to fall in her eyes

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.009 
and it doesn't seem to fall in her eyes
a<00:02:16.830> lot<00:02:17.190> or<00:02:17.370> anything<00:02:17.700> kind<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.030> does<00:02:18.599> that<00:02:18.629> nice

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
a lot or anything kind of does that nice

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.990 
a lot or anything kind of does that nice
swoop<00:02:19.590> in<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.940> back<00:02:21.209> you<00:02:22.019> can<00:02:22.049> see<00:02:22.819> it<00:02:23.819> isn't

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
swoop in the back you can see it isn't

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.360 
swoop in the back you can see it isn't
as<00:02:24.269> pretty<00:02:24.480> as<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.840> front<00:02:24.870> but<00:02:25.799> she<00:02:25.980> has<00:02:26.099> been

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
as pretty as the front but she has been

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.710 
as pretty as the front but she has been
sitting<00:02:26.580> in<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.819> box<00:02:27.030> for<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.450> don't<00:02:27.510> know<00:02:27.659> how

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
sitting in a box for I don't know how

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.559 
sitting in a box for I don't know how
long<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:28.620> I'm<00:02:28.709> sure<00:02:28.769> this<00:02:29.040> will<00:02:29.099> kind<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.569> even

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
long so I'm sure this will kind of even

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.930 
long so I'm sure this will kind of even
out<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:31.019> time<00:02:31.260> goes<00:02:31.530> by<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:32.129> mean<00:02:32.519> it<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:32.640> even

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
out this time goes by I mean it is even

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.119 
out this time goes by I mean it is even
but<00:02:33.660> hopefully<00:02:34.019> it'll<00:02:34.110> flatten<00:02:34.379> out<00:02:34.590> more<00:02:34.830> it

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
but hopefully it'll flatten out more it

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.910 
but hopefully it'll flatten out more it
does<00:02:35.580> kind<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.940> curl<00:02:36.299> out<00:02:36.540> at<00:02:36.690> this<00:02:36.780> point<00:02:36.920> but

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
does kind of curl out at this point but

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.250 
does kind of curl out at this point but
I<00:02:37.980> haven't<00:02:38.190> really<00:02:38.489> tried<00:02:38.819> to<00:02:39.060> get<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.019> to<00:02:40.049> go

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
I haven't really tried to get it to go

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.470 
I haven't really tried to get it to go
under<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.829> think<00:02:41.310> her<00:02:41.459> hair<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:41.700> longer<00:02:42.090> than<00:02:42.299> my

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
under I think her hair is longer than my

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.930 
under I think her hair is longer than my
kids<00:02:42.750> here<00:02:43.190> because<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.220> have<00:02:44.519> a<00:02:44.549> kit<00:02:44.909> with

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
kids here because I have a kit with

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.660 
kids here because I have a kit with
pretty<00:02:45.329> short<00:02:45.659> hair<00:02:47.030> so<00:02:48.030> there<00:02:48.510> she<00:02:48.840> is

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
pretty short hair so there she is

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.809 
pretty short hair so there she is
extremely<00:02:50.670> adorable<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:53.040> hope<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.459> was<00:02:53.730> able

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819
