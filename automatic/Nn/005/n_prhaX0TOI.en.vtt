00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
and overall the general idea for how to

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.380 
and overall the general idea for how to
avoid<00:00:05.279> baits<00:00:05.580> when<00:00:05.819> it<00:00:05.910> comes<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.270> being

avoid baits when it comes to being

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.290 
avoid baits when it comes to being
ganked<00:00:06.690> let's<00:00:07.319> get<00:00:07.500> started<00:00:07.910> now<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:08.940> key<00:00:09.269> to

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
ganked let's get started now the key to

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.089 
ganked let's get started now the key to
avoiding<00:00:09.510> baits<00:00:10.019> is<00:00:10.200> actually<00:00:10.530> fairly<00:00:10.710> simple

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
avoiding baits is actually fairly simple

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.370 
avoiding baits is actually fairly simple
if<00:00:11.309> you<00:00:11.400> can<00:00:11.550> understand<00:00:12.059> it<00:00:12.210> but<00:00:12.660> first<00:00:12.990> you

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
if you can understand it but first you

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.680 
if you can understand it but first you
need<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.559> be<00:00:13.650> aware<00:00:13.980> when<00:00:14.250> you're<00:00:14.370> vulnerable

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
need to be aware when you're vulnerable

need to be aware when you're vulnerable
now<00:00:15.690> as<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:16.020> general<00:00:16.260> rule<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.619> thumb<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.070> link

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
now as a general rule of thumb and link

you're vulnerable now a gank may happen

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.220

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
situations is going on and above all

situations is going on and above all
else<00:00:38.129> if<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.520> opponent's<00:00:38.910> have<00:00:39.030> players

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
else if the opponent's have players

else if the opponent's have players
missing<00:00:39.570> on<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.840> map<00:00:39.989> especially<00:00:40.379> their

missing on the map especially their

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.500 
missing on the map especially their
jungler<00:00:41.129> then<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.489> gank<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.820> just<00:00:42.090> possible

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
jungler then the gank is just possible

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.080 
jungler then the gank is just possible
in<00:00:42.690> general<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.649> track<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.070> enemy<00:00:44.219> players<00:00:44.610> by

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
in general so track the enemy players by

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.610 
in general so track the enemy players by
constantly<00:00:45.660> checking<00:00:45.870> their<00:00:46.079> mini-map<00:00:46.410> and

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
constantly checking their mini-map and

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.549 
constantly checking their mini-map and
predicting<00:00:47.190> their<00:00:47.309> movements<00:00:48.350> anyways<00:00:49.350> when

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
predicting their movements anyways when

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.990 
predicting their movements anyways when
it<00:00:49.649> comes<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.950> avoiding<00:00:50.160> baits<00:00:50.520> it's<00:00:50.760> all

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
it comes to avoiding baits it's all

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.180 
it comes to avoiding baits it's all
about<00:00:51.210> reading<00:00:51.449> body<00:00:51.780> language<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.530> by<00:00:53.010> that

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
about reading body language and by that

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.040 
about reading body language and by that
I<00:00:53.399> mean<00:00:53.640> judging<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.210> way<00:00:54.360> your<00:00:54.600> puns<00:00:54.840> are

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
I mean judging the way your puns are

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.529 
I mean judging the way your puns are
acting<00:00:55.530> most<00:00:56.190> players<00:00:56.460> will<00:00:56.699> go<00:00:56.850> aggressive

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
acting most players will go aggressive

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.599 
acting most players will go aggressive
when<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> gank<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.320> coming<00:00:58.770> if<00:00:58.920> they<00:00:59.370> play<00:00:59.579> a

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
when a gank is coming if they play a

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.760 
when a gank is coming if they play a
passive<00:01:00.120> or<00:01:00.270> defensive<00:01:00.690> often<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.469> then

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
passive or defensive often and then

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.349 
passive or defensive often and then
suddenly<00:01:02.160> turn<00:01:02.340> aggressive<00:01:02.820> for<00:01:03.000> little<00:01:03.239> to

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
suddenly turn aggressive for little to

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.359 
suddenly turn aggressive for little to
no<00:01:03.449> reason<00:01:03.840> or<00:01:03.960> for<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> reason<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.129> can't

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
no reason or for a reason that you can't

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.969 
no reason or for a reason that you can't
figure<00:01:05.549> out<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:06.090> gank<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.810> likely<00:01:07.110> since<00:01:07.799> their

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
figure out a gank is likely since their

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.710 
figure out a gank is likely since their
body<00:01:08.189> language<00:01:08.369> shows<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.360> they<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.600> an

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
body language shows that they have an

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.500 
body language shows that they have an
ally<00:01:10.020> coming<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.610> however<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.970> method<00:01:12.180> only

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
ally coming in however this method only

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.570 
ally coming in however this method only
works<00:01:12.659> if<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.260> see<00:01:13.530> them<00:01:13.710> being<00:01:13.920> passive<00:01:14.400> over

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
works if you see them being passive over

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.340 
works if you see them being passive over
defensive<00:01:15.000> earlier<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.960> make<00:01:16.170> sure<00:01:16.200> that

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
defensive earlier so make sure that

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.960 
defensive earlier so make sure that
you're<00:01:16.590> always<00:01:16.770> observing<00:01:17.460> your<00:01:17.549> opponent's

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
you're always observing your opponent's

you're always observing your opponent's
play<00:01:18.210> style<00:01:18.600> as<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.140> sudden<00:01:19.530> change<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.070> is

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
play style as a sudden change in it is

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.670 
play style as a sudden change in it is
indicative<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:21.060> something<00:01:21.420> coming<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.080> which

indicative of something coming in which
is<00:01:22.860> likely<00:01:23.100> often<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.880> gank<00:01:24.350> other<00:01:25.350> than<00:01:25.770> that

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
is likely often a gank other than that

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.950 
is likely often a gank other than that
there's<00:01:26.310> not<00:01:26.490> much<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.600> really<00:01:27.630> just

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
there's not much to it it really just

there's not much to it it really just
takes<00:01:28.259> map<00:01:28.530> awareness<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:29.070> see<00:01:29.280> what<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> gank

takes map awareness to see what a gank
is<00:01:29.790> possible<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.509> then<00:01:30.960> being<00:01:31.170> aware<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.500> your
