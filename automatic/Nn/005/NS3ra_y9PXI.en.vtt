00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:18.210
 Don Justice 2066 This time I introduce my laptop computer 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.990
 We will go we will start in it 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.080
 At first we will introduce from specifications 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:32.009
 0-5- g Kounagoyamada Electric's Motel 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:35.790
 cpu is amd e 450 apu 1.6 ghz memory is standard right 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:40.700
 But I added 45 by myself and it is 45 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:44.030
 Display The display size is 15.6 type wide 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.930
 Hard disk capacity is 320 d 1 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:53.310
 The drive is a dvd super multi drive 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:56.570
 And os is windows 7 home premium 64 bit 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:01:00.329
 And first let's look at the appearance 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:05.690
 The appearance has no place to review in particular 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.690
 It is simple if it says simple and bad if it says new 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:15.970
 This keyboard is hard to beat if and say, little Machi in 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.500
 So I usually use this Buffalo keyboard 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.780
 It sells its Shite' 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.480
 above 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:28.820
 I wonder if you know that 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:33.940
 I have a web camera on top of it, but the image quality is so bad that I usually have it 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.940
 His has, such as skype using here 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:47.119
 And then let's look back on the next 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:49.150
 There is no place to review here, but the surface is rough and fingerprints and scratches 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:55.050
 Unnoticeable 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:55.050
 It is designed and is written here as a bar of the example of the maker name 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.270
 Let's start it and time it out 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.980
 Please wait a little 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.550
 Then we will spend time 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.469
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.750
 Oh dear 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.770
 I'm tired with 54.1 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:27.350
 It is not so fast but the price is 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.910
 Specs are also steps 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:36.210
 Will what is called a handle not Well how 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:40.040
 I forgot to say, but I bought this for Â¥ 29,800 at Yamada Fore House 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.040
 I do not remember whether I bought a chair 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.530
 Well I want you to fix it 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:52.240
 Sometimes come my own 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:55.520
 It does not have usb driver is recognized but will only PC 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:01.060
 PC is often shut down 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:02.310
 And as I said earlier, I'm worried about the hardship of the keyboard 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.760
 And 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:11.920
 After all if we do processing speed and heavy vehicle 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:17.430
 There is a place where I sometimes get tired, so I want you to fix such a place, but it is so 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.430
 By the way, there are times when I think that it can not be helped because the cost is too much 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:28.030
 Well, reviews and introductions are still a lot of fun 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:30.540
 I will try my best from now on 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.540
 Well then
