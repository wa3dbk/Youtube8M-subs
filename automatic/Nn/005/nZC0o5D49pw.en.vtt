00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.090 

first<00:00:32.720> let's<00:00:32.930> deal<00:00:33.080> with<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:33.260> legs<00:00:33.470> not<00:00:33.860> only

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
first let's deal with the legs not only

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.320 
first let's deal with the legs not only
is<00:00:34.160> it<00:00:34.220> important<00:00:34.760> to<00:00:34.820> learn<00:00:34.850> to<00:00:35.030> fit

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.330 
is it important to learn to fit

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.060 
is it important to learn to fit
correctly<00:00:35.570> a<00:00:36.020> because<00:00:36.680> they<00:00:36.770> give<00:00:36.950> you<00:00:37.040> a

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
correctly a because they give you a

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.370 
correctly a because they give you a
float<00:00:37.370> but<00:00:37.820> also<00:00:38.000> your<00:00:38.510> legs<00:00:38.720> dictate<00:00:39.260> the

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
float but also your legs dictate the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.460 
float but also your legs dictate the
speed<00:00:39.620> of<00:00:39.710> your<00:00:39.800> arms

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
speed of your arms

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.780 
speed of your arms
you<00:00:42.470> should<00:00:42.620> try<00:00:42.800> and<00:00:42.980> kick<00:00:43.220> from<00:00:43.460> the<00:00:43.550> hips

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
you should try and kick from the hips

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.130 
you should try and kick from the hips
it's<00:00:44.270> important<00:00:44.810> to<00:00:44.870> keep<00:00:44.960> your<00:00:45.020> legs

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
it's important to keep your legs

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.990 
it's important to keep your legs
straight<00:00:45.380> with<00:00:46.070> a<00:00:46.160> slight<00:00:46.430> bend<00:00:46.760> in<00:00:46.940> your

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
straight with a slight bend in your

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.420 
straight with a slight bend in your

my<00:00:49.430> specialty<00:00:50.090> is<00:00:50.320> when<00:00:51.320> you're<00:00:51.440> sprinting

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
my specialty is when you're sprinting

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.430 
my specialty is when you're sprinting
keep<00:00:52.640> your<00:00:52.820> legs<00:00:52.970> faster<00:00:53.570> because<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.080> faster

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
keep your legs faster because the faster

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.650 
keep your legs faster because the faster
your<00:00:54.559> legs<00:00:54.739> go<00:00:54.950> the<00:00:55.129> faster<00:00:55.520> your<00:00:55.610> arms<00:00:55.850> go<00:00:56.059> and

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
your legs go the faster your arms go and

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.850 
your legs go the faster your arms go and
when<00:00:56.809> you're<00:00:56.900> swinging<00:00:57.080> longer<00:00:57.440> distance

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
when you're swinging longer distance

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.530 
when you're swinging longer distance
keep<00:00:58.520> them<00:00:58.670> slowly<00:00:58.940> because<00:00:59.300> they're<00:00:59.420> only

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
keep them slowly because they're only

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:09.130 
keep them slowly because they're only
they're<00:00:59.780> faster<00:01:07.570> the<00:01:08.570> arm<00:01:08.720> stroke<00:01:08.990> is<00:01:09.110> the

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
they're faster the arm stroke is the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.890 
they're faster the arm stroke is the
most<00:01:09.380> important<00:01:09.979> thing<00:01:10.190> because<00:01:10.720> 85%<00:01:11.720> of<00:01:11.810> your

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
most important thing because 85% of your

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.690 
most important thing because 85% of your
propulsion<00:01:12.200> comes<00:01:12.740> from<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.040> ocean<00:01:13.160> comes
