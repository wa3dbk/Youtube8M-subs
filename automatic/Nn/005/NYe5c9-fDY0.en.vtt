just we know what to do and wasn't gonna

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.070 
just we know what to do and wasn't gonna
be<00:02:16.030> easy<00:02:16.060> he<00:02:16.390> could<00:02:16.540> have<00:02:16.630> gone<00:02:16.720> either<00:02:16.930> way

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
be easy he could have gone either way

be easy he could have gone either way
but<00:02:17.830> we<00:02:17.980> found<00:02:18.130> them<00:02:18.280> momentum<00:02:19.150> right<00:02:19.300> when<00:02:19.450> we

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
be why a record is a little funky or

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.020

anything but you know we got to play
with<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.270> best<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.900> be<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.110> best<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.470> know

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
with the best to be the best you know

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.199 
with the best to be the best you know
that's<00:02:32.830> what<00:02:32.920> we're<00:02:33.010> trying<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:33.280> do<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:34.000> first

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
that's what we're trying to do the first

game<00:02:34.360> we<00:02:34.480> came<00:02:34.630> out<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.810> little<00:02:34.959> slow<00:02:35.320> but<00:02:35.590> I

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
game we came out a little slow but I

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.840 
game we came out a little slow but I
think<00:02:35.890> that's<00:02:36.010> just<00:02:36.070> because<00:02:36.160> we're<00:02:36.730> a<00:02:36.760> little

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
think that's just because we're a little

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.160 
think that's just because we're a little
nervous<00:02:37.000> we<00:02:37.390> knew<00:02:37.480> this<00:02:37.570> was<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:37.780> big<00:02:37.959> game<00:02:38.140> a
