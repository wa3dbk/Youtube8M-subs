so<00:00:20.590> today<00:00:21.150> we'll<00:00:22.150> be<00:00:22.330> talking<00:00:22.570> about<00:00:22.980> designed

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:24.940 
so today we'll be talking about designed

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.330 
so today we'll be talking about designed
how<00:00:25.510> do<00:00:25.570> you<00:00:25.780> go<00:00:25.960> about<00:00:26.110> designing<00:00:26.740> these

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
how do you go about designing these

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.190 
how do you go about designing these
things<00:00:27.640> for<00:00:28.510> those<00:00:28.720> who<00:00:28.930> are<00:00:29.020> not

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
things for those who are not

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.580 
things for those who are not
architecture<00:00:30.010> planners<00:00:30.850> and<00:00:31.060> designers<00:00:31.590> how

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
architecture planners and designers how

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.460 
architecture planners and designers how
would<00:00:32.980> you<00:00:33.130> approach<00:00:33.940> this<00:00:34.330> the<00:00:34.930> Alpha

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
would you approach this the Alpha

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.850 
would you approach this the Alpha
principles<00:00:36.220> of<00:00:36.460> Earth<00:00:36.940> architecture<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:38.620> we

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
principles of Earth architecture that we

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.650 
principles of Earth architecture that we
carry<00:00:39.160> on<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:41.520> arches<00:00:42.520> vaults<00:00:43.050> domes<00:00:44.489> earth

water air and fire
I<00:00:49.530> believe<00:00:50.530> with<00:00:50.710> these<00:00:50.860> seven<00:00:51.400> nodes<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:53.050> can

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
I believe with these seven nodes you can

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.100 
I believe with these seven nodes you can
really<00:00:53.620> create<00:00:53.890> almost<00:00:54.190> anything<00:00:54.809> those<00:00:55.809> are

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
really create almost anything those are

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.310 
really create almost anything those are
almost<00:00:56.760> unchanged<00:00:57.839> anywhere<00:00:58.839> you<00:00:58.960> go<00:00:59.140> in<00:00:59.290> the

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
almost unchanged anywhere you go in the

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.280 
almost unchanged anywhere you go in the
universe<00:00:59.710> and<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:01.210> come<00:01:01.420> up<00:01:01.449> now<00:01:01.870> with<00:01:01.900> all

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
universe and you come up now with all

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.940 
universe and you come up now with all
these<00:01:02.500> new<00:01:02.559> design<00:01:04.050> parameters<00:01:05.050> that<00:01:05.680> are

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
these new design parameters that are

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.740 
these new design parameters that are
based<00:01:06.310> on<00:01:06.670> those<00:01:06.880> elements<00:01:07.780> not<00:01:08.770> that<00:01:09.600> we<00:01:10.600> are

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
based on those elements not that we are

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.110 
based on those elements not that we are
asking<00:01:11.470> everybody<00:01:11.800> to<00:01:12.010> start<00:01:12.490> building<00:01:12.700> walls

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
asking everybody to start building walls

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.860 
asking everybody to start building walls
and<00:01:13.390> domes<00:01:13.600> this<00:01:14.200> isn't<00:01:14.590> about<00:01:14.979> that<00:01:15.159> at<00:01:15.520> all

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
and domes this isn't about that at all

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.370 
and domes this isn't about that at all
it<00:01:16.870> is<00:01:16.930> to<00:01:17.380> show<00:01:17.650> you<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:19.080> structures<00:01:20.080> that

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
it is to show you the structures that

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.149 
it is to show you the structures that
could<00:01:21.159> be<00:01:21.340> reasonably<00:01:22.060> built<00:01:22.479> today<00:01:23.159> that

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
could be reasonably built today that

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.240 
could be reasonably built today that
could<00:01:24.400> withstand<00:01:25.680> hurricanes<00:01:26.680> and<00:01:27.240> flood<00:01:28.240> and

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
could withstand hurricanes and flood and

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.210 
could withstand hurricanes and flood and
even<00:01:30.250> earthquakes<00:01:31.050> we<00:01:32.050> are<00:01:32.200> taking<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.950> best

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
even earthquakes we are taking the best

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.510 
even earthquakes we are taking the best
of<00:01:33.520> the<00:01:33.670> past

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
of the past

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.410 
of the past
and<00:01:34.880> moving<00:01:35.330> it<00:01:35.479> into<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.780> future<00:01:36.110> so<00:01:37.420> this

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
and moving it into the future so this

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.300 
and moving it into the future so this
unit<00:01:38.750> then<00:01:39.170> will<00:01:39.350> stand<00:01:39.680> by<00:01:39.890> itself

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
unit then will stand by itself

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.300 
unit then will stand by itself
it<00:01:40.460> doesn't<00:01:40.909> need<00:01:41.150> a<00:01:41.180> column<00:01:42.229> it<00:01:42.619> doesn't<00:01:43.100> need

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
it doesn't need a column it doesn't need

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.290 
it doesn't need a column it doesn't need
a<00:01:43.340> beam<00:01:43.640> you<00:01:43.670> don't<00:01:44.119> need<00:01:44.270> to<00:01:44.450> cut<00:01:44.690> trees<00:01:46.300> and

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
a beam you don't need to cut trees and

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.420 
a beam you don't need to cut trees and
yet<00:01:47.479> for<00:01:47.960> us<00:01:48.110> to<00:01:48.350> build<00:01:48.530> a<00:01:48.650> small<00:01:48.950> house<00:01:49.190> we

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
yet for us to build a small house we

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.790 
yet for us to build a small house we
have<00:01:49.580> to<00:01:49.700> go<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:50.030> cut<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:50.720> forest<00:01:51.050> create<00:01:51.590> all

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
have to go and cut the forest create all

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.580 
have to go and cut the forest create all
these<00:01:51.979> factories<00:01:52.640> and<00:01:53.360> some<00:01:53.720> and<00:01:53.960> bring<00:01:54.200> still

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
these factories and some and bring still

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.370 
these factories and some and bring still
bring<00:01:54.890> plastic<00:01:55.490> all<00:01:55.759> of<00:01:55.909> that<00:01:56.119> just<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:56.930> value

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
bring plastic all of that just to value

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.300 
bring plastic all of that just to value
ourselves<00:01:57.560> small<00:01:58.220> house<00:01:59.170> definitely<00:02:00.310> it's

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
ourselves small house definitely it's

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.639 
ourselves small house definitely it's
like<00:02:01.610> a<00:02:01.640> martial<00:02:02.270> arts<00:02:02.690> that<00:02:02.899> you<00:02:03.080> need<00:02:03.350> to

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
like a martial arts that you need to

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.930 
like a martial arts that you need to
know<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:04.210> movement<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.869> meaning<00:02:06.290> of<00:02:06.470> them

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
know the movement the meaning of them

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.029 
know the movement the meaning of them
you're<00:02:07.940> creating<00:02:08.509> what<00:02:08.720> we<00:02:08.750> call<00:02:09.039> jealous

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
you're creating what we call jealous
