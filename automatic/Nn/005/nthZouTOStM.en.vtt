milliamps compared to 1160 the internal

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:20.160 
milliamps compared to 1160 the internal
battery<00:02:13.989> but<00:02:14.829> it's<00:02:15.010> two<00:02:15.190> times<00:02:15.400> bigger<00:02:19.170> now

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
battery but it's two times bigger now

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:33.410 
battery but it's two times bigger now
let's<00:02:20.470> attach<00:02:20.799> it<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.220> go<00:02:21.519> pro

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:45.720 

now<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:34.600> looks<00:02:34.750> like<00:02:35.020> a<00:02:35.050> big<00:02:44.160> both<00:02:45.160> batteries

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
now it looks like a big both batteries

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.580 
now it looks like a big both batteries
are<00:02:46.000> fully<00:02:46.300> charged<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:46.810> now<00:02:46.990> let's<00:02:47.200> run<00:02:47.410> the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
are fully charged and now let's run the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.490 
are fully charged and now let's run the
test<00:02:47.890> and<00:02:48.130> see<00:02:49.030> how<00:02:49.510> long<00:02:49.570> it<00:02:49.930> can<00:02:50.140> record

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
test and see how long it can record

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.720 
test and see how long it can record
until<00:02:50.890> it<00:02:51.010> will<00:02:51.220> stop<00:02:51.580> a<00:02:53.220> better<00:02:54.220> indicator

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
until it will stop a better indicator

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.180 
until it will stop a better indicator
sucks<00:02:55.209> big<00:02:55.480> time<00:02:55.510> in<00:02:56.140> GoPro<00:02:56.620> app<00:02:56.770> you<00:02:56.950> can't

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
sucks big time in GoPro app you can't

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.280 
sucks big time in GoPro app you can't
see<00:02:57.489> it<00:02:57.640> while<00:02:57.910> recording<00:02:58.270> and<00:02:58.690> it<00:02:58.810> shows<00:02:59.050> on

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
see it while recording and it shows on

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.140 
see it while recording and it shows on
in<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.530> internal<00:02:59.800> GoPro<00:03:00.310> battery<00:03:00.730> status<00:03:01.650> and

in the internal GoPro battery status and

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.060 
in the internal GoPro battery status and
the<00:03:04.150> GoPro<00:03:04.660> display<00:03:05.110> they<00:03:05.350> made<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:05.560> bunch<00:03:05.920> of

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
the GoPro display they made a bunch of

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.340 
the GoPro display they made a bunch of
crap<00:03:06.340> points<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:07.270> show<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.630> total<00:03:07.959> battery

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
crap points to show the total battery

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.770 
crap points to show the total battery
left<00:03:08.530> which<00:03:08.890> is<00:03:08.920> also<00:03:09.400> does<00:03:09.970> not<00:03:10.120> work<00:03:10.420> well

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
left which is also does not work well

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.710 
left which is also does not work well
and<00:03:11.019> it's<00:03:11.530> completely<00:03:12.280> non<00:03:12.790> intuitive<00:03:15.720> okay

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
and it's completely non intuitive okay

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.509 
and it's completely non intuitive okay
now<00:03:16.989> both<00:03:17.320> batteries<00:03:17.800> are<00:03:17.980> completely

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
now both batteries are completely

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.370 
now both batteries are completely
discharged<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:21.190> run<00:03:21.519> for<00:03:21.820> two<00:03:22.120> hours<00:03:22.300> and<00:03:22.690> 43

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
discharged it run for two hours and 43

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.600 
discharged it run for two hours and 43
minutes<00:03:23.410> I<00:03:25.739> highly<00:03:26.739> recommend<00:03:26.830> this<00:03:27.280> backpack

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
minutes I highly recommend this backpack

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.699 
minutes I highly recommend this backpack
or<00:03:28.030> otherwise<00:03:28.480> you<00:03:28.750> will<00:03:28.900> change<00:03:29.170> batteries

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
or otherwise you will change batteries

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.590 
or otherwise you will change batteries
every<00:03:30.190> hour<00:03:32.700> but<00:03:33.700> it's<00:03:33.850> a<00:03:33.940> shame<00:03:34.209> that<00:03:34.239> it's

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
every hour but it's a shame that it's

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.509 
every hour but it's a shame that it's
twice<00:03:34.870> bigger<00:03:35.200> than<00:03:35.500> internal<00:03:35.950> battery<00:03:36.340> and

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
twice bigger than internal battery and

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.539 
twice bigger than internal battery and
