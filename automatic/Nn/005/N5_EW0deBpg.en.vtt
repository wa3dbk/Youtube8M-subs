00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
you'd probably have to put in for really

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.400 
you'd probably have to put in for really
cheap<00:02:57.180> my<00:02:57.360> team<00:02:57.630> points<00:02:57.930> but<00:02:58.020> if<00:02:58.140> it's<00:02:58.260> like<00:02:58.380> a

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
cheap my team points but if it's like a

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.960 
cheap my team points but if it's like a
really<00:02:58.680> good<00:02:58.770> player<00:02:59.010> so<00:02:59.490> you<00:02:59.520> put<00:02:59.820> like<00:02:59.940> a

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
really good player so you put like a

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.610 
really good player so you put like a
little<00:03:00.060> Bron<00:03:00.420> James<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:01.050> you<00:03:01.110> try<00:03:01.350> putting

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
little Bron James and you try putting

him<00:03:01.860> on<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.010> auction<00:03:02.310> box<00:03:02.730> like<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:02.910> hunch<00:03:03.180> of

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
him on the auction box like a hunch of

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.360 
him on the auction box like a hunch of
my<00:03:03.420> team<00:03:03.690> points<00:03:04.050> he<00:03:04.290> didn't<00:03:04.710> get<00:03:04.800> scooped<00:03:05.130> up

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
my team points he didn't get scooped up

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.950 
my team points he didn't get scooped up
like<00:03:05.760> in<00:03:06.000> seconds<00:03:06.450> man<00:03:06.600> it's<00:03:06.780> gonna<00:03:06.900> be

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
like in seconds man it's gonna be

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.830 
like in seconds man it's gonna be
instantly<00:03:07.950> where<00:03:08.940> he<00:03:09.060> just<00:03:09.240> gets<00:03:09.420> taken<00:03:09.600> off

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
instantly where he just gets taken off

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.390 
instantly where he just gets taken off
the<00:03:10.020> auction<00:03:10.350> block<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:10.680> on<00:03:10.830> so<00:03:11.010> they<00:03:11.220> add<00:03:11.370> a

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
the auction block so on so they add a

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.490 
the auction block so on so they add a
trade<00:03:11.700> block<00:03:11.970> which<00:03:12.210> hopefully<00:03:12.750> maybe<00:03:13.260> they

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
trade block which hopefully maybe they

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.170 
trade block which hopefully maybe they
can<00:03:13.620> possibly<00:03:13.830> patch<00:03:14.250> in<00:03:14.610> or<00:03:14.760> if<00:03:14.910> not<00:03:15.120> that

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
can possibly patch in or if not that

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.020 
can possibly patch in or if not that
they<00:03:15.900> can<00:03:16.080> maybe<00:03:16.260> add<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.650> in<00:03:16.740> 2k<00:03:17.100> 16<00:03:17.160> that's

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
they can maybe add it in 2k 16 that's

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.310 
they can maybe add it in 2k 16 that's
gonna<00:03:18.209> be<00:03:18.360> tough<00:03:18.570> to<00:03:18.600> edge<00:03:18.810> your<00:03:18.930> players<00:03:19.170> but
