 and hello friends today i am telling you 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.280
 show how to make such a chassis 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:16.699
 part of the machine that is, if we turn on 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.769
 we will go both in one way and another 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:25.730
 here you can substitute the wheels and all that 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:31.609
 please so let's start with me now 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:36.050
 It will be mounted on the daughter of a peasant every video 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:41.150
 another account well, in general, now it will be 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:44.920
 everything is interesting to see so let's start for 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.920
 beginning we need this here 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:57.250
 which put's in this way that 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.350
 we take true this stick sochi room 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:04.000
 We insert it like this if you hope it does not matter 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.000
 then take this one 

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:14.390
 leave like this if it dangles 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:21.189
 again, it does not matter then everything will turn out 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:22.729
 then take three of his wand again and 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:28.009
 take this 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:34.860
 paste here now we need 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:37.780
 wand with the article number 6 and here is such a 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:44.409
 what gear to call them 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:46.650
 insert it like this and slide it in with 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.119
 two sides stuck out on one such 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:53.860
 couple 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:57.040
 we take a gadget we put 1 countries where 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:03.990
 us a little so small detail 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:08.380
 was so then we take the gear 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:13.870
 a little tech series itself there like this 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:20.380
 he holds then we take the wand for 5 and already 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:21.880
 everything works now we take our 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:30.700
 such a four 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:32.560
 4 with a sticking out set u so twist if 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.130
 everything works if you spin 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:40.299
 so good now try to twist 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.430
 here here as we see it is not covered 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.959
 on the contrary it is good for cars that is not 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.290
 will slip wheels when she 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.209
 will stand with a slide who take a little 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.070
 little black if you need 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.680
 if you have above the top take the black one 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:59.049
 such a paste here here so that 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:02.560
 it turned out and then we insert it like this 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:06.040
 here here if you have no motor you can 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.760
 just manually make a gear here 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:17.140
 put will spin this is not all 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:22.320
 now we take these two 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.320
 here and put here so 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:34.100
 then if your wheels are near 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.100
 Immediately take the red ones so small 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:42.720
 from two sides 100 and then install 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:55.350
 wheels in my case are such teachers well you 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:04:02.780
 so that you can see so insert our 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:02.780
 we turn on the motor and itâ€™s spinning 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:13.460
 it is possible so in one way in the other direction 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.730
 so subscribe to the channel put 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:21.820
