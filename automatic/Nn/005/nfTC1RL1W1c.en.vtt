00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
because I love the graphics and how it

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.900 
because I love the graphics and how it
like<00:02:08.000> loads<00:02:08.450> faster<00:02:09.229> a<00:02:09.500> damn<00:02:10.280> it's<00:02:10.550> already

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
like loads faster a damn it's already

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.009 
like loads faster a damn it's already
done<00:02:11.410> and<00:02:12.410> go<00:02:14.140> it<00:02:15.140> gets<00:02:15.500> up<00:02:15.769> to<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:17.090> maximum<00:02:17.570> of

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
done and go it gets up to the maximum of

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.380 
done and go it gets up to the maximum of
I<00:02:18.350> think<00:02:19.300> 60<00:02:20.300> miles<00:02:20.510> per<00:02:20.780> hour<00:02:20.950> as<00:02:21.950> a<00:02:22.910> lot<00:02:23.209> of

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
I think 60 miles per hour as a lot of

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.070
