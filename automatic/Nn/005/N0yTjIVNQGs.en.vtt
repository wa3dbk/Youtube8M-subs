car and holden have been designing large
cars<00:00:20.659> for<00:00:20.929> years<00:00:21.140> so<00:00:21.499> it's<00:00:21.890> no<00:00:22.130> surprise<00:00:22.339> to

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:22.759 
cars for years so it's no surprise to

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.059

the HMI and the user interface it's

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.090 
the HMI and the user interface it's
about<00:01:29.569> letting<00:01:29.899> the<00:01:30.049> technology<00:01:30.619> be<00:01:30.829> there

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
about letting the technology be there

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.300 
about letting the technology be there
but<00:01:31.340> not<00:01:31.639> be<00:01:31.880> in<00:01:32.149> your<00:01:32.240> face<00:01:32.479> so<00:01:33.229> it's<00:01:33.649> all<00:01:33.829> sort
