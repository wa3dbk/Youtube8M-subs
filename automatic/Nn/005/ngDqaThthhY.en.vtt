 Vaughn released video for the first time 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.010

 controller in action in the video shown 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.390
 several actions and strategies at once 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.099
 which is in portal 2 civilization 5 and 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.690
 counter-strike in steam actions 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.640
 the controller looks a lot more 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.620
 confident than ordinary gamepads player 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.390
 aim quickly and accurately with ease 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.150
 performs all necessary movements in 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.160
 flesh to 100 f and squats thanks 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.480
 used by the touch panel player can 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.640
 smoothly change the speed of movement 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.360
 character that can not be done on 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.980
 keyboard 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.080
 but on the strategy in the steam controller 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.090
 while it looks not so convincing we are not 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.500
 noticed that the player had 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.510
 some serious difficulties with 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.549
 control, however, the action performs 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.590
 slower than possible at the usual 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.330
 combinations of mouse and keyboard 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.099
 I remind you that the steam controller should 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.380
 come out next year this gamepad 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.209
 will be combined as Spock so from the main 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.769
 gaming operating system blade 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.769
 which is called steam os 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.100
 until the end of the year riot games is planning 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.550
 add to league of legends unusual 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.070
 mode 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.080
 he for all in him for each side will be 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.240
 perform 5 identical heroes current 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.740
 the rules of the game prohibits such a situation 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.930
 this mode will require players 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.760
 completely new tactics and skills 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.320
 reserve for a u in riot games 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.390
 plans to start a new tradition 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.610
 regularly add new modes to the game 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.440
 which pro only exists a certain 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.510
 mode time is scheduled to change once 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.190
 several months so the players 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.990
 will constantly get new emotions 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.160
 however if some mode is very 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.260
 like users 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.320
 he will be able to return to the game on a permanent 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.320
 basis 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.449
 american musician with dillinger 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.430
 stated that rockstar is illegal 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.349
 I used in the game 5 5 of his two tracks 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.120
 now the rapper demands from the company 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:19.400
 withdraw and destroy all sold 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.690
 copies of the game where he said that first 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.830
 rockstar tried to get 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.460
 official use right 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.349
 Tracks offering fees 4270 1 dollar 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.849
 but after the musician rejected 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:30.740
 counting the amount of the offer 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:32.780
 too small company anyway 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.099
 included the song in the game without paying 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.990
 he already has a penny 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:37.970
 Dz's lawyers have already sent to rockstar 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.009
 official company claim 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.660
 invites or withdraw or destroy 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:44.000
 all sold buy games or offer 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.070
 dose of fees the amount he deems 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.930
 sufficient considering that then already 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:52.060
 earned over a billion dollars we 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.060
 we think that the rapper will not waste time on trifles 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.379
 surgeons from a Paris hospital took 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.240
 as a rule before each operation 56 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:12.370
 minutes to play arcade super monkey ball 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.319
 there was this tradition after 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.939
 surgeon james router did research 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:18.159
 within which tested about 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:20.110
 300 colleagues who played 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:22.060
 before performing a trial operation on 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.710
 Special simulator showed the best 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.409
 more favorable outcomes 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.030
 for the patient Ross also stated that by 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:30.129
 his data surgeons who in the past 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.229
 spent on the games at least three hours 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:34.120
 weeks make 37 percent less 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:35.919
 mistakes and work at 27 percent 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.750
 faster than doctors never 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:39.699
 addicted to video games 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.949
 James generally has a very high opinion of 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:43.780
 video games he thinks is interactive 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:45.550
 entertainment will be part of a revolution in 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.229
 education and completely change our 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.520
 idea of ​​how people can and 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:49.960
 must learn 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.949
 that was all the news for today thanks 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.949
 for the attention of all bye
