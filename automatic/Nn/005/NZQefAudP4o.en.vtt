00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
how much of that's going to make it to

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.990 
how much of that's going to make it to
the<00:00:46.140> camera<00:00:46.440> but<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.219> thing<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.640> really

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
the camera but this thing is really

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.260 
the camera but this thing is really
glossed<00:00:48.539> up<00:00:48.860> it<00:00:49.860> seems<00:00:50.070> like<00:00:50.219> they<00:00:50.370> use<00:00:51.090> some

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
glossed up it seems like they use some

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.540

printed the black line up the side I

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.479 
printed the black line up the side I
really<00:00:58.320> think<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.649> was<00:00:58.859> somebody's<00:00:59.280> pet

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489

really think this was somebody's pet
project<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.030> think<00:01:00.090> somebody<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.719> worked<00:01:00.899> for

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
project I think somebody that worked for

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.680 
project I think somebody that worked for
Mattel<00:01:01.829> owned<00:01:02.460> one<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.910> these<00:01:03.030> really<00:01:03.449> liked

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
Mattel owned one of these really liked

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.160 
Mattel owned one of these really liked
it<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.320> sunroof<00:01:05.360> I<00:01:06.360> don't<00:01:06.750> know<00:01:06.840> about<00:01:06.960> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
it the sunroof I don't know about the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.859 
it the sunroof I don't know about the
chrome<00:01:07.380> seats<00:01:07.770> inside<00:01:08.390> maybe<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.540> was<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.689> little

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
chrome seats inside maybe I was a little

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.270 
chrome seats inside maybe I was a little
short<00:01:10.110> cutting<00:01:10.409> it's<00:01:10.619> not<00:01:10.740> chrome<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
short cutting it's not chrome on the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.410 
short cutting it's not chrome on the
bottom<00:01:11.640> you'd<00:01:11.820> think<00:01:11.939> it'd<00:01:12.090> be<00:01:12.119> chrome

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
bottom you'd think it'd be chrome

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.330 
bottom you'd think it'd be chrome
everywhere<00:01:12.990> for<00:01:13.260> what<00:01:13.409> they're<00:01:13.590> doing<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.070> I

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
everywhere for what they're doing but I

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.310 
everywhere for what they're doing but I
think<00:01:14.939> they<00:01:15.030> wanted<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.420> chrome<00:01:15.689> grille<00:01:16.020> and

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
think they wanted to chrome grille and

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.960 
think they wanted to chrome grille and
the<00:01:16.380> black<00:01:16.650> underside<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.610> order<00:01:17.939> to

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
the black underside and in order to

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.660 
the black underside and in order to
accomplish<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:19.049> piece<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.890> molded<00:01:20.549> in

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
accomplish that this piece is molded in

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.010 
accomplish that this piece is molded in
with<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> rest<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.390> them<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.689> that's<00:01:21.750> why<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
with the rest of them and that's why the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.219 
with the rest of them and that's why the
interior<00:01:22.619> end<00:01:23.400> up<00:01:23.490> having<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:24.030> chrome<00:01:24.299> it's

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
interior end up having to be chrome it's

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.170 
interior end up having to be chrome it's
really<00:01:25.740> interesting<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.490> see<00:01:26.640> chrome

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
really interesting to see chrome

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.810 
really interesting to see chrome
interior<00:01:27.780> they<00:01:28.619> even<00:01:28.799> did<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.070> spare<00:01:29.310> tire<00:01:29.549> in

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
interior they even did the spare tire in

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.480 
interior they even did the spare tire in
the<00:01:29.909> back<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.630> see<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.930> drive<00:01:31.170> line<00:01:31.500> you

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
the back you can see the drive line you

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.069 
the back you can see the drive line you
can<00:01:32.610> see<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.850> engine<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.780> see<00:01:33.930> even

can see the engine and you can see even

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.770 
can see the engine and you can see even
the<00:01:34.290> torsion<00:01:34.740> bars<00:01:35.090> instead<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.210> using<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.540> coil

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the torsion bars instead of using a coil

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.480 
the torsion bars instead of using a coil
spring<00:01:36.900> oftentimes<00:01:37.619> we'll<00:01:37.799> use<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.979> torsion

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
spring oftentimes we'll use a torsion

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.149 
spring oftentimes we'll use a torsion
bar<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:39.210> uses<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.689> metal<00:01:39.990> twisting<00:01:40.530> as<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
bar it uses the metal twisting as the

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.730 
bar it uses the metal twisting as the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
spring for the suspension of course you

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.859 
spring for the suspension of course you
have<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.890> rear<00:01:44.070> view<00:01:44.130> mirrors<00:01:44.630> let's<00:01:45.630> give<00:01:45.840> it

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
have the rear view mirrors let's give it

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.840 
have the rear view mirrors let's give it
a<00:01:46.020> roll<00:01:46.170> roll<00:01:46.560> test<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.100> see<00:01:47.250> how<00:01:47.280> that's

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
a roll roll test and see how that's

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.260

smooth<00:01:48.770> these<00:01:49.770> pet<00:01:50.100> project<00:01:50.640> ones<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.090> can

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
smooth these pet project ones you can
