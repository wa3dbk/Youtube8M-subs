sometimes you might want to get

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.199 
sometimes you might want to get
adjustable<00:02:30.100> vice<00:02:30.370> grips<00:02:30.640> put<00:02:30.910> a<00:02:30.940> cloth

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
adjustable vice grips put a cloth

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.360 
adjustable vice grips put a cloth
between<00:02:31.450> here<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:31.900> here<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.290> squeeze<00:02:32.980> on<00:02:33.190> it

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
between here and here and squeeze on it

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.140 
between here and here and squeeze on it
so<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.360> squishes<00:02:34.690> in<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.280> hydraulic<00:02:36.280> now<00:02:37.030> in

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
so it squishes in the hydraulic now in

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.250 
so it squishes in the hydraulic now in
order<00:02:37.330> to<00:02:37.480> put<00:02:37.690> this<00:02:37.870> in<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.350> right<00:02:38.560> way<00:02:38.620> as

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
order to put this in the right way as

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.199 
order to put this in the right way as
you're<00:02:41.260> going<00:02:41.350> to<00:02:41.410> put<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:42.459> piece<00:02:42.700> that<00:02:43.000> comes

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
you're going to put the piece that comes

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.009 
you're going to put the piece that comes
out<00:02:43.450> with<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:43.750> gap<00:02:44.310> just<00:02:45.310> like<00:02:45.489> this<00:02:46.019> alright

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
out with the gap just like this alright

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.449 
out with the gap just like this alright
so<00:02:47.079> we're<00:02:47.380> going<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.530> set<00:02:47.799> it<00:02:47.920> down<00:02:47.950> in<00:02:48.250> there

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
so we're going to set it down in there

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
get yourself a 14 millimeter socket with

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.750 
get yourself a 14 millimeter socket with
an<00:06:25.110> extension<00:06:25.220> and<00:06:26.220> we're<00:06:26.310> going<00:06:26.430> to<00:06:26.460> hit<00:06:26.610> this

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
an extension and we're going to hit this

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.100 
an extension and we're going to hit this
bolt<00:06:27.000> right<00:06:27.060> here<00:06:27.210> now<00:06:27.480> this<00:06:27.630> bolt<00:06:27.900> has

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
bolt right here now this bolt has

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.410 
bolt right here now this bolt has
Stoppers<00:06:28.650> and<00:06:28.890> they're<00:06:29.700> carved<00:06:30.060> out<00:06:30.180> on<00:06:30.330> the

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:30.420 
Stoppers and they're carved out on the

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.700 
Stoppers and they're carved out on the
side<00:06:30.600> of<00:06:30.630> the<00:06:30.750> boat<00:06:30.900> so<00:06:31.080> every<00:06:31.230> time<00:06:31.350> you<00:06:31.500> turn

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
side of the boat so every time you turn

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.770 
side of the boat so every time you turn
it<00:06:31.740> the<00:06:32.610> bolt<00:06:32.820> is<00:06:33.000> gonna<00:06:33.560> lock<00:06:34.560> in<00:06:35.420> so<00:06:36.420> it<00:06:36.570> can't

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
it the bolt is gonna lock in so it can't

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.960 
it the bolt is gonna lock in so it can't
back<00:06:36.990> out<00:06:37.200> so<00:06:37.650> when<00:06:37.800> you<00:06:37.890> turn<00:06:38.070> it<00:06:38.310> let<00:06:38.670> me<00:06:38.760> see

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:38.970 
back out so when you turn it let me see

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.460 
back out so when you turn it let me see
if<00:06:39.060> I<00:06:39.120> can<00:06:39.300> show<00:06:39.480> you<00:06:39.540> right<00:06:39.900> there<00:06:40.140> you<00:06:40.260> see

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.470 
if I can show you right there you see

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.590 
if I can show you right there you see
how<00:06:40.560> it's<00:06:40.740> oval<00:06:41.040> doubt<00:06:41.250> so<00:06:42.090> if<00:06:42.180> you<00:06:42.300> leave<00:06:42.420> it

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 
how it's oval doubt so if you leave it

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.280 
how it's oval doubt so if you leave it
like<00:06:42.750> that

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:43.290 
like that

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.740 
like that
the<00:06:43.620> bolts<00:06:43.890> going<00:06:44.070> to<00:06:44.160> spin<00:06:44.670> backwards<00:06:44.910> so<00:06:45.720> you

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
the bolts going to spin backwards so you

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.050 
the bolts going to spin backwards so you
got<00:06:45.930> to<00:06:46.020> turn<00:06:46.170> it<00:06:46.320> one<00:06:46.560> at<00:06:46.770> a<00:06:46.830> time<00:06:47.100> so<00:06:47.850> if<00:06:47.970> you

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
got to turn it one at a time so if you

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.600 
got to turn it one at a time so if you
feel<00:06:48.210> it<00:06:48.390> really<00:06:48.720> loose<00:06:49.280> I'm<00:06:50.280> going<00:06:50.460> to<00:06:50.520> do

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
feel it really loose I'm going to do

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.579 
feel it really loose I'm going to do
about<00:06:50.730> five

00:06:55.579 --> 00:06:55.589 

00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:57.719 

you<00:06:56.589> don't<00:06:56.740> want<00:06:56.860> to<00:06:56.919> do<00:06:57.039> too<00:06:57.249> much<00:06:57.460> because

00:06:57.719 --> 00:06:57.729 
you don't want to do too much because

00:06:57.729 --> 00:06:59.579 
you don't want to do too much because
then<00:06:58.089> the<00:06:58.240> break<00:06:58.479> will<00:06:58.659> be<00:06:58.689> stopping<00:06:59.169> at<00:06:59.439> all

00:06:59.579 --> 00:06:59.589 
then the break will be stopping at all

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:01.950 
then the break will be stopping at all
times<00:06:59.919> and<00:07:00.159> you<00:07:00.219> won't<00:07:00.460> get<00:07:00.580> any<00:07:00.639> speed<00:07:01.120> so<00:07:01.809> go

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
times and you won't get any speed so go

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.309 
times and you won't get any speed so go
ahead<00:07:02.259> and<00:07:02.469> test<00:07:03.189> your<00:07:03.339> breakout<00:07:04.020> until<00:07:05.020> where

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:05.319 
ahead and test your breakout until where

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:07.739 
ahead and test your breakout until where
you<00:07:05.439> pull<00:07:05.650> it<00:07:05.800> about<00:07:05.979> halfway<00:07:06.249> or<00:07:07.089> right<00:07:07.449> a

00:07:07.739 --> 00:07:07.749 
you pull it about halfway or right a

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:09.450 
you pull it about halfway or right a
little<00:07:08.229> bit<00:07:08.379> of<00:07:08.589> pull<00:07:08.770> like<00:07:09.039> maybe<00:07:09.339> a

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.460 
little bit of pull like maybe a

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.760 
little bit of pull like maybe a
quarter-inch<00:07:10.120> and<00:07:10.629> then<00:07:11.139> it<00:07:11.259> starts<00:07:11.529> grabbing

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:11.770 
quarter-inch and then it starts grabbing

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.559 
quarter-inch and then it starts grabbing
but<00:07:12.400> you<00:07:12.520> don't<00:07:12.669> want<00:07:12.879> it<00:07:12.969> to<00:07:13.089> where<00:07:13.240> it<00:07:13.330> grabs

00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:13.569 
but you don't want it to where it grabs

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:15.450 
but you don't want it to where it grabs
immediately<00:07:14.139> because<00:07:14.349> if<00:07:14.469> it<00:07:14.589> does<00:07:14.770> then

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:15.460 
immediately because if it does then

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.429 
immediately because if it does then
you're<00:07:16.389> going<00:07:16.509> to<00:07:16.569> be<00:07:16.689> dragged<00:07:16.930> and<00:07:17.110> break<00:07:17.289> the

00:07:17.429 --> 00:07:17.439 
you're going to be dragged and break the

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:20.309 
you're going to be dragged and break the
whole<00:07:17.620> way<00:07:17.770> all<00:07:18.639> right<00:07:18.819> so<00:07:19.599> we<00:07:19.809> went<00:07:20.050> ahead<00:07:20.139> and

00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 
whole way all right so we went ahead and

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:23.519 
whole way all right so we went ahead and
tighten<00:07:20.889> it<00:07:20.949> up<00:07:21.039> five<00:07:21.279> clicks<00:07:21.610> and<00:07:21.939> now<00:07:22.569> I<00:07:22.900> feel

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:23.529 
tighten it up five clicks and now I feel

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:25.350 
tighten it up five clicks and now I feel
it<00:07:23.680> get<00:07:23.830> tight<00:07:24.159> like<00:07:24.370> it's<00:07:24.400> harder<00:07:24.909> to<00:07:25.029> pull<00:07:25.240> it

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 
it get tight like it's harder to pull it

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.899 
it get tight like it's harder to pull it
right<00:07:25.779> about<00:07:26.020> there<00:07:26.319> it<00:07:26.830> engages<00:07:27.159> right<00:07:27.639> there

00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:27.909

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:29.800 
you don't want it to where it engages
