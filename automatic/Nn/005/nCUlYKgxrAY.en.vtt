as the water rises in the tank it then

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.490 
as the water rises in the tank it then
reaches<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.270> outlet<00:01:58.630> pipe<00:01:58.840> in<00:01:59.049> the<00:01:59.140> septic

tank all the discharge point and from
there<00:02:02.140> it<00:02:02.380> makes<00:02:02.860> its<00:02:03.070> way<00:02:03.250> down<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:03.640> pipe

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
there it makes its way down the pipe

there it makes its way down the pipe
work<00:02:04.360> into<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.289> soak<00:02:05.500> away<00:02:06.030> now<00:02:07.030> as<00:02:07.329> the<00:02:07.869> water

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
work into the soak away now as the water

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.370 
work into the soak away now as the water
enters<00:02:08.319> the<00:02:08.709> soak<00:02:09.099> away<00:02:09.429> via<00:02:10.119> gravity<00:02:10.539> the

enters the soak away via gravity the

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.470 
enters the soak away via gravity the
water<00:02:11.650> naturally<00:02:12.550> makes<00:02:12.790> its<00:02:13.030> way<00:02:13.120> through

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
water naturally makes its way through

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.080 
the soak away from the top all the way
to<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.450> bottom<00:02:16.630> where<00:02:17.500> it<00:02:17.650> finally<00:02:18.090> drains

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
to the bottom where it finally drains

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.070 
to the bottom where it finally drains
away<00:02:19.299> naturally

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
away naturally

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.100 
away naturally
into<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.799> subsoil

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.840 

okay<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:26.650> we've<00:02:26.830> looked<00:02:26.980> at<00:02:27.190> what<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.430> septic

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
okay so we've looked at what a septic

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.240 
okay so we've looked at what a septic
tank<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:28.270> sokka<00:02:28.480> we<00:02:28.660> are<00:02:28.840> we've<00:02:29.709> looked<00:02:30.010> at

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
tank and sokka we are we've looked at

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.610 
tank and sokka we are we've looked at
what<00:02:31.090> I<00:02:31.120> said<00:02:31.360> how<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.780> septic<00:02:32.260> tank<00:02:32.290> and

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
what I said how a septic tank and

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.220 
what I said how a septic tank and
soakaway<00:02:32.980> work<00:02:33.340> now<00:02:34.330> we're<00:02:34.540> going<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.780> look<00:02:35.020> at

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
soakaway work now we're going to look at

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.370 
soakaway work now we're going to look at
why<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:35.920> septic<00:02:36.520> tank<00:02:36.550> and<00:02:37.060> so<00:02:37.360> Kuwait<00:02:37.750> becomes

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
why a septic tank and so Kuwait becomes

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.080 
why a septic tank and so Kuwait becomes
blocked

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.630 

so<00:02:46.090> just<00:02:46.870> how<00:02:47.200> does<00:02:47.590> a<00:02:47.620> septic<00:02:48.189> tank<00:02:48.220> in

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
so just how does a septic tank in

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.000 
so just how does a septic tank in
soakaway<00:02:49.090> become<00:02:49.540> blocked<00:02:49.840> well<00:02:50.709> what

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
soakaway become blocked well what

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.009 
soakaway become blocked well what
happens<00:02:51.459> is<00:02:51.640> as<00:02:51.819> the<00:02:51.939> effluent<00:02:52.390> leaves<00:02:52.720> the

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
happens is as the effluent leaves the

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.350 
happens is as the effluent leaves the
property<00:02:53.290> makes<00:02:54.280> its<00:02:54.459> way<00:02:54.549> into<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.970> septic

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
property makes its way into the septic

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.170 
property makes its way into the septic
tank<00:02:55.629> heavy<00:02:56.349> particles<00:02:56.950> of<00:02:57.129> fat<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.730> sludge

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
tank heavy particles of fat and sludge

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.600 
tank heavy particles of fat and sludge
fall<00:02:59.019> to<00:02:59.379> the<00:02:59.470> bottom<00:02:59.590> of<00:02:59.860> the<00:02:59.980> septic<00:03:00.310> tank

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
fall to the bottom of the septic tank

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.350 
fall to the bottom of the septic tank
and<00:03:00.939> in<00:03:01.659> time<00:03:01.959> these<00:03:02.739> break<00:03:03.190> off<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.730> float<00:03:04.030> up

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
and in time these break off and float up

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.809 
and in time these break off and float up
through<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:05.110> discharge<00:03:05.349> pipe<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.459> outlet

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
through the discharge pipe the outlet

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.850 
through the discharge pipe the outlet
pipe<00:03:07.000> on<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:07.269> septic<00:03:07.720> tank<00:03:07.989> and<00:03:08.409> make<00:03:08.650> their

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
pipe on the septic tank and make their

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.390 
pipe on the septic tank and make their
way<00:03:08.980> into<00:03:09.159> the<00:03:09.280> soak<00:03:09.579> away<00:03:09.900> now<00:03:11.040> also<00:03:12.040> Koei's

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
way into the soak away now also Koei's

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.729 
way into the soak away now also Koei's
are<00:03:12.730> prone<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.180> silting<00:03:14.170> up<00:03:14.260> from<00:03:14.530> heavy

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
are prone to silting up from heavy

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.890 
are prone to silting up from heavy
particles<00:03:15.370> of<00:03:15.519> fat<00:03:15.790> grease<00:03:16.299> and<00:03:16.510> other<00:03:16.629> debris

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
particles of fat grease and other debris

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.190 
particles of fat grease and other debris
why<00:03:17.560> well<00:03:18.010> because<00:03:18.299> solid<00:03:19.299> particles<00:03:19.989> like

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
why well because solid particles like

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.789 
why well because solid particles like
cholesterol<00:03:20.739> end<00:03:21.489> up<00:03:22.060> in<00:03:22.359> the<00:03:22.720> soak<00:03:22.930> away<00:03:23.139> and

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
cholesterol end up in the soak away and

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.069 
cholesterol end up in the soak away and
what<00:03:23.950> happens<00:03:24.370> is<00:03:24.609> if<00:03:24.970> you<00:03:25.299> think<00:03:25.569> of<00:03:25.690> you<00:03:25.810> soak

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
what happens is if you think of you soak

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.140 
what happens is if you think of you soak
away<00:03:26.260> like<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.530> person<00:03:27.129> who<00:03:27.489> eats<00:03:27.519> loads<00:03:27.970> of

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
away like a person who eats loads of

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.149 
away like a person who eats loads of
chips<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.959> crisps<00:03:29.470> and<00:03:29.650> burgers<00:03:30.129> and

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 
chips and crisps and burgers and

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.030 
chips and crisps and burgers and
takeaway<00:03:30.670> meals<00:03:30.849> I<00:03:31.180> mean<00:03:31.739> he'll<00:03:32.739> get<00:03:32.920> away

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
takeaway meals I mean he'll get away

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.740 
takeaway meals I mean he'll get away
with<00:03:33.340> it<00:03:33.459> you<00:03:33.549> can<00:03:33.760> junk<00:03:34.000> food<00:03:34.239> for<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.540> while

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
with it you can junk food for a while

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.899 
with it you can junk food for a while
but<00:03:35.049> it's<00:03:35.170> only<00:03:35.349> a<00:03:35.500> matter<00:03:35.680> of<00:03:35.859> time<00:03:36.220> before

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:36.909 
but it's only a matter of time before

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.180 
but it's only a matter of time before
his<00:03:37.269> arteries<00:03:37.750> clogged<00:03:38.079> up<00:03:38.290> and<00:03:38.440> his<00:03:38.889> heart

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
his arteries clogged up and his heart

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.220 
his arteries clogged up and his heart
cries<00:03:39.549> I<00:03:39.940> can't<00:03:40.120> take<00:03:40.690> it<00:03:40.840> anymore

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
cries I can't take it anymore

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.430 
cries I can't take it anymore
and<00:03:41.620> give<00:03:41.829> that<00:03:42.040> well<00:03:42.970> soak<00:03:43.420> aways<00:03:43.690> also<00:03:44.200> meet

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
and give that well soak aways also meet

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.860 
and give that well soak aways also meet
with<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.769> same<00:03:44.950> fate<00:03:45.599> because<00:03:46.599> I<00:03:46.629> was

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
with the same fate because I was

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.170 
with the same fate because I was
subjected<00:03:47.079> to<00:03:47.590> a<00:03:47.739> bad<00:03:48.040> diet<00:03:48.459> over<00:03:48.819> the<00:03:48.909> years

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
subjected to a bad diet over the years

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.150 
subjected to a bad diet over the years
they<00:03:49.690> eventually<00:03:49.930> become<00:03:50.500> blocked<00:03:50.859> and

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
they eventually become blocked and

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.330 
they eventually become blocked and
clogged<00:03:51.609> up<00:03:52.019> once<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:53.199> SoCo<00:03:53.590> is<00:03:53.709> clogged<00:03:54.069> up

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
clogged up once the SoCo is clogged up

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.150 
clogged up once the SoCo is clogged up
it<00:03:54.609> will<00:03:55.090> cease<00:03:55.359> to<00:03:55.389> function<00:03:55.810> and<00:03:56.500> the

typical soak away only has a lifespan of
about<00:03:59.859> 15<00:04:00.519> years<00:04:01.319> interestingly<00:04:02.549> most<00:04:03.549> people

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
about 15 years interestingly most people

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.699 
about 15 years interestingly most people
don't<00:04:04.299> know<00:04:04.480> their<00:04:04.720> septic<00:04:05.079> tanks<00:04:05.410> failed

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
don't know their septic tanks failed

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.460 
don't know their septic tanks failed
until<00:04:06.549> they<00:04:06.669> experience<00:04:07.359> symptoms<00:04:07.810> like<00:04:08.260> I've

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
until they experience symptoms like I've

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.009 
until they experience symptoms like I've
been<00:04:08.829> unable<00:04:09.010> to<00:04:09.190> flush<00:04:09.639> a<00:04:09.669> toilet<00:04:09.790> or<00:04:10.329> having

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
to get the septic tank emptied more

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.039 
to get the septic tank emptied more
frequently

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
frequently

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.050 
frequently
okay<00:04:16.049> so<00:04:16.829> we've<00:04:17.010> seen<00:04:17.040> what<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.549> septic<00:04:18.030> tank

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
okay so we've seen what a septic tank

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.110 
okay so we've seen what a septic tank
and<00:04:18.359> sokka<00:04:18.660> we<00:04:18.840> are<00:04:19.130> we've<00:04:20.130> seen<00:04:20.400> how<00:04:20.579> a<00:04:20.609> septic

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
and sokka we are we've seen how a septic

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.160 
and sokka we are we've seen how a septic
tank<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.660> subway<00:04:22.230> work<00:04:22.580> we've<00:04:23.580> seen<00:04:23.910> why<00:04:24.780> a

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
tank and subway work we've seen why a

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.170 
tank and subway work we've seen why a
septic<00:04:25.650> tank<00:04:25.920> and<00:04:26.040> soakaway<00:04:26.460> become<00:04:26.910> blocked

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
septic tank and soakaway become blocked

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.450 
septic tank and soakaway become blocked
now<00:04:27.990> we're<00:04:28.230> going<00:04:28.380> to<00:04:28.470> look<00:04:28.620> at<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:28.980> symptoms

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
now we're going to look at the symptoms

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.960 
now we're going to look at the symptoms
that<00:04:30.180> result<00:04:30.690> from<00:04:30.840> a<00:04:31.350> block<00:04:31.890> septic<00:04:32.430> tank<00:04:32.730> and

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
that result from a block septic tank and

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.580 
that result from a block septic tank and
soak<00:04:33.330> away

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.040 

so<00:04:39.590> what<00:04:40.190> exactly<00:04:40.820> happens<00:04:41.300> in<00:04:41.480> when<00:04:41.690> the<00:04:41.810> Soka

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
so what exactly happens in when the Soka

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.980 
so what exactly happens in when the Soka
waste<00:04:42.350> blocked<00:04:43.000> well<00:04:44.000> in<00:04:44.210> a<00:04:44.330> nutshell<00:04:44.540> because

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
waste blocked well in a nutshell because

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.650 
waste blocked well in a nutshell because
the<00:04:45.440> liquid<00:04:45.920> effluent<00:04:46.220> can't<00:04:46.850> escape<00:04:47.300> into

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
the liquid effluent can't escape into

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.380 
the liquid effluent can't escape into
the<00:04:47.750> soil<00:04:48.020> anymore<00:04:48.590> via<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.490> soak<00:04:49.730> away<00:04:50.000> it

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
the soil anymore via the soak away it

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.190 
the soil anymore via the soak away it
back<00:04:50.840> fills<00:04:51.230> back<00:04:51.980> towards<00:04:52.490> a<00:04:52.580> septic<00:04:52.970> tank

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
back fills back towards a septic tank

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.530 
back fills back towards a septic tank
once<00:04:54.200> it<00:04:54.410> gets<00:04:54.590> into<00:04:54.830> the<00:04:55.070> tank<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.880> tank<00:04:55.910> then

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
once it gets into the tank the tank then

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.630 
once it gets into the tank the tank then
fills<00:04:56.960> with<00:04:57.350> all<00:04:57.530> the<00:04:57.650> backwash<00:04:58.190> which<00:04:58.430> is

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
fills with all the backwash which is

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.180 
fills with all the backwash which is
sludge<00:04:59.030> fat<00:04:59.570> in<00:04:59.780> grease<00:05:00.080> and<00:05:00.890> it<00:05:01.040> basically

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
sludge fat in grease and it basically

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.360 
sludge fat in grease and it basically
back<00:05:01.790> fills<00:05:02.120> up<00:05:02.420> the<00:05:02.900> septic<00:05:03.140> tank<00:05:03.620> and<00:05:03.830> then

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
back fills up the septic tank and then

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.390 
back fills up the septic tank and then
back<00:05:04.700> towards<00:05:05.450> the<00:05:05.600> property<00:05:06.050> that<00:05:06.950> is<00:05:07.160> why
