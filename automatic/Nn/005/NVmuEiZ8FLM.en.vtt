example<00:04:02.359> there's<00:04:03.359> a<00:04:03.480> smaller<00:04:03.900> hole<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.590> then

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
example there's a smaller hole and then

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.610 
example there's a smaller hole and then
a<00:04:05.489> slit<00:04:06.000> made<00:04:06.269> from<00:04:06.599> the<00:04:06.750> big<00:04:07.140> hole<00:04:07.319> to<00:04:07.500> the

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
a slit made from the big hole to the

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.339 
a slit made from the big hole to the
smaller<00:04:07.920> hole<00:04:08.299> so<00:04:09.299> let's<00:04:09.510> go<00:04:09.659> ahead<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:09.930> punch

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
smaller hole so let's go ahead and punch

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:20.640 
smaller hole so let's go ahead and punch
a<00:04:10.530> smaller<00:04:10.920> hole

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.990 

and<00:04:21.650> this<00:04:22.009> one<00:04:22.220> here<00:04:22.400> we're<00:04:22.550> just<00:04:22.580> going<00:04:22.910> to

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
and this one here we're just going to

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.860 
and this one here we're just going to
kind<00:04:23.180> of<00:04:24.610> eyeball<00:04:25.610> how<00:04:26.060> far<00:04:26.360> away<00:04:26.540> it<00:04:26.690> should

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
kind of eyeball how far away it should

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:38.520 
kind of eyeball how far away it should
be

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.140 

now<00:04:39.530> I'm<00:04:39.680> going<00:04:39.860> to<00:04:39.919> take<00:04:40.129> an<00:04:40.310> exacto<00:04:40.909> knife

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
now I'm going to take an exacto knife

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.010 
now I'm going to take an exacto knife
and<00:04:41.629> make<00:04:41.900> a<00:04:41.930> little<00:04:42.199> slit<00:04:43.389> between<00:04:44.389> the<00:04:44.840> two

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
and make a little slit between the two

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.809 
and make a little slit between the two
and<00:04:45.319> try<00:04:45.770> to<00:04:45.830> keep<00:04:46.069> it<00:04:46.189> as<00:04:46.310> straight<00:04:46.460> as

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:46.819 
and try to keep it as straight as

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:51.969 
and try to keep it as straight as
possible<00:04:48.009> that<00:04:49.009> will<00:04:49.219> allow<00:04:49.520> some<00:04:49.849> relief<00:04:50.979> so

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
possible that will allow some relief so

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:55.469 
possible that will allow some relief so
that<00:04:52.189> they<00:04:52.340> can<00:04:52.550> actually<00:04:52.729> go<00:04:53.150> over<00:04:53.180> the<00:04:53.590> stud

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
that they can actually go over the stud

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.839 
that they can actually go over the stud
so<00:04:56.479> there's<00:04:56.689> the<00:04:56.990> two<00:04:57.469> holes<00:04:57.770> and<00:04:58.099> the<00:04:58.400> stud<00:04:58.699> is

00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:58.849 
so there's the two holes and the stud is

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.149 
so there's the two holes and the stud is
is<00:04:59.180> bigger<00:04:59.539> than<00:04:59.780> this<00:04:59.930> big<00:05:00.199> ol<00:05:00.409> butt<00:05:00.949> watch

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:01.159 
is bigger than this big ol butt watch

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:05.020 
is bigger than this big ol butt watch
your<00:05:01.430> Nolan<00:05:02.590> turn<00:05:03.590> it<00:05:03.650> over<00:05:03.710> this<00:05:03.949> snaps<00:05:04.789> and

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
your Nolan turn it over this snaps and

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.360 
your Nolan turn it over this snaps and
that's<00:05:05.180> the<00:05:05.330> first<00:05:05.800> first<00:05:06.800> time<00:05:07.069> it's<00:05:07.219> gone

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
that's the first first time it's gone

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.589 
that's the first first time it's gone
over<00:05:07.520> that<00:05:07.639> and<00:05:08.289> basically<00:05:10.029> the<00:05:11.029> knife<00:05:11.240> case

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:11.599 
over that and basically the knife case

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:13.749 
over that and basically the knife case
portion<00:05:12.379> is<00:05:12.529> done<00:05:12.560> I've<00:05:12.949> got<00:05:12.979> one<00:05:13.340> other<00:05:13.460> thing
