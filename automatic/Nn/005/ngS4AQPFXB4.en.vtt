00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
monsters and same over here so the only

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.359 
monsters and same over here so the only
person<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.170> can<00:01:22.229> attack<00:01:22.560> with<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.189> guy

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
person I can attack with is this guy

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.960 
person I can attack with is this guy
here<00:01:23.759> but<00:01:23.970> he<00:01:24.150> only<00:01:24.299> has<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:25.400> basically<00:01:26.400> attack

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.780 
here but he only has to basically attack
points<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.049> i<00:01:28.110> attack<00:01:28.500> her<00:01:28.829> i'm<00:01:29.009> going<00:01:29.520> to

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
points so if i attack her i'm going to

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.319 
points so if i attack her i'm going to
lose<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.720> i<00:01:31.229> won't<00:01:31.860> be<00:01:31.979> able<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.250> win<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
lose and i won't be able to win so the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.120 
lose and i won't be able to win so the
next<00:01:33.360> thing<00:01:33.600> I'm<00:01:33.750> wondering<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.140> okay<00:01:34.380> clearly

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
next thing I'm wondering is okay clearly

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.469 
next thing I'm wondering is okay clearly
on<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.400> board<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.610> can't<00:01:35.820> do<00:01:35.970> anything<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.360> my

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
on the board I can't do anything so my

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.390 
on the board I can't do anything so my
next<00:01:36.630> question<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:37.229> all<00:01:37.500> right<00:01:37.829> well<00:01:38.070> can<00:01:38.340> I

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
next question is all right well can I

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.880 
next question is all right well can I
use<00:01:38.610> any<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.970> these<00:01:39.150> cards<00:01:39.810> well<00:01:40.530> none<00:01:40.860> of

these cards are highlighted green which

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.050 
these cards are highlighted green which
means<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.409> can't<00:01:43.649> use<00:01:43.890> any<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.250> them<00:01:44.460> but<00:01:44.759> I

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.920 
might and now by doing that I have
increased<00:01:53.850> amount<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.210> five<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.420> can<00:01:54.659> now<00:01:54.750> use

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
increased amount of five I can now use

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.929 
increased amount of five I can now use
this<00:01:55.140> card<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.219> card<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.670> pretty

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
this card so this card is pretty

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.639 
this card so this card is pretty
interesting<00:01:57.180> because<00:01:57.540> basically<00:01:57.840> what<00:01:58.530> you

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
interesting because basically what you

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.640 
interesting because basically what you
do<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.130> if<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.850> attack<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.950> you

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
do is if you attack and you

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.040 
do is if you attack and you
use<00:02:03.100> this<00:02:03.280> guy<00:02:03.460> you<00:02:03.520> have<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.820> sacrifice<00:02:04.050> two

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
use this guy you have to sacrifice two

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.240 
use this guy you have to sacrifice two
of<00:02:05.080> your<00:02:05.290> cards<00:02:05.440> but<00:02:05.680> you<00:02:05.800> could<00:02:05.920> increase<00:02:06.190> the

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
of your cards but you could increase the

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.550 
of your cards but you could increase the
attack<00:02:06.880> points<00:02:06.940> so<00:02:07.420> this<00:02:07.660> guy<00:02:07.840> is<00:02:07.900> going<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.350> be

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
attack points so this guy is going to be

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.220 
attack points so this guy is going to be
our<00:02:08.800> key<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:09.820> winning<00:02:10.000> is<00:02:10.240> what<00:02:11.020> we're<00:02:11.140> gonna

on the turn it's over cuz they have
enough<00:03:04.840> to<00:03:05.680> kill<00:03:05.920> and<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.580> puzzles<00:03:07.150> what

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
enough to kill and the puzzles what

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
enough to kill and the puzzles what
makes<00:03:07.570> them<00:03:07.690> different<00:03:07.750> from<00:03:08.050> the<00:03:08.260> regular

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
makes them different from the regular

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.380 
makes them different from the regular
matches<00:03:08.739> is<00:03:09.040> that<00:03:09.220> there's<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.489> trick<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.030> them

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
matches is that there's a trick to them

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.300 
matches is that there's a trick to them
like<00:03:10.570> yes<00:03:10.810> this<00:03:10.840> one<00:03:11.290> they're<00:03:11.440> all<00:03:11.650> solvable

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
like yes this one they're all solvable

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.270 
like yes this one they're all solvable
in<00:03:12.640> one<00:03:13.090> move<00:03:13.330> I<00:03:13.769> really<00:03:14.769> look<00:03:15.010> at<00:03:15.100> all<00:03:15.190> the

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
in one move I really look at all the

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.130 
in one move I really look at all the
cards<00:03:15.670> and<00:03:15.820> the<00:03:16.150> idea<00:03:16.570> is<00:03:16.630> that<00:03:16.690> a<00:03:16.900> lot<00:03:17.110> of

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
cards and the idea is that a lot of

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.740 
cards and the idea is that a lot of
these<00:03:17.320> cards<00:03:17.769> actually<00:03:17.980> you<00:03:18.640> they're<00:03:19.360> just<00:03:19.390> a

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
these cards actually you they're just a

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.860 
these cards actually you they're just a
distraction<00:03:20.370> anyway<00:03:21.370> so<00:03:22.000> where<00:03:22.570> we're<00:03:22.750> at<00:03:22.780> now

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
distraction anyway so where we're at now

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.229 
distraction anyway so where we're at now
like<00:03:23.170> I<00:03:23.290> was<00:03:23.320> saying<00:03:23.440> is<00:03:23.739> we've<00:03:24.070> got<00:03:24.239> four

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
like I was saying is we've got four

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.540 
like I was saying is we've got four
attack<00:03:25.540> points<00:03:25.989> and<00:03:26.140> we<00:03:26.560> need<00:03:26.739> one<00:03:26.890> more<00:03:27.070> now

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
attack points and we need one more now

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.430 
attack points and we need one more now
