things<00:03:16.030> they're<00:03:16.989> listening<00:03:17.230> now<00:03:17.650> but<00:03:18.129> it<00:03:18.340> just

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
things they're listening now but it just

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.459 
things they're listening now but it just
hope<00:03:18.760> they<00:03:19.000> do<00:03:19.239> it<00:03:19.419> fast<00:03:19.689> it's<00:03:20.109> just<00:03:20.290> take

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:20.469 
hope they do it fast it's just take

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:22.740 
hope they do it fast it's just take
action<00:03:20.980> all<00:03:21.609> the<00:03:21.879> governments<00:03:22.450> in<00:03:22.569> the<00:03:22.599> world

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.990 
action all the governments in the world
really<00:03:23.230> take<00:03:23.439> it<00:03:23.620> now<00:03:23.799> seriously<00:03:24.370> it's<00:03:24.760> just

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
really take it now seriously it's just

really take it now seriously it's just
I'm<00:03:25.209> worried<00:03:25.629> the<00:03:25.720> action<00:03:26.049> might<00:03:26.260> be<00:03:26.379> too<00:03:26.590> slow

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
I'm worried the action might be too slow

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.849 
I'm worried the action might be too slow
that's<00:03:27.069> all<00:03:27.329> because<00:03:28.329> the<00:03:28.479> eyes<00:03:28.690> are

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
that's all because the eyes are

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.009 
that's all because the eyes are
reflecting<00:03:29.859> the<00:03:29.979> Sun<00:03:30.250> you<00:03:30.849> see<00:03:30.879> so<00:03:31.599> send<00:03:31.900> it

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
reflecting the Sun you see so send it

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.039 
reflecting the Sun you see so send it
back<00:03:32.169> into<00:03:32.409> the<00:03:32.590> space<00:03:33.299> but<00:03:34.299> the<00:03:34.840> eyes<00:03:35.019> are

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
back into the space but the eyes are

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.819 
back into the space but the eyes are
melting<00:03:35.680> so<00:03:35.889> fast<00:03:35.919> now<00:03:37.199> that<00:03:38.199> there<00:03:38.500> is<00:03:38.590> not

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
melting so fast now that there is not

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.059 
melting so fast now that there is not
enough<00:03:39.359> reflection<00:03:40.359> yeah<00:03:40.689> and<00:03:40.989> because<00:03:41.799> the

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
enough reflection yeah and because the

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.539 
enough reflection yeah and because the
Seas<00:03:42.340> already<00:03:42.819> warm<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:44.010> because<00:03:45.010> I<00:03:45.040> see<00:03:45.310> warm

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
Seas already warm and because I see warm

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.670 
Seas already warm and because I see warm
it<00:03:45.669> melt<00:03:45.909> the<00:03:46.030> ice<00:03:46.180> and<00:03:46.209> because<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.169> I<00:03:47.199> smell

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
it melt the ice and because the I smell

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.119 
it melt the ice and because the I smell
the<00:03:47.889> sea<00:03:48.069> warmer<00:03:48.489> you<00:03:48.909> see<00:03:49.120> I<00:03:49.150> mean<00:03:49.419> the<00:03:49.599> cycle

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
the sea warmer you see I mean the cycle

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.189 
the sea warmer you see I mean the cycle
the<00:03:51.129> way<00:03:51.310> it<00:03:51.489> is<00:03:51.609> going<00:03:51.699> if<00:03:52.209> they<00:03:52.569> don't<00:03:52.750> fix<00:03:53.019> it

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:53.199 
the way it is going if they don't fix it

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:57.140 
the way it is going if they don't fix it
four<00:03:53.979> or<00:03:54.009> five<00:03:54.310> years<00:03:54.340> time<00:03:55.049> finito

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
four or five years time finito

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.810 
four or five years time finito
no<00:03:58.700> it's<00:03:59.700> really<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:00.390> urgent
