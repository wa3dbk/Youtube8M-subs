I like them all actually but they all of

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.810 
I like them all actually but they all of
the<00:00:21.930> difference<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.470> historically<00:00:23.310> display

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
the difference of historically display

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.570 
the difference of historically display

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
years the smallest baby here it's

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.900 
years the smallest baby here it's
actually<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.980> still<00:00:35.190> one<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.460> my<00:00:35.520> favorite

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
actually a still one of my favorite

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.000 
actually a still one of my favorite
phones<00:00:36.180> because<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.930> feels<00:00:37.079> so<00:00:37.200> good<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.770> it's

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
phones because it feels so good and it's

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.840 
phones because it feels so good and it's
also<00:00:38.420> pretty<00:00:39.420> thin<00:00:39.780> here<00:00:39.960> actually<00:00:40.670> so<00:00:41.670> you're

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
also pretty thin here actually so you're

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.119 
also pretty thin here actually so you're
also<00:00:41.969> different<00:00:42.420> display<00:00:42.809> resolutions<00:00:43.469> you

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
also different display resolutions you

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.450 
also different display resolutions you
have<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.480> 720p<00:00:45.480> displays<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.379> s5<00:00:46.980> mini<00:00:47.039> and

have a 720p displays on the s5 mini and
the<00:00:47.520> Alpha<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.829> a5<00:00:49.829> but<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.520> galaxy<00:00:50.969> a3

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
the Alpha and the a5 but the galaxy a3

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.090 
the Alpha and the a5 but the galaxy a3
and<00:00:51.629> s4<00:00:51.989> mini<00:00:52.140> also<00:00:52.500> comes<00:00:52.649> with<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.860> pretty

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
and s4 mini also comes with a pretty

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.029 
and s4 mini also comes with a pretty
good<00:00:53.340> resolution<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.910> 540<00:00:54.120> thousand<00:00:54.719> 60<00:00:55.079> in

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
good resolution of 540 thousand 60 in

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.010 
good resolution of 540 thousand 60 in
terms<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.460> chipset<00:00:56.910> inside<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.329> internal<00:00:57.840> is

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
terms of chipset inside the internal is

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.349 
terms of chipset inside the internal is
actually<00:00:58.770> worse<00:00:58.980> here<00:00:59.309> on<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.609> a3<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.329> a5

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
actually worse here on the a3 and the a5

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.619 
actually worse here on the a3 and the a5
is<00:01:00.809> only<00:01:01.140> Snapdragon<00:01:01.680> 410<00:01:02.129> now<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.180> do<00:01:03.449> get

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
is only Snapdragon 410 now you do get

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.530 
is only Snapdragon 410 now you do get
the<00:01:03.750> Snapdragon<00:01:04.140> 400<00:01:04.619> inside<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.970> s5

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
the Snapdragon 400 inside of the the s5

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.520 
the Snapdragon 400 inside of the the s5
mini<00:01:07.520> or<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.670> mean<00:01:08.909> s4<00:01:09.270> mini<00:01:09.390> here<00:01:09.689> but<00:01:10.140> for<00:01:10.409> some

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
mini or I mean s4 mini here but for some

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.870 
mini or I mean s4 mini here but for some
reason<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.890> runs<00:01:11.070> really<00:01:11.369> really<00:01:11.700> well

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
reason it runs really really well

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.510 
reason it runs really really well
probably<00:01:12.210> because<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.840> dual<00:01:13.320> core<00:01:13.799> open

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
probably because of this dual core open

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.910 
probably because of this dual core open

3<00:01:17.130> or<00:01:17.250> 5<00:01:17.430> now<00:01:17.880> these<00:01:18.090> two<00:01:18.720> have<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:19.110> quad<00:01:19.530> core

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
3 or 5 now these two have a quad core

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.120 
3 or 5 now these two have a quad core
over<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.670> Earth's<00:01:20.909> core<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.439> 33-year

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
over to the Earth's core this a 33-year

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.120 
over to the Earth's core this a 33-year
me<00:01:23.790> me<00:01:24.210> personal<00:01:24.720> opinion<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.290> games<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.860> seems

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
me me personal opinion in games it seems

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.420 
me me personal opinion in games it seems
like<00:01:26.540> this<00:01:27.540> duper<00:01:28.140> setup<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.650> better<00:01:29.189> or<00:01:29.400> less

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
like this duper setup is better or less

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.940 
like this duper setup is better or less
for<00:01:29.939> mini<00:01:30.270> which<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.900> pretty<00:01:31.049> interesting<00:01:31.320> but

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
for mini which is pretty interesting but

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.649 
for mini which is pretty interesting but
he's<00:01:32.130> come<00:01:32.369> with<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> better<00:01:32.790> GPU<00:01:33.240> but<00:01:33.360> overall

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
he's come with a better GPU but overall

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.390 
he's come with a better GPU but overall
the<00:01:33.930> CPUs<00:01:34.350> needs<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.680> be<00:01:34.799> more<00:01:34.979> important

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
the CPUs needs to be more important

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.520 
the CPUs needs to be more important
there<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.549> think<00:01:37.340> these<00:01:38.340> two<00:01:38.670> here<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.720> s5<00:01:40.500> mini

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
there I think these two here the s5 mini

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.179 
there I think these two here the s5 mini
and<00:01:41.250> as<00:01:42.180> 5<00:01:42.570> mini<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.840> Alpha<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.619> they

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
and as 5 mini and the the Alpha and they

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.469 
and as 5 mini and the the Alpha and they
basically<00:01:47.369> comes<00:01:47.729> with<00:01:47.939> Samsung's<00:01:48.329> own

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
basically comes with Samsung's own

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.429 
basically comes with Samsung's own

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
the s5 mini performs extremely well but

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.959 
the s5 mini performs extremely well but
you<00:01:55.560> have<00:01:55.649> an<00:01:55.740> even<00:01:55.979> more<00:01:56.009> powerful<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.759> some

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
you have an even more powerful in some

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
look at one of these over here you don't

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.890 
look at one of these over here you don't
get<00:02:42.100> two<00:02:42.370> openings<00:02:43.030> down<00:02:43.270> here<00:02:43.450> I<00:02:43.480> think<00:02:43.720> one

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
get two openings down here I think one

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.699 
get two openings down here I think one

if something happens with the phone you

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.360 
if something happens with the phone you
can't<00:03:07.450> replace<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.930> battery<00:03:08.320> it's<00:03:08.590> it<00:03:09.130> could

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
can't replace the battery it's it could

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.730 
can't replace the battery it's it could
be<00:03:09.490> very<00:03:09.730> very<00:03:09.910> bad

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
be very very bad

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.490 
be very very bad
also<00:03:11.740> on<00:03:12.040> these<00:03:12.459> devices<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:14.200> do<00:03:14.320> get<00:03:14.470> a

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
also on these devices you do get a

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.130 
also on these devices you do get a
little<00:03:14.709> bit<00:03:14.920> different<00:03:15.400> like<00:03:15.850> metal<00:03:16.660> body<00:03:16.930> or

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
little bit different like metal body or

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.720 
little bit different like metal body or
whatever<00:03:17.560> not<00:03:17.709> material<00:03:18.070> they're<00:03:18.220> using<00:03:18.250> them

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
whatever not material they're using them

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.120 
whatever not material they're using them
compare<00:03:19.510> it<00:03:19.600> to<00:03:19.780> be<00:03:19.930> like<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.350> better<00:03:20.620> more

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
compare it to be like the better more

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.580 
compare it to be like the better more
premium<00:03:21.550> material<00:03:21.970> I<00:03:22.060> think<00:03:22.330> it<00:03:22.600> feels<00:03:23.170> here

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
premium material I think it feels here

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.610 
premium material I think it feels here
on<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.820> galaxy<00:03:25.269> alpha<00:03:25.420> feels<00:03:26.320> like<00:03:26.500> they

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
on the galaxy alpha feels like they

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.979 
on the galaxy alpha feels like they
wanted<00:03:26.950> to<00:03:27.070> make<00:03:27.489> it<00:03:27.670> you<00:03:28.239> know<00:03:28.360> it's<00:03:28.630> it<00:03:28.780> feels

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
wanted to make it you know it's it feels

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.020 
wanted to make it you know it's it feels
extremely<00:03:29.200> good<00:03:29.590> on<00:03:29.800> these<00:03:30.040> two<00:03:30.280> but<00:03:30.489> the

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
extremely good on these two but the

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.600 
extremely good on these two but the
offer<00:03:31.209> that<00:03:31.660> has<00:03:32.110> a<00:03:32.140> more<00:03:32.410> premium<00:03:32.709> feeling

offer that has a more premium feeling
around<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:34.450> side<00:03:34.660> to<00:03:34.840> think<00:03:35.080> and<00:03:35.290> also<00:03:35.739> some

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
around the side to think and also some

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.400 
around the side to think and also some
added<00:03:36.400> design<00:03:36.790> cues<00:03:37.330> around<00:03:37.750> here<00:03:37.989> which<00:03:38.170> is

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
added design cues around here which is

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.920 
added design cues around here which is
extremely<00:03:38.950> cool<00:03:39.269> but<00:03:40.269> I<00:03:40.300> like<00:03:40.510> them<00:03:40.660> all

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
extremely cool but I like them all

I<00:03:40.959> like<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.350> more<00:03:41.500> like<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:42.190> middle<00:03:42.580> and<00:03:42.970> this

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
I like the more like the middle and this

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.120 
I like the more like the middle and this
one<00:03:43.450> also<00:03:43.660> has<00:03:43.810> a<00:03:43.989> kind<00:03:44.320> of<00:03:44.350> plastic<00:03:44.650> bag
