those lenses the radar XL range pitch
path<00:00:42.300> they<00:00:42.690> all<00:00:42.870> use<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.260> same<00:00:43.500> exact<00:00:43.950> system

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
path they all use the same exact system

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.610 
path they all use the same exact system
and<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:45.420> fact<00:00:45.450> all<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:45.989> lenses<00:00:46.500> are

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
and in fact all the lenses are

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.400 
and in fact all the lenses are
interchangeable<00:00:46.670> with<00:00:47.670> each<00:00:48.210> other<00:00:48.450> except

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
interchangeable with each other except

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.950 
interchangeable with each other except
for<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.800> excel<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.579> if<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.789> have<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> range<00:00:51.539> and

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
for the excel so if you have a range and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.380 
for the excel so if you have a range and
you<00:00:52.469> have<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> pitch<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.879> lenses<00:00:54.270> will

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
you have a pitch the lenses will

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.760 
you have a pitch the lenses will
interchange<00:00:54.840> with<00:00:54.989> each<00:00:55.110> other<00:00:55.320> but<00:00:55.620> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
interchange with each other but the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.650 
interchange with each other but the
excel<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.610> its<00:00:56.730> own<00:00:56.910> little<00:00:57.090> world<00:00:57.449> and

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
excel is in its own little world and

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.479 
excel is in its own little world and
that<00:00:57.870> one<00:00:58.050> does<00:00:58.199> not<00:00:58.230> play<00:00:58.680> well<00:00:58.920> with<00:00:58.949> all<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
that one does not play well with all the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.430 
that one does not play well with all the
other<00:00:59.609> ones<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.180> here<00:01:00.840> we<00:01:00.960> go<00:01:01.170> on
