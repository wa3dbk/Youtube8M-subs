quick to show you guys how to run your
batteries<00:00:07.429> parallel<00:00:08.429> on<00:00:09.440> either<00:00:10.440> RV<00:00:11.130> or

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
batteries parallel on either RV or

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.829 
batteries parallel on either RV or
pop-up<00:00:11.969> camper<00:00:12.590> that's<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.980> front<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.400> my

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
pop-up camper that's the front of my

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.730 
pop-up camper that's the front of my
2001<00:00:15.839> Coleman<00:00:16.529> Tacoma<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:18.199> got<00:00:19.199> my<00:00:19.320> batteries

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
2001 Coleman Tacoma and got my batteries

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.240 
2001 Coleman Tacoma and got my batteries
mounted<00:00:20.189> up<00:00:20.460> here<00:00:20.939> on<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.180> front<00:00:22.189> these<00:00:23.189> are

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
mounted up here on the front these are

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.300 
mounted up here on the front these are
the<00:00:23.430> covers<00:00:25.699> take<00:00:26.699> off<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.890> underneath<00:00:28.890> here

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
the covers take off and underneath here

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:38.510 
the covers take off and underneath here
I<00:00:29.340> have<00:00:29.670> two<00:00:32.180> group<00:00:33.380> 27s<00:00:35.660> 12-volt<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.489> so<00:00:38.489> I

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
I have two group 27s 12-volt and so I

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.299 
I have two group 27s 12-volt and so I
ran<00:00:38.820> them<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.770> parallel<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:40.950> was<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
ran them in parallel this was the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.900 
ran them in parallel this was the
original<00:00:41.399> one<00:00:41.879> here<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:43.500> then<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.489> ended<00:00:44.789> up

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
original one here and then I ended up

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.979 
original one here and then I ended up
getting<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.360> newer<00:00:45.809> one<00:00:46.370> and<00:00:47.840> running<00:00:48.840> on

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
getting a newer one and running on

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.490 
getting a newer one and running on
parallel<00:00:49.980> pretty<00:00:50.370> easy<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.899> just<00:00:51.899> screwed<00:00:52.739> the

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
parallel pretty easy I just screwed the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.310 
parallel pretty easy I just screwed the
actual<00:00:55.500> like<00:00:55.710> battery<00:00:56.129> boxes<00:00:56.899> to<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.050> wood

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
actual like battery boxes to the wood

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.000 
actual like battery boxes to the wood
and<00:01:00.140> you<00:01:01.140> know<00:01:01.230> just<00:01:01.410> put<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.620> batteries<00:01:01.980> in

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
and you know just put the batteries in

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.050 
and you know just put the batteries in
there<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.660> then<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:04.140> ended<00:01:04.379> up<00:01:04.470> finding<00:01:05.060> for

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
there and then I ended up finding for

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.730 
there and then I ended up finding for
really<00:01:06.270> cheap<00:01:06.680> these<00:01:08.540> pretty<00:01:09.540> heavy<00:01:09.750> gauged<00:01:10.260> I

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
really cheap these pretty heavy gauged I

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.090 
really cheap these pretty heavy gauged I
don't<00:01:11.070> know<00:01:11.130> maybe<00:01:11.340> four<00:01:11.810> even<00:01:12.810> bigger<00:01:13.619> but

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
don't know maybe four even bigger but

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.539 
don't know maybe four even bigger but
pretty<00:01:14.549> big<00:01:14.790> gauged<00:01:15.710> wires<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:17.130> already<00:01:17.400> had

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
pretty big gauged wires that already had

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.420 
pretty big gauged wires that already had
these<00:01:17.729> connectors<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.509> end<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.340> so<00:01:20.340> to

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
these connectors on the end and so to

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.550 
these connectors on the end and so to
run<00:01:20.700> them<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:20.939> parallel<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.450> do<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.140> connect

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
run them in parallel I do is you connect

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.039 
run them in parallel I do is you connect
the<00:01:23.100> positive<00:01:23.640> end<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:25.070> one<00:01:26.070> battery<00:01:26.689> to<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
the positive end of one battery to the

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.300 
the positive end of one battery to the
positive<00:01:28.080> end<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.460> other<00:01:29.790> battery<00:01:30.630> and

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
positive end of the other battery and

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.530 
positive end of the other battery and
then<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.340> have<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> same<00:01:32.880> thing<00:01:33.210> on<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
then I have the same thing on the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.249 
then I have the same thing on the
negative<00:01:33.990> side<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.820> so<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:36.570> black<00:01:36.869> wire

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
negative side and so this black wire

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.600 
negative side and so this black wire
here<00:01:37.939> connects<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.509> battery<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:39.960> negative

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
here connects this battery is negative

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.060 
here connects this battery is negative
to<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.090> other<00:01:42.630> batteries<00:01:43.079> negative<00:01:43.619> terminal

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
to the other batteries negative terminal

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.850 
to the other batteries negative terminal
and<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.479> way<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:46.229> know<00:01:46.350> it's<00:01:46.470> running<00:01:46.619> in

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
and so that way you know it's running in

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.940 
and so that way you know it's running in
series<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.490> you're<00:01:47.640> staying<00:01:47.939> at<00:01:48.119> 12<00:01:48.390> volts

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
series so you're staying at 12 volts

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.100 
series so you're staying at 12 volts
which<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.759> know<00:01:50.880> what<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.750> camper

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
which is you know what the the camper

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.740 
which is you know what the the camper
needs<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.700> then<00:01:54.320> these<00:01:55.320> two<00:01:55.619> small<00:01:56.009> wires

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
needs and then these two small wires

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.109 
needs and then these two small wires
that<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:58.049> coming<00:01:58.380> up<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:59.310> white<00:01:59.640> one<00:01:59.880> is

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
that I have coming up this white one is

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.139 
that I have coming up this white one is
just<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.899> camper<00:02:01.290> negative<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.820> black

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
just the camper negative and this black

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.800 
just the camper negative and this black
one<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.200> camper<00:02:04.710> positive<00:02:05.420> with<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.540> fuse

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
one is the camper positive with the fuse

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.670 
one is the camper positive with the fuse
there

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
there

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.730 
there
and<00:02:07.980> so<00:02:08.880> after<00:02:09.630> doing<00:02:09.960> some<00:02:10.080> research<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.619> found

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
and so after doing some research I found

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.300 
and so after doing some research I found
the<00:02:10.920> best<00:02:11.130> way<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:12.800> you<00:02:13.800> know<00:02:13.890> have<00:02:14.130> the

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
the best way is to you know have the

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
the best way is to you know have the
positive<00:02:14.580> on<00:02:15.330> one<00:02:15.440> battery<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:17.060> then<00:02:18.060> have

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
positive on one battery and then have

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.260 
positive on one battery and then have
the<00:02:18.660> negative<00:02:19.200> on<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.470> other<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:21.090> that

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
the negative on the other and so that

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.160 
the negative on the other and so that
way<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.630> treats<00:02:21.990> both<00:02:22.380> these<00:02:22.650> batteries<00:02:23.220> as

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
way it treats both these batteries as

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.790 
way it treats both these batteries as
one<00:02:25.170> big<00:02:25.440> one<00:02:26.060> I<00:02:27.060> suppose<00:02:28.020> it<00:02:28.350> would<00:02:28.500> still

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
one big one I suppose it would still

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.460 
one big one I suppose it would still
work<00:02:28.830> if<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.400> connected<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:31.110> know<00:02:31.140> the

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
work if you connected you know the

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.010 
work if you connected you know the
positive<00:02:32.220> from<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.790> camper<00:02:33.210> to<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.480> positive

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
positive from the camper to a positive

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.140 
positive from the camper to a positive
on<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.320> battery<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.920> then<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.700> negative

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
on the battery and then the negative

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.820 
on the battery and then the negative
from<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.450> camper<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.230> negative<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.770> the

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
from the camper to the negative of the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.430 
from the camper to the negative of the
same<00:02:38.190> battery<00:02:38.630> but<00:02:39.630> then<00:02:39.870> you're<00:02:40.110> kind<00:02:40.290> of

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
same battery but then you're kind of
