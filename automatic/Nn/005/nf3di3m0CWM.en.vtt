we're gone ready to put it away so i'm

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.290 
we're gone ready to put it away so i'm
going<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.430> give<00:03:36.550> this<00:03:36.640> a<00:03:36.700> little<00:03:36.850> more<00:03:36.970> heat

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
going to give this a little more heat

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.690 
going to give this a little more heat
and<00:03:37.510> while<00:03:38.410> we're<00:03:38.650> waiting<00:03:38.980> for<00:03:39.040> that<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:39.550> get

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
and while we're waiting for that to get

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.210 
and while we're waiting for that to get
hot<00:03:39.940> and<00:03:40.420> i'll<00:03:40.600> show<00:03:40.630> you<00:03:40.810> this<00:03:41.769> is<00:03:41.920> one<00:03:42.070> of<00:03:42.160> the

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
hot and i'll show you this is one of the

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.650 
hot and i'll show you this is one of the
number<00:03:42.430> Five's<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.350> back<00:03:44.560> there

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:54.480 

I<00:03:49.450> figure<00:03:50.450> do<00:03:50.630> a<00:03:50.660> live<00:03:51.220> demonstration<00:03:52.220> of<00:03:53.060> the

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
I figure do a live demonstration of the

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:33.970 
I figure do a live demonstration of the
freshly<00:03:55.490> seasoned<00:03:55.970> paint<00:03:56.180> Zod

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.980 

and<00:04:34.980> see<00:04:35.190> my<00:04:35.370> range<00:04:35.670> is<00:04:35.850> not<00:04:36.120> exactly<00:04:36.660> level

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
and see my range is not exactly level

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:43.640 
and see my range is not exactly level
but<00:04:37.590> I<00:04:40.400> would<00:04:41.400> say<00:04:41.550> that's<00:04:41.760> probably<00:04:42.500> about<00:04:43.500> as

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
but I would say that's probably about as

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.690 
but I would say that's probably about as
nonstick<00:04:44.280> as<00:04:44.460> it's<00:04:44.580> going<00:04:44.700> to<00:04:44.760> get<00:04:46.700> right

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
nonstick as it's going to get right

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.890 
nonstick as it's going to get right
there<00:04:49.970> can't<00:04:50.970> ask<00:04:51.210> for<00:04:51.330> much<00:04:51.510> better<00:04:51.720> than

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
there can't ask for much better than

00:04:51.900 --> 00:05:20.690 
there can't ask for much better than
that

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.730 

okay<00:05:21.390> now<00:05:21.510> I<00:05:21.540> did<00:05:21.840> speed<00:05:22.110> that<00:05:22.290> up<00:05:22.350> just<00:05:22.500> a

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
okay now I did speed that up just a

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.560 
okay now I did speed that up just a
little<00:05:22.860> bit<00:05:23.010> to<00:05:23.730> kind<00:05:23.940> of<00:05:23.970> expedite<00:05:24.450> this

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
little bit to kind of expedite this

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:25.730 
little bit to kind of expedite this
process<00:05:24.630> but<00:05:25.140> as<00:05:25.230> you<00:05:25.290> can<00:05:25.380> see<00:05:25.530> it's<00:05:25.680> just

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
process but as you can see it's just

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.220 
process but as you can see it's just
starting<00:05:26.400> to<00:05:26.430> smoke<00:05:26.670> a<00:05:26.730> little<00:05:27.000> bit<00:05:27.180> there<00:05:27.900> and

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
starting to smoke a little bit there and

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.680 
starting to smoke a little bit there and
that<00:05:28.440> whole<00:05:29.070> number<00:05:29.400> three<00:05:29.580> pan<00:05:29.790> and<00:05:30.570> it's

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
that whole number three pan and it's

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.860 
that whole number three pan and it's
exactly<00:05:31.080> what<00:05:31.230> I<00:05:31.260> wanted<00:05:31.320> to<00:05:31.620> do<00:05:32.840> and<00:05:33.840> just

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
exactly what I wanted to do and just

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:40.430 
exactly what I wanted to do and just
wipe<00:05:34.140> out<00:05:34.350> the<00:05:34.500> excess<00:05:34.800> oil<00:05:39.020> use<00:05:40.020> that<00:05:40.200> through

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
wipe out the excess oil use that through

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.280 
wipe out the excess oil use that through
the<00:05:40.530> rest<00:05:40.680> of<00:05:40.800> the<00:05:40.890> pan<00:05:44.750> answer<00:05:45.750> that's<00:05:46.050> done

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
the rest of the pan answer that's done

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.740 
the rest of the pan answer that's done
I'll<00:05:46.500> take<00:05:46.710> cool<00:05:46.890> down<00:05:47.100> and<00:05:47.630> again<00:05:48.630> that's

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
I'll take cool down and again that's

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.860 
I'll take cool down and again that's
just<00:05:48.990> something<00:05:49.140> I<00:05:49.320> do<00:05:49.380> any<00:05:50.070> time<00:05:50.630> well<00:05:51.630> most

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
just something I do any time well most

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.230 
just something I do any time well most
of<00:05:52.050> the<00:05:52.140> time<00:05:52.170> I<00:05:52.350> try<00:05:52.620> cooking<00:05:52.800> them<00:05:53.120> any<00:05:54.120> time

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
of the time I try cooking them any time

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.290 
of the time I try cooking them any time
I<00:05:54.810> hit<00:05:55.140> him<00:05:55.200> with<00:05:55.320> water<00:05:55.560> or<00:05:55.800> F<00:05:56.040> to<00:05:56.280> brush<00:05:57.120> up<00:05:57.240> a

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
I hit him with water or F to brush up a

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.700 
I hit him with water or F to brush up a
little<00:05:57.510> bit<00:05:57.660> I<00:05:57.870> always<00:05:58.290> do<00:05:58.860> that<00:05:59.010> afterwards

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
little bit I always do that afterwards

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.160 
little bit I always do that afterwards

did here goes the yolk Don gone I don't
do<00:06:16.530> eggs<00:06:16.710> very<00:06:16.950> often<00:06:17.340> not<00:06:17.850> like<00:06:18.030> this<00:06:18.650> but

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
do eggs very often not like this but

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.110 
do eggs very often not like this but
there's<00:06:19.860> okay<00:06:20.130> as<00:06:20.850> we'll<00:06:21.150> see<00:06:21.330> how<00:06:21.450> well<00:06:21.630> that

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
there's okay as we'll see how well that

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:45.820 
there's okay as we'll see how well that
holds<00:06:24.120> off<00:06:24.240> the<00:06:24.270> yoke

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.109 

once<00:06:46.830> again<00:06:46.979> I<00:06:47.099> sped<00:06:47.459> that<00:06:47.639> up<00:06:47.759> to<00:06:47.909> save<00:06:48.089> a

00:06:48.109 --> 00:06:48.119 
once again I sped that up to save a

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:52.820 
once again I sped that up to save a
little<00:06:48.419> bit<00:06:48.569> of<00:06:48.659> time<00:06:48.869> here<00:06:51.319> still<00:06:52.319> no<00:06:52.439> problem

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:52.830 
little bit of time here still no problem

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.100 
little bit of time here still no problem
and<00:06:53.669> since<00:06:54.029> we<00:06:54.119> broke<00:06:54.300> the<00:06:54.479> yolk<00:06:54.689> we'll<00:06:54.989> go

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110 
and since we broke the yolk we'll go

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.839 
and since we broke the yolk we'll go
ahead<00:06:55.199> and<00:06:55.289> make<00:06:55.469> that<00:06:55.499> a<00:06:55.709> fried<00:06:56.369> egg<00:06:56.399> sandwich

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:56.849 
ahead and make that a fried egg sandwich

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:30.710 
ahead and make that a fried egg sandwich
I<00:06:56.939> guess<00:06:59.569> and<00:07:00.569> the<00:07:00.659> court<00:07:00.899> with<00:07:01.080> it

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.270 

well<00:07:31.720> once<00:07:31.900> again<00:07:32.020> it's<00:07:32.230> a<00:07:32.290> miracle<00:07:32.500> time

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.280 

slides<00:07:36.280> around<00:07:36.460> without<00:07:36.910> any<00:07:37.300> issues<00:07:37.900> so

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:38.290 
slides around without any issues so

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.380 
slides around without any issues so
whether<00:07:38.530> it<00:07:38.890> was<00:07:39.040> and<00:07:39.520> so<00:07:39.700> it<00:07:39.790> was<00:07:39.940> a<00:07:39.970> pretty
