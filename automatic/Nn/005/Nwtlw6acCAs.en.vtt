00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.280 

so<00:00:01.860> this<00:00:02.129> is<00:00:02.280> the<00:00:02.460> sound<00:00:02.700> test<00:00:03.149> for<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.929> new

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
so this is the sound test for the new

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.549 
so this is the sound test for the new
cable<00:00:04.859> I<00:00:05.069> bought<00:00:05.339> for<00:00:06.109> zoom<00:00:07.109> h6<00:00:08.660> coming<00:00:09.660> out<00:00:10.170> of

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
cable I bought for zoom h6 coming out of

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.259 
cable I bought for zoom h6 coming out of
the<00:00:10.769> line<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:12.650> going<00:00:13.650> into<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.370> microphone

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
the line and going into the microphone

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.670 
the line and going into the microphone
of<00:00:15.540> Panasonic<00:00:16.350> gh4<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:18.529> simultaneously<00:00:19.529> I'm

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
of Panasonic gh4 and simultaneously I'm

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.880 
of Panasonic gh4 and simultaneously I'm
recording<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.640> zoom<00:00:20.970> h6<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.890> comparing

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
recording it to zoom h6 and comparing

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.439 
recording it to zoom h6 and comparing
the<00:00:23.039> sound<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.699> zoom<00:00:24.060> h6<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.689> Panasonic<00:00:25.619> gh4

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
the sound of zoom h6 and Panasonic gh4

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.269 
the sound of zoom h6 and Panasonic gh4
by<00:00:27.449> means<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.140> test<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.949> far<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.689> and<00:00:30.689> B<00:00:30.900> it

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
by means of the test so far a and B it

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.950 
by means of the test so far a and B it
just<00:00:32.279> took<00:00:32.820> off<00:00:33.000> my<00:00:33.030> headphone<00:00:33.950> from<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
just took off my headphone from the

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.900 
just took off my headphone from the
headphone<00:00:36.960> output<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.980> camera<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.790> put

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
headphone output of the camera and put

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.900 
headphone output of the camera and put
it<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.239> headphone<00:00:39.629> output<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:41.670> zoom

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
it to the headphone output of the zoom

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.180 
it to the headphone output of the zoom
h6<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.750> looks<00:00:43.050> like<00:00:43.410> zoom<00:00:44.399> h6<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.450> slightly

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
h6 it looks like zoom h6 is a slightly

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.479 
h6 it looks like zoom h6 is a slightly
cleaner<00:00:47.989> less<00:00:48.989> noise<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.710> background<00:00:49.920> and

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
cleaner less noise in the background and

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.119 
cleaner less noise in the background and
sound<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.649> bit<00:00:52.920> more<00:00:53.250> open<00:00:54.320> so<00:00:55.320> but<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
sound is just a bit more open so but the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.750 
sound is just a bit more open so but the
difference<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.820> probably<00:00:57.539> around<00:00:57.770> 5%<00:00:58.770> or<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.489> I

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
difference is probably around 5% or so I

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.070 
difference is probably around 5% or so I
think<00:01:00.570> it's<00:01:01.170> worth<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.719> not<00:01:03.719> have<00:01:03.750> that

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
think it's worth it to not have that

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.250 
think it's worth it to not have that
additional<00:01:04.880> 5%<00:01:05.880> but<00:01:06.090> then<00:01:06.270> saving<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.960> lot<00:01:07.110> of

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
additional 5% but then saving a lot of

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.850 
additional 5% but then saving a lot of
time<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.799> syncing<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.520> sound<00:01:09.590> once<00:01:10.590> I

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
time in syncing the sound once I

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.179 
time in syncing the sound once I
finished<00:01:11.460> recording<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.240> take<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.189> sound

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
finished recording and take the sound

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.830 
finished recording and take the sound
bites<00:01:14.610> into<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.990> editing<00:01:16.350> suite<00:01:17.100> and

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
bites into the editing suite and

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.149 
bites into the editing suite and
comparing<00:01:18.840> them<00:01:18.990> over<00:01:19.259> there<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.530> will<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:19.979> a

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
comparing them over there I will have a

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.609 
comparing them over there I will have a
better<00:01:20.369> idea<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:23.600> this<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.930> sound<00:01:25.259> test

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
better idea so this is the sound test

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.149 
better idea so this is the sound test
for<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.400> new<00:01:26.790> cable<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.570> bought<00:01:27.810> for<00:01:28.610> zoom<00:01:29.610> h6

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
for the new cable I bought for zoom h6

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.499 
for the new cable I bought for zoom h6
coming<00:01:32.159> out<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.240> line<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:35.150> going<00:01:36.150> into

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
coming out of the line and going into

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.990 
coming out of the line and going into
the<00:01:36.840> microphone<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:38.040> Panasonic<00:01:38.820> gh4<00:01:39.240> and

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
the microphone of Panasonic gh4 and

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.429 
the microphone of Panasonic gh4 and
simultaneously<00:01:42.000> I'm<00:01:42.180> recording<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.140> zoom

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
simultaneously I'm recording it to zoom

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.700 
simultaneously I'm recording it to zoom
h6<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.360> comparing<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.509> sound<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:46.170> zoom<00:01:46.530> h6

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
h6 and comparing the sound of zoom h6

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.080 
h6 and comparing the sound of zoom h6
and<00:01:47.189> Panasonic<00:01:48.090> gh4<00:01:48.920> by<00:01:49.920> means<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.640> tests

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
and Panasonic gh4 by means of the tests

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.520 
and Panasonic gh4 by means of the tests
so<00:01:51.420> far<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:52.189> and<00:01:53.189> B<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.810> just<00:01:54.810> took<00:01:55.290> off<00:01:55.500> my

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
so far a and B it just took off my

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.109 
so far a and B it just took off my
headphone<00:01:56.420> from<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:58.430> headphone<00:01:59.430> output<00:01:59.909> of

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
headphone from the headphone output of

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.090 
headphone from the headphone output of
the<00:02:00.479> camera<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.259> put<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.710> headphone

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
the camera and put it to the headphone

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.859 
the camera and put it to the headphone
output<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:04.140> zoom<00:02:04.380> h6<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:05.219> looks<00:02:05.520> like<00:02:05.880> zoom

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
output of the zoom h6 it looks like zoom

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.869 
output of the zoom h6 it looks like zoom
h6<00:02:07.079> is<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.920> slightly<00:02:08.690> cleaner<00:02:10.459> less<00:02:11.459> noise<00:02:11.849> in

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
h6 is a slightly cleaner less noise in

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.699 
h6 is a slightly cleaner less noise in
the<00:02:12.150> background<00:02:12.720> and

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
the background and

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.619 
the background and
is<00:02:13.909> just<00:02:14.909> a<00:02:15.120> bit<00:02:15.420> more<00:02:16.049> open<00:02:16.790> so<00:02:17.790> but<00:02:18.450> the

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
is just a bit more open so but the

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.929 
is just a bit more open so but the
difference<00:02:19.049> is<00:02:19.319> probably<00:02:19.980> around<00:02:20.129> five

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
difference is probably around five

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:25.179 
difference is probably around five
percent<00:02:20.970> or<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:21.989> I<00:02:22.230> think<00:02:23.069> it's<00:02:23.640> worth<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.269> to

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:25.189 
percent or so I think it's worth it to

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.759 
percent or so I think it's worth it to
not<00:02:26.189> have<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.819> additional<00:02:27.349> 5%<00:02:28.349> but<00:02:28.560> then

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
not have that additional 5% but then

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.979 
not have that additional 5% but then
saving<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.430> lot<00:02:29.579> of<00:02:29.640> time<00:02:29.790> in<00:02:30.299> sinking<00:02:30.840> the

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
saving a lot of time in sinking the

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.270 
saving a lot of time in sinking the
sound<00:02:32.060> once<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.329> finished<00:02:33.930> recording<00:02:34.079> and<00:02:34.709> take

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
sound once I finished recording and take

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.559 
sound once I finished recording and take
the<00:02:35.690> sound<00:02:36.690> bytes<00:02:37.110> into<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:38.459> editing<00:02:39.000> suite

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
the sound bytes into the editing suite

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.410 
the sound bytes into the editing suite
and<00:02:40.310> comparing<00:02:41.310> them<00:02:41.459> over<00:02:41.760> there<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.030> will

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
and comparing them over there I will

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.899 
and comparing them over there I will
have<00:02:42.599> a<00:02:42.629> better<00:02:42.810> idea<00:02:46.010> so<00:02:47.010> this<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.579> sound

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
have a better idea so this is the sound

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.250 
have a better idea so this is the sound
test<00:02:48.269> for<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.049> new<00:02:49.440> cable<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.220> bought<00:02:50.459> for<00:02:51.260> zoom

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260

the<00:02:59.489> microphone<00:03:00.389> of<00:03:00.690> Panasonic<00:03:01.470> gh4<00:03:01.889> and

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
the microphone of Panasonic gh4 and

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.080 
the microphone of Panasonic gh4 and
simultaneously<00:03:04.650> I'm<00:03:04.829> recording<00:03:05.400> it<00:03:05.519> to<00:03:05.760> zoom

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
simultaneously I'm recording it to zoom

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.349 
simultaneously I'm recording it to zoom
h6<00:03:06.329> and<00:03:07.040> comparing<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.159> sound<00:03:08.489> of<00:03:08.819> zoom<00:03:09.180> h6

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
h6 and comparing the sound of zoom h6

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:13.729 
h6 and comparing the sound of zoom h6
and<00:03:09.900> Panasonic<00:03:10.739> gh4<00:03:11.569> by<00:03:12.569> means<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:13.079> the<00:03:13.290> tests

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
and Panasonic gh4 by means of the tests

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.170 
and Panasonic gh4 by means of the tests
so<00:03:14.069> far<00:03:14.099> a<00:03:14.840> and<00:03:15.840> B<00:03:16.019> it<00:03:16.459> just<00:03:17.459> took<00:03:17.940> off<00:03:18.120> my

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
so far a and B it just took off my

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.759 
so far a and B it just took off my
headphone<00:03:19.069> from<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:21.079> headphone<00:03:22.079> output<00:03:22.560> of

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
headphone from the headphone output of

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.740 
headphone from the headphone output of
the<00:03:23.099> camera<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:23.910> put<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.359> headphone

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
the camera and put it to the headphone

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.509 
the camera and put it to the headphone
output<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:26.790> zoom<00:03:27.030> h6<00:03:27.269> it<00:03:27.870> looks<00:03:28.169> like<00:03:28.519> zoom

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
output of the zoom h6 it looks like zoom

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.520 
output of the zoom h6 it looks like zoom
h6<00:03:29.730> is<00:03:30.389> a<00:03:30.569> slightly<00:03:31.340> cleaner<00:03:33.109> less<00:03:34.109> noise<00:03:34.500> in

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
h6 is a slightly cleaner less noise in

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.059 
h6 is a slightly cleaner less noise in
the<00:03:34.859> background<00:03:35.069> and<00:03:35.609> sound<00:03:36.060> is<00:03:36.569> just<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.769> bit

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
the background and sound is just a bit

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.960 
the background and sound is just a bit
more<00:03:38.669> open<00:03:39.440> so<00:03:40.440> but<00:03:41.099> the<00:03:41.280> difference<00:03:41.699> is

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
more open so but the difference is

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.280 
more open so but the difference is
probably<00:03:42.629> around<00:03:42.889> 5%<00:03:43.889> or<00:03:44.400> so<00:03:44.639> I<00:03:44.879> think<00:03:45.720> it's

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
probably around 5% or so I think it's

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.539 
probably around 5% or so I think it's
worth<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:46.919> to<00:03:47.840> not<00:03:48.840> have<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:49.250> additional<00:03:50.250> 5%

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
worth it to not have that additional 5%

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.479 
worth it to not have that additional 5%
but<00:03:51.209> then<00:03:51.419> saving<00:03:51.810> a<00:03:52.079> lot<00:03:52.230> of<00:03:52.410> time<00:03:52.680> in<00:03:52.949> syncing

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
but then saving a lot of time in syncing

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.110 
but then saving a lot of time in syncing
the<00:03:53.669> sound<00:03:54.709> once<00:03:55.709> I'd<00:03:56.010> finished<00:03:56.579> recording

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
the sound once I'd finished recording

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.099 
the sound once I'd finished recording
and<00:03:57.359> take<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.340> sound<00:03:59.340> bites<00:03:59.760> into<00:04:00.599> the

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
and take the sound bites into the

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.369 
and take the sound bites into the
editing<00:04:01.500> suite<00:04:02.099> and<00:04:02.959> comparing<00:04:03.959> them<00:04:04.109> over

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
editing suite and comparing them over

00:04:04.379 --> 00:05:07.920 
editing suite and comparing them over
there<00:04:04.650> I<00:04:04.680> will<00:04:05.069> have<00:04:05.250> a<00:04:05.280> better<00:04:05.519> idea

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.990
