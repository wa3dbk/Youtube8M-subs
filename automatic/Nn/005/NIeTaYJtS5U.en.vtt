also incorporates a lot of data elements
so<00:00:51.670> when<00:00:51.790> you're<00:00:51.910> doing<00:00:52.030> this<00:00:52.210> you<00:00:52.330> want<00:00:52.450> to

isolations<00:00:54.930> which<00:00:55.930> if<00:00:56.080> you<00:00:56.170> don't<00:00:56.260> know<00:00:56.350> what

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
isolations which if you don't know what

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.540 
isolations which if you don't know what

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.220 
that means basically you're going to
keep<00:00:57.640> certain<00:00:57.850> parts<00:00:58.150> of<00:00:58.210> your<00:00:58.300> body<00:00:58.360> still<00:00:58.870> in

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
the other thing that's gonna incorporate

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.310 
the other thing that's gonna incorporate
the<00:01:03.970> dance<00:01:04.180> is<00:01:04.390> some<00:01:04.540> threading<00:01:04.900> which<00:01:05.140> is

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
the dance is some threading which is

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.780 
the dance is some threading which is
basically<00:01:05.680> like<00:01:05.890> when<00:01:06.040> you<00:01:06.100> take<00:01:06.220> a<00:01:06.280> loop<00:01:06.579> and

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
basically like when you take a loop and

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.520 
basically like when you take a loop and
you<00:01:06.850> move<00:01:07.390> like<00:01:07.540> body<00:01:07.840> parts<00:01:07.930> through<00:01:08.350> that

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
you move like body parts through that

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.350 
you move like body parts through that
loop<00:01:08.680> so<00:01:09.520> let's<00:01:09.549> get<00:01:09.909> started<00:01:10.180> with<00:01:10.299> it

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
loop so let's get started with it

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.569 
loop so let's get started with it
