00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.809
 every time has its moment of test 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.630
 the rocks had it before it was the 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:14.930
 firm matter that supports our feet 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.539
 the plants withstood strong winds 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:20.840
 before their roots gave us the 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:23.630
 life in all my years of wise I have only 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:28.530
 known I do not taste similar but the 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:31.590
 hero that he created was a tarno paladin 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:34.260
 today is the big day I hope you're 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.440
 prepared for what happens 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.820
 I think I already understand this machine 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.190
 interacts in some way with that great 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.480
 precursor ring I hope we have not 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.910
 broken nothing by bringing it from the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.440
 lab for you it's easy to tell us 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.250
 We have stripped us 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.980
 to you do not touch anything although the pre 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.230
 courses disappeared long ago their 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.570
 artifacts can still cause large 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.089
 damage great benefits if you know how 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.549
 use them I have some experience with 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.699
 those things I know you can do them 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:05.699
 function 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:14.590
 if she had interesting seems to be 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.590
 reading some preset coordinates 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.830
 songs 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.830
 in the last censorship has been opened 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.790
 those objects 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.750
 then this is how it is 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.750
 I can not 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.540
 but no 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.540
 and we won them all 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.420
 look for yourself from memory 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.299
 no no no 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.299
 plus 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.320
 played by my hairy ears that never 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:48.680
 forward the pastures of the animal 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:53.000
 forgotten of the baron's rat loves you 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:56.170
 We have been waiting for peace of mind 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.170
 save in a pelican 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.620
 i 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.290
 Rich of injections of dark finished 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.850
 normal phones and without changes nothing 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.180
 He informed me that this would eat 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.610
 distinctly surprisingly resistant to 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.780
 your experiments for a praxis I'm afraid 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.440
 that the dark warrior program 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.140
 failed 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.810
 with all the echoes healed that I got you into 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.030
 the body you should be dead now 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.590
 that the armies head plates increase 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.910
 his attacks without a new weapon my 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.130
 men will not be able to resist 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.230
 indefinitely I will not go down in history 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.900
 as the man who lost the city of 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.800
 tandil is creatures forward with the plan 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:51.250
 final and they finish with this thing tonight 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.250
 how do you want to come back and later 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.400
 third floor opinion as a way to 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.220
 exotic and complements the torture of you 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.890
 Or have you seen a hero around here I'm going to 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.730
 they have done you 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:09.909
 I'm already baxter 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.190
 well, I greet him borrowed, swarming 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:15.930
 this place playing literally sees the 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:19.350
 tail to save you we are looking for that 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.350
 carry something 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.200
 I will kill praxis 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.180
 and you have to do is get out of here I leave 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.810
 here to minimum how to open the lands and 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.810
 amara 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.430
 it takes turns 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:40.229
 quiet quiet god I am your colleague 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.229

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:49.389
 it has been that, God remind me that I notice 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:52.680
 and we 'll go dark and macabre little friend 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.680
 we leave here 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.990
 in 32 the muddy new swamps
