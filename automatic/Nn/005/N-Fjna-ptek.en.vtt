00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:08.389
 save people 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:11.160
 well I'm here recording for a galaxy s 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.849
 that recording for a galaxie that I ask 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:19.140
 forgiveness for the quality of the video and in the case 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:21.779
 I'm here with a motorcycle motorola the gir 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.510
 first generation with the function of 4g 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.980
 correct 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.830
 unfortunately the video will have a 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.810
 quality is too low because the camera 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.399
 phone is horrible 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.700
 are 5 megapixels that are not worth two 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:41.520
 but I'll try to show you here 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.170
 the new function of housing that are the 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.289
 themes 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.809
 well, well, little aging cyanogen 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.660
 I tried to install the maximum of theme but 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.140
 o the rush of the installed video 4 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.030
 Let's test the bad green pm 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.570
 I do not know how to pronounce my English is a 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.850
 but anyway a video only 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.210
 statement in the correct case 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.820
 Good fellow, as I said at the beginning of the video. 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.240
 today cyanogenmod has gained the function 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.740
 of topics 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.909
 when you lower status bar you 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.350
 sees that already changed color 12 colors too 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.619
 are green 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.110
 if you open the dialer and the red 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.240
 Anyway, these are themes that I will leave in the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.869
 description of the video for you to download 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.970
 are quite interesting guys are 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.670
 quite interesting because it changes a 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.270
 world the visual of the device 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.290
 Yours is good. 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.090
 continuing here in the fast 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.579
 demonstration of the themes, here we go to the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.770
 Material bless material does not bless 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:54.689
 to pronounce 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:59.700
 we will apply he wanted I wanted the 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:03.540
 camera phone 10 a focus but the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.360
 situation it is difficult that well 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.470
 in the glass material of presence you can 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:14.720
 perceive a little transparency 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:17.750
 here in the correct status bar bar 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.900
 How will I show you in the case? 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.360
 here in the correct themes section itself 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.170
 as you can see here in the background 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.500
 you probably will not see the 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.780
 wallpaper sits right in the very bottom 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.890
 Look, I do not know if you're seeing 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.320
 Here is a small tree wallpaper 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.370
 It sits deep in here at the motel glass one 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:47.090
 Atrium glass is a beautiful theme based on 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:50.540
 those r themes that become lodged dark 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:56.540
 or not to rule in law in the case 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:03:01.700
 but anyway its a black theme that I liked 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:08.780
 enough of the dialer did not discard black 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:12.980
 I think the other time but knowing that already 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:16.010
 have these themes that the development already 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.890
 is starting at ancine today at 12 already 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.100
 something quite satisfactory correct 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.870
 good here in nicolas stuff here is 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.450
 This is where the dialer is black and the 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.530
 confuses without shame in the case 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.450
 we will apply the material nicolas from here 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.820
 practically a theme identical to the old 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.250
 the only difference glass material is that 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.440
 it does not have correct transparency now 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.090
 What about the dialer for you? 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.440
 understand more or less what to say 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:50.989
 said dodo is arc material is this 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:53.360
 it gets totally black fourth goal 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.970
 it is also very interesting to 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.570
 status bar 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.980
 but let's go to the next next zenit 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.560
 he does not change anything 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.470
 it changes more source animation 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.860
 initialization ringtones notifications and 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:13.580
 icons is a more useless theme that is already 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.320
 the law in the case but forgive 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.139
 developer is just my opinion 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:21.990
 right 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:26.080
 good the subject did not apply I think 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:30.400
 let's try to not apply yes it's 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.889
 As you can see, he does not change the style. 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.870
 the national style today mold is nothing else 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.060
 that the device interface does not change 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.189
 interface in case it would change the 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.550
 wall wallpaper the source 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:45.990
 the anima animals in the animation debut in the 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:49.509
 Notify notifications case 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.449
 only changes the wallpaper these things 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:54.729
 so galera of all systems by 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.750
 more that the video has been confusing and 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.509
 boring 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.279
 the best the only light material aric I 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:02.979
 I'll leave everyone as the download on 

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:05.949
 description and this video was a video 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:08.169
 candy theme system demo 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:11.259
 of the correct 12 death scenes 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:13.960
 No matter how old it is, I 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:17.740
 I found it interesting post to see here 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.110
 you to stay connected to the 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.699
 'correct' I know the video was a 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.779
 dude I know the quality sucks 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:28.539
 photographing the galaxy s galaxy and deciding 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:30.400
 almost three years ago it was hardly 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:33.939
 released in 2011 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.800
 four years ago by more than 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:38.560
 quality has gone bad if you 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.629
 liked the news and liked the themes 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.669
 I left the description of the league and 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:44.669
 Strengthens the channel, that's it guys
