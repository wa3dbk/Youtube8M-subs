hi welcome to daddy curves Orchard today

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.070 
hi welcome to daddy curves Orchard today
I<00:00:02.730> wanted<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.240> show<00:00:03.449> you<00:00:03.560> the<00:00:04.560> apple<00:00:05.400> tree<00:00:06.080> it's

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
I wanted to show you the apple tree it's

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.890 
I wanted to show you the apple tree it's
growing<00:00:07.350> up<00:00:07.620> fine<00:00:07.919> it's<00:00:08.220> filling<00:00:08.700> out<00:00:08.900> I

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
growing up fine it's filling out I

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.930 
growing up fine it's filling out I
pruned<00:00:10.710> it<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.920> little<00:00:11.099> bit<00:00:11.340> still<00:00:11.730> need<00:00:11.910> a

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
pruned it a little bit still need a

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.549 
pruned it a little bit still need a
little<00:00:12.150> more<00:00:12.330> pruning<00:00:12.780> but<00:00:12.960> today<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.259> want<00:00:13.500> to

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
little more pruning but today I want to

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.920 
little more pruning but today I want to
show<00:00:13.740> you<00:00:14.330> this<00:00:15.859> festooning<00:00:16.910> method<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:18.090> tying

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
show you this festooning method of tying

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.109 
show you this festooning method of tying
down<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.560> something<00:00:20.430> solid<00:00:20.640> on<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.090> ground

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
down to something solid on the ground

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.920 
down to something solid on the ground
instead<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.930> hanging<00:00:22.109> weights<00:00:23.570> you<00:00:24.570> can<00:00:24.720> see

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
instead of hanging weights you can see

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.679 
instead of hanging weights you can see
here<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.199> took<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.710> thicker<00:00:26.039> piece<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.760> nylon

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
here I took a thicker piece of nylon

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.419 
here I took a thicker piece of nylon
rope<00:00:27.930> because<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.500> it's<00:00:28.769> thicker<00:00:29.070> and

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
rope because it's it's thicker and

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.060 
rope because it's it's thicker and
softer<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:30.359> would<00:00:30.810> have<00:00:31.080> less<00:00:31.439> chance<00:00:31.859> of

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
softer it would have less chance of

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.030 
softer it would have less chance of
damaging<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.700> branch<00:00:33.030> as<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:34.230> pressure<00:00:34.800> of

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
damaging this branch as the pressure of

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.889 
damaging this branch as the pressure of
the<00:00:35.130> branch<00:00:35.399> pushes<00:00:35.969> against<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.420> rope<00:00:36.660> and

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
the branch pushes against that rope and

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.190 
the branch pushes against that rope and
from<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.920> just<00:00:38.280> tied<00:00:38.520> twine<00:00:38.940> down<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.170> a

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
from that I just tied twine down to a

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:50.270 
from that I just tied twine down to a
brick<00:00:47.960> okay<00:00:48.960> let<00:00:49.230> me<00:00:49.289> show<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.530> again<00:00:49.860> using

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
brick okay let me show you again using

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.410 
brick okay let me show you again using
this<00:00:50.399> branch<00:00:50.760> here<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.360> have<00:00:52.699> this<00:00:53.699> short<00:00:54.239> piece

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
this branch here I have this short piece

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.299 
this branch here I have this short piece
of<00:00:54.690> fatter<00:00:55.440> thicker<00:00:56.390> nylon<00:00:57.390> rope<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:58.309> longer

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
of fatter thicker nylon rope a longer

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.319 
of fatter thicker nylon rope a longer
length<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.730> twine<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:01.559> brick<00:01:01.969> now<00:01:02.969> on<00:01:03.149> this

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
length of twine and a brick now on this

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.450 
length of twine and a brick now on this
branch<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.809> can<00:01:03.840> see<00:01:04.140> how<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.680> long

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
branch you can see how it's it's long

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.750 
branch you can see how it's it's long
skinny<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.210> it's<00:01:06.299> kind<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.540> growing<00:01:06.930> up<00:01:07.110> I

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
skinny and it's kind of growing up I

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.210 
skinny and it's kind of growing up I
want<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.790> train<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.330> go<00:01:09.450> more<00:01:09.689> out<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.590> I'm

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
want to train it to go more out so I'm

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.510 
want to train it to go more out so I'm
going<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.460> find<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.909> point<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.510> branch

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.550 

somewhere<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.610> here<00:01:18.000> where<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.110> pressure<00:01:19.350> is

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
somewhere in here where the pressure is

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.929 
somewhere in here where the pressure is
going<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.100> about<00:01:20.340> right<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.759> get<00:01:20.880> that

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
going to be just about right to get that

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.149 
going to be just about right to get that
branch<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.509> grow<00:01:21.780> more<00:01:21.990> out<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.439> don't<00:01:22.770> want<00:01:23.100> to

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
branch to grow more out I don't want to

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.070 
branch to grow more out I don't want to
put<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.610> much<00:01:23.640> pressure<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.780> break

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
put so much pressure on it that I break

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.850 
put so much pressure on it that I break
it<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:25.979> tell<00:01:26.220> by<00:01:26.369> feeling<00:01:27.740> when<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
it you can tell by feeling when the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.850 
it you can tell by feeling when the
pressure<00:01:29.100> starts<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.579> get<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> bit<00:01:30.150> much<00:01:30.420> and

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
pressure starts to get a bit much and

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.410 
pressure starts to get a bit much and
where<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.979> might<00:01:32.159> get<00:01:32.610> close<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.030> breaking

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
where it might get close to breaking

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.300 
where it might get close to breaking
it's<00:01:33.840> not<00:01:33.990> even<00:01:34.380> close<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.650> breaking<00:01:35.040> right

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
it's not even close to breaking right

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.950 
it's not even close to breaking right
here<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.939> about<00:01:36.060> where<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.540> want<00:01:36.840> it

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
here and this is about where I want it

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.140 
here and this is about where I want it
so<00:01:37.500> I'm<00:01:37.590> going<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.770> tie<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.430> here<00:01:41.150> I'm

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
so I'm going to tie this on here I'm

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.730 
so I'm going to tie this on here I'm
going<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.329> take<00:01:42.509> my<00:01:42.689> twine<00:01:43.020> through<00:01:43.350> here<00:01:43.590> and

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
going to take my twine through here and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.929 
going to take my twine through here and
tie<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:43.979> on<00:01:44.899> now<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:45.960> have<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.320> nylon<00:01:46.770> rope<00:01:47.040> tied

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
tie it on now I have the nylon rope tied

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.870 
tie it on now I have the nylon rope tied
around<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.299> branch<00:01:48.570> loosely<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:50.220> twine<00:01:50.549> tied

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
around the branch loosely the twine tied

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.179 
around the branch loosely the twine tied
to<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.180> nylon<00:01:51.540> rope<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.439> I'm<00:01:52.890> just<00:01:53.009> going<00:01:53.159> to

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
to the nylon rope and I'm just going to

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.399 
to the nylon rope and I'm just going to
pull<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.549> down<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:54.570> about<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.930> angle<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.350> I

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
pull it down to about the angle that I

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.200 
pull it down to about the angle that I
like

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.430 

so<00:01:59.140> I<00:01:59.170> tied<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.560> twine<00:02:00.060> from<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.240> nylon<00:02:01.660> down

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
so I tied the twine from the nylon down

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.800 
so I tied the twine from the nylon down
to<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.830> brick<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.370> then<00:02:04.210> just<00:02:04.510> for<00:02:04.690> good

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
to the brick and then just for good

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.020 
to the brick and then just for good
measure<00:02:04.870> brought<00:02:05.410> it<00:02:05.560> back<00:02:05.710> up<00:02:05.950> and<00:02:06.250> tied<00:02:06.910> it

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
measure brought it back up and tied it

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.529 
measure brought it back up and tied it
back<00:02:07.210> to<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:08.350> nylon<00:02:08.820> now<00:02:09.820> the<00:02:09.880> advantage

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
back to the the nylon now the advantage

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.130 
back to the the nylon now the advantage
of<00:02:10.780> doing<00:02:11.530> this<00:02:12.000> instead<00:02:13.000> of<00:02:13.270> the<00:02:13.390> weights<00:02:13.630> now

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
of doing this instead of the weights now

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.050 
of doing this instead of the weights now
I've<00:02:14.290> had<00:02:14.500> pretty<00:02:15.100> decent<00:02:15.490> luck<00:02:15.670> with<00:02:15.880> the

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
I've had pretty decent luck with the

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.580 
I've had pretty decent luck with the
hanging<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.600> weights<00:02:17.050> from<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.320> tree

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
hanging the weights from the tree

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.070 
hanging the weights from the tree
branches<00:02:18.040> but<00:02:18.640> what<00:02:18.940> happens<00:02:19.300> with<00:02:19.450> when<00:02:19.959> you

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
branches but what happens with when you

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.000 
branches but what happens with when you
hang<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.440> weights<00:02:20.650> is<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:22.030> can't<00:02:22.330> control

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
hang the weights is you can't control

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.220 
hang the weights is you can't control
how<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.310> tree<00:02:24.640> bends<00:02:24.970> so<00:02:25.660> you<00:02:25.720> can't<00:02:26.020> really

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
how that tree bends so you can't really

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.470 
how that tree bends so you can't really
control<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.920> direction<00:02:27.100> of<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.760> growth

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
control the direction of the growth

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.600 
control the direction of the growth
because<00:02:29.050> it<00:02:29.080> could<00:02:29.380> be<00:02:29.770> pulled<00:02:30.070> out<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.520> they

it<00:02:52.840> doesn't<00:02:53.020> have<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.440> be<00:02:53.620> because<00:02:54.340> after<00:02:54.790> a

few months of growing like this the

out in that direction you know once the

when I pulled it down in this case I was

okay with that

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.120 
okay with that
because<00:04:11.530> I<00:04:11.770> wanted<00:04:12.160> it<00:04:12.310> growing<00:04:12.700> more<00:04:13.390> out

prune<00:04:27.820> some<00:04:28.060> of<00:04:28.180> these<00:04:28.530> that<00:04:29.530> are<00:04:29.650> around<00:04:29.980> it

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
prune some of these that are around it

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:39.050 
prune some of these that are around it
out<00:04:30.430> later

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.910 

now<00:04:40.060> this<00:04:40.240> is<00:04:40.420> kind<00:04:40.660> of<00:04:40.720> my<00:04:40.840> own<00:04:40.990> experiment<00:04:41.740> I

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
now this is kind of my own experiment I

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.340 
now this is kind of my own experiment I
haven't<00:04:42.610> seen<00:04:43.420> a<00:04:43.450> whole<00:04:43.690> lot<00:04:43.720> of<00:04:43.930> this<00:04:44.110> online

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
haven't seen a whole lot of this online

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.110 
haven't seen a whole lot of this online
I<00:04:44.560> haven't<00:04:45.010> read<00:04:45.130> about<00:04:45.280> it<00:04:45.610> nobody's<00:04:45.940> really

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
I haven't read about it nobody's really

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.570 
I haven't read about it nobody's really
told<00:04:46.450> me<00:04:46.540> about<00:04:46.630> it<00:04:46.960> now<00:04:47.440> what<00:04:47.650> I<00:04:47.680> had<00:04:48.010> looked

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
told me about it now what I had looked

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.120 
told me about it now what I had looked
at<00:04:48.760> before<00:04:48.910> was<00:04:49.330> hanging<00:04:49.720> the<00:04:49.810> weights<00:04:50.130> and

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
at before was hanging the weights and

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.120 
at before was hanging the weights and
that<00:04:51.550> has<00:04:51.730> done<00:04:51.970> fine<00:04:52.300> I<00:04:52.770> just<00:04:53.770> wanted<00:04:54.010> a

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
that has done fine I just wanted a

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.940 
that has done fine I just wanted a
little<00:04:54.220> more<00:04:54.490> control<00:04:55.000> over<00:04:55.770> where<00:04:56.770> the

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
little more control over where the

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.100 
little more control over where the
branches<00:04:57.370> went<00:04:57.670> so<00:04:58.240> like<00:04:58.450> I<00:04:58.570> said<00:04:58.630> it's<00:04:58.960> my

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
branches went so like I said it's my

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.050 
branches went so like I said it's my
experiment<00:04:59.800> you're<00:05:00.370> going<00:05:00.520> to<00:05:00.580> get<00:05:00.700> to<00:05:00.820> see

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
experiment you're going to get to see

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.270 
experiment you're going to get to see
how<00:05:01.810> this<00:05:02.110> turns<00:05:02.290> out<00:05:02.650> you're<00:05:02.980> going<00:05:03.100> to<00:05:03.160> get

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
how this turns out you're going to get

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.610 
how this turns out you're going to get
to<00:05:03.400> see<00:05:03.580> how<00:05:03.790> this<00:05:03.970> tree<00:05:04.270> shapes<00:05:04.630> up<00:05:04.900> I<00:05:05.110> figure

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
to see how this tree shapes up I figure

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.920 
to see how this tree shapes up I figure
the<00:05:05.800> trees<00:05:06.070> are<00:05:06.280> going<00:05:06.370> to<00:05:06.460> teach<00:05:06.670> me<00:05:06.940> better

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
the trees are going to teach me better

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.260 
the trees are going to teach me better
than<00:05:08.260> you<00:05:08.980> know<00:05:09.100> anything<00:05:09.610> that<00:05:09.790> I<00:05:09.820> could<00:05:10.030> read

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
than you know anything that I could read

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.140 
than you know anything that I could read
or<00:05:10.630> be<00:05:10.780> told<00:05:11.370> go<00:05:12.370> ahead<00:05:12.520> and<00:05:12.610> give<00:05:12.700> me<00:05:12.790> a<00:05:12.850> thumbs
