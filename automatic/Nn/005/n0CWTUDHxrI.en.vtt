00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:07.190
 hello today carolina will prepare us a country 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.650
 of lemon for the base we will need the 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.780
 following ingredients one and a half cup 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.320
 of flour as we can call 50 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.490
 grams of sugar flower 2 egg yolks 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.789
 125 grams keeps the butter 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.519
 listen 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:25.210
 first football we make the butter or 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:27.920
 margarine then the superfluous we take a 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.050
 fork and mixed 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.300
 once the mixture is homogeneous 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.370
 we incorporate the flour 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.079
 the egg yolks 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.079
 we mix a little 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.170
 and then we knead and hydrate the dough 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.170
 with a little milk 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.140
 after a few minutes we will have all 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:09.240
 the ingredients incorporated in what 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.240
 it will be our raider base 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.330
 then we will take a cloth that 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.000
 It can be one of the classic cloths that 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.680
 we occupy in our kitchen we proceed to 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.410
 wrap the dough to take it to the 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.570
 refrigerator keep the dough 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.310
 resting for 20 min 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.200
 we take out the mass from the cloth and the 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.060
 We take a mold of 24 centimeters 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.820
 from which we gave the mantel that has arrived 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.950
 previously then we put our hands together 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.380
 a little flour and we start to mold 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.510
 our mass pressing and stretching 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.119
 so that we have an even layer 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.580
 in all the extension of the mold both in 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.590
 the bottom as in the ovens 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.210
 we puncture our base with a fork 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.940
 to prevent cooking in the oven 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.880
 do not stay even while we heat the 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.130
 180 degree oven once ready 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.780
 We carry the mold with the base of our 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.300
 baked country the one that has already is 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.460
 hot we leave our base in the 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.650
 oven for about 10 2 the same while 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.360
 we will make a simple fill for this 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.760
 we will need a milk jar 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.369
 condensed half a cup of lemon juice 2 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.710
 tablespoons of lemon zest in a 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:17.080
 bol incorporate the condensed milk 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.080
 lemon juice and lemon zest 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.180
 we mix until a paste 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.180
 homogeneous 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.780
 the filling chosen for this recipe does not 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.260
 includes eggs therefore does not require 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.330
 sweet moss 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.790
 the time has passed we retire with the 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.310
 transfer of the oven let cool by 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.709
 a few minutes 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.270
 once cold we remove the mold and 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.640
 we emptied the filling in the center of 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.440
 our base for the country with a 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.510
 spatula we continue to match the 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.230
 filling on the base from the center 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.230
 up to the edges 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.780
 for the cover we will make a meringue 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.360
 Italian for this we will need five 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.879
 egg classes 240 grams of sugar 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.920
 granulated 80 millimeters of water and a 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.780
 kitchen thermometer in a pot or 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.819
 small pan we empty the sugar 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.819
 then the water and mix 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.290
 then we take the kitchen to medium heat 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.150
 one of the properties of merengue 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.159
 Italian is that it is a stable meringue 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.780
 that stays solid for a long time 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:26.400
 ideal time for our country 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.410
 while we do the question of 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.730
 our syrup together we started 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.730
 with the egg whites party 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.670
 the whites must be completely 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.670
 white to incorporate the syrup 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.330
 once the syrup reaches 118 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.350
 degrees Celsius we are ready to 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.350
 perform the mixture 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.330
 for this we remove from the unit yet 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.640
 hot and while we beat let's go 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.580
 incorporating the syrup slowly and with 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.660
 careful to avoid inconveniences in the 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.660
 match of the clear 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.989
 we continue beating the meringue 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.010
 a few minutes to reach a height and 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.010
 adequate consistency 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.560
 at this moment we are ready to 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.900
 apply the cover to our country 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.760
 for the application of the cover with the 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.860
 help from a spatula we do not know how to know you 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.950
 meringue in small quantities on the 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.650
 filling 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.970
 first we form a layer that covers all 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.970
 the top of the country 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.710
 then we will incorporate a 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:04.050
 second layer but the idea is to train in 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.050
 these mounds with the meringue 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.690
 yes 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.920
 then we proceed to burn the surface 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.290
 of meringue 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.260
 for this the ideal is to do it with a 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.480
 kitchen torch if it does not have a blowtorch 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.240
 can last merengue with help 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.510
 from the oven green that only a couple 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.130
 of minutes and under constant supervision 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:46.030
 since the egg white to snow is 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.030
 easy to intur 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.440
 I've seen we have this exquisite pay 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.720
 of lemon that enjoy it
