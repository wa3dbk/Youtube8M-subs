I<00:03:44.540> believe<00:03:45.540> if<00:03:45.870> all<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:47.070> Z<00:03:47.310> fighters<00:03:47.519> came

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
I believe if all the Z fighters came

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.880 
I believe if all the Z fighters came
together<00:03:48.090> even<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:48.900> you<00:03:48.989> yawn<00:03:49.290> check<00:03:49.500> growing

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
together even to you yawn check growing

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.009 
together even to you yawn check growing
and<00:03:50.070> then<00:03:50.310> I<00:03:50.340> went<00:03:50.610> on<00:03:50.730> for<00:03:51.090> fourth<00:03:51.390> actually

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
and then I went on for fourth actually

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.060 
and then I went on for fourth actually
believe<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.320> they<00:03:52.530> could<00:03:52.739> have<00:03:52.860> actually

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
believe that they could have actually

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.340 
believe that they could have actually
done<00:03:53.640> something<00:03:54.239> like<00:03:54.630> they<00:03:55.049> could<00:03:55.230> have

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
done something like they could have

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.800 
done something like they could have
possibly<00:03:55.500> won<00:03:55.890> that<00:03:56.070> battle<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.430> way<00:03:56.850> the

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
possibly won that battle that way the

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.300 
possibly won that battle that way the
only<00:03:57.959> reason<00:03:58.079> I<00:03:58.380> truly<00:03:58.680> did<00:03:58.829> the<00:03:58.920> Z<00:03:59.100> fighters

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
only reason I truly did the Z fighters

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.949 
only reason I truly did the Z fighters
lost<00:03:59.850> that<00:04:00.060> belt<00:04:00.269> was<00:04:00.390> because<00:04:00.690> they<00:04:00.810> were

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
lost that belt was because they were

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.960 
lost that belt was because they were
just<00:04:01.110> continually<00:04:01.799> outnumbered

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970
