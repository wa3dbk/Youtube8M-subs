00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.940 
high-end design program and I wanted to
ensure<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.229> students<00:01:46.590> were<00:01:46.710> fully

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
ensure that the students were fully

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.569 
ensure that the students were fully
informed<00:01:47.640> about<00:01:47.930> what<00:01:48.930> goes<00:01:49.110> into<00:01:49.170> fur<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:50.490> was

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
informed about what goes into fur it was

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.830 
informed about what goes into fur it was
really<00:01:50.790> more<00:01:50.909> about<00:01:51.030> for<00:01:51.299> at<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.509> time<00:01:51.689> but

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
really more about for at that time but

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.719 
really more about for at that time but
also<00:01:52.020> leather<00:01:52.439> wool<00:01:53.990> knowing<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.729> origin

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
also leather wool knowing the the origin

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.240 
also leather wool knowing the the origin
of<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.270> materials<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.780> you're<00:01:57.990> using

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.650 

professional<00:02:01.250> streets<00:02:01.700> you<00:02:01.880> stop<00:02:02.150> using<00:02:02.390> an

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
professional streets you stop using an

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.520 
professional streets you stop using an
animal<00:02:03.080> fabrics<00:02:04.040> all<00:02:04.220> together<00:02:04.400> I<00:02:05.530> really

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
animal fabrics all together I really

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.930 
animal fabrics all together I really
believe<00:02:06.770> we<00:02:06.980> will<00:02:07.100> arrive<00:02:07.400> in<00:02:07.430> that<00:02:07.730> place

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
believe we will arrive in that place

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.359 
believe we will arrive in that place
eventually<00:02:08.270> but<00:02:08.630> if<00:02:08.780> we<00:02:09.260> can<00:02:09.590> make<00:02:10.040> great

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
eventually but if we can make great

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.540 
eventually but if we can make great
progress<00:02:11.150> with<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.960> fur<00:02:12.170> issue<00:02:12.410> alone<00:02:13.310> and

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
progress with the fur issue alone and

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.780 
progress with the fur issue alone and
forgive<00:02:13.790> me<00:02:13.820> from<00:02:14.090> being<00:02:15.020> this<00:02:15.520> want<00:02:16.520> about

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
forgive me from being this want about

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.610 
forgive me from being this want about
that<00:02:17.000> i<00:02:17.180> just<00:02:17.240> find<00:02:17.570> it<00:02:17.690> it's<00:02:17.870> so<00:02:18.020> egregious

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
that i just find it it's so egregious

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.740 
that i just find it it's so egregious
that<00:02:18.650> if<00:02:19.430> we<00:02:19.520> can<00:02:19.640> make<00:02:19.820> a<00:02:20.060> lot<00:02:20.480> of<00:02:20.540> headway

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
that if we can make a lot of headway

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.830 
that if we can make a lot of headway
with<00:02:20.990> fur<00:02:21.230> which<00:02:21.440> we<00:02:21.620> clearly<00:02:21.770> have<00:02:22.330> that<00:02:23.330> it's

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
with fur which we clearly have that it's

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:31.780 
with fur which we clearly have that it's
a<00:02:23.960> very<00:02:24.170> very<00:02:24.230> very<00:02:24.650> good<00:02:24.800> thing<00:02:30.550> recently<00:02:31.550> the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
a very very very good thing recently the

specifically a website called fur is

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.930 
specifically a website called fur is
green<00:02:37.310> calm<00:02:37.820> and<00:02:38.120> they're<00:02:38.840> trying<00:02:39.170> to

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
green calm and they're trying to

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.550 
green calm and they're trying to
greenwash<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.360> fur<00:02:41.510> industry<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:42.110> say<00:02:42.320> that

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
because it's a natural product it's also

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.510 
because it's a natural product it's also
eco-friendly<00:02:44.540> can<00:02:45.500> you<00:02:45.560> clarify<00:02:45.800> is<00:02:46.220> for

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
eco-friendly can you clarify is for

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.040 
eco-friendly can you clarify is for
eco-friendly<00:02:46.790> well<00:02:47.510> it's<00:02:47.630> very<00:02:47.810> ironic

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
eco-friendly well it's very ironic

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.560 
eco-friendly well it's very ironic
because<00:02:48.620> fur<00:02:49.160> is<00:02:49.520> not<00:02:49.970> only<00:02:50.150> environmentally

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
because fur is not only environmentally

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.540 
because fur is not only environmentally
unfriendly<00:02:50.870> but<00:02:51.350> for<00:02:51.620> yours<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:52.130> skins
