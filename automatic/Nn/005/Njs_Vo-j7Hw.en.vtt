trained hard throughout the week have a

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.060 
trained hard throughout the week have a
protein<00:04:39.550> pancake<00:04:40.180> so<00:04:40.600> aimed<00:04:41.530> at<00:04:41.800> someone

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
protein pancake so aimed at someone

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.730 
protein pancake so aimed at someone
wanting<00:04:42.550> to<00:04:42.639> keep<00:04:43.180> their<00:04:43.389> size<00:04:43.630> up<00:04:43.870> I<00:04:44.139> noticed

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
wanting to keep their size up I noticed

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.500 
wanting to keep their size up I noticed
Peter<00:04:44.949> it's<00:04:45.130> bubbling<00:04:45.520> up<00:04:45.699> there<00:04:45.940> yeah<00:04:46.300> that's

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
Peter it's bubbling up there yeah that's

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.719 
Peter it's bubbling up there yeah that's
what<00:04:46.570> you<00:04:46.750> want<00:04:46.930> you're<00:04:47.110> looking<00:04:47.350> for<00:04:47.530> that

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
what you want you're looking for that

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.830 
what you want you're looking for that
you<00:04:48.729> can<00:04:48.880> see<00:04:49.000> it's<00:04:49.120> out<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.419> bubble<00:04:49.720> which

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
you can see it's out the bubble which

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.510 
you can see it's out the bubble which
means<00:04:50.080> it's<00:04:50.260> just<00:04:50.440> about<00:04:50.650> ready<00:04:50.860> to<00:04:50.979> turn<00:04:51.250> when

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
means it's just about ready to turn when

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.100 
means it's just about ready to turn when
it's<00:04:51.639> bubbled<00:04:51.970> all<00:04:52.090> the<00:04:52.180> way<00:04:52.300> through<00:04:52.600> that

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
it's bubbled all the way through that

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.080 
it's bubbled all the way through that
means<00:04:53.350> it's<00:04:53.500> halfway<00:04:53.740> cooked<00:04:54.070> just<00:04:54.789> flip<00:04:55.000> it

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
means it's halfway cooked just flip it

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.670 
means it's halfway cooked just flip it
over<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.419> the<00:04:55.510> other<00:04:55.600> side<00:04:55.840> so<00:04:56.380> how<00:04:56.530> do<00:04:56.590> you

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
over to the other side so how do you

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.620 
over to the other side so how do you
know<00:04:56.770> when<00:04:56.919> it's<00:04:56.949> cooked<00:04:57.280> Pete<00:04:57.550> it's<00:04:58.240> about<00:04:58.479> an

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
know when it's cooked Pete it's about an

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.480 
know when it's cooked Pete it's about an
even<00:04:58.870> amount<00:04:58.930> of<00:04:59.229> on<00:04:59.710> both<00:04:59.919> sides<00:05:00.190> but<00:05:00.340> it's

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
even amount of on both sides but it's

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.250 
even amount of on both sides but it's
quite<00:05:00.639> firm<00:05:01.000> so<00:05:01.419> if<00:05:01.479> I<00:05:01.539> just<00:05:01.570> got<00:05:01.840> to<00:05:01.930> push<00:05:02.110> it

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
quite firm so if I just got to push it

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.629 
quite firm so if I just got to push it
like<00:05:02.410> that<00:05:02.500> it's<00:05:02.650> quite<00:05:02.770> it'll<00:05:03.160> bounce<00:05:03.310> back

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
like that it's quite it'll bounce back

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.210 
like that it's quite it'll bounce back
up<00:05:03.850> yes<00:05:04.510> if<00:05:04.990> it's<00:05:05.229> not<00:05:05.289> caught<00:05:05.680> little<00:05:05.889> you'll

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
up yes if it's not caught little you'll

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.590 
up yes if it's not caught little you'll
break<00:05:06.370> the<00:05:06.610> middle<00:05:06.880> and<00:05:07.000> the<00:05:07.090> battle<00:05:07.389> be<00:05:07.510> in

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
break the middle and the battle be in

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.270 
break the middle and the battle be in
the<00:05:07.690> middle<00:05:07.870> so<00:05:08.560> it<00:05:08.590> put<00:05:08.919> a<00:05:08.949> couple<00:05:09.220> of

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
the middle so it put a couple of

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.580 
the middle so it put a couple of
pancakes<00:05:09.760> on<00:05:09.970> their<00:05:10.180> bit<00:05:10.539> fancy<00:05:11.020> their<00:05:11.289> Fred

maple syrup not obviously we're not
certain<00:05:42.400> without<00:05:42.789> in<00:05:43.030> this<00:05:43.180> program<00:05:43.660> Peter<00:05:43.960> it

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
certain without in this program Peter it

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.260 
certain without in this program Peter it
might<00:05:44.950> be<00:05:45.070> another<00:05:45.310> program<00:05:45.729> that<00:05:45.760> you<00:05:45.970> do<00:05:46.120> but

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
might be another program that you do but

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.450 
might be another program that you do but
not<00:05:46.389> this<00:05:46.570> one<00:05:46.780> okay<00:05:47.289> what<00:05:47.919> I<00:05:47.950> like<00:05:48.160> to<00:05:48.310> do<00:05:48.430> is

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
not this one okay what I like to do is

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.460 
not this one okay what I like to do is
put<00:05:48.789> a<00:05:48.820> little<00:05:49.090> bit<00:05:49.270> of<00:05:49.300> flexi<00:05:49.780> all<00:05:49.990> over<00:05:50.349> it

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
put a little bit of flexi all over it

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.980 
put a little bit of flexi all over it
obviously<00:05:50.919> it<00:05:51.039> adds<00:05:51.190> flavor<00:05:51.610> so<00:05:52.210> we<00:05:52.389> drizzle<00:05:52.780> a

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
obviously it adds flavor so we drizzle a

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.409 
obviously it adds flavor so we drizzle a
bit<00:05:53.349> over<00:05:53.740> the<00:05:53.860> top<00:05:53.889> plexi<00:05:54.669> doors<00:05:54.880> really<00:05:55.180> got

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
bit over the top plexi doors really got

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.029 
bit over the top plexi doors really got
home<00:05:55.630> answer<00:05:55.960> fat's<00:05:56.199> in<00:05:56.320> it<00:05:56.500> so<00:05:56.710> good<00:05:56.949> and

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 
home answer fat's in it so good and
