 let's make a lala ho the first malawi 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:17.700
 here and we do foreign files a folder 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.229
 wii make ok fight that you would have moments 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.390
 through these files we will see on dolphin 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.540
 setup people if you have some 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.439
 to sell a dual core processor 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:34.560
 no water interface for the volume 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.840
 with the work the gamecube and wii we put 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.920
 Italian language system 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.970
 the paths we add we try 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.600
 the folder where we downloaded the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:57.150
 we extracted the world from the walls 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:58.590
 I do ok video productions we put the 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.479
 say what you want 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.280
 for example I keep of and 13 wanted 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:10.140
 your computer is not so powerful 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:13.800
 powerful say 3d 9 or later will come out 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:17.520
 the video card here then the solution in 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.630
 where you play the game 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.450
 I hold to 1600 for 1900 here you can 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.760
 play both full screen and v 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:32.459
 screen 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:34.050
 here we go to control sometimes 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.330
 of wii we can put both with 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.830
 the oreal and that of tears I do not 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:43.140
 therefore I keep it with the bulwarks 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:46.410
 we do with figures configures this echo 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.080
 the pre defined to me 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.890
 like how you know so I don't know if you want it 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.370
 changing him is fine for me 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.270
 that once you have it configured 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.230
 for games 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:04.350
 I only keep these two and they are 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:09.210
 curling ju on the bridge are gods 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:11.730
 horror orgy games that wii exclusive 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:17.940
 then I'll show you where where 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:21.900
 to be able to download them and certainly perugia 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:29.700
 we will find it here and in the given Italian 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:36.140
 really then we will find kaling instead 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:40.410
 here always by torrent in English in usa 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.880
 ready that we will have downloaded when it is 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.700
 better in my opinion make a new one 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:50.790
 folder calling it wii games time 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:57.420
 after downloading it you will find the files again 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:04:07.560
 iso make pulls out and shrunk in 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:11.730
 a wii game folder but you will have it 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.190
 these files this is from carlin 13 e 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.810
 this is from zune 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:24.120
 then we are only interested in the files 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:27.150
 image these two fi not go on 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:32.430

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:38.430
 here but will succeed if on the screen of 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:41.500
 double-click the game you search 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.430
 double- click search 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:49.180
 the card and not that you put the game 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:54.250
 example then I keep it here not 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:05:00.820
 wait here and click on the image 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:05.080

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.700

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.690
 you don't want these two games I'll leave you 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:15.910
