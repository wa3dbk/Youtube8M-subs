the<00:01:20.909> actual<00:01:21.000> rigid<00:01:21.420> hub<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:22.350> what<00:01:22.560> we're

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
the actual rigid hub and what we're

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.310 
the actual rigid hub and what we're
gonna<00:01:22.860> show<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.520> but<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> boats<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.930> this

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
gonna show is but the boats on this

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.050 
gonna show is but the boats on this
isn't<00:01:26.040> actually<00:01:26.340> what's<00:01:26.520> transmitting<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
isn't actually what's transmitting the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.460 
isn't actually what's transmitting the
torque<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.479> drive<00:01:27.689> shaft<00:01:27.960> okay<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.380> we've

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
torque on the drive shaft okay and we've

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.230 
torque on the drive shaft okay and we've
got<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> little<00:01:29.130> sample<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.640> over<00:01:29.909> here<00:01:30.090> so

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
got a little sample of this over here so

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.499 
got a little sample of this over here so
basically<00:01:30.479> what<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.780> have<00:01:30.960> here<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:32.509> sample

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
basically what we have here is a sample

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.780 
basically what we have here is a sample
setup<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.170> universal<00:01:34.740> flange<00:01:35.040> type<00:01:35.460> joint

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
setup of a universal flange type joint

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.789 
setup of a universal flange type joint
so<00:01:36.540> what<00:01:36.659> we<00:01:36.750> have<00:01:36.900> here<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.259> flange<00:01:37.530> out

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
so what we have here is the flange out

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.980 
so what we have here is the flange out
with<00:01:38.460> equally<00:01:38.939> spaced<00:01:39.180> holes<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.840> have<00:01:39.869> a

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
with equally spaced holes you have a

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
torque wrench over there so that's

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.610 
torque wrench over there so that's
something<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.270> I<00:02:25.300> know<00:02:25.450> has<00:02:26.110> got<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.530> be

something that I know has got to be

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.960 
something that I know has got to be
critical<00:02:27.040> make<00:02:27.190> sure<00:02:27.310> all<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.580> bolts<00:02:27.820> are

that's done properly as you're putting
together<00:02:51.970> at<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.300> drive<00:02:52.510> shaft<00:02:52.780> okay<00:02:53.170> what's

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
together at the drive shaft okay what's

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.170 
together at the drive shaft okay what's
next<00:02:53.800> after<00:02:54.160> we<00:02:54.340> got<00:02:54.459> that<00:02:54.610> taken<00:02:54.820> care<00:02:54.970> of

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
next after we got that taken care of

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.550 
next after we got that taken care of
well<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:55.660> next<00:02:55.840> two<00:02:56.080> critical<00:02:56.530> things

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
well the next two critical things

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.920 
well the next two critical things
basically<00:02:57.250> have<00:02:57.489> to<00:02:57.610> do<00:02:57.790> with<00:02:58.239> when<00:02:58.750> you're

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
basically have to do with when you're

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.620 
basically have to do with when you're
actually<00:02:59.110> mounting<00:02:59.739> this<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.459> setup<00:03:01.450> and

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
actually mounting this and the setup and

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.030 
actually mounting this and the setup and
the<00:03:01.690> configuration<00:03:02.020> you<00:03:02.440> use<00:03:02.709> when<00:03:02.920> you're

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
the configuration you use when you're

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.680 
the configuration you use when you're
actually<00:03:03.220> mounting<00:03:03.640> this<00:03:03.730> drive<00:03:04.000> shaft<00:03:04.030> okay

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
actually mounting this drive shaft okay

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.510 
actually mounting this drive shaft okay
well<00:03:05.020> let's<00:03:05.200> get<00:03:05.560> everything<00:03:05.800> set<00:03:06.220> up<00:03:06.250> because

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
well let's get everything set up because

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.740 
well let's get everything set up because
I<00:03:06.550> know<00:03:06.610> you're<00:03:06.820> gonna<00:03:06.880> turn<00:03:07.180> that<00:03:07.390> motor<00:03:07.630> and

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
I know you're gonna turn that motor and

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.120 
I know you're gonna turn that motor and
we<00:03:07.930> got<00:03:08.080> to<00:03:08.170> lift<00:03:08.350> this<00:03:08.470> up<00:03:08.650> because<00:03:08.950> we're

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
we got to lift this up because we're

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.460 
we got to lift this up because we're
showing<00:03:09.370> some<00:03:09.600> extreme<00:03:10.600> angles<00:03:11.110> raise<00:03:11.290> your

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
showing some extreme angles raise your

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.729 
showing some extreme angles raise your
arms<00:03:11.860> and<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:12.580> helps<00:03:12.910> exaggerate<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:14.200> concept

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
arms and it helps exaggerate the concept

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.890 
arms and it helps exaggerate the concept
that<00:03:14.830> we're<00:03:14.980> actually<00:03:15.370> introducing<00:03:16.360> I<00:03:16.480> got<00:03:16.780> it

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
that we're actually introducing I got it

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.150 
that we're actually introducing I got it
to<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.110> height<00:03:17.260> you<00:03:17.290> wanted<00:03:17.709> what<00:03:18.010> have<00:03:18.100> we

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
to the height you wanted what have we

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.250 
to the height you wanted what have we
got<00:03:18.310> so<00:03:18.580> basically<00:03:19.330> when<00:03:19.570> you<00:03:19.600> install<00:03:20.049> this

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
got so basically when you install this

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.900 
got so basically when you install this
drive<00:03:20.500> shaft<00:03:20.530> you'd<00:03:20.920> have<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.160> be<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:21.310> word<00:03:21.610> that

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
drive shaft you'd have to be a word that

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.670 
drive shaft you'd have to be a word that
the<00:03:22.000> actual<00:03:22.540> yokes<00:03:22.870> on<00:03:23.110> this<00:03:23.260> drive<00:03:23.500> show

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
the actual yokes on this drive show

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.320 
the actual yokes on this drive show
something<00:03:24.100> must<00:03:24.280> be<00:03:24.370> aligned<00:03:24.760> okay<00:03:25.150> and

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
something must be aligned okay and

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.940 
something must be aligned okay and
usually<00:03:25.480> these<00:03:25.840> have<00:03:26.110> to<00:03:26.200> be<00:03:26.320> within<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.739> line

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
usually these have to be within the line

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.770 
usually these have to be within the line
within<00:03:27.190> one<00:03:27.489> to<00:03:27.640> two<00:03:27.760> degrees<00:03:27.880> in<00:03:28.360> order<00:03:28.540> for

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
within one to two degrees in order for

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.259 
within one to two degrees in order for
this<00:03:28.870> drive<00:03:29.140> shaft<00:03:29.170> to<00:03:29.500> operate<00:03:29.950> properly

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
this drive shaft to operate properly

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.300 
this drive shaft to operate properly

that<00:03:35.769> way<00:03:36.040> if<00:03:36.400> while<00:03:36.760> you're<00:03:37.000> installing<00:03:37.209> or

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
that way if while you're installing or

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.570 
that way if while you're installing or
when<00:03:38.049> you're<00:03:38.320> doing<00:03:39.130> any<00:03:39.280> kind<00:03:39.519> of

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
when you're doing any kind of

when you're doing any kind of
maintenance<00:03:39.760> on<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.180> machine<00:03:40.480> your<00:03:40.930> slip

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
maintenance on the machine your slip

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.750 
maintenance on the machine your slip
actually<00:03:41.709> comes<00:03:42.010> out<00:03:42.250> of<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.489> drive<00:03:42.730> shaft

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
actually comes out of the drive shaft

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.789 
actually comes out of the drive shaft
assembly<00:03:43.060> you<00:03:43.840> will<00:03:44.019> know<00:03:44.200> where<00:03:44.470> to<00:03:44.500> put<00:03:44.769> it

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
assembly you will know where to put it

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.289 
assembly you will know where to put it
back<00:03:44.950> together<00:03:45.130> to<00:03:45.459> ensure<00:03:45.760> you<00:03:45.940> have<00:03:46.120> these

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
back together to ensure you have these

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.600 
back together to ensure you have these
yokes<00:03:46.720> phase<00:03:47.260> correctly<00:03:47.829> so<00:03:48.100> basically<00:03:48.430> we're

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
yokes phase correctly so basically we're

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.430 
yokes phase correctly so basically we're
going<00:03:48.730> to<00:03:48.790> look<00:03:48.940> here<00:03:49.239> and<00:03:49.480> I'm<00:03:49.840> gonna<00:03:49.959> use

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
going to look here and I'm gonna use

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.520 
going to look here and I'm gonna use
this<00:03:50.650> demonstrator<00:03:51.280> to<00:03:52.000> show<00:03:52.360> how<00:03:52.840> a<00:03:52.870> line<00:03:53.320> of

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
this demonstrator to show how a line of

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.140 
this demonstrator to show how a line of
flange<00:03:53.769> jokes<00:03:54.040> makes<00:03:54.340> everything<00:03:54.610> work<00:03:55.000> as

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
flange jokes makes everything work as

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.030 
flange jokes makes everything work as
its<00:03:55.299> proper<00:03:55.600> design<00:03:55.840> to<00:03:56.019> the<00:03:56.380> first<00:03:56.620> run<00:03:56.860> I'm

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
its proper design to the first run I'm

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.520 
its proper design to the first run I'm
gonna<00:03:57.190> turn<00:03:57.430> it<00:03:57.579> on<00:03:57.700> I'm<00:03:57.910> gonna<00:03:58.060> use<00:03:58.930> this<00:03:59.170> card

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
gonna turn it on I'm gonna use this card

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.009 
gonna turn it on I'm gonna use this card
here<00:03:59.829> and<00:04:00.070> I'm<00:04:00.160> gonna<00:04:00.340> actually<00:04:00.989> listen<00:04:01.989> to

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
here and I'm gonna actually listen to

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.660 
here and I'm gonna actually listen to
the<00:04:02.200> frequency<00:04:02.650> this<00:04:02.769> car<00:04:03.040> makes<00:04:03.310> on<00:04:03.489> these

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
the frequency this car makes on these

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.850 
the frequency this car makes on these
sprockets<00:04:03.880> okay<00:04:04.810> so<00:04:05.140> I'm<00:04:05.320> gonna<00:04:05.440> trace<00:04:05.680> this

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
sprockets okay so I'm gonna trace this

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.039 
sprockets okay so I'm gonna trace this
trip<00:04:06.280> test<00:04:06.549> the<00:04:06.700> drive<00:04:06.910> side<00:04:07.180> and<00:04:07.780> it's<00:04:07.930> going

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
trip test the drive side and it's going

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.080 
trip test the drive side and it's going
to<00:04:08.110> be<00:04:08.200> constant<00:04:08.739> ledger<00:04:08.920> motor

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
to be constant ledger motor

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.090 
to be constant ledger motor
everything<00:04:10.990> is<00:04:11.080> good<00:04:11.230> now<00:04:11.350> you<00:04:11.410> try<00:04:11.650> your<00:04:11.860> side

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
everything is good now you try your side

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.870 
everything is good now you try your side
there

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
there

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.720 
there
their<00:04:14.720> constant<00:04:15.620> noise<00:04:15.860> I'm<00:04:16.100> goes<00:04:16.250> faster

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
their constant noise I'm goes faster

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.160 
their constant noise I'm goes faster
speed<00:04:17.000> everything's<00:04:17.480> running<00:04:17.750> great

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
speed everything's running great

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.510 
speed everything's running great
okay<00:04:18.440> now<00:04:19.160> we're<00:04:19.400> actually<00:04:19.550> going<00:04:19.940> to<00:04:20.060> mimic<00:04:20.900> a

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
okay now we're actually going to mimic a

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.760 
okay now we're actually going to mimic a
the<00:04:22.520> non<00:04:23.000> phase<00:04:23.450> yokes<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:24.290> actually<00:04:24.560> show

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
the non phase yokes to actually show

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.030 
the non phase yokes to actually show
what<00:04:25.040> that<00:04:25.100> does<00:04:25.430> so<00:04:26.000> basically<00:04:26.360> I'm<00:04:26.600> gonna

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
what that does so basically I'm gonna

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.770 
what that does so basically I'm gonna
misalign<00:04:28.040> these<00:04:28.280> jokes<00:04:28.550> 90<00:04:28.940> degrees<00:04:29.300> just<00:04:29.330> for

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
misalign these jokes 90 degrees just for

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.050 
misalign these jokes 90 degrees just for
example<00:04:30.230> so<00:04:30.620> if<00:04:30.860> a<00:04:30.980> customer<00:04:31.190> wasn't<00:04:31.640> aware

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
example so if a customer wasn't aware

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.210 
example so if a customer wasn't aware
that<00:04:32.450> this<00:04:32.990> was<00:04:33.170> a<00:04:33.230> problem<00:04:33.680> they<00:04:33.890> would<00:04:34.040> look

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
that this was a problem they would look

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.130 
that this was a problem they would look
at<00:04:34.310> this<00:04:34.430> dry<00:04:34.640> chef<00:04:34.910> installed<00:04:35.300> and<00:04:35.630> not

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
at this dry chef installed and not

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.420 
at this dry chef installed and not
realize<00:04:36.530> that<00:04:36.710> there's<00:04:36.890> actually<00:04:37.220> an<00:04:37.280> issue

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
realize that there's actually an issue

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.000 
realize that there's actually an issue
so<00:04:38.390> what<00:04:38.510> we're<00:04:38.720> gonna<00:04:38.780> do<00:04:39.080> is<00:04:39.380> run<00:04:39.800> this

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
so what we're gonna do is run this

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.440 
so what we're gonna do is run this
assembly<00:04:40.460> and<00:04:40.580> just<00:04:40.730> see<00:04:40.880> how<00:04:40.910> big<00:04:41.270> of<00:04:41.330> an

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
assembly and just see how big of an

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.120 
assembly and just see how big of an
issue<00:04:41.570> this<00:04:41.870> is<00:04:42.110> so<00:04:42.650> I'm<00:04:42.740> going<00:04:42.860> to<00:04:42.950> try<00:04:43.100> my

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
issue this is so I'm going to try my

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.280 
issue this is so I'm going to try my
side<00:04:43.580> it's<00:04:43.880> gonna<00:04:44.000> be<00:04:44.180> constant<00:04:44.660> like<00:04:44.780> usual

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
side it's gonna be constant like usual

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.290 
side it's gonna be constant like usual
on<00:04:45.350> the<00:04:45.410> drive<00:04:45.650> side<00:04:46.090> everything's<00:04:47.090> still

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
on the drive side everything's still

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.280 
on the drive side everything's still
good<00:04:47.540> and<00:04:47.690> I<00:04:47.720> check<00:04:47.960> it<00:04:48.080> driven<00:04:48.290> inside<00:04:48.650> oh<00:04:50.230> wow

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
good and I check it driven inside oh wow

was<00:04:54.950> quite<00:04:55.190> a<00:04:55.250> difference<00:04:55.760> right<00:04:55.940> there<00:04:57.670> right

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
was quite a difference right there right

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.310 
was quite a difference right there right
there<00:04:58.880> you<00:04:59.060> know<00:04:59.090> it's<00:04:59.390> out<00:04:59.510> of<00:04:59.540> fish<00:04:59.750> yes<00:05:00.110> so

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
there you know it's out of fish yes so

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.830 
there you know it's out of fish yes so
just<00:05:00.350> imagine<00:05:01.100> being<00:05:01.370> in<00:05:01.940> application<00:05:02.690> you

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
just imagine being in application you

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.990 
just imagine being in application you
know<00:05:02.960> if<00:05:03.290> the<00:05:03.560> customer<00:05:04.100> is<00:05:04.190> trying<00:05:04.370> to<00:05:04.700> drive

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
know if the customer is trying to drive

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.440 
know if the customer is trying to drive
any<00:05:05.750> type<00:05:06.140> of<00:05:06.700> driven<00:05:07.700> equipment<00:05:08.240> at<00:05:08.420> a

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
any type of driven equipment at a

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.020 
any type of driven equipment at a
consistent<00:05:08.870> speed<00:05:09.110> vibrations<00:05:10.100> and<00:05:10.700> things

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
consistent speed vibrations and things

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.340 
consistent speed vibrations and things
have<00:05:11.150> been<00:05:11.240> shaking<00:05:11.660> all<00:05:11.780> over<00:05:11.810> that<00:05:12.080> even

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
have been shaking all over that even

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.230 
have been shaking all over that even
where's<00:05:12.680> the<00:05:12.980> drive<00:05:13.190> chef<00:05:13.430> out<00:05:13.640> simply<00:05:14.090> out

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
where's the drive chef out simply out

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.970 
where's the drive chef out simply out
faster<00:05:14.780> because<00:05:15.110> the<00:05:15.230> whole<00:05:15.410> drive<00:05:15.740> chef

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
faster because the whole drive chef

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.980 
faster because the whole drive chef
experience<00:05:16.610> in<00:05:16.700> a<00:05:16.790> pulsating<00:05:17.240> torque<00:05:17.720> on<00:05:17.960> it

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
experience in a pulsating torque on it

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.690 
experience in a pulsating torque on it
okay<00:05:18.350> let's<00:05:18.560> put<00:05:18.710> it<00:05:18.830> back<00:05:18.980> to<00:05:19.190> normal<00:05:19.400> again

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
okay let's put it back to normal again

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.090 
okay let's put it back to normal again
and<00:05:19.910> let's<00:05:20.180> show<00:05:20.390> the<00:05:20.750> other<00:05:21.020> way<00:05:21.350> that<00:05:21.620> proper

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
and let's show the other way that proper

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.830 
and let's show the other way that proper
that<00:05:22.550> people<00:05:22.850> don't<00:05:23.060> realize<00:05:23.450> that<00:05:23.480> you<00:05:23.810> know

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
that people don't realize that you know

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.450 
that people don't realize that you know
things<00:05:24.140> are<00:05:24.320> going<00:05:24.530> wrong<00:05:24.710> and<00:05:24.950> we<00:05:25.160> can<00:05:25.310> do

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
things are going wrong and we can do

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.890 
things are going wrong and we can do
that<00:05:25.640> I<00:05:25.790> mean<00:05:26.060> we<00:05:26.180> could<00:05:26.360> actually<00:05:26.510> just<00:05:26.690> see

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
that I mean we could actually just see

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.900 
that I mean we could actually just see
in<00:05:27.170> you<00:05:27.560> know<00:05:27.680> by<00:05:27.800> the<00:05:27.860> arrows<00:05:28.250> as<00:05:28.490> he<00:05:28.700> said

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
in you know by the arrows as he said

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.430 
in you know by the arrows as he said
line<00:05:29.120> em<00:05:29.270> up<00:05:29.360> we<00:05:29.540> just<00:05:29.660> line<00:05:29.870> up<00:05:30.020> the<00:05:30.140> arrows

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
line em up we just line up the arrows

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.800 
line em up we just line up the arrows
yep<00:05:30.860> there's<00:05:31.160> just<00:05:31.730> line<00:05:31.970> them<00:05:32.150> up<00:05:32.300> and<00:05:32.660> now

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
yep there's just line them up and now

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.200 
yep there's just line them up and now
I'm<00:05:32.990> properly<00:05:33.410> phased<00:05:33.770> ready<00:05:34.190> to<00:05:34.310> go<00:05:34.460> I'm<00:05:34.940> just

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
I'm properly phased ready to go I'm just

checking okay he did it right thanks
good<00:05:40.820> now<00:05:41.390> we're<00:05:41.720> going<00:05:41.870> to<00:05:41.990> introduced<00:05:42.620> a<00:05:42.920> non

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
good now we're going to introduced a non

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.980 
good now we're going to introduced a non
parallel<00:05:43.610> flange<00:05:44.060> face<00:05:44.360> so<00:05:44.720> I'm<00:05:44.810> basically

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
parallel flange face so I'm basically

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.500 
parallel flange face so I'm basically
just<00:05:45.170> gonna<00:05:45.410> pivot<00:05:45.830> this<00:05:45.950> motor<00:05:46.250> a<00:05:46.550> couple<00:05:47.420> of

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
just gonna pivot this motor a couple of

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.340 
just gonna pivot this motor a couple of
degrees<00:05:47.630> they<00:05:48.350> introduced<00:05:48.830> a<00:05:49.130> non<00:05:49.670> parallel

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
degrees they introduced a non parallel

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.450 
degrees they introduced a non parallel
flange<00:05:51.350> face<00:05:51.590> but<00:05:51.800> that's<00:05:51.890> not<00:05:52.130> much<00:05:52.310> you

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
flange face but that's not much you

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.280 
flange face but that's not much you
didn't<00:05:52.640> move<00:05:52.730> it<00:05:52.850> that<00:05:52.940> no<00:05:53.090> not<00:05:53.330> much<00:05:53.540> okay<00:05:53.870> but

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
didn't move it that no not much okay but

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.080 
didn't move it that no not much okay but
you're<00:05:54.740> gonna<00:05:54.860> see<00:05:54.950> how<00:05:55.430> much<00:05:55.640> that<00:05:55.940> actually

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
you're gonna see how much that actually

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.880 
you're gonna see how much that actually
affects<00:05:56.660> the<00:05:56.810> operation<00:05:56.960> of<00:05:57.500> this<00:05:57.620> drive

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
affects the operation of this drive

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.380 
affects the operation of this drive
shaft<00:05:58.240> so<00:05:59.240> I'm<00:05:59.390> on<00:05:59.750> my<00:05:59.990> drive<00:06:00.260> side

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
shaft so I'm on my drive side

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.290 
shaft so I'm on my drive side
everything's<00:06:02.390> good<00:06:02.630> I<00:06:02.870> tried<00:06:03.170> on<00:06:03.320> your<00:06:03.470> side

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
everything's good I tried on your side

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.700 
everything's good I tried on your side
there's<00:06:06.290> that<00:06:06.500> noise<00:06:06.740> again<00:06:07.040> yep<00:06:07.990> that's<00:06:08.990> just

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
there's that noise again yep that's just

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.530 
there's that noise again yep that's just
from<00:06:09.920> having<00:06:10.070> nonparallel<00:06:10.700> flange<00:06:11.090> spacious

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.540 
from having nonparallel flange spacious

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.750 
from having nonparallel flange spacious
so<00:06:11.750> the<00:06:12.140> customer<00:06:12.530> should<00:06:12.680> be<00:06:12.800> aware<00:06:13.070> that

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
so the customer should be aware that

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.880 
so the customer should be aware that
having<00:06:14.300> those<00:06:14.420> flange<00:06:14.750> faces<00:06:14.960> parallel<00:06:15.590> and

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:15.890 
having those flange faces parallel and

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.580 
having those flange faces parallel and
their<00:06:16.850> correct<00:06:17.240> alignment<00:06:17.780> criteria<00:06:18.320> on

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
their correct alignment criteria on

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.770 
their correct alignment criteria on
actually<00:06:19.160> installing<00:06:19.670> this<00:06:19.790> is<00:06:20.060> very

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
actually installing this is very

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.330 
actually installing this is very
important<00:06:21.260> for<00:06:21.410> running<00:06:21.620> in<00:06:21.920> the<00:06:22.010> machine

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
important for running in the machine

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.340 
important for running in the machine
