00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.590
 Today I am very happy because I 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.150
 they told which 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.580
 and I liked it so much that I thought it's 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.580
 perfect for the class of 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.580
 so 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:34.250
 to enjoy the story that they 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:36.950
 I welcome miguelina the 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.760
 Mr. pencil was happy because he could 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.680
 dance and I could make lines one day at 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.260
 pencil came up with three lines 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.840
 same and realized that if I joined the 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.800
 tips formed a pretty figure 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:55.040
 elegant and pointy to this figure of 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.260
 three lines I call it triangle draw it 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.580
 it made him very happy so he got to 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.820
 dance 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:05.059
 suddenly thought and what happens if I draw a 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.310
 line more then I draw four lines 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.770
 equal and realized that he joined 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.650
 the tips formed another very figure 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.850
 safe and balanced to this figure of 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.560
 four equal lines I call it square 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.770
 drawing it made him very happy so 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.350
 danced a little more then he got to 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.690
 think again and if I draw four 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.860
 lines this time but I put two together 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.400
 above 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.860
 down he did it and realized that 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.160
 formed another very curious figure and 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.580
 harmonic to this figure of four lines 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:44.450
 I call it rhombus drawing it put it very 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:47.300
 so happy I dance a little more 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.690
 it soon occurred to him and if I draw four 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.690
 lines again but I do two long and 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:57.080
 two short so he did and he realized 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.930
 which was another very stretched figure and 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.040
 straight to this figure of four lines 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.840
 different I call it the rectangle 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.690
 drawing it made him very happy so 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.770
 I dance a lot more for having made a 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.320
 triangle a square a rhombus and a 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.540
 rectangle went to spin around the 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.330
 emotion realizing that by giving 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.989
 laps had drawn one more figure 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.860
 that looked very pretty and chubby to this 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.230
 figure that looks like a bubble I call it 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.319
 circle 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.940
 look at the roof of that house is a 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:39.180
 triangle that photo is a square look 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:43.170
 that kite is a diamond and look at those 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:46.280
 buildings are rectangles or tires 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:50.120
 of the cars are circles 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.900
 the apex was very happy because all the 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:59.020
 figures are wonderful and we all have 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:03.080
 a favorite figure of mine is the circle 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.860
 what is yours I hope for you in the next 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.700
 Program 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.700
 and now 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.440
 I am your friend 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.180
 not all of you 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.970
 s 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.960
 style you want 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.960
 to learn 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.610
 and 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.700
 and
