00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.580
 and we go with great news from one of 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.140
 my favorite titles is one of the 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.180
 votes that I am playing in these 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.040
 moments is disney infinity and is that 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.960
 there seems to be very good news for 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.610
 this new franchise for this new 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.170
 saga because I think it's going to 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.810
 turn into a whole saga of 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.880
 video games and products disney is 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.949
 extremely happy with the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.289
 commercial performance of Disney Infinite 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.410
 and you know that the game debuted the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.970
 Last month of August , Mr. Jay Rasulo 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.129
 finance chief of disney interactive 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.649
 has affirmed that the company is 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.630
 extremely happy are more than 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.210
 happy with the sales performance 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.340
 of this disney infinite and during your 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.750
 first weeks in the market attentive to 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.090
 his words say I do not want to take 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.190
 conclusions about something that is still in 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.930
 your first days but if you think of a 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.149
 truly good product that has 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.100
 came out recently and has some 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.860
 similarities with infinity as is 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.860
 skylanders our sales have been to 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.840
 the pair are on that scale maybe 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.000
 better the truth is that it is very important 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.190
 what he said in the skylanders 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.260
 effectively they are the main 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.510
 enemy the main competition of 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.430
 disney infinity and notice that they are already 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.790
 the pair and that what skylanders already takes 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.370
 several sagas and the case of we go on the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.740
 case of disney infinite and we are facing 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.720
 the first delivery is worth shaved too 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.420
 revealed that the average age of 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.820
 disney infinite players and is 13 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.220
 years but that there is a lot of adult public 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.430
 we are facing a very high percentage of 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.200
 public that exceeds 20 years and also 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.900
 good to say that the versions for 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.240
 PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were the 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.940
 platforms for which best sold 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.770
 to disney infinite and it was evidently 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.750
 normal to be sold more than 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.460
 example in wii but well that's for the 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.960
 number of consoles distributed not 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.550
 However, any version of disney 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.320
 finity is more than recommended and 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.000
 remember from here that the dolls 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.560
 they are valid for all versions and 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.630
 also remember that here in the channel 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.290
 you're going to have a lot of Disney infinite and 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.290
 shortly 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.390
 I love my family
