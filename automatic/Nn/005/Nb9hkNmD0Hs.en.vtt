00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
first question what's the status are you

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.410 
first question what's the status are you
amtrak<00:01:53.890> according<00:01:54.429> to<00:01:54.580> your<00:01:54.729> own<00:01:54.789> time<00:01:55.119> plan

and<00:01:55.690> when<00:01:56.470> can<00:01:56.920> we<00:01:57.310> expect<00:01:57.340> to<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.840> build<00:01:59.049> the

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
and when can we expect to to build the

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.749 
and when can we expect to to build the
first<00:01:59.380> saleable<00:02:00.069> production<00:02:00.490> current

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759

literature<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:02.789> you<00:02:03.789> have<00:02:04.000> asked<00:02:04.390> first<00:02:04.570> about

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
literature so you have asked first about

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.469 
literature so you have asked first about
the<00:02:05.109> timing<00:02:05.430> about<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.520> installation<00:02:07.090> status

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
the timing about the installation status

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.469 
the timing about the installation status
so<00:02:08.019> from<00:02:08.979> hardware<00:02:09.340> perspective<00:02:09.609> we<00:02:10.239> are<00:02:10.359> on

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
so from hardware perspective we are on

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.130 
so from hardware perspective we are on
time<00:02:10.750> everything<00:02:11.739> is<00:02:11.890> installed<00:02:12.250> and

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
time everything is installed and

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.340 
time everything is installed and

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
preparation phase so far I think the

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.940 
preparation phase so far I think the
biggest<00:02:51.700> challenge<00:02:52.690> is<00:02:52.930> still<00:02:53.410> in<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.709> front

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
biggest challenge is still in the front

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.030 
biggest challenge is still in the front
of<00:02:54.069> us<00:02:54.720> we<00:02:55.720> will<00:02:55.840> have<00:02:56.079> to<00:02:56.290> build<00:02:56.590> in<00:02:56.769> five

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
of us we will have to build in five

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.750 
of us we will have to build in five
weeks<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.819> cars<00:02:58.180> for<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.739> endcap<00:02:59.739> tests<00:03:00.160> they

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
weeks the cars for the endcap tests they

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.599 
weeks the cars for the endcap tests they
are<00:03:00.910> test<00:03:01.180> which<00:03:01.680> crush<00:03:02.680> test<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.310> uncap

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
are test which crush test the uncap

giving the rating for all car
manufacturer<00:03:09.489> so<00:03:10.299> why<00:03:10.750> it<00:03:10.810> is<00:03:11.019> a<00:03:11.049> challenge<00:03:11.560> we

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
manufacturer so why it is a challenge we

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.600 
manufacturer so why it is a challenge we
at<00:03:12.450> relatively<00:03:13.450> short<00:03:13.840> time<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.890> achieve<00:03:15.069> one

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
at relatively short time to achieve one

hundred<00:03:16.060> percent<00:03:16.349> wealth<00:03:17.459> quality<00:03:18.459> okay<00:03:18.849> so

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:19.689 
hundred percent wealth quality okay so

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:22.140 
hundred percent wealth quality okay so
we<00:03:19.930> had<00:03:20.079> to<00:03:20.290> reorganize<00:03:20.799> completely<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.909> work

the key item is a training which was

the key item is a training which was
performed<00:04:08.260> very<00:04:08.950> good<00:04:09.250> and<00:04:11.879> how<00:04:12.879> can<00:04:13.150> I<00:04:13.299> say

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
performed very good and how can I say

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.069 
performed very good and how can I say
that<00:04:14.019> is<00:04:14.170> good<00:04:14.579> already<00:04:15.579> the<00:04:15.730> first<00:04:16.030> car<00:04:16.359> built

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
that is good already the first car built

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.689 
that is good already the first car built
on<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.829> line<00:04:18.070> in<00:04:18.370> emerg<00:04:19.289> had<00:04:20.289> a<00:04:20.320> GC<00:04:21.099> aid<00:04:21.280> out

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:21.699 
on the line in emerg had a GC aid out

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.320 
on the line in emerg had a GC aid out
its<00:04:22.120> core<00:04:22.479> fifty<00:04:23.410> percent<00:04:24.340> below<00:04:24.820> the<00:04:25.060> target

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
its core fifty percent below the target

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.210 
its core fifty percent below the target
in<00:04:26.110> this<00:04:26.500> case<00:04:26.710> below<00:04:27.400> is<00:04:27.669> positive<00:04:29.010> very<00:04:30.010> good

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
in this case below is positive very good

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.760 
in this case below is positive very good
so<00:04:30.580> means<00:04:31.270> time<00:04:31.900> wise<00:04:32.110> we<00:04:32.320> seem<00:04:32.500> to<00:04:32.620> be<00:04:32.650> on

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
so means time wise we seem to be on

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.360 
so means time wise we seem to be on
track<00:04:33.070> quality<00:04:34.139> we<00:04:35.139> will<00:04:35.349> achieve<00:04:35.470> what<00:04:36.340> we

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
track quality we will achieve what we

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.700 
track quality we will achieve what we
are<00:04:36.610> used<00:04:36.789> to<00:04:36.910> receive<00:04:37.690> from<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:38.590> glacier
