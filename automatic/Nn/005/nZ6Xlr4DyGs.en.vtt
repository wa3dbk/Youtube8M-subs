can<00:02:39.900> see<00:02:40.050> some<00:02:40.440> of<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.560> stickers<00:02:40.800> are<00:02:41.040> really

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
can see some of the stickers are really

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.210 
can see some of the stickers are really
really<00:02:41.820> bright<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.480> I'm<00:02:43.350> gonna<00:02:43.530> compare<00:02:43.920> them

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
really bright and I'm gonna compare them

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.270 
really bright and I'm gonna compare them
to<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.610> stickers<00:02:44.940> on<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.150> dianne<00:02:45.540> cube<00:02:45.780> now<00:02:46.280> so

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
to the stickers on a dianne cube now so

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.610 
to the stickers on a dianne cube now so
obviously<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.360> white<00:02:48.540> will<00:02:49.019> be<00:02:49.050> pretty<00:02:49.500> much

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
obviously the white will be pretty much

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.990 
obviously the white will be pretty much
the<00:02:49.709> same<00:02:49.860> because<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.489> can't<00:02:50.700> really<00:02:50.880> have

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
the same because you can't really have

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.390 
the same because you can't really have
more<00:02:51.150> than<00:02:51.330> one<00:02:51.510> shade<00:02:51.780> of<00:02:51.810> white<00:02:52.220> well<00:02:53.220> then<00:02:53.340> I

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
more than one shade of white well then I

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.210 
more than one shade of white well then I
turn<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.760> orange<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.450> as<00:02:55.080> you<00:02:55.170> can<00:02:55.320> see<00:02:55.530> the

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
turn to orange and as you can see the

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.940 
turn to orange and as you can see the
orange<00:02:56.580> is<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.730> lot<00:02:56.970> brighter<00:02:57.390> on<00:02:57.870> my<00:02:58.320> camera<00:02:58.769> it

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
orange is a lot brighter on my camera it

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.210 
orange is a lot brighter on my camera it
turns<00:02:59.250> out<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.459> little<00:02:59.700> bit<00:02:59.940> reddish<00:03:00.800> but<00:03:01.800> it<00:03:02.040> is

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
turns out a little bit reddish but it is

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.840 
turns out a little bit reddish but it is
really<00:03:02.610> really<00:03:03.000> bright<00:03:03.300> orange<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:05.340> green<00:03:05.489> as

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
really really bright orange the green as

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.940 
really really bright orange the green as
you<00:03:05.970> can<00:03:06.120> see<00:03:06.300> it<00:03:06.360> is<00:03:06.540> very<00:03:06.570> very<00:03:07.230> fluorescent

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
you can see it is very very fluorescent

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.160 
you can see it is very very fluorescent
and<00:03:08.130> vibrant<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:08.820> I<00:03:09.150> really<00:03:09.600> like<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.930> shade

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
and vibrant and I really like the shade

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.840 
and vibrant and I really like the shade
of<00:03:10.320> green<00:03:10.500> on<00:03:10.739> this<00:03:10.980> puzzle<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.519> think<00:03:11.730> it's

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
of green on this puzzle I think it's

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.910 
of green on this puzzle I think it's
really<00:03:12.090> nice<00:03:12.360> and<00:03:13.019> it's<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.350> big<00:03:13.560> improvement

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
really nice and it's a big improvement

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.570 
really nice and it's a big improvement
to<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.400> diamond<00:03:14.760> colors<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:16.890> Reds<00:03:17.130> are<00:03:17.340> about

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
to the diamond colors the Reds are about

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.370 
to the diamond colors the Reds are about
the<00:03:17.760> same<00:03:18.030> because<00:03:18.450> this<00:03:18.690> is<00:03:18.840> only<00:03:19.019> a<00:03:19.170> half

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
the same because this is only a half

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.380 
the same because this is only a half
price<00:03:19.680> at<00:03:20.040> only<00:03:20.220> three<00:03:20.760> of<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:20.940> stickers<00:03:21.269> are

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
price at only three of the stickers are

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.990 
price at only three of the stickers are
bright<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:21.660> three<00:03:22.110> of<00:03:22.170> them<00:03:22.260> are<00:03:22.350> normal<00:03:23.000> so

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
bright and three of them are normal so

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.810 
bright and three of them are normal so
the<00:03:24.150> red<00:03:24.330> is<00:03:24.510> about<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.870> same<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.890> so<00:03:26.550> is<00:03:26.670> the

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
the red is about the same and so is the

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.390 
the red is about the same and so is the
blue<00:03:27.120> I'll<00:03:27.570> prefer<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.440> blue<00:03:28.709> to<00:03:29.040> be<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.220> bit

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
blue I'll prefer the blue to be a bit

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.470 
blue I'll prefer the blue to be a bit
more<00:03:29.580> vibrant<00:03:29.989> however<00:03:30.989> I<00:03:31.380> do<00:03:31.769> think<00:03:32.010> that<00:03:32.480> the

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
more vibrant however I do think that the

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.930 
more vibrant however I do think that the
sticker<00:03:33.720> set<00:03:33.959> is<00:03:34.110> very<00:03:34.200> nice<00:03:34.620> as<00:03:34.830> it<00:03:35.010> is<00:03:35.100> and

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
sticker set is very nice as it is and

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.570 
sticker set is very nice as it is and
then<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.180> yellow<00:03:36.570> is<00:03:37.080> very<00:03:37.590> nice<00:03:37.860> this<00:03:38.310> kind

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
then the yellow is very nice this kind

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.670 
then the yellow is very nice this kind
of<00:03:38.670> most<00:03:38.940> of<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.209> yellow<00:03:39.540> I<00:03:39.750> don't<00:03:40.110> like<00:03:40.290> it<00:03:40.530> at

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
of most of the yellow I don't like it at

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.160 
of most of the yellow I don't like it at
all<00:03:40.709> I'm<00:03:41.070> a<00:03:41.160> dying<00:03:41.400> cubes<00:03:41.730> but<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.510> really<00:03:42.989> do

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
all I'm a dying cubes but I really do

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.370 
all I'm a dying cubes but I really do
like<00:03:43.440> this<00:03:43.739> one

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
like this one

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.810 
like this one
so<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.530> stickers<00:03:46.860> are<00:03:46.980> very<00:03:47.190> nice<00:03:47.400> I<00:03:47.640> think

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
so the stickers are very nice I think

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.970 
so the stickers are very nice I think
the<00:03:47.940> vibrant<00:03:48.510> under<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.110> bright<00:03:49.350> colors<00:03:49.800> are

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
the vibrant under the bright colors are

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.220 
the vibrant under the bright colors are
the<00:03:50.070> yellow<00:03:50.400> green<00:03:50.640> and<00:03:50.700> orange<00:03:51.030> and<00:03:51.840> that's

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
the yellow green and orange and that's

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.130 
the yellow green and orange and that's
the<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:52.650> half<00:03:52.920> bright<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:53.670> then<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.810> normal

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
the the half bright and then the normal

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.200 
the the half bright and then the normal
colors<00:03:55.500> are<00:03:55.710> the<00:03:55.830> white<00:03:56.040> red<00:03:56.460> and<00:03:56.490> blue<00:03:56.820> and<00:03:57.060> I

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
colors are the white red and blue and I

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.030 
colors are the white red and blue and I
think<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:57.720> they<00:03:57.990> make<00:03:58.170> really<00:03:58.890> nice

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
think that they make really nice

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.230 
think that they make really nice
contrast<00:03:59.640> to<00:03:59.970> each<00:04:00.060> other<00:04:01.130> as<00:04:02.130> you<00:04:02.280> can<00:04:02.460> see<00:04:02.730> on

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
contrast to each other as you can see on

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.600 
contrast to each other as you can see on
the<00:04:03.660> white<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.110> yellow<00:04:04.260> you<00:04:05.070> can<00:04:05.220> tell<00:04:05.460> the

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
the white and yellow you can tell the

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.150 
the white and yellow you can tell the
difference<00:04:06.140> amazingly<00:04:07.140> because<00:04:07.650> it's<00:04:07.980> half

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
difference amazingly because it's half

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.900 
difference amazingly because it's half
bright<00:04:09.470> one<00:04:10.470> of<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.680> colors<00:04:11.010> will<00:04:11.340> be<00:04:11.460> darker

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
bright one of the colors will be darker

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.870 
bright one of the colors will be darker
and<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.480> other<00:04:12.630> half<00:04:12.810> will<00:04:13.290> be<00:04:13.320> brighter<00:04:13.880> so

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
and the other half will be brighter so

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.520 
and the other half will be brighter so
as<00:04:15.030> you<00:04:15.090> can<00:04:15.180> see<00:04:15.420> it's<00:04:15.570> very<00:04:15.600> easy<00:04:15.840> to<00:04:16.230> tell

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
as you can see it's very easy to tell

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.860 
as you can see it's very easy to tell
the<00:04:16.680> colors<00:04:16.920> apart<00:04:17.310> now<00:04:18.120> on<00:04:18.270> the<00:04:18.390> camera<00:04:18.720> on

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
the colors apart now on the camera on

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.630 
the colors apart now on the camera on
this<00:04:19.020> side<00:04:19.320> they<00:04:19.739> don't<00:04:19.950> look<00:04:20.160> that<00:04:20.220> different

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
this side they don't look that different

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.540 
this side they don't look that different
but<00:04:21.600> they<00:04:21.780> aren't<00:04:22.110> very<00:04:22.320> different<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:23.040> red

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
but they aren't very different the red

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.480 
but they aren't very different the red
is<00:04:23.820> a<00:04:23.940> lot<00:04:24.270> like<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.720> Dayan<00:04:25.110> red<00:04:25.350> and<00:04:26.310> the

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
is a lot like the Dayan red and the

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.100 
is a lot like the Dayan red and the
orange<00:04:26.640> is<00:04:26.970> very<00:04:27.270> bright

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
orange is very bright

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.950 
orange is very bright
if<00:04:28.860> I<00:04:29.010> was<00:04:29.160> to<00:04:29.310> put<00:04:29.490> this<00:04:30.060> quarter<00:04:30.330> this<00:04:30.690> one

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
if I was to put this quarter this one

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.750 
if I was to put this quarter this one
they<00:04:31.380> don't<00:04:31.710> seem<00:04:31.950> that<00:04:31.980> different<00:04:32.310> but<00:04:32.610> they

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
they don't seem that different but they

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.830 
they don't seem that different but they
are<00:04:32.940> very<00:04:33.330> very<00:04:33.480> different<00:04:35.510> so<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.630> clothes

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
are very very different so the clothes

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.570 
are very very different so the clothes
is<00:04:36.960> very<00:04:37.170> very<00:04:37.380> easy<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.800> tell<00:04:37.950> apart<00:04:38.010> and<00:04:38.520> I

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
is very very easy to tell apart and I

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.190 
is very very easy to tell apart and I
think<00:04:38.850> that<00:04:39.000> would<00:04:39.090> make<00:04:39.240> it<00:04:39.420> easier<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:39.810> solve

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
think that would make it easier to solve

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.060 
think that would make it easier to solve
them<00:04:40.380> in<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:40.560> dark

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
them in the dark

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.150 
them in the dark
and<00:04:41.780> I<00:04:42.780> just<00:04:43.050> really<00:04:43.410> like<00:04:43.590> this<00:04:43.770> color<00:04:44.010> scheme

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
and I just really like this color scheme

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.950 
and I just really like this color scheme
I<00:04:44.490> have<00:04:44.790> tried<00:04:45.060> to<00:04:45.090> be<00:04:45.210> solves<00:04:45.660> in<00:04:45.750> it<00:04:45.840> and<00:04:45.930> I

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
I have tried to be solves in it and I

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.130 
I have tried to be solves in it and I
have<00:04:46.200> slowed<00:04:46.530> down<00:04:46.740> its<00:04:46.980> a<00:04:47.310> little<00:04:47.880> bit<00:04:48.110> but<00:04:49.110> I

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
have slowed down its a little bit but I

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.230 
have slowed down its a little bit but I
guess<00:04:49.380> I<00:04:49.530> do<00:04:49.590> need<00:04:49.860> to<00:04:50.010> get<00:04:50.160> used<00:04:50.490> to<00:04:50.910> this

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
guess I do need to get used to this

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.000 
guess I do need to get used to this
color<00:04:51.540> scheme<00:04:51.660> and<00:04:52.080> I<00:04:52.170> think<00:04:52.410> I'll<00:04:52.560> be<00:04:52.650> using

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
color scheme and I think I'll be using

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.190 
color scheme and I think I'll be using
the<00:04:53.130> lingam<00:04:53.520> version<00:04:53.940> two<00:04:54.120> as<00:04:54.300> my<00:04:54.660> main<00:04:54.900> from

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
the lingam version two as my main from

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.520 
the lingam version two as my main from
now<00:04:55.380> on<00:04:56.300> so<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.420> stickers<00:04:57.750> are<00:04:57.930> very<00:04:58.230> very

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
now on so the stickers are very very

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.590 
now on so the stickers are very very
nice<00:04:58.650> -<00:04:58.860> a<00:04:58.890> very<00:04:59.100> cheap<00:04:59.490> as<00:04:59.730> well<00:04:59.970> I<00:05:00.000> think<00:05:00.300> they

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
nice - a very cheap as well I think they

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.770 
nice - a very cheap as well I think they
were<00:05:00.690> only<00:05:00.870> like<00:05:02.030> 125<00:05:03.030> or<00:05:03.330> something<00:05:03.690> I'm

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
were only like 125 or something I'm

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.200 
were only like 125 or something I'm
lighting<00:05:04.020> and<00:05:04.650> the<00:05:05.520> shipping<00:05:05.880> came<00:05:06.030> pretty

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
lighting and the shipping came pretty

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.800 
lighting and the shipping came pretty
fast

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
fast

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.440 
fast
I<00:05:06.900> was<00:05:07.080> on<00:05:07.170> holiday<00:05:07.380> so<00:05:07.680> I'm<00:05:08.190> you<00:05:09.060> know<00:05:09.210> I

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
I was on holiday so I'm you know I

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.880 
I was on holiday so I'm you know I
didn't<00:05:09.780> have<00:05:09.810> to<00:05:10.020> wait<00:05:10.200> they<00:05:10.500> were<00:05:10.590> just<00:05:10.770> here

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
didn't have to wait they were just here

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.790 
didn't have to wait they were just here
when<00:05:11.070> I<00:05:11.130> got<00:05:11.280> back<00:05:11.960> but<00:05:12.960> yeah<00:05:13.170> I<00:05:13.200> think<00:05:13.350> these

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
when I got back but yeah I think these

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.740 
when I got back but yeah I think these
are<00:05:13.860> really<00:05:14.340> really<00:05:14.460> great<00:05:14.700> stickers<00:05:15.240> they

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
are really really great stickers they

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.600 
are really really great stickers they
they<00:05:16.320> don't<00:05:16.470> seem<00:05:16.710> to<00:05:16.830> be<00:05:16.950> peeling<00:05:17.220> at<00:05:17.460> all

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
they don't seem to be peeling at all

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.440 
they don't seem to be peeling at all
either<00:05:18.500> any<00:05:19.500> bubbles<00:05:20.340> also<00:05:20.550> were<00:05:20.880> done<00:05:21.060> by<00:05:21.210> me

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
either any bubbles also were done by me

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.530 
either any bubbles also were done by me
when<00:05:21.690> I<00:05:21.720> was<00:05:21.900> sticking<00:05:22.140> them<00:05:22.500> so<00:05:22.740> it's<00:05:22.890> not

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
when I was sticking them so it's not

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.120 
when I was sticking them so it's not
it's<00:05:24.540> not<00:05:24.660> the<00:05:24.720> stickers<00:05:25.140> fault<00:05:25.410> that<00:05:25.770> there

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
it's not the stickers fault that there

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.670 
it's not the stickers fault that there
are<00:05:26.280> bubbles<00:05:26.430> and<00:05:26.990> I<00:05:27.990> just<00:05:28.200> think<00:05:28.350> the<00:05:28.410> shades

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
are bubbles and I just think the shades

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.230 
are bubbles and I just think the shades
are<00:05:28.890> really<00:05:29.250> really<00:05:29.490> nice<00:05:29.640> and<00:05:30.030> you<00:05:30.060> should
