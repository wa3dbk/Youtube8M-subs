00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.610
 a warm hello and welcome 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.170
 which becomes one or the other of you 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.420
 surely have already tried one 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.700
 video from his pc to the xbox ears 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.020
 to stream this is not so far synonymous 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.410
 problem because the xbox one supports 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.720
 dlna or so-called play to 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.420
 feature what in windows 7 and also 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.310
 Windows 8 is integrated works 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.590
 but then only with windows 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.000
 own formats or where the synonymous 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.430
 codecs from the outset with it 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.120
 are that there for example mp4 or 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.030
 wmv 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.059
 if it turns into a more exotic one 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.250
 format works as for example mkv then 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.840
 first you stand on the dry 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.460
 there is still the possibility ever 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.680
 I can tell you all 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.120
 now using a windows 8 tablet 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.960
 Of course, it works with everyone 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.670
 commercial device where your windows 8 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.770
 accordingly with you have on it 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.780
 then go first to homescreen evening 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.850
 you have to use the mobile edge application 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.680
 download link in the description 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.570
 with it the costs 399 but there are 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.830
 Also as a trial for seven days in 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.990
 full extent can have their right 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.780
 enjoy before you pay for it 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.619
 and yes then I would 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.350
 maybe a little bit anyway 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.210
 wait within the next few days 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.130
 short weeks should then also the vlc app 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.450
 appear when the stop then 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.070
 according to paid then 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.420
 Who comes out therefore maybe 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.100
 recommend the then but to gain 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.930
 we will now for the first time based 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.689
 this app we try would be times 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.540
 go out the short movie big buck bunny 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.710
 open on 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.110
 and now the course pointing to the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.220
 Device down opens the charms was go 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.340
 then enter again on equipment and 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.040
 choose the xbox com then use one 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.509
 moment the xbox video app opens on the 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.399
 xbox and should be the same 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.060
 start the streaming 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.329
 that is synonymous in full 1080p in full hd 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.520
 and in the beginning it will be building a 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.320
 bit on it then jumps to 1080p 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.960
 dts will not work from this app 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.369
 So that supports already one 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.390
 a little older or not at all anymore 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.180
 worked but does 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.350
 in that sense its purpose and quite nice 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.540
 as I said, it works 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.110
 very fast and you can see it without it 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.270
 problems if you do not feel like it 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.500
 on a windows 8 app or meat 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.240
 Windows 8 does not have and wants 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.560
 anyway with your windows 7 pc that 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.110
 realize whole 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.690
 then we can stop that too 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.640
 whole now so go back on 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.790
 the desktop and that's it 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.230
 so-called codec pack from shark da packe 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.090
 I was the description again 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.890
 that matters when you do that 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.450
 have installed then the bucket goes on 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.180
 the settings I have the shortcut 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.570
 set here and must first under 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.730
 go to the menu item mkv and look there 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.710
 that we also have selected support 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.030
 come extenders with it all then 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.670
 also works when done 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.320
 did you go on exit you have to 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.670
 as administrator run out if 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.160
 so that works and go now 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.010
 We first in the videos folder and we 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.340
 See you here again on the 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.260
 short film with a right click on it and 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.610
 then we see play to here too 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.650
 this is a little bit here, unfortunately 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.420
 blurred I just see the focus 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.800
 I do not want to be so 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.140
 not so bad 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.260
 So we're going to play to whom now, yes 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.960
 again the xbox off and he starts 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.840
 the little windows media player off and on 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.900
 we see that works too 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.400
 then she sends something else to say 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.450
 So you do not have to 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.040
 separately or the xbox one with your pc 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.450
 link or manually connect the 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.580
 goes automatically if such in the same 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.240
 network is both wlan and 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.860
 ethernet and then goes right 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.550
 easy display to feature works 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:56.670
 then also with music or pictures altogether 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.400
 easy and maybe you should 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.170
 Try it if you have one 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.200
 corresponding computer I have hope 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.240
 you like it all and we hear and 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.640
 See you next time 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.640
 adios amigos and bye
