00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.040
 when natuzzi spa asked me to 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.110
 take photographs for the markets 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.140
 Americans I told myself I have to give 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.060
 originated something 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.369
 the task was the canonical one 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.500
 of the setting with sofas and actors 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.680
 sitting but I wanted to develop it 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.930
 interpreting the customer's vision e 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.879
 the image that immediately began Easter 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.610
 natuzzi sent me is that of a 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.280
 gladiator his presence unleashes 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.199
 an incredible energy 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.120
 during the briefing he told me 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:52.920
 would like the actors not to be 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.559
 sitting on the sofa but in the sofa from 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.930
 these words was born close up I wanted 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.600
 add emotion sharing and 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.969
 cold life lived and to do so I had 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.309
 need to be very tight 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.310
 being on the actors I had to 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.440
 capturing the spontaneous vibration the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.410
 sharing of pleasant time and the 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.720
 sofa a comfortable Italian sofa is me 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.759
 immediately seemed place where the core 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.990
 family can find complicity 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.580
 contact 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.590
 I want to tell those who are couch 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.869
 natuzzi editions can happen 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.759
 fall asleep in good company of 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.340
 rediscover the breath of a child or the 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.479
 heart beat and is at the heart 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.479
 what a photo 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.310
 I think it is a photographic technique 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.880
 exasperated remains an indisputable 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.860
 style exercise 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.770
 personally I prefer to do myself 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.560
 to carry and in my turn to carry 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.840
 towards emotional involvement 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.420
 because at that moment that image 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.330
 must tell me something has been 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.770
 surprising to manage small actors 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.540
 very good 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.520
 I had to hold their own up 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.650
 concentration 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.260
 basically I worked on two levels 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.440
 of touch that of the mother contact 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:46.060
 grandmother and grandchild son welcoming 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:48.100
 of the actors in the sofa the light and had to 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.980
 help me tell the product the 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.610
 quality finishes and thickness 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.760
 of the skin 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.890
 they had to have the right emphasis I had 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.200
 need a grazing light that 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.450
 he drew the excellent workmanship 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.209
 of the product in perfect symbiosis with 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.220
 the internship of the actors close up a 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.470
 five days of filming and tens of 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.340
 professionals involved for a purpose 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.340
 common to exalt the beautiful through 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.340
 emotion
