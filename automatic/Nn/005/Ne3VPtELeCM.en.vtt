hi I'm Kathleen Samms with red heart

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.580 
hi I'm Kathleen Samms with red heart
yarns<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:17.609> want<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.170> give<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.320> few<00:00:19.560> tips

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
yarns and I want to give you a few tips

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.689 
yarns and I want to give you a few tips
on<00:00:20.010> working<00:00:20.520> with<00:00:20.550> double<00:00:21.150> pointed<00:00:21.660> needles

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
on working with double pointed needles

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.750 
on working with double pointed needles
generally<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:23.939> they<00:00:24.630> come<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:24.900> sets<00:00:25.500> of

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
generally this is they come in sets of

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.230 
generally this is they come in sets of
four<00:00:26.760> five<00:00:27.269> or<00:00:27.689> six<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.189> can<00:00:29.340> see<00:00:29.580> there's

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
four five or six and you can see there's

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.060 
four five or six and you can see there's
a<00:00:30.330> point<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.840> each<00:00:31.080> end<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.619> it's<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.859> way<00:00:32.040> of

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
a point on each end and it's a way of

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.750 
a point on each end and it's a way of
working<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.940> round<00:00:33.120> with<00:00:34.190> few<00:00:35.190> stitches

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
working in the round with few stitches

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.720 
working in the round with few stitches
and<00:00:36.590> normally<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.890> how<00:00:38.010> socks<00:00:38.340> are<00:00:38.579> work

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
and normally this is how socks are work

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.000 
and normally this is how socks are work
now<00:00:39.270> what<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.570> need<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.780> do<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.350> divide<00:00:40.770> your

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
now what you need to do is divide your

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.389 
now what you need to do is divide your
stitches<00:00:41.340> evenly<00:00:41.960> among<00:00:42.960> three<00:00:43.469> needles<00:00:44.100> and

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
stitches evenly among three needles and

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.490 
stitches evenly among three needles and
then<00:00:44.520> you're<00:00:44.640> going<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.000> use<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.210> fourth<00:00:45.690> one<00:00:45.989> to

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
then you're going to use a fourth one to

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.740 
then you're going to use a fourth one to
knit<00:00:46.710> with<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.670> say<00:00:47.850> sometimes<00:00:48.120> there's<00:00:48.660> a

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
knit with like I say sometimes there's a

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.420 
knit with like I say sometimes there's a
fifth<00:00:49.020> one<00:00:49.200> depends<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.710> how<00:00:49.950> many<00:00:50.160> stitches

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
fifth one depends on how many stitches

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.279 
fifth one depends on how many stitches
you<00:00:50.760> actually<00:00:51.090> have<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.480> work<00:00:51.660> with<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.199> how

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
you actually have to work with and how

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.619 
you actually have to work with and how
you<00:00:52.350> want<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.710> divide<00:00:52.949> them<00:00:53.190> up<00:00:53.390> so<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.420> can

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
you want to divide them up so you can

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.529 
you want to divide them up so you can
see<00:00:54.840> here<00:00:55.079> how<00:00:55.230> we<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:56.360> nice<00:00:57.360> little

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
see here how we have a nice little

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.650 
see here how we have a nice little
triangle<00:00:58.070> keep<00:00:59.070> your<00:00:59.309> stitches<00:00:59.660> straight

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
triangle keep your stitches straight

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.200 
triangle keep your stitches straight
don't<00:01:01.020> twist<00:01:01.350> them<00:01:01.649> make<00:01:02.489> sure<00:01:02.520> everything's

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
don't twist them make sure everything's

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.920 
don't twist them make sure everything's
even<00:01:03.480> we're<00:01:03.989> going<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.320> pick<00:01:04.559> them<00:01:04.769> up<00:01:05.930> take

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
even we're going to pick them up take

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.830 
even we're going to pick them up take
your<00:01:07.170> needle<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:08.119> this<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> little<00:01:09.630> awkward

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
your needle and this is a little awkward

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.750 
your needle and this is a little awkward
until<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.560> get<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.830> hang<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.340> especially

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
until you get the hang of it especially

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.990 
until you get the hang of it especially
doing<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.420> first<00:01:12.659> round<00:01:13.610> we're<00:01:14.610> going<00:01:14.790> to

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
doing the first round we're going to

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.880 
doing the first round we're going to
knit<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:16.200> first<00:01:16.500> stitch<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:18.210> then<00:01:18.500> I<00:01:19.500> pull

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
knit that first stitch and then I pull

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.920 
knit that first stitch and then I pull
that<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.460> little<00:01:20.700> bit<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.390> tightens<00:01:21.780> it

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
that just a little bit so it tightens it

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.690 
that just a little bit so it tightens it
up<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.409> not<00:01:22.560> going<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.860> ladder<00:01:23.130> on<00:01:23.460> you

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
up and it's not going to ladder on you

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.190 
up and it's not going to ladder on you
and<00:01:23.939> then<00:01:24.720> we're<00:01:24.900> going<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:26.180> knit<00:01:27.180> across

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.620 

these<00:01:31.200> next<00:01:31.530> couple<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.920> stitches<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.820> this

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
these next couple of stitches and this

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.310 
these next couple of stitches and this
is<00:01:33.869> generally<00:01:34.560> done<00:01:35.780> from<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.900> front<00:01:37.140> side

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
is generally done from the front side

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.530 
is generally done from the front side
also<00:01:37.650> you're<00:01:38.520> not<00:01:38.670> going<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.000> be<00:01:39.119> flipping

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
also you're not going to be flipping

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.749 
also you're not going to be flipping
your<00:01:39.659> work<00:01:39.869> back<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.350> forth<00:01:40.439> now<00:01:41.220> see<00:01:41.400> as<00:01:41.549> you

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
your work back and forth now see as you

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.120 
your work back and forth now see as you
drop<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.090> needle<00:01:42.450> then<00:01:43.350> you're<00:01:43.560> going<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.890> slide

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
drop a needle then you're going to slide

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.370 
drop a needle then you're going to slide
your<00:01:44.159> stitches<00:01:44.729> up<00:01:45.920> use<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.220> needle<00:01:48.000> and

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
your stitches up use that needle and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.980 
your stitches up use that needle and
start<00:01:49.380> knitting<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.100> next<00:01:50.250> set<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.579> stitches

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
start knitting the next set of stitches

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.960 
start knitting the next set of stitches
we'll<00:01:51.990> work<00:01:52.200> across<00:01:52.500> these

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.280 

and<00:01:56.450> as<00:01:56.660> fact<00:01:57.020> you<00:01:57.170> get<00:01:57.440> a<00:01:58.330> few<00:01:59.330> rounds<00:01:59.600> on<00:02:00.020> here

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
and as fact you get a few rounds on here

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.590 
and as fact you get a few rounds on here
it<00:02:00.440> does<00:02:00.680> get<00:02:01.070> a<00:02:01.100> little<00:02:01.310> bit<00:02:01.460> easier<00:02:02.030> now<00:02:02.570> that

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
it does get a little bit easier now that

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.870 
it does get a little bit easier now that
it's<00:02:02.960> actually<00:02:03.410> joined<00:02:03.800> see<00:02:04.340> now<00:02:04.490> we<00:02:04.550> have<00:02:04.760> an

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
it's actually joined see now we have an

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.730 
it's actually joined see now we have an
empty<00:02:05.000> needle<00:02:05.390> and<00:02:06.140> then<00:02:06.290> we'll<00:02:06.440> come<00:02:06.590> over

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
empty needle and then we'll come over

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.600 
empty needle and then we'll come over
here<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.840> we're<00:02:09.080> going<00:02:09.290> to<00:02:09.380> knit<00:02:09.830> off<00:02:12.610> the

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
here and we're going to knit off the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.070 
here and we're going to knit off the
last<00:02:15.220> set<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.550> this<00:02:16.820> will<00:02:17.060> be<00:02:17.240> a<00:02:17.510> complete

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
last set and this will be a complete

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.560 
last set and this will be a complete
round<00:02:18.320> you<00:02:19.310> may<00:02:19.490> want<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.730> push<00:02:20.000> this<00:02:20.270> down

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
round you may want to push this down

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.000 
round you may want to push this down
just<00:02:20.600> a<00:02:21.050> little<00:02:21.080> there<00:02:21.470> we<00:02:21.590> go

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
just a little there we go

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.820 
just a little there we go
now<00:02:22.940> I've<00:02:23.120> put<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:23.480> marker<00:02:24.020> in<00:02:24.200> that<00:02:24.560> first

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
now I've put a marker in that first

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.980 
now I've put a marker in that first
stitch<00:02:25.190> so<00:02:25.580> I<00:02:25.610> know<00:02:25.760> where<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:27.440> beginning<00:02:28.310> and

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
stitch so I know where the beginning and

bit<00:03:42.230> on<00:03:42.410> your<00:03:42.530> first<00:03:42.800> stitch<00:03:43.040> so<00:03:43.100> you<00:03:43.400> don't

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
bit on your first stitch so you don't

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.970 
bit on your first stitch so you don't
have<00:03:43.850> ladders<00:03:44.120> between<00:03:44.830> changing<00:03:45.830> of<00:03:45.950> your

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.030 

and<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:54.120> takes<00:03:54.330> a<00:03:54.480> little<00:03:54.630> bit<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:54.930> time<00:03:55.680> to<00:03:55.920> get

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
and it takes a little bit of time to get

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.730 
and it takes a little bit of time to get
the<00:03:56.220> hang<00:03:56.400> of<00:03:56.550> working<00:03:57.440> with<00:03:58.440> all<00:03:58.590> these

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
the hang of working with all these

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.380 
the hang of working with all these
needles<00:03:59.100> going<00:03:59.250> around<00:03:59.580> and<00:03:59.730> it<00:03:59.820> is<00:03:59.850> easier

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
needles going around and it is easier

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.790 
needles going around and it is easier
when<00:04:00.570> you're<00:04:00.750> actually<00:04:00.930> working<00:04:01.170> with<00:04:01.560> more

when you're actually working with more

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.860 
when you're actually working with more
stitches<00:04:02.220> on<00:04:02.370> there<00:04:02.580> just<00:04:03.330> a<00:04:03.450> few<00:04:03.480> of<00:04:03.780> the

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
these are done in double points also we

these are done in double points also we
have<00:04:11.640> hats<00:04:12.060> this<00:04:12.510> is<00:04:12.660> another<00:04:12.930> way<00:04:13.140> of<00:04:13.410> working

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
have hats this is another way of working

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.460 
have hats this is another way of working
in<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.010> round<00:04:14.220> without<00:04:14.520> any<00:04:14.910> seams<00:04:15.300> and<00:04:15.630> as

in the round without any seams and as

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.490 
in the round without any seams and as
you<00:04:16.650> decrease<00:04:17.070> down<00:04:17.690> that<00:04:18.690> way<00:04:18.840> you<00:04:18.900> can<00:04:19.170> you

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
you decrease down that way you can you

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.130 
you decrease down that way you can you
can<00:04:19.680> actually<00:04:19.830> decrease<00:04:20.459> down<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:21.510> just<00:04:21.840> a<00:04:21.989> few

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
can actually decrease down to just a few

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.990 
can actually decrease down to just a few
stitches<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:22.830> here's<00:04:23.250> another<00:04:23.400> hat<00:04:23.820> that's

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
stitches and here's another hat that's

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:39.270 
stitches and here's another hat that's
work<00:04:24.210> in<00:04:24.390> the<00:04:24.510> round<00:04:24.660> also<00:04:25.200> on<00:04:25.440> double<00:04:25.770> points
