00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
this is a video I've been wanting to

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.290 
this is a video I've been wanting to
make<00:00:09.929> for<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.260> while<00:00:10.469> in<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.490> past<00:00:11.730> I've<00:00:12.030> been

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
make for a while in the past I've been

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.120 
make for a while in the past I've been
pretty<00:00:12.630> critical<00:00:13.019> of<00:00:13.469> Sony<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.070> Microsoft

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
pretty critical of Sony and Microsoft

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.400 
pretty critical of Sony and Microsoft
when<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.059> comes<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.450> their<00:00:15.570> stance<00:00:15.900> on<00:00:16.109> indie

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
when it comes to their stance on indie

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.920 
when it comes to their stance on indie
games<00:00:16.619> more<00:00:16.980> sony<00:00:17.369> than<00:00:17.789> than<00:00:18.240> Microsoft

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
games more sony than than Microsoft

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.900 
games more sony than than Microsoft
because<00:00:19.320> at<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.920> beginning<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.460> seemed<00:00:20.699> like

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
because at the beginning it seemed like

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.090 
because at the beginning it seemed like
Sony<00:00:21.210> was<00:00:21.840> sort<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.199> opening<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.890> floodgates

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
Sony was sort of opening the floodgates

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.630 
Sony was sort of opening the floodgates
letting<00:00:23.850> any<00:00:24.210> indie<00:00:24.869> come<00:00:25.619> on<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.010> console

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
letting any indie come on to the console

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.150 
letting any indie come on to the console
and<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.210> think<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.480> did<00:00:27.660> kind<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:28.050> trash<00:00:28.410> Sony<00:00:28.830> for

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
and I think I did kind of trash Sony for

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.999 
and I think I did kind of trash Sony for
it<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.550> think<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:30.119> my<00:00:30.900> stance<00:00:31.349> on<00:00:31.529> indys

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
it and I think that my stance on indys

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.490 
it and I think that my stance on indys
is<00:00:32.250> sort<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.820> changing<00:00:33.420> being<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.050> console

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
is sort of changing being a console

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.740 
is sort of changing being a console
gamer<00:00:34.739> mostly<00:00:35.280> my<00:00:35.460> whole<00:00:35.670> life<00:00:35.910> up<00:00:36.180> until<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
gamer mostly my whole life up until the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.830 
gamer mostly my whole life up until the
end<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:37.050> 2013<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.420> really<00:00:39.420> didn't<00:00:39.690> appreciate

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
end of 2013 I really didn't appreciate

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.170 
end of 2013 I really didn't appreciate
Indies<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:41.070> guess<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.579> thought<00:00:41.790> what<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> lot<00:00:42.149> of

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
Indies I guess I thought what a lot of

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.910 
Indies I guess I thought what a lot of
people<00:00:42.300> thought<00:00:42.660> their<00:00:42.930> their<00:00:43.230> crappy<00:00:43.530> games

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
people thought their their crappy games

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.889 
people thought their their crappy games
they're<00:00:44.250> not<00:00:44.430> big<00:00:44.730> budget<00:00:45.270> they're<00:00:45.480> not<00:00:45.629> made

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
they're not big budget they're not made

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.670 
they're not big budget they're not made
by<00:00:45.930> huge<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:47.129> know<00:00:47.160> development<00:00:48.120> studios<00:00:48.870> so

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
by huge you know development studios so

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.069 
by huge you know development studios so
they<00:00:49.980> can't<00:00:50.250> be<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.399> great<00:00:50.700> right<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.930> was

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
they can't be that great right and I was

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.049 
they can't be that great right and I was
happy<00:00:52.410> believing<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.579> was<00:00:53.730> happy

more indie games and exploring new indie

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.330 
more indie games and exploring new indie
games<00:04:02.670> I'm<00:04:02.940> really<00:04:03.570> on<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:04.010> survival<00:04:05.010> kick

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
games I'm really on a survival kick

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.460 
games I'm really on a survival kick
right<00:04:05.610> now<00:04:05.640> I<00:04:05.790> love<00:04:06.209> a<00:04:06.240> lot<00:04:06.540> of<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.780> survival

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
right now I love a lot of the survival

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.860 
right now I love a lot of the survival
games<00:04:07.740> and<00:04:08.100> a<00:04:08.490> lot<00:04:08.640> of<00:04:08.790> them<00:04:08.850> are<00:04:09.030> Andy<00:04:09.390> titles

games and a lot of them are Andy titles

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.870 
games and a lot of them are Andy titles
so<00:04:10.350> I<00:04:10.380> think<00:04:10.470> it's<00:04:10.740> fair<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:10.950> say<00:04:11.100> that<00:04:11.280> pc

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
so I think it's fair to say that pc

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.699 
so I think it's fair to say that pc
gaming<00:04:12.150> is<00:04:12.420> kind<00:04:12.750> of<00:04:12.900> opening<00:04:13.350> my<00:04:13.380> eyes<00:04:13.500> to

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
over because they have this

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.020 
over because they have this
this<00:04:27.360> pre<00:04:27.930> notion<00:04:28.590> this<00:04:28.830> this<00:04:29.370> thought<00:04:29.700> that's

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
this pre notion this this thought that's

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.570

minds that all Indies are garbage and I

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.370 
minds that all Indies are garbage and I

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
triple-a companies who have great ideas

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.230 
triple-a companies who have great ideas
for<00:04:49.530> games<00:04:49.710> and<00:04:50.100> don't<00:04:50.610> want<00:04:50.820> to<00:04:50.910> work<00:04:51.060> for

these triple-a companies anymore but
they<00:04:53.400> have<00:04:53.610> no<00:04:53.820> way<00:04:53.970> out<00:04:54.000> they<00:04:54.480> have<00:04:54.660> no<00:04:54.900> way

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
they have no way out they have no way

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.350

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
own game so I think Kickstarter and in

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.300 
own game so I think Kickstarter and in
