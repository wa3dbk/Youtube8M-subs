00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.209 
Turing through Australia's Alpine area
is<00:00:08.260> spectacular<00:00:09.290> but<00:00:09.620> if<00:00:09.710> you're<00:00:09.860> travelling

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
we've stopped our boys here at the base

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.150 
we've stopped our boys here at the base
of<00:00:26.510> Mount<00:00:26.840> Hotham<00:00:27.050> they're<00:00:27.650> gonna<00:00:27.769> show<00:00:28.010> us

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
of Mount Hotham they're gonna show us

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.410 
of Mount Hotham they're gonna show us
how<00:00:28.189> it's<00:00:28.490> done<00:00:28.580> the<00:00:28.910> right<00:00:29.090> way

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
that you get the right ones for the tire

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.440 
that you get the right ones for the tire
it's<00:00:40.190> all<00:00:40.280> about<00:00:40.430> tire<00:00:40.700> size<00:00:41.000> about<00:00:41.239> tire

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
it's all about tire size about tire

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.650 
it's all about tire size about tire
sizes<00:00:41.899> and<00:00:42.680> then<00:00:43.309> the<00:00:43.399> fitting<00:00:43.670> just<00:00:44.329> cuz<00:00:44.540> it's

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
diamond ones here they've got extra

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.310 
diamond ones here they've got extra
superior<00:00:55.700> grip<00:00:55.850> and<00:00:56.120> they<00:00:56.750> just<00:00:56.899> work<00:00:57.110> a<00:00:57.199> lot

chain forward and do them up at this

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:54.359 
chain forward and do them up at this
point

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
point

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.069

red to red you want this sitting nice

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.210 
red to red you want this sitting nice
and<00:01:57.229> even<00:01:57.380> range<00:01:57.560> of<00:01:57.680> rim<00:01:57.829> so<00:01:57.979> you<00:01:58.070> want<00:01:58.189> a

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
and even range of rim so you want a

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.609 
and even range of rim so you want a
little<00:01:58.340> bit<00:01:58.430> two-thirds<00:01:58.970> of<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.149> way<00:01:59.270> up<00:01:59.619> push

sure open up the little ratchet in

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.860 
sure open up the little ratchet in
through<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.100> side<00:02:12.920> headlock<00:02:13.920> sin<00:02:14.450> in<00:02:15.450> behind

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
through the side headlock sin in behind

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.979 
through the side headlock sin in behind
the<00:02:15.959> tensioners<00:02:17.569> and<00:02:18.569> up

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
the tensioners and up

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.229 
the tensioners and up
so<00:02:19.709> really<00:02:19.980> it's<00:02:20.250> quite<00:02:20.400> it's<00:02:20.700> quite<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.940> simple

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
so really it's quite it's quite a simple

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.090 
so really it's quite it's quite a simple
taste<00:02:21.660> not<00:02:21.810> too<00:02:21.930> bad<00:02:22.110> just<00:02:22.410> want<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:22.830> do<00:02:23.010> it

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
taste not too bad just want to do it

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.400 
taste not too bad just want to do it
tangle<00:02:23.430> free<00:02:23.459> so<00:02:23.819> she<00:02:24.300> had<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.540> tangle<00:02:24.930> it's

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
tangle free so she had a tangle it's

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.309 
tangle free so she had a tangle it's
better<00:02:25.590> off<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.709> start<00:02:25.980> again<00:02:26.220> it's<00:02:26.640> very<00:02:26.940> easy

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
better off to start again it's very easy

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.570 
better off to start again it's very easy
at<00:02:28.319> this<00:02:28.500> point<00:02:28.739> you<00:02:28.860> want<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.040> drive<00:02:29.250> forward

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
at this point you want to drive forward

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.340 
at this point you want to drive forward
about<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.760> metre<00:02:30.000> or<00:02:30.060> so<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.569> just<00:02:30.600> check<00:02:31.230> the

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
about a metre or so and just check the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.430 
about a metre or so and just check the
tension<00:02:31.709> on<00:02:31.800> them<00:02:32.690> pull<00:02:33.690> on<00:02:33.810> this<00:02:33.930> tensioning

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
tension on them pull on this tensioning

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.800 
tension on them pull on this tensioning
chain<00:02:34.680> adjuster<00:02:35.420> don't<00:02:36.420> know<00:02:36.480> how<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.690> get

chain adjuster don't know how to get

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
chain adjuster don't know how to get
them<00:02:36.930> off<00:02:36.959> there<00:02:38.209> reckon<00:02:39.209> you<00:02:39.330> soon<00:02:39.680> you<00:02:40.680> gotta

different colors hook on different
chains<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.400> one's<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.730> red<00:02:44.880> hook<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.720> want<00:02:45.810> to

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
chains this one's a red hook you want to

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.030 
chains this one's a red hook you want to
get<00:02:46.019> this<00:02:46.110> somewhere<00:02:46.500> near<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.709> top<00:02:46.739> of<00:02:46.890> your

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
get this somewhere near the top of your

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.680 
get this somewhere near the top of your
tire<00:02:47.250> this<00:02:47.850> is<00:02:47.970> how<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.150> find<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.540> joint

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
tire this is how you find the joint

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.080 
tire this is how you find the joint
again<00:02:48.870> at<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.080> back<00:02:49.430> if<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.489> don't<00:02:50.940> know

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
again at the back if you don't know

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.449 
again at the back if you don't know
where<00:02:51.269> that<00:02:51.300> joint<00:02:51.569> is<00:02:51.860> undo<00:02:52.860> them<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.190> that's

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
where that joint is undo them and that's

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.039 
where that joint is undo them and that's
a<00:02:53.550> common<00:02:53.819> problem<00:02:53.970> so<00:02:54.269> people<00:02:54.630> reprimand

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
a common problem so people reprimand

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.530 
a common problem so people reprimand
their<00:02:55.140> axles<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:56.220> have<00:02:56.430> trouble<00:02:56.730> so<00:02:57.269> you<00:02:57.299> look

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
their axles and have trouble so you look

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.210 
their axles and have trouble so you look
for<00:02:57.569> that<00:02:57.750> join<00:02:57.989> get<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:58.680> somewhere<00:02:58.980> near<00:02:59.040> the

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
for that join get it somewhere near the

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.770 
for that join get it somewhere near the
top<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.400> your<00:02:59.489> tire<00:02:59.730> again<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.209> then<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.630> makes

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
top of your tire again and then it makes

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.930 
top of your tire again and then it makes
it<00:03:00.870> easy<00:03:01.019> for<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.380> to<00:03:01.410> undo<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:02.069> reach<00:03:02.640> him<00:03:02.819> to
