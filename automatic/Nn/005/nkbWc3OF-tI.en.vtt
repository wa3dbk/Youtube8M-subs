character generation and there's a bunch
of<00:00:47.460> different<00:00:47.579> races<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.300> can<00:00:48.480> play<00:00:48.690> orks

undead humans elves all that kind of

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.080 
undead humans elves all that kind of
stuff<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:53.129> can<00:00:53.160> fill<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.610> with<00:00:53.730> some<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
stuff you can fill it with some of the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.580 
stuff you can fill it with some of the
main<00:00:54.210> characteristics<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.079> them<00:00:55.230> how<00:00:55.440> their

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
main characteristics of them how their

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.260 
main characteristics of them how their
hair<00:00:55.739> kind<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.039> looks<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.730> little<00:00:57.210> bit

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
hair kind of looks and a little bit

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.029 
hair kind of looks and a little bit
about<00:00:57.420> their<00:00:57.570> face<00:00:57.840> but<00:00:58.440> remember<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:58.980> is

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
about their face but remember this is

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.950 
about their face but remember this is
sort<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.670> little<00:01:00.149> bit<00:01:00.270> like<00:01:00.420> Minecraft

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
sort of a little bit like Minecraft

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.510 
sort of a little bit like Minecraft
except<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.680> don't<00:01:01.739> have<00:01:01.890> just<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.100> plain

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
except you don't have just a plain

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.399 
except you don't have just a plain
square<00:01:02.879> block<00:01:03.180> for<00:01:03.390> faces<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.809> lot<00:01:03.899> more<00:01:04.080> detail

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
square block for faces a lot more detail

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.789 
square block for faces a lot more detail
involved<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.280> why<00:01:05.549> voxels<00:01:06.350> voxels<00:01:07.350> basically

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
involved so why voxels voxels basically

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.800 
involved so why voxels voxels basically
are<00:01:07.979> an<00:01:08.220> alternative<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.330> normal

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
are an alternative to the normal

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.969 
are an alternative to the normal
vertices<00:01:10.530> which<00:01:10.799> if<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.369> have<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.840> cube<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.140> a

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
vertices which if you have a cube in a

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.859 
vertices which if you have a cube in a
world<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.670> vertices<00:01:14.970> are<00:01:15.240> pretty<00:01:15.420> obvious

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
world the vertices are pretty obvious

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.630 
world the vertices are pretty obvious
because<00:01:16.320> there's<00:01:16.650> one<00:01:16.799> on<00:01:16.890> each<00:01:17.100> corner<00:01:17.400> and

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
because there's one on each corner and

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.980 
because there's one on each corner and
there's<00:01:17.759> certain<00:01:18.060> distance<00:01:18.390> apart<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.810> blah

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
there's certain distance apart in blah

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.539 
there's certain distance apart in blah
blah<00:01:19.170> blah<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.560> then<00:01:19.920> they<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.400> put<00:01:20.520> a

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
blah blah and then they can put a

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.190 
blah blah and then they can put a
texture<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.180> surface<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.840> each<00:01:21.960> one<00:01:22.170> of

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
texture on the surface of each one of

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.679 
texture on the surface of each one of
those<00:01:22.409> planes<00:01:22.799> voxels<00:01:23.700> allow<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.090> computer

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
those planes voxels allow the computer

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.870 
those planes voxels allow the computer
to<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:25.110> render<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> particular<00:01:25.920> block<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
to just render a particular block with a

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.749 
to just render a particular block with a
set<00:01:27.479> color<00:01:27.930> scheme<00:01:28.320> on<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.680> now<00:01:28.920> while<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.250> is

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
set color scheme on it now while that is

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.060 
set color scheme on it now while that is
great<00:01:30.450> because<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:31.140> means<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.680> computer

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
great because it means that the computer

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.620 
great because it means that the computer
only<00:01:32.220> has<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.490> worry<00:01:32.520> about<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.820> single<00:01:33.180> cube<00:01:33.420> if

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
only has to worry about a single cube if

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.050 
only has to worry about a single cube if
the<00:01:34.020> game<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.530> really<00:01:35.280> really<00:01:35.579> detailed

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
the game is really really detailed

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.910 
the game is really really detailed
voxels<00:01:36.600> have<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.810> be<00:01:36.869> quite<00:01:37.110> small<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.710> if<00:01:37.860> you

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
voxels have to be quite small and if you

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.830 
voxels have to be quite small and if you
get<00:01:38.009> really<00:01:38.250> small<00:01:38.670> voxels<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.509> means<00:01:39.689> it's

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
get really small voxels that means it's

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.420 
get really small voxels that means it's
a<00:01:39.900> lot<00:01:40.079> more<00:01:40.200> work<00:01:40.439> for<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.770> computer<00:01:41.280> to

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
a lot more work for the computer to

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.969 
a lot more work for the computer to
generate<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:42.299> versus<00:01:43.049> vertices<00:01:43.770> and

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
generate that versus vertices and

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.550 
generate that versus vertices and
textures<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.240> end<00:01:45.360> result<00:01:45.689> here<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.049> that

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
textures the end result here is that

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.880 
textures the end result here is that
they<00:01:47.220> have<00:01:47.520> paired<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.240> game<00:01:48.659> down<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.409> such

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
they have paired this game down to such

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.999 
they have paired this game down to such
a<00:01:50.040> small<00:01:50.670> amount<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.450> horsepower<00:01:52.229> required

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
a small amount of horsepower required

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.399 
a small amount of horsepower required
that<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.610> only<00:01:53.729> needs<00:01:54.000> windows<00:01:54.360> XP<00:01:54.930> service

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
that it only needs windows XP service
