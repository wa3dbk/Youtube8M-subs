00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
right so you have the wire that you can

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.800 
right so you have the wire that you can
plug<00:00:18.900> into<00:00:19.039> your<00:00:20.090> 3d<00:00:21.090> s<00:00:22.130> that<00:00:23.130> then<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:24.029> put<00:00:24.539> the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
plug into your 3d s that then I put the

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.000 
plug into your 3d s that then I put the
noise<00:00:25.019> filter<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.920> website<00:00:26.279> as<00:00:26.430> well<00:00:26.460> and

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
noise filter on the website as well and

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.130 
noise filter on the website as well and
that<00:00:29.010> plugs<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.510> from<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.779> end<00:00:30.929> of

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
that plugs in this is from the end of

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.220 
that plugs in this is from the end of
that<00:00:31.439> wire<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.730> plugs<00:00:32.790> into<00:00:33.239> here<00:00:33.390> which<00:00:34.020> is

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
that wire that plugs into here which is

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.440 
that wire that plugs into here which is
the<00:00:34.350> beginning<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.670> noise<00:00:36.000> filter<00:00:38.450> these

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
the beginning of the noise filter these

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.880 
the beginning of the noise filter these
don't<00:00:39.750> actually<00:00:39.899> come<00:00:40.320> with<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> capture
