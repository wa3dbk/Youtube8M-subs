 third generation snake I have 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:04.790
 adored also for the simple factor 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:07.160
 of his rivalry against angus and therefore 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.940
 it is also quite strong because it exists 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.070

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.209
 at position number 2 we find mine 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.910

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.480
 from goal bat boxes that many consider 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.690
 useless and boring, cro bat comes out 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.560

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.150
 wheezing is absolutely phenomenal and 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.819
 deserves a mega evolution without 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.500
 think about it in the slightest instead of 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.310
 let's think about the mega evolutions of audino 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.500

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.330
 I absolutely want a mega evolution 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.099
 wheezing because it is given that they use it 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.890
 all always just for exclusion 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.680
