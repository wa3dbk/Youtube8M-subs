00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.990
 eight minutes for one more important is 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.299
 part of the game 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.990
 now you have to go out there and dominate 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:12.990
 this match 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:23.410
 to win to prove that we are the 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:23.410
 first 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.119
 good 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.900
 how to speak 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.150
 the imbatidos reus imperials visited 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.440
 the difficult field of santurtzi for 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.440
 continue with his victorious streak 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.910
 the coyotes wanted to avoid it at all 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.910
 defense- based coast 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.510
 but the American connection of those of 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.000
 reus scored the first points in 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.479
 the line of 30 evans denis cultural of 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.430
 the empires raised flying occasion 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.550
 first trying the party the empires 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.369
 they put 06 on the scoreboard was 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:29.040
 evaluation to the American connection space 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.040
 to advance the Catalan set 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.940
 the casualties did not diminish the potential of 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.619
 the visitors were never overwhelmed 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.780
 on the defensive line despite the 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:01.360
 absences and rest the marker 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.360
 it reflected a 0 6 for the Imperials 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.660
 the attack reus in was added us with 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.950
 ease but little by little they opened 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.950
 gaps in the defense of Bilbao 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.829
 footprint in the third quarter when that 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.769
 gap resulted in the marker with a 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:48.549
 new touchdown the Imperials were getting 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.549
 0 to 13 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.400
 it's not going to attack the empires it seems that 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.220
 it goes from a band it's not the culture oil 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.040
 with the center ricky took the rich ball 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:04.420
 is the race is going to be career is going to be 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.190
 so much is so fast imperials according to boot 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.500
 they are for the Catalans who open 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.500
 gap in the score 0 to 13 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.740
 the coyotes did not know how to surpass 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.320
 a Catalan defense that did not want to hear 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.810
 talk about casualties to top the 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.050
 I find a new touchdown closed the 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.570
 bookmark the empires in the network are and 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.260
 they break the defense of the coyotes and 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:39.180
 new breed this time to bamberg 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:44.090
 close the game already for the empires 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.090
 new victory for the whole Reus 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.549
 the Imperials are still undefeated in this 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.690
 2015 series and continue to seek the dream 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.690
 of the rise to the elite
