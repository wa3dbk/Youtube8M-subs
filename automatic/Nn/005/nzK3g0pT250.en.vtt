00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.950 
it's probably the the best thing that
you<00:01:52.950> could<00:01:53.130> do<00:01:53.280> for<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.549> world<00:01:53.820> but<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.780> makes

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
you could do for the world but it makes

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.350 
you could do for the world but it makes
other<00:01:55.140> people<00:01:55.470> very<00:01:55.799> uncomfortable<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.909> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
other people very uncomfortable and the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.149 
other people very uncomfortable and the
reason<00:01:57.630> why<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.869> because<00:01:58.079> first<00:01:58.649> they'll<00:01:59.130> have

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
reason why is because first they'll have

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.910 
reason why is because first they'll have
to<00:01:59.610> choose<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.360> new<00:02:00.780> way<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:00.990> respond<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.740> you

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
to choose a new way to respond to you

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.520 
to choose a new way to respond to you
because<00:02:02.159> you'll<00:02:02.369> no<00:02:02.640> longer<00:02:03.350> associate<00:02:04.350> with

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
because you'll no longer associate with

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.789 
because you'll no longer associate with
them<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.520> same<00:02:05.790> way<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.320> did<00:02:07.530> when

that you're also going to yell

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:47.999 
that you're also going to yell
at<00:05:46.659> the<00:05:46.749> top<00:05:47.050> of<00:05:47.199> your<00:05:47.259> voice<00:05:47.499> to<00:05:47.680> break<00:05:47.860> up

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:48.009 
at the top of your voice to break up

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:54.360 
at the top of your voice to break up
some<00:05:48.189> of<00:05:48.219> the<00:05:48.340> resistance<00:05:48.639> in<00:05:48.969> your<00:05:49.120> neck<00:05:53.370> once

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
some of the resistance in your neck once

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.089 
some of the resistance in your neck once
you<00:05:54.550> do<00:05:54.759> those<00:05:54.999> you're<00:05:55.449> going<00:05:55.569> to<00:05:55.629> be<00:05:55.779> free<00:05:56.740> to

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
you do those you're going to be free to

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:59.459 
you do those you're going to be free to
discharge<00:05:57.699> as<00:05:58.060> a<00:05:58.509> human<00:05:58.870> being<00:05:59.080> there<00:05:59.259> are<00:05:59.289> two

00:05:59.459 --> 00:05:59.469 
discharge as a human being there are two

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:00.989 
discharge as a human being there are two
things<00:05:59.680> essentially<00:06:00.189> that<00:06:00.310> we<00:06:00.430> do<00:06:00.610> we<00:06:00.729> either

00:06:00.989 --> 00:06:00.999 
things essentially that we do we either

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:03.600 
things essentially that we do we either
charge<00:06:01.300> through<00:06:01.719> breathing<00:06:02.050> or<00:06:02.610> discharge

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
charge through breathing or discharge

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.239 
charge through breathing or discharge
through<00:06:04.060> laughing<00:06:04.599> crying<00:06:05.259> and<00:06:05.589> sex

00:06:06.239 --> 00:06:06.249 
through laughing crying and sex

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:09.600 
through laughing crying and sex
so<00:06:06.969> we're<00:06:07.539> busy<00:06:08.189> discharging<00:06:09.189> charging

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
so we're busy discharging charging

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.149 
so we're busy discharging charging
charging<00:06:10.060> through<00:06:10.300> food<00:06:10.659> but<00:06:11.259> very<00:06:11.529> rarely<00:06:11.889> do

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:12.159 
charging through food but very rarely do

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:15.179 
charging through food but very rarely do
we<00:06:12.189> charge<00:06:12.550> with<00:06:12.759> the<00:06:12.849> most<00:06:13.089> vital<00:06:14.009> element<00:06:15.009> in

00:06:15.179 --> 00:06:15.189 
we charge with the most vital element in

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:17.070 
we charge with the most vital element in
a<00:06:15.430> nutrient<00:06:16.270> as<00:06:16.389> a<00:06:16.419> human<00:06:16.689> being<00:06:16.870> which<00:06:17.050> is

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
a nutrient as a human being which is

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.769 
a nutrient as a human being which is
oxygen<00:06:18.069> you're<00:06:18.879> going<00:06:19.029> to<00:06:19.089> charge<00:06:19.330> your<00:06:19.569> body

00:06:19.769 --> 00:06:19.779 
oxygen you're going to charge your body

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:21.329 
oxygen you're going to charge your body
and<00:06:20.080> you're<00:06:20.229> going<00:06:20.349> to<00:06:20.379> discharge<00:06:20.680> this<00:06:21.219> is

00:06:21.329 --> 00:06:21.339 
and you're going to discharge this is

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:23.339 
and you're going to discharge this is
going<00:06:21.460> to<00:06:21.520> break<00:06:21.849> up<00:06:22.120> a<00:06:22.270> lot<00:06:22.689> of<00:06:22.749> the<00:06:22.930> physical
