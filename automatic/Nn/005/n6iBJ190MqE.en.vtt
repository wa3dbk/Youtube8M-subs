00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
last year and I just got to think this

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.250 
last year and I just got to think this
is<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.380> natural<00:02:52.950> letdown<00:02:53.370> spot<00:02:53.730> for<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.840> Saints

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
is a natural letdown spot for the Saints

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.320 
is a natural letdown spot for the Saints
so<00:02:55.710> I'm<00:02:56.100> going<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.400> kind<00:02:56.550> of<00:02:56.670> agree<00:02:56.940> with<00:02:56.970> you

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
and I'm going to also kind of shade to

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.000 
and I'm going to also kind of shade to
the<00:02:59.430> under<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.240> the<00:03:00.330> over<00:03:00.660> here<00:03:00.900> because<00:03:01.320> if<00:03:01.710> a

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
the under to the over here because if a

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.010 
the under to the over here because if a
team<00:03:02.250> is<00:03:02.280> disinterested<00:03:02.940> I<00:03:03.390> think<00:03:03.720> we're<00:03:03.840> that

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
team is disinterested I think we're that

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.770 
team is disinterested I think we're that
shows<00:03:04.350> up<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.740> most<00:03:05.070> is<00:03:05.640> on<00:03:05.940> defense<00:03:06.420> because

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
shows up the most is on defense because

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.510 
shows up the most is on defense because
that's<00:03:07.170> where<00:03:07.380> your<00:03:07.560> magic<00:03:10.010> on<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.130> integer

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
that's where your magic on the integer

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.650 
that's where your magic on the integer
sometime<00:03:12.000> this<00:03:12.180> year<00:03:13.790> but<00:03:14.790> look<00:03:15.030> at<00:03:15.210> last<00:03:15.480> week

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
sometime this year but look at last week

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.930 
sometime this year but look at last week
they<00:03:15.780> were<00:03:15.840> pumped<00:03:16.290> up<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.710> they<00:03:17.340> stopped<00:03:17.730> at

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
they were pumped up and they stopped at

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.210 
they were pumped up and they stopped at
land<00:03:18.150> I<00:03:18.360> mean<00:03:18.600> they<00:03:18.750> had<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.860> wasn't<00:03:20.160> the

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
land I mean they had to that wasn't the

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.190 
land I mean they had to that wasn't the
first<00:03:20.430> time<00:03:20.670> at<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.510> end<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.810> game<00:03:21.840> when

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
first time at the end of the game when

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.780 
first time at the end of the game when
they<00:03:22.320> stopped<00:03:22.560> him<00:03:22.740> for<00:03:22.890> dead<00:03:23.070> but<00:03:23.250> earlier

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
they stopped him for dead but earlier

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.180 
they stopped him for dead but earlier
they<00:03:24.000> held<00:03:24.210> him<00:03:24.330> on<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:25.140> inside<00:03:25.260> first<00:03:25.860> and<00:03:26.010> go

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
they held him on the inside first and go

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.800 
they held him on the inside first and go
inside<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:26.700> 10<00:03:26.910> they<00:03:27.270> held<00:03:27.480> them<00:03:27.600> to<00:03:27.630> a<00:03:27.720> field

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
inside to 10 they held them to a field

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.260 
inside to 10 they held them to a field
goal<00:03:28.230> so<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.980> mean<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.340> defense<00:03:29.760> rose<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.180> the

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
goal so I mean the defense rose to the

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.000 
goal so I mean the defense rose to the
occasion<00:03:30.300> last<00:03:30.840> week<00:03:31.080> I<00:03:31.230> don't<00:03:31.590> think<00:03:31.860> it

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
occasion last week I don't think it

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.220 
occasion last week I don't think it
happens<00:03:32.430> again<00:03:32.790> this<00:03:33.090> week<00:03:33.330> I<00:03:33.450> think<00:03:33.480> they<00:03:34.110> got

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
happens again this week I think they got

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.810 
happens again this week I think they got
to<00:03:34.380> be<00:03:34.470> patting<00:03:34.770> themselves<00:03:34.890> on<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.280> back<00:03:35.400> and

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
to be patting themselves on the back and

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.620 
to be patting themselves on the back and
I<00:03:36.030> think<00:03:36.240> they're<00:03:36.330> going<00:03:36.450> to<00:03:36.540> be<00:03:36.600> looking

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
I think they're going to be looking

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.960 
I think they're going to be looking
ahead<00:03:36.960> next<00:03:37.620> week<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:38.070> a<00:03:38.100> shot<00:03:38.400> for<00:03:38.760> San

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
ahead next week to a shot for San

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.850 
ahead next week to a shot for San
Francisco<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.840> one<00:03:40.020> thing<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:40.290> will<00:03:40.350> say<00:03:40.530> about

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
Francisco the one thing I will say about

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.190 
Francisco the one thing I will say about
this<00:03:41.070> defense<00:03:41.610> that<00:03:42.390> it<00:03:42.540> has<00:03:42.690> gotten<00:03:42.990> a<00:03:43.020> little

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
this defense that it has gotten a little

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.230 
this defense that it has gotten a little
bit<00:03:43.380> better<00:03:43.590> is<00:03:43.830> you<00:03:44.550> know<00:03:44.850> we<00:03:44.940> didn't<00:03:45.150> talk

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
bit better is you know we didn't talk

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.820 
bit better is you know we didn't talk
about<00:03:45.390> it<00:03:45.480> but<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:45.900> know<00:03:46.020> since<00:03:46.350> Gil<00:03:46.620> must

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
about it but you know since Gil must

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.670 
about it but you know since Gil must
come<00:03:47.040> back<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:47.550> now<00:03:47.970> you've<00:03:48.270> had<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:49.200> actual

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
come back and now you've had the actual

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.560 
come back and now you've had the actual
interim<00:03:50.430> coach<00:03:50.640> that<00:03:50.940> was<00:03:51.060> supposed<00:03:51.360> to<00:03:51.480> be

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
interim coach that was supposed to be

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.180 
interim coach that was supposed to be
there<00:03:51.930> is<00:03:52.110> been<00:03:52.350> there<00:03:52.530> now<00:03:52.680> this<00:03:52.890> will<00:03:52.980> be<00:03:53.070> the

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
there is been there now this will be the

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.650 
there is been there now this will be the
third<00:03:53.370> game<00:03:53.610> in<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.880> row<00:03:53.910> for<00:03:54.210> both<00:03:54.390> of<00:03:54.570> those

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
third game in a row for both of those

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.300 
third game in a row for both of those
guys<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:55.140> think<00:03:55.530> that's<00:03:55.650> starting<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.070> make<00:03:56.280> a

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
guys I think that's starting to make a

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.520 
guys I think that's starting to make a
little<00:03:56.400> bit<00:03:56.730> of<00:03:56.760> continuity<00:03:57.600> on<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.990> team<00:03:58.320> that

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
little bit of continuity on a team that

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.770 
little bit of continuity on a team that
had<00:03:58.920> no<00:03:59.130> continuity<00:03:59.520> all<00:03:59.880> year<00:04:00.150> I<00:04:00.300> think<00:04:00.630> we've

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
had no continuity all year I think we've

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.570 
had no continuity all year I think we've
dissected<00:04:01.500> this<00:04:01.770> one<00:04:01.950> as<00:04:02.070> much<00:04:02.160> as<00:04:02.340> we<00:04:02.430> can

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
dissected this one as much as we can

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.160 
dissected this one as much as we can
Bryan<00:04:02.850> this<00:04:03.000> one's<00:04:03.150> your<00:04:03.270> best<00:04:03.450> bet
