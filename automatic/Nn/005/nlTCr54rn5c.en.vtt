00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.900
 Guten Morgin today I decided to take you off 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.040
 review of how such portable works 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.709
 a stove which is made of two 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.409
 cans in general woke up 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:16.380
 I decided to do a review, well, I forgot to put 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:18.270
 battery at night for charging today 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.320
 the review will consist of a blow of two 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.360
 such components 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.050
 that is, the first thing is , of course 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.640
 our singing is more of a matter I will check 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.010
 not far from home means such 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.620
 portable solar charging so 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.120
 way here it is connected yet 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:39.420
 the battery is charging I cook means 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:45.450
 such a stove as follows it 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:50.640
 made one cut through the diameter 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:54.180
 over this bank so it will be the future 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.600
 one-handed shoot 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.590
 cover in general so named made 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.290
 bottom did not holes big nail 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.290
 pick up the holes froze over the diameter of 2 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.590
 jars took a smaller jar 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:15.470
 we made holes on top of the bottom below 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.619
 holes and at the very bottom for ventilation 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.150
 it means further so what is inserted 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.650
 so the camera at home is dead now I 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.650
 I will move to shooting from the camera 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.110
 well, in principle, all Harry's horn is pretty 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.330
 still not bad and generally what sense 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.330
 In general, what is the point in order to 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.310
 don't breed permanent kong big 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.440
 fire can use such a small 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.570
 jar for cooking such food 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.610
 either warming up water excuse how much 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.090
 it means you need firewood to boil there 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.740
 let in a liter of water i understand they don't 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.930
 today's goal was check and simple 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.880
 work is generally because such here 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:02.580
 burners I met quite often and 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:06.600
 guys use them and pretty 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:09.209
 quite good complaints well in general that today 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.130
 I will hares today I checked the oven and 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.130
 checked my solar charge 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.959
 solar charging did not work right away 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.930
 I had to wait a little about 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.390
 10-15 minutes, the end boxer see for yourself 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.870
 everything happens all record happens 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.870
 scanners 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:13.030
 I correctly consider the stove pine fuming 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:14.890
 of course crazy but in general I 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.040
 honestly pretty happy not 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:22.000
 burns badly if you pay attention 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:25.050
 places us I nakovyryat hole there at all 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.050
 like a turbine and a face 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.250
 cameras unfortunately in my opinion this is not 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.819
 will give you can believe the word that 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:38.980
 in places i made holes burning kaya 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:42.819
 comfort means has been used 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.340
 Pretty not very big pine 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.250
 board about 30 centimeters in diameter 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.170
 6 centimeters as you can see so far everything 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.890
 still burning is not going to go out i think 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.140
 that such a piece of wood to boil a liter 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.430
 water will in principle be enough also 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.989
 You can use others much 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.160
 things and things like bumps 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:08.470
 spruce or pine knots in principle 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:13.120
 any horse chord should come up for 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:15.100
 such a portable stove, in principle, I 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.140
 wait until she got done and burn to 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.940
 don't make a fire on with you 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.329
 say goodbye to everyone for now and thank you to the new 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.329
 meeting 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:48.330
 well everything went ten more minutes all this 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.530
 the case itself went out still 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:55.650
 smoke continues to burn 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.720
 finally gone out you can go home in 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:03.300
 Generally a small delegation was burning 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:05.940
 a long time ago about 20 minutes I think that 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.300
 such a heat would be enough to 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:12.720
 boil about let's say 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.180
 half a liter of water means we will continue 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.180
 sample 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.400
 we will try to boil water 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.810
 exploiting the overall look 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.120
 as much as a quality thing because 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.539
 which honestly is not always desirable 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:30.289
 make a fire to make 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.289
 a glass of tea or coffee 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:35.599
 Well, thank you all and bye
