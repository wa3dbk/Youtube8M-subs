00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
little number 18 on the other we are

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.730 
little number 18 on the other we are
interested<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.610> hole<00:01:38.909> number<00:01:39.030> one<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.740> hole

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
interested in hole number one and hole

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.620 
interested in hole number one and hole
number<00:01:40.860> 17<00:01:41.340> I'm<00:01:42.180> going<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.360> put<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.540> phone

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
number 17 I'm going to put the phone

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.030 
number 17 I'm going to put the phone
down<00:01:42.689> for<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.990> second<00:01:43.229> whilst<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.500> do<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.799> bit

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
down for a second whilst I do this bit

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.620 
down for a second whilst I do this bit
because<00:01:44.220> it's<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.850> little<00:01:45.119> bit<00:01:45.210> fiddly<00:01:45.420> with

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
because it's a little bit fiddly with

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.399 
because it's a little bit fiddly with
just<00:01:45.840> one<00:01:45.960> hand

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
just one hand

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.889 
just one hand
when<00:01:46.770> I'm<00:01:46.860> going<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.009> put<00:01:47.159> my<00:01:47.250> paperclip<00:01:47.899> 1/2

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
when I'm going to put my paperclip 1/2

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.080 
when I'm going to put my paperclip 1/2
into<00:01:49.409> number<00:01:49.619> one<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.579> other<00:01:50.729> half<00:01:50.850> into

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
into number one the other half into

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.910 
into number one the other half into
number<00:01:51.329> 17<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.320> what<00:01:52.439> we're<00:01:52.560> doing<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.829> is

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
number 17 and what we're doing that is

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.020 
number 17 and what we're doing that is
we're<00:01:53.040> tricking<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.490> system<00:01:53.820> into<00:01:54.000> thinking

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
we're tricking the system into thinking

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.420 
we're tricking the system into thinking
that<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.509> wiring<00:01:54.720> network<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.310> is

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
that the wiring network is in and so is

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.109 
that the wiring network is in and so is
the<00:01:56.490> button<00:01:57.259> so<00:01:58.259> before<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.649> do<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:59.119> turn

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
the button so before you do that turn

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.719 
the button so before you do that turn
your<00:02:00.270> ignition<00:02:00.360> on<00:02:00.950> just<00:02:01.950> once<00:02:02.219> just<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.579> make

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
your ignition on just once just to make

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.010 
your ignition on just once just to make
sure<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:03.000> screen<00:02:03.299> lights<00:02:03.509> up<00:02:03.689> nice<00:02:03.869> and

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
sure you screen lights up nice and

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.840 
sure you screen lights up nice and
quickly

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.430 

so<00:02:07.850> Nick<00:02:08.210> in<00:02:08.420> this<00:02:08.600> case<00:02:08.750> it's<00:02:08.929> not<00:02:09.140> what<00:02:09.350> we

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
so Nick in this case it's not what we

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.559 
so Nick in this case it's not what we
want<00:02:09.649> to<00:02:09.800> see<00:02:09.979> is<00:02:10.160> not<00:02:10.429> that<00:02:10.670> screen<00:02:11.030> we<00:02:11.420> want

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
want to see is not that screen we want

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.290 
want to see is not that screen we want
to<00:02:11.750> see<00:02:11.900> either<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.260> computer<00:02:12.740> screen<00:02:12.980> or

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
to see either the computer screen or

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.000 
to see either the computer screen or
just<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.420> running<00:02:14.959> screen<00:02:15.380> of<00:02:15.560> your<00:02:15.590> radio

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
just the running screen of your radio

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.230 
just the running screen of your radio
whatever<00:02:16.280> so<00:02:16.520> that's<00:02:16.670> what<00:02:16.760> we<00:02:16.850> want<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.209> it's

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
whatever so that's what we want and it's

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.190 
whatever so that's what we want and it's
only<00:02:17.450> edition<00:02:17.750> off<00:02:17.840> again<00:02:18.130> back<00:02:19.130> on<00:02:19.280> again

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
only edition off again back on again

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.390 
only edition off again back on again
and<00:02:21.200> hopefully<00:02:21.380> this<00:02:21.650> time<00:02:21.830> their<00:02:22.040> gate<00:02:22.220> comes

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
and hopefully this time their gate comes

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.420 
and hopefully this time their gate comes
up<00:02:22.550> so<00:02:22.730> ignition<00:02:23.450> off<00:02:23.540> all<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.200> way<00:02:24.320> plug<00:02:25.310> in

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
up so ignition off all the way plug in

117 and I'm going to show you what it

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.020 
117 and I'm going to show you what it
looks<00:02:34.970> like<00:02:39.250> it<00:02:40.250> looks<00:02:40.430> like<00:02:40.640> that

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
looks like it looks like that

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.449 
looks like it looks like that
so<00:02:41.510> when<00:02:42.380> under<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.650> paperclip<00:02:43.040> is<00:02:43.160> in<00:02:43.280> number

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
so when under the paperclip is in number

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.759 
so when under the paperclip is in number
one<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.090> other<00:02:44.209> is<00:02:44.300> in<00:02:44.390> number<00:02:44.570> 17<00:02:44.930> simple

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
one and the other is in number 17 simple

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:46.180 
one and the other is in number 17 simple
as<00:02:45.830> that

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
as that

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.759 
as that
let's<00:02:46.459> you<00:02:46.610> screen<00:02:46.930> ignition<00:02:47.930> on<00:02:47.989> stage<00:02:48.230> 2<00:02:49.180> and
