00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
am actually counter steering and it's

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.650

anywhere trying to recover from this
state<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:22.950> just<00:02:23.370> stop<00:02:23.909> the<00:02:24.060> car<00:02:24.200> okay<00:02:33.319> let's

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
state so just stop the car okay let's

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.619 
state so just stop the car okay let's
review<00:02:34.469> the<00:02:34.680> training<00:02:34.980> program<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.700> admit<00:02:36.510> that

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
review the training program I admit that

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.720 
review the training program I admit that
this<00:02:36.750> training<00:02:37.049> needs<00:02:37.319> ever<00:02:37.530> but<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.519> want<00:02:38.670> to

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
this training needs ever but you want to

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.770 
this training needs ever but you want to
have<00:02:38.849> fun<00:02:39.090> too

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
have fun too

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.660 
have fun too
so<00:02:40.170> find<00:02:40.409> a<00:02:40.469> safe<00:02:40.680> place<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:40.950> practice<00:02:41.250> and

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
so find a safe place to practice and

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.330 
so find a safe place to practice and
start<00:02:42.060> from<00:02:42.180> 180<00:02:42.719> degree<00:02:43.049> turn<00:02:43.319> then<00:02:44.010> try<00:02:44.280> the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
start from 180 degree turn then try the

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.869 
start from 180 degree turn then try the
360<00:02:45.000> but<00:02:45.269> you<00:02:45.569> need<00:02:45.750> an<00:02:46.079> LSD<00:02:46.439> to<00:02:46.769> do<00:02:46.889> this<00:02:47.069> then

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
360 but you need an LSD to do this then

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.819 
360 but you need an LSD to do this then
the<00:02:48.000> 90<00:02:48.299> degree<00:02:48.419> turn<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.290> when<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:49.709> learn

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
the 90 degree turn and when you learn

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.710 
the 90 degree turn and when you learn
all<00:02:50.069> this<00:02:50.099> come<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.819> track<00:02:51.120> like<00:02:51.329> this<00:02:51.389> one

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
all this come to a track like this one

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.599 
all this come to a track like this one
to<00:02:51.780> practice<00:02:52.230> or<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:52.769> can<00:02:52.799> find<00:02:53.189> something

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
to practice or you can find something

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.179 
to practice or you can find something
like<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:54.079> to<00:02:55.079> practice<00:02:55.260> doing<00:02:55.709> donuts<00:02:56.099> you

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
like this to practice doing donuts you

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:57.020 
like this to practice doing donuts you
need<00:02:56.400> an<00:02:56.519> LSD

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
need an LSD

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.770 
need an LSD
kibou<00:02:57.900> track<00:02:58.169> like<00:02:58.409> this<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.769> practice<00:02:58.950> pool

gas<00:03:07.160> 480<00:03:08.160> which<00:03:08.459> actually<00:03:09.120> is<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.300> u-turn<00:03:09.660> you

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
gas 480 which actually is a u-turn you

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.300 
gas 480 which actually is a u-turn you
need<00:03:10.050> to<00:03:10.140> keep<00:03:10.350> pulling<00:03:10.680> for<00:03:10.890> at<00:03:10.950> least<00:03:11.040> one

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
need to keep pulling for at least one

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.000 
need to keep pulling for at least one
second<00:03:11.819> to<00:03:12.150> let<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.450> tail<00:03:12.630> slide<00:03:12.959> so<00:03:13.560> practice

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
second to let the tail slide so practice

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.260 
second to let the tail slide so practice
and<00:03:14.250> learn<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.520> get<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.730> feeling<00:03:15.060> of<00:03:15.120> what

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
and learn to get the feeling of what

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.479 
and learn to get the feeling of what
kind<00:03:15.540> of<00:03:15.600> speed<00:03:15.959> angle<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.740> steering<00:03:17.010> work<00:03:17.310> is

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
kind of speed angle and steering work is

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.180 
kind of speed angle and steering work is
needed<00:03:17.700> for<00:03:18.000> various<00:03:18.030> terms<00:03:18.569> i<00:03:19.080> said<00:03:19.680> practice

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
needed for various terms i said practice

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.130 
needed for various terms i said practice
but<00:03:20.400> you'll<00:03:20.760> have<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.120> much<00:03:21.239> fun<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:22.020> won't

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
but you'll have so much fun you won't

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.430 
but you'll have so much fun you won't
feel<00:03:22.380> if<00:03:22.560> you're<00:03:22.709> practicing<00:03:22.860> at<00:03:23.280> all
