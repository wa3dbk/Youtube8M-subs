know it's probably been around for 15 20
years<00:00:33.710> and<00:00:33.950> then<00:00:34.100> you<00:00:34.220> go<00:00:34.400> composite<00:00:34.940> door

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
years and then you go composite door

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.670 
years and then you go composite door
yeah<00:00:35.780> what<00:00:36.739> the<00:00:36.980> I<00:00:37.280> mean<00:00:38.020> what<00:00:39.020> are<00:00:39.050> the<00:00:39.260> pros

your<00:00:52.909> problem<00:00:53.239> in<00:00:53.720> the<00:00:53.900> winter<00:00:54.260> when<00:00:54.409> they

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
your problem in the winter when they

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.869 
your problem in the winter when they
swell<00:00:54.769> up<00:00:54.800> yeah<00:00:55.760> you<00:00:56.659> end<00:00:56.839> up<00:00:57.019> finding<00:00:57.879> the

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
swell up yeah you end up finding the

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.180 
swell up yeah you end up finding the
edge<00:00:59.000> of<00:00:59.150> the<00:00:59.269> door<00:00:59.390> off<00:00:59.570> to<00:00:59.720> make<00:00:59.870> it<00:01:00.080> sure<00:01:00.830> and

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
edge of the door off to make it sure and

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.820 
edge of the door off to make it sure and
then<00:01:01.400> in<00:01:01.790> the<00:01:01.970> summer<00:01:02.239> it's<00:01:03.080> rinks<00:01:03.559> and<00:01:03.650> you've

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
then in the summer it's rinks and you've

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.950 
then in the summer it's rinks and you've
got<00:01:03.979> big<00:01:04.159> gaps<00:01:04.370> right<00:01:04.699> yeah<00:01:05.360> I<00:01:05.420> had<00:01:05.690> that<00:01:05.720> with

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
got big gaps right yeah I had that with

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.500 
got big gaps right yeah I had that with
my<00:01:06.110> door<00:01:06.320> yeah<00:01:06.680> yeah<00:01:07.159> and<00:01:07.400> a<00:01:07.940> new<00:01:08.150> PVC

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
my door yeah yeah and a new PVC

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.080 
my door yeah yeah and a new PVC
presumably<00:01:09.350> that's<00:01:09.590> a<00:01:09.770> bit<00:01:09.920> better<00:01:10.070> but<00:01:10.760> yeah

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
presumably that's a bit better but yeah

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.810 
presumably that's a bit better but yeah
uPVC<00:01:11.810> doors<00:01:11.930> like<00:01:12.530> you<00:01:12.799> generally<00:01:13.580> see<00:01:13.790> on

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
uPVC doors like you generally see on

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.109 
uPVC doors like you generally see on
those<00:01:14.330> houses<00:01:14.690> coming<00:01:15.590> white<00:01:16.009> you<00:01:16.789> know<00:01:16.939> there

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
those houses coming white you know there

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.380 
those houses coming white you know there
are<00:01:17.270> companies<00:01:17.600> that<00:01:17.780> do<00:01:18.020> your<00:01:18.740> color<00:01:19.070> yeah

are companies that do your color yeah

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.380 
are companies that do your color yeah
but<00:01:20.899> they<00:01:21.079> are<00:01:21.320> basically<00:01:22.009> a<00:01:22.399> panel<00:01:22.880> inside<00:01:23.210> of

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
but they are basically a panel inside of

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.200 
but they are basically a panel inside of
a<00:01:23.509> frame<00:01:23.659> okay<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:24.860> I've<00:01:25.610> never<00:01:25.850> heard<00:01:26.060> of

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
a frame okay and I've never heard of

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.840 
a frame okay and I've never heard of
composite<00:01:26.750> door<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.340> example<00:01:28.340> behind<00:01:28.490> you

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
composite door and example behind you

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.580 
composite door and example behind you
there<00:01:29.060> is<00:01:29.240> a<00:01:29.270> composite<00:01:29.659> dog<00:01:29.960> you<00:01:30.200> just<00:01:30.409> take

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
there is a composite dog you just take

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.080 
there is a composite dog you just take
us<00:01:30.740> through<00:01:30.890> that<00:01:30.920> what's<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.490> composite<00:01:31.969> or

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
us through that what's the composite or

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.289 
us through that what's the composite or
becomes<00:01:32.509> it<00:01:32.750> door<00:01:32.960> there<00:01:33.289> is<00:01:33.320> a<00:01:33.530> solid<00:01:34.299> core

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
becomes it door there is a solid core

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.410 
becomes it door there is a solid core
door<00:01:35.359> so<00:01:36.259> basically<00:01:36.710> it's<00:01:36.920> not<00:01:37.100> a<00:01:37.130> panel<00:01:37.549> it's

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
door so basically it's not a panel it's

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.770 
door so basically it's not a panel it's
just<00:01:39.320> it's<00:01:39.829> almost<00:01:40.270> human<00:01:41.270> if<00:01:41.420> you<00:01:41.570> imagine

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
just it's almost human if you imagine

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.660 
just it's almost human if you imagine
our<00:01:42.140> timber<00:01:42.469> doors<00:01:42.799> made<00:01:43.219> as<00:01:43.880> a<00:01:43.939> solid<00:01:44.420> slab

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
our timber doors made as a solid slab

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.580 
our timber doors made as a solid slab
which<00:01:46.670> you<00:01:46.820> looks<00:01:47.109> obviously<00:01:48.109> putting<00:01:48.350> the

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
which you looks obviously putting the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.069 
which you looks obviously putting the
edges<00:01:48.890> and<00:01:49.729> it's<00:01:49.969> a<00:01:50.030> very<00:01:50.270> very<00:01:50.570> skilled<00:01:50.899> or

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
edges and it's a very very skilled or

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.800 
edges and it's a very very skilled or
five-point<00:01:51.679> locking<00:01:52.070> system<00:01:52.520> okay<00:01:53.299> on<00:01:53.509> this

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
five-point locking system okay on this

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.380 
five-point locking system okay on this
particular<00:01:54.170> door<00:01:54.469> there<00:01:54.770> is<00:01:54.799> keyless<00:01:55.429> entry

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
particular door there is keyless entry

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.730 
particular door there is keyless entry
we<00:01:56.479> do<00:01:56.690> yeah<00:01:57.340> and<00:01:58.659> presumably<00:01:59.659> they<00:02:00.229> they<00:02:00.470> last

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
we do yeah and presumably they they last

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.469 
we do yeah and presumably they they last
longer<00:02:01.070> what's<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.490> maintenance<00:02:01.909> like<00:02:02.150> on<00:02:02.360> it

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
longer what's the maintenance like on it

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.870 
longer what's the maintenance like on it
our<00:02:02.690> maintenance<00:02:03.320> very<00:02:03.979> little<00:02:04.460> you<00:02:04.700> know<00:02:04.850> you

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
our maintenance very little you know you

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.870 
our maintenance very little you know you
can<00:02:05.420> UV<00:02:06.409> you<00:02:06.680> can<00:02:06.830> almost<00:02:06.979> get<00:02:07.280> winter<00:02:07.640> clean

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
can UV you can almost get winter clean
