00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
are made from a cheaper plastic material

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.170 
are made from a cheaper plastic material
and<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:08.140> control<00:03:08.770> talk<00:03:09.100> is<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.340> bit<00:03:09.910> thicker

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
and is the control talk is a bit thicker

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.670 
and is the control talk is a bit thicker
and<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.740> buttons<00:03:12.100> are<00:03:12.660> this<00:03:13.660> button<00:03:14.080> is<00:03:14.290> a<00:03:14.350> bit

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
and the buttons are this button is a bit

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.170 
and the buttons are this button is a bit
harder<00:03:15.070> in<00:03:15.940> this<00:03:16.150> way<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:18.130> they<00:03:18.970> make

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
harder in this way and they make

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.680 
harder in this way and they make
different<00:03:19.450> kind<00:03:19.959> of<00:03:20.050> noises<00:03:21.480> so<00:03:22.480> that's

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
different kind of noises so that's

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.130 
different kind of noises so that's
another<00:03:23.170> thing<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.560> take<00:03:23.709> you<00:03:23.830> notice<00:03:24.100> also

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
the divider where divides from one

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.760 
the divider where divides from one
