00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.229
 black color show how to make the most 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.269
 volume is not more spectacular so if 

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:48.309
 you are interested in this subject then 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.500
 stay with me and let's get started 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.659
 Now we will do the design in black 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.030
 option I already put on the palette black 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:58.390
 gel polish and next put a drop of top and 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:02.280
 now we have to mix it all up to 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.280
 turned out translucent black 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.210
 the resulting color I will invite to 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.310
 tipsy if you do on gel varnish 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.360
 then you apply this design to 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.179
 base coat 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.569
 I took a brush of the amount in the bottle and 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:20.159
 Now it will apply our color you 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:22.679
 you can take absolutely any kill 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.600
 can take a brush for axons general 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:28.009
 take here which is convenient for you and and 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.009
 which you on 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.560
 inflicted my main color and now I 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.580
 I put you on the kuna for two minutes I 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.040
 I take a brush 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.280
 thin I will not draw a border for 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.560
 our design for this, I have already inflicted 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.780
 on the palette gel paint black you 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.630
 you can choose absolutely any company 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.509
 even cream without a sticky layer here 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.020
 no role it starts 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:02.790
 draw a rim or should not 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.680
 be thin fat i love here 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.410
 It is in this design to do the edging 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.220
 since with it the design seems more 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.220
 completed 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.130
 where is the end of our nails I'm in this 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.580
 option do like a mini french 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:42.100
 thicken this line and rounding 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:44.320
 angles like this 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.940
 now I put the lamp to dry in two 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.130
 minutes now in this very same 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.620
 gel paint I will draw a grid 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.750
 by the way you can paint and gel polish 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.990
 there is no difference the only thing 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.970
 that gel paint is denser a little bit color 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.670
 more pigmented mesh should be 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.670
 not quite small not quite large 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.540
 drew in our all the way now we 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.209
 We get up to listen to Ivanka for two minutes and 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.819
 after immediately block you and we will 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.220
 continue to perform scissors blocked 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.170
 top removed stickiness and now we will 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.690
 keep painting and you're gel paint 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.800
 already on the fully finished nail and we will 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.800
 we draw our monogram 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.860
 now we take doses and start the same 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.180
 gel paint dotted on the ground 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.180
 crossing our lines 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.920
 and now this design I will sprinkle finely 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.730
 abrasive whip sypem and their lagna 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.730
 dried layer 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.419
 and put you to dry for two minutes 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.970
 Here is such a beautiful and elegant 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:27.280
 the design we got was 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.379
 for the second option I have already prepared 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.539
 our nail also blocked 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:33.720
 translucent white make the edging 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:36.370
 white gel paint without a sticky layer 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.770
 blocked top stickiness stick now I'm 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.110
 I will continue to implement our design for 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.210
 I need this gel paint from her 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.909

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:48.060

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.210
 we drew our main element 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.800
 design now i will dot the 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.800
 he himself staggered 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.220
 and now our entire design and sprinkle 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.140
 acrylic powder 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.540
 legs ask need after that 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.790
 cover our design top in no way 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.660
 the case can not be then lost at all 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.170
 whole effect 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.490
 the whole volume will not look like 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.130
 looks without him 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.980
 new it does not reflect all 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.990
 worn very fine the only thing with 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.600
