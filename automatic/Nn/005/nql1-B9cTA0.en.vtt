00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 Hello everyone , welcome to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.850
 gaming this oar people see the 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.980
 it cuts exotic fragments of memory 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.860
 devastated exotic size that will have as 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.840
 infinite pocket reward for a rifle 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.429
 to fusion with giving it solar like al 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.500
 usually if you were interested in all the 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.779
 weapon features between a pair of 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.609
 days I should theoretically load a 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.439
 video dedicated purely to infinity 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.689
 pocket-sized so come back here click 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.490
 on the thumbnail you will see on the screen e 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.109
 you will be shown that video for today 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.939
 but we will only talk about the size 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.740
 exotic and what you have to do for 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.320
 complete it once obtained a 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.120
 randomly from the appropriate npc on the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.680
 tower the first task that you will be 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.120
 required to complete will be to 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.860
 go on Venus and find this 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.570
 spectrum the spectrum will appear 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.370
 automatically when you have it from 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.750
 complete this assignment then locations 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.280
 quiet is not a specter that 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.140
 you may have already taken in the past 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.640
 watching the video anyway you should 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.920
 understand quite easily where it is 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.020
 located specter once collected 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.030
 you'll have to kill the door guard in the 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.100
 heroic mission of history or more of the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.899
 guards once kills this 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.910
 boss you'll have to go back to the tower to go 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.769
 to speak to the speaker who will give you to the 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.299
 this fusion rifle diagrams 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.670
 mission object should carry it 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.680
 from the gunsmith and he will give you another item 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.720
 for the mission the next assignment from 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.939
 complete will be to disassemble ten 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.369
 rifles and rare or rare fusion 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.799
 upper and few words of blue rarity 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.509
 purple or yellow the fastest way to 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.130
 get these fusion guns without 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.170
 doubt that of checking every three 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.549
 hours what sells the gunsmith I say three 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.680
 hours because this is just the time that 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.390
 it will change the merchandise it sells 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.430
 alternatively you could throw yourself into it 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.710
 avant-garde tiger and cross the 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.079
 fingers that see the grammy as a reward 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.390
 inconsistent for special weapons and hope 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.710
 to find fusion rifles or if 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.060
 just had to be desperate 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.590
 you could use your marks 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.930
 of the vanguard of the crucible for 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.520
 buy rifles of various factions 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.590
 legendary fusion but this will have to 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.700
 be just a hopeless case 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.140
 professor you should miss one e 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.430
 two fusion rifles once 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.500
 completed this assignment should 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.930
 go back to talking to the gunsmith who is there 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.939
 will give the last assignment to complete 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.259
 ie to kill 200 enemies with 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.310
 fusion rifles 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.259
 night falls in the weekly assault 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.299
 I want to specify that to complete 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.800
 all this will not be good 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.650
 the killings you will do in the assault 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.480
 night falls but only the 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.650
 killings you will do in the true assault e 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.050
 you just can't go freely 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.030
 in the map but simply those that 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.430
 kills net in restricted re-entry zones 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.620
 trivial example making the assault of 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.599
 sexies for example voinÃ  get off in 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.250
 those missile construction site 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.260
 will go well should you enter the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.420
 structure that will lead you to kill the 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.860
 Walker also completed once 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.690
 this last assignment you will have to go 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.209
 from the gunsmith who will give you your weapon 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.739
 so coveted the pocket infinity without 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.810
 shadow of a doubt this is the size 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.130
 longer exotic to complete then 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.260
 I recommend you if you haven't yet 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.180
 having found it to start procuring 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.650
 at least ten rare fusion rifles 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.660
 not to throw them away when you find them in 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.040
 poor words because it is almost taken for granted 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.569
 that sooner or later you will have it and for 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.519
 shortening the time could be one 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.380
 really smart move and this thing here 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.880
 also applies to those who have already done so e 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.650
 that one day he will want to do it again a 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.480
 day in the air will get so doing yes 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.069
 then you can bring a little bit forward 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.610
 guys saying this is the video 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.110
 at the end 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.880
 as usual I hope it was yours 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.420
 interest on invitation leave me yours 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.040
 feedback 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.359
 I remind you that in a couple of days 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.010
 the dedicated video will also arrive 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.140
 purely to the infinite pocket and 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.220
 so don't miss it on my part and 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.120
 everything and we feel to each other 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.120
 video hi to all guys
