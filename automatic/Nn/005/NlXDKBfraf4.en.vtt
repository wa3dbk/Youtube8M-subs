00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
hey guys but if I was to

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.130 
hey guys but if I was to
compartmentalize<00:02:14.580> things<00:02:15.209> and<00:02:15.450> look<00:02:15.870> at<00:02:16.019> it

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
compartmentalize things and look at it

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.270 
compartmentalize things and look at it
from<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.379> different<00:02:16.530> perspective

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
from a different perspective

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.699 
from a different perspective
even<00:02:17.730> though<00:02:17.849> Aaron<00:02:18.239> was<00:02:18.420> oppressed<00:02:18.900> from

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
even though Aaron was oppressed from

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.890 
even though Aaron was oppressed from
younger<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.940> kind<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.239> gate<00:02:21.390> like<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:21.810> know

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900

you live that life you grow up in that
life<00:02:23.549> and<00:02:23.760> it's<00:02:23.849> ultimately<00:02:24.000> why<00:02:24.299> yeah<00:02:24.510> it's

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
life and it's ultimately why yeah it's

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.420

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
oppressive and depressing that's just

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.500 
oppressive and depressing that's just
the<00:02:29.099> life<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.459> live<00:02:29.610> so<00:02:29.819> it's<00:02:30.060> not<00:02:30.209> going

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
the life that you live so it's not going

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.059 
the life that you live so it's not going

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
to be as big an impact as something

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.070 
to be as big an impact as something
coming<00:02:32.370> alone<00:02:32.610> into<00:02:33.150> your<00:02:33.299> decent<00:02:33.720> life<00:02:33.930> and

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
coming alone into your decent life and

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.020 
coming alone into your decent life and
fucking<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.739> all<00:02:34.860> up<00:02:35.099> so<00:02:35.129> while<00:02:35.610> Aaron<00:02:35.910> again

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
fucking you all up so while Aaron again

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.030 
fucking you all up so while Aaron again
had<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.540> terrible<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.200> still<00:02:37.440> has<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.560> terrible

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
had it terrible and still has a terrible

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.800 
had it terrible and still has a terrible
ultimately<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:38.790> would<00:02:38.910> say<00:02:39.120> between<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:39.599> four

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
ultimately I would say between the four

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.380 
ultimately I would say between the four
of<00:02:39.840> them<00:02:40.049> he<00:02:40.560> grew<00:02:40.769> up<00:02:40.799> with<00:02:41.099> that<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.519> yeah<00:02:42.150> he

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
of them he grew up with that and yeah he

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.640 
of them he grew up with that and yeah he
lost<00:02:42.540> his<00:02:42.780> mom<00:02:42.930> along<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.319> way<00:02:43.409> and<00:02:43.560> again

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
lost his mom along the way and again

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.710 
lost his mom along the way and again
they've<00:02:43.920> all<00:02:44.099> lost<00:02:44.400> people<00:02:44.549> everyone<00:02:45.150> again

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
they've all lost people everyone again

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.960 
they've all lost people everyone again
I'm<00:02:45.930> comparing<00:02:46.349> them<00:02:46.620> for<00:02:47.280> people<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:47.760> have

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
I'm comparing them for people that have

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.759 
I'm comparing them for people that have
done<00:02:48.269> through<00:02:48.510> tragedy<00:02:48.989> so<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.170> obviously<00:02:49.500> have

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
done through tragedy so I obviously have

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.830 
done through tragedy so I obviously have
to<00:02:49.890> pick<00:02:50.099> somebody<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.640> I<00:02:50.670> would<00:02:50.790> say<00:02:50.910> between

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
to pick somebody and I would say between

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.210 
to pick somebody and I would say between
the<00:02:51.930> four<00:02:52.109> of<00:02:52.200> them<00:02:52.349> Aaron<00:02:52.680> definitely

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
the four of them Aaron definitely

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.089 
the four of them Aaron definitely
probably<00:02:53.579> not<00:02:54.390> had<00:02:54.629> it<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.840> easiest<00:02:55.379> and<00:02:55.920> any

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
probably not had it the easiest and any

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.640 
probably not had it the easiest and any
means<00:02:56.400> but<00:02:56.700> he<00:02:57.390> grew<00:02:58.170> up<00:02:58.200> with<00:02:58.500> these

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.160 
this would be a fun discussion something
a<00:05:00.550> little<00:05:00.760> bit<00:05:00.850> different<00:05:01.120> from<00:05:01.210> the<00:05:01.300> norm<00:05:01.570> who

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
a little bit different from the norm who

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.780 
a little bit different from the norm who
had<00:05:02.530> it<00:05:02.680> worse<00:05:02.710> if<00:05:03.070> you<00:05:03.160> only<00:05:03.430> seen<00:05:03.580> a<00:05:03.610> couple

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
had it worse if you only seen a couple

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.460 
had it worse if you only seen a couple
of<00:05:04.000> series<00:05:04.270> to<00:05:04.390> say<00:05:04.540> between<00:05:04.840> those<00:05:05.020> two<00:05:05.230> we

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
of series to say between those two we

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.870 
of series to say between those two we
think<00:05:05.710> had<00:05:05.830> it<00:05:05.860> worse<00:05:06.070> if<00:05:06.310> you<00:05:06.370> only<00:05:06.580> seen<00:05:06.730> one

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
think had it worse if you only seen one

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.190 
think had it worse if you only seen one
of<00:05:06.970> these<00:05:07.090> series<00:05:07.360> tell<00:05:07.540> me<00:05:07.660> why<00:05:07.840> do<00:05:07.900> you<00:05:08.110> think

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
of these series tell me why do you think

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.810

that<00:05:08.320> this<00:05:08.500> character<00:05:08.830> just<00:05:09.010> had<00:05:09.130> it<00:05:09.250> so<00:05:09.520> bad

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
that this character just had it so bad

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.820 
that this character just had it so bad
because<00:05:10.060> honestly<00:05:10.570> all<00:05:10.810> four<00:05:11.350> of<00:05:11.380> them<00:05:11.590> live

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
because honestly all four of them live

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.280
