gonna get a lot of attention but in the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.469 
gonna get a lot of attention but in the
long<00:01:16.799> run<00:01:16.830> it's<00:01:17.250> not<00:01:17.430> exactly<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.970> success

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479

you want I guess you can learn off of

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.590 
you want I guess you can learn off of
this<00:01:20.430> because<00:01:20.670> there<00:01:20.880> are<00:01:20.970> there<00:01:21.180> are<00:01:21.270> tons<00:01:21.479> of

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
this because there are there are tons of

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.499 
this because there are there are tons of
dislikes<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.320> video<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:23.280> lot<00:01:23.460> of

negative<00:01:24.509> comments<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.830> hope<00:01:26.159> she<00:01:26.340> can

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
negative comments so I hope she can

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
learn from this and kind of take a step

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.980 
learn from this and kind of take a step
back<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.400> really<00:01:29.610> concentrate<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.420> music

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990

back and really concentrate on the music
aspect<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.920> whole<00:01:32.070> thing<00:01:32.130> instead<00:01:32.610> of

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
aspect of the whole thing instead of

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.230 
aspect of the whole thing instead of
just<00:01:33.000> stripping<00:01:33.840> half<00:01:34.110> naked<00:01:34.560> too<00:01:35.150> just<00:01:36.150> for

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
just stripping half naked too just for

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.640 
just stripping half naked too just for
the<00:01:36.329> hell<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.229> yeah<00:01:37.350> I'm<00:01:37.470> not

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
the hell of it so yeah I'm not

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.289 
the hell of it so yeah I'm not
complaining<00:01:38.070> too<00:01:38.220> much<00:01:38.250> but<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:39.060> is

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
complaining too much but this is

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.649 
complaining too much but this is
definitely<00:01:39.540> nowhere<00:01:40.140> near<00:01:40.640> her<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.850> game<00:01:42.119> okay

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659
