00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.910 
hope we have to sharpen it okay here
where<00:00:34.620> we<00:00:34.739> start<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:36.469> TP<00:00:37.640> section<00:00:39.920> here

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
where we start in the TP section here

where we start in the TP section here
you<00:00:41.070> can<00:00:44.300> switch<00:00:45.300> TV<00:00:45.809> channels<00:00:46.820> let's<00:00:47.820> try<00:00:49.280> the

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
you can switch TV channels let's try the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:01:00.139 
you can switch TV channels let's try the
history<00:00:52.260> channel<00:00:58.370> actually<00:00:59.370> it's<00:00:59.520> nice<00:00:59.820> when

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
history channel actually it's nice when

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.969 
history channel actually it's nice when
it<00:01:00.270> works<00:01:00.570> but<00:01:00.930> i<00:01:02.359> think<00:01:03.359> about<00:01:03.949> fifty<00:01:04.949> percent

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
it works but i think about fifty percent

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.510 
it works but i think about fifty percent
of<00:01:05.400> all<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.119> channels<00:01:06.390> are<00:01:07.189> actually<00:01:08.189> not

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
of all the channels are actually not

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.620 
of all the channels are actually not
functioning<00:01:10.250> so<00:01:11.250> what<00:01:11.430> happens<00:01:11.760> when<00:01:12.030> we<00:01:12.240> to

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
functioning so what happens when we to

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.950 
functioning so what happens when we to
switch<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.470> another<00:01:13.830> channel<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.960> just

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
switch to another channel I just

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:24.469 
switch to another channel I just
selected<00:01:16.740> history<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:22.020> reads<00:01:22.380> busy<00:01:23.479> doesn't

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
selected history and reads busy doesn't

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.039 
selected history and reads busy doesn't
mean<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.659> thing<00:01:25.970> usually<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.119> right<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.630> runs

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
mean a thing usually it right it runs

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.499 
mean a thing usually it right it runs
busy<00:01:28.820> about<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> minute<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.479> then<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.780> quits

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
busy about a minute and then it quits

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.170 
busy about a minute and then it quits
because<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.259> doesn't<00:01:34.590> get<00:01:34.950> any<00:01:35.220> good

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180
