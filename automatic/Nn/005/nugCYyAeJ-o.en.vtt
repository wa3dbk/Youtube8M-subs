helped out my game a bunch since i've

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.800 
helped out my game a bunch since i've
started<00:00:29.189> using<00:00:29.550> them<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.000> hopefully<00:00:30.330> you

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
guys can learn something from it too so

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.990 
guys can learn something from it too so
the<00:00:33.630> first<00:00:33.960> tip<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.230> going<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.829> be<00:00:35.070> if<00:00:35.309> you're

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
the first tip is going to be if you're

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.600 
the first tip is going to be if you're
near<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.540> max<00:00:36.930> ammo<00:00:37.230> box<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.800> know<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.070> giant

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
near a max ammo box you know the giant

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.060 
near a max ammo box you know the giant
round<00:00:39.210> box<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.870> gives<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.260> max<00:00:40.559> metal<00:00:40.950> and

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
round box that gives you max metal and

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.790 
round box that gives you max metal and
ammo<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:42.600> build<00:00:42.840> your<00:00:42.960> nest<00:00:43.379> next<00:00:43.739> to

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
ammo and you build your nest next to

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.459 
ammo and you build your nest next to
that<00:00:44.329> use<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.600> metal<00:00:45.870> before<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.170> pick<00:00:46.350> it

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
that use that metal before you pick it

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.069 
that use that metal before you pick it
up<00:00:46.559> because<00:00:47.190> generally<00:00:47.910> what<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.300> see<00:00:48.600> most<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
up because generally what I see most the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.959 
up because generally what I see most the
time<00:00:49.260> people<00:00:49.800> will<00:00:50.010> have<00:00:50.280> like<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.760> hundred

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
time people will have like a hundred

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.569 
time people will have like a hundred
metal<00:00:51.480> or<00:00:51.629> 50<00:00:52.289> metal<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.739> they'll<00:00:53.160> just<00:00:53.430> go

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
metal or 50 metal and they'll just go

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.250 
metal or 50 metal and they'll just go
pick<00:00:53.820> up<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.090> box<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.420> refill<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:54.960> back<00:00:55.140> to

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
pick up the box and refill it back to

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.279 
pick up the box and refill it back to
200<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:56.399> box<00:00:56.670> only<00:00:56.940> puts<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.570> back<00:00:57.690> at<00:00:57.870> 200

it's just gonna only take up like an
extra<00:01:24.689> second<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.200> your<00:01:25.320> time<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:26.390> since

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
using this I have helped myself at a lot

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.460 
using this I have helped myself at a lot
I'll<00:01:29.909> see<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.600> don't<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.110> spend<00:01:31.320> as

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
I'll see that I don't have to spend as

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.830 
I'll see that I don't have to spend as
much<00:01:31.619> time<00:01:31.680> building<00:01:32.670> up<00:01:32.970> my<00:01:33.119> century<00:01:33.509> instead

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
much time building up my century instead

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.510 
much time building up my century instead
on<00:01:33.990> those<00:01:34.170> oh<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.590> only<00:01:34.710> needs<00:01:34.979> two<00:01:35.159> more<00:01:35.189> hits

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
on those oh it only needs two more hits

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.490 
on those oh it only needs two more hits
and<00:01:35.759> then<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.090> got<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> level<00:01:36.600> three<00:01:36.869> just<00:01:37.380> by

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
and then I got a level three just by

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.359 
and then I got a level three just by
doing<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:38.100> tip<00:01:39.380> so<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.470> next<00:01:40.740> tip<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:40.979> going

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
doing this tip so the next tip is going

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.999 
doing this tip so the next tip is going
to<00:01:41.460> be<00:01:41.670> being<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.659> little<00:01:42.899> more<00:01:43.079> proactive<00:01:43.829> as

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
to be being a little more proactive as

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.840 
to be being a little more proactive as
an<00:01:44.490> engineer<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.299> by<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.619> mean<00:01:46.850> instead

another<00:03:34.110> tip<00:03:34.470> is<00:03:34.620> going<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.459> be<00:03:35.670> a<00:03:35.910> little<00:03:36.180> bit

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
another tip is going to be a little bit

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.009 
another tip is going to be a little bit
of<00:03:36.420> situational<00:03:37.140> awareness<00:03:37.290> here<00:03:38.130> and

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
of situational awareness here and

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.870 
of situational awareness here and
involves<00:03:40.019> moving<00:03:40.380> your<00:03:40.680> buildings<00:03:41.160> according

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
involves moving your buildings according

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.449 
involves moving your buildings according
to<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.269> enemies<00:03:42.720> now<00:03:43.440> see<00:03:43.739> right<00:03:44.010> there<00:03:44.280> that

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
to the enemies now see right there that

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.940 
to the enemies now see right there that
dome<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:45.630> he<00:03:45.870> could<00:03:46.049> barely<00:03:46.350> see<00:03:46.920> my

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
dome and he could barely see my

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.670 
dome and he could barely see my
buildings<00:03:47.579> but<00:03:48.420> he<00:03:48.780> knew<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.200> general

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
buildings but he knew the general

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.220 
buildings but he knew the general
location<00:03:49.950> of<00:03:50.700> them<00:03:50.910> so<00:03:51.480> by<00:03:51.630> doing<00:03:51.690> that<00:03:51.989> he's

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
location of them so by doing that he's

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.740 
location of them so by doing that he's
just<00:03:52.410> able<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.709> pop<00:03:53.040> some<00:03:53.250> pipes<00:03:53.519> over<00:03:53.820> and<00:03:54.180> if

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
just able to pop some pipes over and if

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.750 
just able to pop some pipes over and if
he<00:03:54.989> stayed<00:03:55.470> alive<00:03:55.709> probably<00:03:56.160> a<00:03:56.220> few<00:03:56.370> stickies

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
he stayed alive probably a few stickies

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.550 
he stayed alive probably a few stickies
and<00:03:57.000> he<00:03:57.480> would<00:03:57.630> have<00:03:57.750> been<00:03:57.870> in<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:57.989> general

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
and he would have been in the general

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.560 
and he would have been in the general
area<00:03:58.799> of<00:03:59.160> my<00:03:59.430> buildings<00:03:59.820> and<00:04:00.030> just<00:04:00.329> been<00:04:00.450> able
