00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 I guess I can turn life around 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.189
 as well as awful and unpleasant 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.290
 suddenly beautiful can be wonderful 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.170
 that describes it goes this little 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.990
 Here she tells her novel nail free 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.490
 from her life and that starts all over 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.939
 unspectacular in Bavaria on one 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.980
 small Bavarian courtyard and experienced there 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.470
 she is all terrible her father stands 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.439
 in the second world war is called 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.590
 cannon fodder burned 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.960
 her mother is just disgusting to her and 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.719
 always lets her feel that she is not 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.290
 her stepfather is wanted raped 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.540
 and mistreated her one day 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.239
 the chance to escape but from the 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.590
 Hof and travels to Munich to get there 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.230
 to start a new life 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.930
 then she travels farther from the station 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.449
 station until she becomes a model and then 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.370
 with the orient nobility with the dancing 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.289
 then what starts later to the mobile 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.449
 schematically dances her because again converts 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.190
 she goes with a dance group in the 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.619
 ears and becomes a celebrated there 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.400
 star and even forgives one 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.479
 prince 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.119
 yes it is not a fairy tale it is her life 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.490
 it's about this insanely strong one 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.090
 Frau Elfriede Saddler you were the ndr 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.460
 talk show 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.840
 You can relate that to the interview 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.740
 you certainly still in the mediathek 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.930
 look at 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.600
 She has really experienced her life 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.210
 her life is really worth reading too 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.579
 be because it had so many ups and 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.860
 deep one wonders in the meantime 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.530
 how they got out of there and it 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.140
 it went on and on for her again and again 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.090
 is such an impressive book about 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.369
 an impressive woman that I can give you 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.770
 only warmly to heart 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.750
 who likes books about strong women who 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.640
 yourself for the orient or the 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.340
 oriental dance is interested 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.990
 here are certainly in good hands 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.750
 also pictures in the middle so that one 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.329
 the people can well imagine 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.390
 and maybe in all other impression 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.490
 get what it was for her then 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.509
 real estate then a celebrated star too 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.209
 yes as I said I can do it 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.580
 only recommend a life as in the fairy tale 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.520
 not even cinderella did it that way 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.620
 bad as you could anyway 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.750
 everything is still a wanderin a book 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.700
 that makes courage and women too, she says 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.190
 should tackle their own life 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.190
 in this sense until the next video
