00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.429 
much bigger now or they do more damage
or<00:02:21.889> something<00:02:22.340> many<00:02:22.909> enemies<00:02:23.359> see<00:02:23.959> you<00:02:24.049> hold<00:02:24.230> X

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:24.439 
or something many enemies see you hold X

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.309 
or something many enemies see you hold X
and<00:02:25.430> he<00:02:25.670> vomits<00:02:26.209> like<00:02:26.329> a<00:02:26.389> gajillion<00:02:26.599> lava

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
and he vomits like a gajillion lava

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:36.849 
and he vomits like a gajillion lava
balls

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.349 

like<00:02:37.859> I<00:02:37.920> just<00:02:37.950> feel<00:02:38.249> like<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.790> Magna<00:02:39.150> balls

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
like I just feel like the Magna balls

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.300 
like I just feel like the Magna balls
are<00:02:39.540> so<00:02:39.810> much<00:02:40.049> better<00:02:40.469> than<00:02:40.560> they<00:02:40.799> used<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.129> be

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
are so much better than they used to be

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:52.130 
are so much better than they used to be
which<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.549> phenomenal

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.810 

looks<00:02:52.890> like<00:02:53.040> they<00:02:53.130> might<00:02:53.280> have<00:02:53.340> nerfed<00:02:53.640> his

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
looks like they might have nerfed his

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:11.900 
looks like they might have nerfed his
damage<00:02:54.270> a<00:02:54.360> bit<00:02:54.540> though

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:24.119 

a<00:03:11.970> few<00:03:12.630> enemies<00:03:12.900> left

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:25.449 

uh-huh

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
uh-huh

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.460 
uh-huh
so<00:03:25.640> okay<00:03:25.970> see<00:03:26.030> if<00:03:26.239> you<00:03:26.329> get<00:03:26.450> hit<00:03:26.720> you<00:03:26.930> lose<00:03:26.959> the

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
so okay see if you get hit you lose the

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.940 
so okay see if you get hit you lose the
wild<00:03:27.860> probability<00:03:28.430> for<00:03:28.700> that<00:03:28.900> second<00:03:29.950> which

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
wild probability for that second which

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.720 
wild probability for that second which
makes<00:03:31.159> sense<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.610> make<00:03:31.760> it<00:03:31.849> fair<00:03:32.120> I<00:03:33.730> definitely

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
makes sense to make it fair I definitely

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.099 
makes sense to make it fair I definitely
feel<00:03:34.879> a<00:03:34.909> nerfed<00:03:35.209> his<00:03:35.390> damage<00:03:35.780> though<00:03:38.109> all

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109
