 champions you know how to play is just one 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.070
 rather than explaining that these 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.910
 champions without knowing can cause defeat 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.149
 of your team is a very serious thing 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:07.530

 But they set out to sit on the 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.799
 stool and the two are more 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.960
 that never champions much power both 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.659

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.990
 over there

 It's serious, I'm listening to voices . 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.310
 sunred hombo because it is the gods of the 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.500
 jungle that are threatening the animals 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.350
 our favorite friends who can 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.840
 save or destroy our following games 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.720
 the vai-vai of xix and ruan I basically 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.580
 I'm more to be a go shopping or street shopping 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.070
 because they have an innate ability 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.810
 very strong by chance the champion are already going 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.850
 unfortunately left this list but still 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.440
 a very champion so you want 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.630
 django or want to learn in this 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.190
 update you have the opportunity to 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.709
 perform their skill even the 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.080
 champions that in my opinion your ip 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.010
 spent will be worth it if you do not 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.010
 have the same 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:34.750
 ah I like the mx funk attack 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.970
 mikells at last we have e3 a funk gary 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.959
 old man counting on adins to turn around and 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.910
 occurs 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.349
 continuing with adins greivis and 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.600
 adding the following in this update 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.610
 We can have an extremely 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.530
 strong with the following god and the 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.330
 best of all we do not have so many 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.430
 mysteries to learn to play with the 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.440
 months, which makes its performance 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.380
 learning and knowledge with the champion 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.450
 easier and more objective and wider to 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.489
 First of all, I want a 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.860
 ue should know if to position because it is a 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.170
 positioning of which he will say hello 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.390
 I am dykes 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.519
 the way is to take the shots I think 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.130
 They'll talk what it's like to take a style. 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.920
 You'll already have your head cut in there. 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.340
 branch and the rest of the body there in the jungle 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.989
 huh 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.989
 We are going to be pro 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:30.440
 I heard blindam because it's the famous 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:33.170
 god of the tank or is top law - the largest 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.540
 variety of champions to choose from. 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.720
 is the top law is with the four champions 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.760
 they are the idea I kicked it like I 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.090
 said in my thirst video 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.400
 but it is not only in itself and I occurs are 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.379
 champions that if you master will give you a 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.340
 great power of game setting in 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.530
 your hands 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.989
 Ever thought these champions are already strong 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.470
 now imagine being the strongest of the 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:04:00.560
 top lenny in today's face and really 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.470
 Good old man but as I said at the beginning of 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.579
 video and poking without knowing how to master can 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.579
 be your worst choice 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.510
 now our dear helpers 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.930
 bosch lenny gods who endured the 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.970
 funk kerry and the 3 leona blitzkrieg jana 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.700
 are great supports even though I am 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.350
 preferring the lioness at that moment 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.300
 if you have someone who can play or even 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.970
 even you with one of these three champions 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.810
 the game you will give strong support to the 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.050
 your team 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.000
 This is that the hi too old lioness 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.130
 with its strong blitz tank power 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.510
 with his famous political floor and giana with 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.310
 their varieties 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.590
 so you even creating your move 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.860
 bright citing as an example the famous 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:48.130

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:52.660
 Leave it to abbott lenny it 's fine too 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:54.940
 Good, we can not say it's bad, but it's 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.310
 You have to know how to use the champions of 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.580
 The right way is not going to get any 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.590
 support not knowing right move 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.780

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:23.260
 kind to them but do not forget that 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.660
 having a notion of the champion is very 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.370
 important I did not mention much about the 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.040
 characteristics of the champions because I 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.500
 I will use them in the D series as I play bar 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.690
 precautionary measure that it is a series that 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.330
