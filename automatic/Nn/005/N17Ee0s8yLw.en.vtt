00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.310
 in this tutorial we will try 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.560
 here are some ways of operation 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.560
 with elements and mathematical functions 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:15.150
 it's very useful percent and what we're going to show 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.490
 and we are going to do it even though we try to do only its most basic aspect 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.130
 now it's very easy 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.449
 certainly approach how it develops 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.449
 aa great speed and with great complication 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:30.470
 as we will see 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.570
 mmm 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.670
 first the first one 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.670
 carrascosa that we are going to do 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.290
 it's percent in seeing that we have 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.510
 in one of these is function bubbles 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.650
 it's both input allows us to introduce functions through a 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.650
 panel anyone 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.810
 here on the panel we can write any function and when connecting 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.930
 It will be effective within the function 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.110
 It is very useful and highly recommended in any case that the conquero use the editor of 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.050
 functions that this inside the bubble itself 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.690
 we copied the function here they were a panel to always know that it works and 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.170
 inside this bubble 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.960
 when things get complicated it's better to have them 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.820
 house while outside that left us signs not 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.080
 to tell us that there is what is inside 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.689
 today to click twice these are p diapers that can produce 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:27.220
 with which we are going operation 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.220
 that's why I'm going to say it I think we'll have specific functions for 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.280
 a single entry 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.610
 standing and posters I throw another one that I will explain to a 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.440
 for which we were 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.440
 in is that we can specify both the name of these massacres 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.600
 as your number 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.520
 clicking twice will appear this screen often where we can 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.520
 to write 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.520
 percent the mathematical expression that we want 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.620
 all these are 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.080
 operations what can we do the only thing we have to be careful 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.540
 It is not the only problem that the only thing that one has to walk with eye is 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.020
 with the syntax 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.540
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.149
 there are certain things that will not be admitted 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.319
 and what talal errors 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.010
 percent something like this that I have not written anything yet but already talks about 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.369
 shin kak-soo ferrol 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:18.289
 the father of zeta expressions 

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:21.159
 the only thing that I do to the only thing that will have to be attended to will be the way in which 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:21.930
 it's written 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.589
 click here to use these guaranteed transactions that 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:28.959
 the way in which the operations are expressed in this the window will be 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:29.799
 The correct one 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.859
 does not have that advantage can also be prescribed naturally 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.999
 percent that your keyboard 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:40.159
 Finally pay attention to this display west button 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:42.019
 extra mu 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.420
 all the functions that are available and also its syntax 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.390
 a small description that serves quite little so 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.390
 I would ask you if you have a doubt, try and prove it 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:54.749
 but it is what 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:57.559
 I needed and probe like 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:58.859
 it is an adventure 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.389
 percent and sections table very 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:02.479
 little 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:04.129
 or with very little information 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.159
 and here and more functions than here that are available and that can be 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:08.749
 use but good is submerged 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:11.749
 l a lot more than enough 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:15.499
 percent is not interactive merlo that three copies 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.919
 in the functions of lucinda csis paying close attention to the way no 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.349
 they are written on it 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.989
 the circle functions window 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.049
 buoy write an example 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:28.309
 very easy 

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:29.349
 percent 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.389
 with so many variables that are going to be that I wanted and 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:33.389
 n for 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:34.740
 write a function 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.740
 anyone for example 

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:39.480
 now I use 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.209
 The sign 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.209
 the cendon function 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.749
 i used the variable 

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:48.830
 x for 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.009
 when entering this variable 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:53.329
 the summit in parentheses 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.049
 x everything that affects the function but must go in parentheses 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.590
 now he says what he is saying is that the aventino there is data for x and there is no 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:04.019
 data for and 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.359
 is a parameter is that we will have to go 2 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.109
 we say cocaign 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.909
 that is right now there is nothing here what we do is now give values ​​sa x 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:15.619
 and there 

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:17.790
 ares was very angry as discuss 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.159
 that's precisely why 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:22.159
 has no data n so we use liquid solids 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:27.879
 in principle we work with these values 

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:34.969
 already 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:35.950
 I will leave 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.759
 getting nervous 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:41.569
 n but of course it does not draw because it is because what it is returning are 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:42.789
 values 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.800
 true this organ a single hands 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.050
 what it does is to say that the function is calculated from our 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.889
 values 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.900
 and its corresponding in tikrit 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.370
 what we have to do to show a function is non tivo jalkh 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.870
 efe we ​​will have to make them points 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:01.560
 percent describe 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.400
 that function are therefore we are going to look for the bubble of the points 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:11.999
 to which alá that we have to introduce the sentences of xp and and from 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:15.240
 in this case we are going to work only the plane 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.389
 percent and kisic 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:22.639
 so the entrance of mint will leave free unless we want but we know 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.020
 what perfectly possible things 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:31.729
 ing n let's introduce their blades tantes values ​​on the x-axis that bases 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:33.469
 it's probably that he takes 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:36.469
 the function is non 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:39.550
 dressed we have given him a value 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.009
 and that this value changes as soon as 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:44.039
 as mutual lagarde 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:47.039
 I come from a new lose a new value 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:48.669
 to the function 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:51.330
 but we only have one point we want more points 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.699
 what do we have to do 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:55.839
 given more points 

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:58.839
 wings cut to these for either of the two 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:02.129
 concrete surely with a series not 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:03.900
 which is like we have not done 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.789
 so far we leave for example 10 points 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:09.879
 with which we will give values ​​a to the x 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:12.400
 there are traces 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.569
 with these kirk values 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:18.409
 becker emphasizes that the value of the x and the iss are not the same as 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:20.860
 these that are coordinated from the points 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:21.689
 and these are 

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:25.219
 variables of the function are called equal but we can change the name 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:28.759
 it's called the same but they do not do the same thing in fact they do not have anything 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:33.919
 let's see the new values ​​n the nup the same amount of points that we have 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:34.550
 dice 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:35.919
 to the function 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:39.099
 what the d coordinates romo sabas 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.389
 and we have seen that 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:45.389
 and you start to write lacko 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:48.189
 for one hundrerd 

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:51.179
 once this is done so we will have to push and look for the personal cure 

00:06:51.179 --> 00:06:53.300
 it's more than going 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.389
 now percent in a curve 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:59.729
 with this format and tissues between a curve 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:02.839
 see what we can control with eye nodes let's say more 

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:04.849
 in plant 

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:08.900
 oo to a normal interpolated curve I think it will be the most appiah 

00:07:09.809 --> 00:07:13.159
 these are the vertices on which we are going to draw the curve 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.520
 i have no more than drew if we want to see it more clearly 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.259
 we can make the points disappear 

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:23.080
 and we'll see the curve perfectly drawn a curve 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.199
 which on the other hand is perfectly manageable 

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:29.629
 in the terms of modification we have already sustained the modifications 

00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:31.159
 corresponding 

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:33.139
 through this idea sixth box 

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:35.559
 we can also do 

00:07:35.559 --> 00:07:39.119
 the modification before this curve 

00:07:39.119 --> 00:07:40.869
 but the modification this function 

00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:43.460
 will provide us with any kind of 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.389
 curve 

00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:47.039
 chess that your account 

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:50.189
 by the way perfectly operable element within the operas as 

00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:52.349
 any other thing that is to say 

00:07:52.349 --> 00:07:56.050
 can produce extrusions surfaces and any kind of 

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.629
 objects that we can handle 

00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:59.299
 this is all
