 good afternoon hi carlos what's up 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:20.340
 this woman who has this very red but 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:25.710
 at the same time, it is not to be shaken 6/2 a 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:29.460
 screw since when I took a shower 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.259
 It thinks it was on Saturday as he usually 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.669
 spend every time we go we demand the 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.669
 I work with what I am 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.410
 is the one that had bad through the other the 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.770
 right to see little mouse we're going to 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.680
 remove the coat 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.130
 now look how I have it all fit 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.130
 in the same 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.210
 it is worth otherwise that such good 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.210
 otherwise very good ear 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.890
 well let's see the heart and now you 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.090
 we look 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.090
 the flowers are worth it 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:15.340
 all good, all right, let's see the 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:19.859
 ear helps the signs 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.859
 says that now we see it 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.610
 now the other very well 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.610
 this is the one that I think is wrong 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.110
 good as much as it is fatal 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.619
 and bad 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.490
 very bad on the outside 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.210
 and because 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.330
 yes but we're just going to clean before 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.830
 how rough I looked at that no taiz if it 's the 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.830
 secretion that comes out inside 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.270
 and keep in mind that these dogs have 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.990
 the ears down the duct 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.150
 ventilate little or nothing 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.570
 and sometimes there are some who have a little 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.570
 of sensitivity 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.110
 to suffer otitis 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.570
 and we will take a sample for 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.170
 look at the microscope and we're going to put 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.170
 cleaner 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.680
 do not 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.580
 good carlos pretty nothing we have seen that 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.930
 have an otitis 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.940
 then I'm going to put him a little 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.490
 of cleaner to remove all the sidewalk 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.250
 and I'm going to send you a few drops if you notice 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.140
 that is scratched or shaken or any 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.750
 something else is better if you come soon 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.360
 to prevent otitis is worth in the 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.770
 bathrooms since we know it is a dog 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.780
 sensible to be careful even if you do not 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.110
 drop a lot of water in your ears if you want 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.480
 you can put some cotton plugs 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.460
 to isi that maybe revisions 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.580
 periodically to prevent otitis from being 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.230
 chronic or or that when the when the 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.850
 let's detect ourselves and to the ear be 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.510
 too bad and we need a lot more 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.510
 treatment time
