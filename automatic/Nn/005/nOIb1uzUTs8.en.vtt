girls go bad by cobra starship and I

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.969

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
think the courts for that are a minor C

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.750 
think the courts for that are a minor C

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
example I can give because there's no

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.749 
example I can give because there's no
way<00:02:03.710> if<00:02:03.830> you<00:02:03.890> look<00:02:03.979> for<00:02:04.130> bass<00:02:04.280> have<00:02:04.520> four<00:02:04.670> you

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
way if you look for bass have four you

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.310 
way if you look for bass have four you
won't<00:02:04.880> find<00:02:05.090> me<00:02:05.180> you<00:02:05.539> won't<00:02:05.690> find<00:02:05.810> bass<00:02:05.990> covers

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
won't find me you won't find bass covers

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.559 
won't find me you won't find bass covers
for<00:02:06.500> that<00:02:06.619> but<00:02:07.399> you<00:02:07.700> can<00:02:07.729> find<00:02:08.000> chords<00:02:08.390> for

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
for that but you can find chords for

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:09.850 
for that but you can find chords for
that<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:08.959> can<00:02:09.110> find<00:02:09.289> people<00:02:09.590> playing

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
that you can find people playing

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.070 
that you can find people playing
acoustic<00:02:10.310> guitar<00:02:10.580> to<00:02:10.700> it<00:02:10.729> and<00:02:10.940> acoustic<00:02:11.810> edges

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
acoustic guitar to it and acoustic edges

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.660 
acoustic guitar to it and acoustic edges
they<00:02:12.170> play<00:02:12.319> a<00:02:12.470> minor<00:02:12.709> then<00:02:13.069> that<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.370> don't<00:02:13.580> know

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
they play a minor then that I don't know

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.750 
they play a minor then that I don't know
but<00:02:14.239> anything<00:02:14.510> like<00:02:14.930> um<00:02:15.459> let's<00:02:16.459> say<00:02:16.610> your

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
but anything like um let's say your

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.800 
but anything like um let's say your
chords<00:02:17.120> are<00:02:17.269> a<00:02:18.880> fcg<00:02:19.880> right<00:02:20.360> which<00:02:20.660> are

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
chords are a fcg right which are

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:32.460 
chords are a fcg right which are
actually<00:02:21.140> that<00:02:21.260> same<00:02:21.470> time<00:02:21.680> so<00:02:21.860> a

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.350 

I<00:02:34.860> got<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.890> video<00:02:36.220> on<00:02:36.250> theory<00:02:36.820> where<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:37.150> tells

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
I got a video on theory where it tells

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.800 
I got a video on theory where it tells
you<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:38.170> letters<00:02:38.530> that<00:02:38.920> you<00:02:39.910> have<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.150> every

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
you the letters that you have to every

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.930 
you the letters that you have to every
note<00:02:40.990> on<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.290> fret<00:02:41.500> board<00:02:41.700> look<00:02:42.700> up<00:02:42.820> that

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
note on the fret board look up that

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.220 
note on the fret board look up that
video<00:02:43.210> to<00:02:43.390> know<00:02:43.510> what<00:02:43.720> you<00:02:43.810> know<00:02:43.900> where<00:02:44.080> you're

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
video to know what you know where you're

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.230 
video to know what you know where you're
at<00:02:44.260> but<00:02:44.890> uh<00:02:44.950> so<00:02:45.430> how<00:02:45.580> do<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.700> know<00:02:45.820> that's<00:02:46.030> the

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
at but uh so how do you know that's the

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.870 
at but uh so how do you know that's the
a<00:02:46.270> note<00:02:46.570> you<00:02:46.600> have<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:46.840> play<00:02:47.020> now<00:02:47.560> usually<00:02:47.920> what

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
a note you have to play now usually what

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.420 
a note you have to play now usually what
you<00:02:49.000> do<00:02:49.180> is<00:02:49.480> you<00:02:49.960> start<00:02:50.380> off<00:02:50.590> with<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:51.010> basic

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
you do is you start off with the basic

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.260 
you do is you start off with the basic
so<00:02:51.640> I<00:02:51.880> say<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.570> say<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:53.220> basic<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.370> is<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.850> open<00:02:55.150> a

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
so I say I say a basic a is the open a

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.850 
so I say I say a basic a is the open a
string<00:02:55.300> and<00:02:56.230> then<00:02:56.410> I<00:02:56.590> would<00:02:56.710> play

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
string and then I would play

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.800 
string and then I would play
corresponding<00:02:57.400> I<00:02:57.430> play<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:58.060> C<00:02:58.330> on<00:02:58.540> that<00:02:58.780> a

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
corresponding I play the the C on that a

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.590 
corresponding I play the the C on that a
string<00:02:59.200> you<00:03:00.130> can<00:03:00.160> move<00:03:00.430> octaves<00:03:01.030> you<00:03:01.150> can<00:03:01.480> play

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
string you can move octaves you can play

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.210 
string you can move octaves you can play
open<00:03:01.960> a<00:03:02.080> here<00:03:02.500> you<00:03:02.530> can<00:03:02.800> you<00:03:02.920> know<00:03:03.010> you<00:03:03.100> can

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
open a here you can you know you can

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.820 
open a here you can you know you can
count<00:03:03.370> a<00:03:03.700> anywhere<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.240> down<00:03:04.930> or<00:03:05.260> up<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.590> neck

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
count a anywhere a down or up the neck

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.180 
count a anywhere a down or up the neck
and<00:03:06.010> play<00:03:06.580> there<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.900> see<00:03:08.740> which<00:03:08.860> one<00:03:09.010> sounds

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
and play there to see which one sounds

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.550 
and play there to see which one sounds
right<00:03:09.490> though<00:03:09.850> any<00:03:10.360> a<00:03:10.630> note<00:03:10.930> is<00:03:11.140> gonna<00:03:11.350> sound

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
right though any a note is gonna sound

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.990 
right though any a note is gonna sound
correct<00:03:11.920> just<00:03:12.130> they're<00:03:12.310> gonna<00:03:12.400> be<00:03:12.550> octaves

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
correct just they're gonna be octaves

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.740 
correct just they're gonna be octaves
deeper<00:03:13.660> higher<00:03:13.930> or<00:03:14.110> lower<00:03:14.260> um<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:16.150> after<00:03:16.450> that

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
deeper higher or lower um so after that

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.840 
deeper higher or lower um so after that
you<00:03:16.960> can<00:03:17.140> there's<00:03:17.560> improvisation<00:03:18.220> there<00:03:18.490> you

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
you can there's improvisation there you

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.830 
you can there's improvisation there you
can<00:03:19.000> play<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.270> a<00:03:19.300> note<00:03:19.600> play<00:03:20.440> a<00:03:20.470> fifth<00:03:21.840> maybe

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
can play the a note play a fifth maybe

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:32.610 
can play the a note play a fifth maybe
not

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.440 

or<00:03:33.620> just<00:03:34.040> me<00:03:34.370> I<00:03:34.400> can't<00:03:34.820> take<00:03:35.000> a<00:03:35.030> hit<00:03:35.210> the<00:03:35.300> time

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
or just me I can't take a hit the time

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:51.760 
or just me I can't take a hit the time
but<00:03:35.660> you<00:03:36.440> can<00:03:36.530> just<00:03:36.680> play<00:03:36.830> it<00:03:36.860> fits

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.740 

so<00:03:52.770> um<00:03:52.980> basically<00:03:53.790> what<00:03:54.390> you're<00:03:54.510> doing<00:03:54.540> is

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
so um basically what you're doing is

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.900 
so um basically what you're doing is
just<00:03:54.900> adding<00:03:55.220> when<00:03:56.220> you<00:03:56.310> play<00:03:56.460> power<00:03:56.670> berry

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
just adding when you play power berry

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.850 
just adding when you play power berry
play<00:03:57.060> a<00:03:57.090> root<00:03:57.300> fifth<00:03:57.600> an<00:03:57.780> octave<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.410> just<00:03:58.620> add

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
play a root fifth an octave you just add

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.260 
play a root fifth an octave you just add
a<00:03:58.920> fifth<00:03:59.220> yet<00:03:59.430> that<00:03:59.610> second<00:03:59.970> note<00:04:00.060> of<00:04:00.120> the

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
a fifth yet that second note of the

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.960 
a fifth yet that second note of the
Parker<00:04:03.110> so<00:04:04.110> I'm<00:04:04.620> not<00:04:04.800> gonna<00:04:04.950> go<00:04:05.160> too<00:04:05.220> deep<00:04:05.760> and

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
Parker so I'm not gonna go too deep and

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.030 
Parker so I'm not gonna go too deep and
explaining<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.750> entire<00:04:06.990> theory<00:04:07.770> for<00:04:07.980> that

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
explaining the entire theory for that

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.080 
explaining the entire theory for that
and<00:04:08.400> am<00:04:08.460> I<00:04:08.520> gonna<00:04:08.640> make<00:04:08.760> it<00:04:08.880> too<00:04:08.970> complicated

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
and am I gonna make it too complicated

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.180 
and am I gonna make it too complicated
I'm<00:04:09.810> just<00:04:09.960> gonna<00:04:10.080> say<00:04:10.260> that<00:04:10.440> if<00:04:10.860> you<00:04:10.980> can<00:04:11.070> find

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
I'm just gonna say that if you can find

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.470 
I'm just gonna say that if you can find
the<00:04:11.340> course<00:04:11.550> for<00:04:11.790> it<00:04:11.880> even<00:04:12.090> even<00:04:12.330> if<00:04:12.420> you

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
the course for it even even if you

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.270 
the course for it even even if you
listen<00:04:12.810> you<00:04:12.900> can<00:04:12.930> listen<00:04:13.290> you<00:04:13.470> can<00:04:13.590> basically

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
listen you can listen you can basically

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.100 
listen you can listen you can basically
kind<00:04:14.760> of<00:04:14.820> like<00:04:14.940> hear<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.480> bass<00:04:15.630> line<00:04:15.870> you<00:04:15.990> can

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.110 
kind of like hear the bass line you can

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.590 
kind of like hear the bass line you can
kind<00:04:16.290> of<00:04:16.320> go<00:04:16.440> for<00:04:16.680> a<00:04:17.000> listen<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.060> it<00:04:18.120> by<00:04:18.209> ear<00:04:18.450> as

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
kind of go for a listen to it by ear as
