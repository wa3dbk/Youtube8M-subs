00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:04.740
 hi everyone today we get 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.870
 found for a video of recipes that 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.429
 I was asked a lot on my 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.150
 account instagram and in comments on 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.370
 Youtube 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.099
 it's about pea-based recipes 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.170
 chickens and wants to start with that of 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.910
 falafels and as I want it to be the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.410
 healthier possible I'm not going to them 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.920
 fry but I will pass them to 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.990
 oven as an ingredient I use 200 g of 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.910
 dry chickpeas not in box it's very 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.160
 important it's really bad 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.840
 shot in the end believe me I do not have 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.189
 learned in the sweet way I'm going 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.590
 soak the chickpeas for 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.420
 a night in enough water because 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.790
 that it tends to still absorb 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.550
 a lot of water I also use an onion 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.620
 parsley spices like delahaye in 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.480
 powder of cumin and coriander 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.309
 but you can put other spices 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.719
 it's according to your tastes I'm going to cut 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.550
 roughly my onions and I'm going 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.469
 do the same thing with parsley this 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.149
 will be easier to mix in a robot 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.530
 blender or in a bowl I'm going to put 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.210
 all my ingredients and I'm going all 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.100
 simply mix until everything 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.289
 be completely crushed and the mixture 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.000
 homogeneous but as chickpeas do not 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.360
 are not cooked the texture will not be 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.920
 then smooth with my hands I'm going 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.630
 to form little balls that I 'm going 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.280
 slightly flatten and I'm going to them 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.270
 place on a baking sheet 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.270
 with parchment paper 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.320
 I will cook for 40 minutes 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.640
 at 180 Â°, giving a grill 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.369
 end of cooking to brown 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.930
 falafels and that's usually I eat 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.240
 falafels with a wheat cake and 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.340
 some credited I accompany everything 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.780
 a homemade yoghurt sauce and 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.250
 of mint but do not hesitate to me 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.810
 leave your suggestions and comments 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.540
 I always try to find the sauce 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.710
 which will fit perfectly for the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.750
 second recipe I will make the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.979
 hummus is really very very simple to 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.869
 do it and it's delicious for 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.100
 accompany these types of raw vegetables or 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.470
 aperitif or snack 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.240
 I will use 100 g of chickpeas 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.009
 dry I'll go again let 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.570
 soak overnight but I'm going 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.640
 also cook them for an hour 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.270
 and in the end remove the skin that 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.470
 envelope 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.850
 this step is optional but it is 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.950
 really the best to have or foam 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.540
 ultra creamy ellis you can 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.250
 however, use of chickpeas 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.640
 box this time it works too very 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.409
 very well 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.980
 as I said I'll put like in 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.010
 the falafels of cumin garlic 2 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.570
 coriander I'm going to add salt and I 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.760
 will also put black olives 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.350
 it's totally optional but I have 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.720
 tasted that when i was in barcelona is 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.910
 really it was hyper hyper perfumed 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.920
 and finally I'm going to use the juice of a 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.240
 half a lemon if you do not like it 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.220
 I was not and if you love 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.560
 put in more I'm just going 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.120
 everything even in a mixer robot and that's it 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.040
 I let it spin until the 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.020
 consistency is smooth and homogeneous 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.610
 I also add a little water between two 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.680
 shots blender until the 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.260
 creamy texture the most perfect and 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.240
 this is serious does not it 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.950
 looks delicious eight months in the 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.260
