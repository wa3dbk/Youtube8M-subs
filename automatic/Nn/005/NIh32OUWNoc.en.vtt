 pepper soy sauce must come down below 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:01:01.859
 is initially cut our rock rap 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:07.290
 somewhat small even to write then looks 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:09.810
 the complete compensation certainly very 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.689
 fixed big advantage hokkaido pumpkin he 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.430
 does not have to be peeled 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.140
 and he certainly belongs to the 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:22.860
 Lakers in addition to the character must be up to 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.540
 for very aromatic tasty one 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.009
 that's just a little bit of a vestner 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.970
 stop 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.970
 we we throw our hearts to 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.870
 coconut oil is enough 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.820
 can you calm the pumpkin now? 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.820
 Enter parties best 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.070
 cut willy cruiser seiling am 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:13.370
 best with really sharp knife 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:14.810
 possible thin slices who comes the same 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.790
 in the hot pan that is also very 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.739
 important then he immediately draws water and 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.510
 does not taste 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.910
 that's why wait first the browser 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.580
 that too the pumpkin of the herbs longer 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.140
 the side is basically one minute 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:33.319
 not even finished the others 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.730
 ingredients are spring leeks there 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.890
 Let's just do it 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.150
 the festivals below 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.970
 the roast with and the green 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.440
 we use that completely fresh 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.769
 nice if you tilt it so easily 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:53.780
 cuts that too very expensive 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:56.980
 out of wrestler so far and the rest 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.980
 coming 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:06.650
 At the moment I can be shot 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.960
 the beautiful in such a grill pan a 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:14.810
 nice picture like investor on top 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:16.040
 tastes delicious can be 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:23.110
 Of course, it's also easy to bake 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.110
 make olive oil salt pepper garlic 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.360
 It does not even have to be that big 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.140
 be cut 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.800
 but now to manage the whole big one 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.800
 needed now 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.730
 a little bit more is added 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:03.280
 will that make one too 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:05.110
 You can also do very thin films 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.760
 There is also the majority in Bahrain 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:12.599
 then normal kitchens go in very well 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.599
 good that over the pumpkin 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.330
 he can still 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.250
 because the beautiful cult stripes really 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.260
 of course a bit of a picture 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.460
 That's why we go the pulse run 1 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.890
 that does not have to be yes in principle 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:15.490
 even ready 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:16.090
 Losing it is so beautiful 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.530
 purely 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.750
 there it is not that dallas 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.490
 broken into 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.880
 very briefly in the first ever out 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:36.060
 direct noise maturity that makes it easy 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:36.060
 ever continue to do it for him 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.990
 something has to be done 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.220
 both sides 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.790
 the neutral must or not 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.140
 with sugar or something 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.020
 agile salts is or completely central 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:15.740
 that is very close 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.740
 early loud schneider ever 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:37.890
 Chinese coriander green would too 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.930
 still great fit 

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:47.000
 the first time has been with me already 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:47.000
 by ok then we set up times 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.110
 are ling 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.740
 the whole thing is now a vegan recipe 

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.500
 would also be very good with tofu 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.420
 fit in 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:12.260
 He likes to like meat from gossamer 

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:13.220
 fried strips beef or as 

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:17.180
 roast beef is also delicious 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:19.700
 taste or salmon very thin or 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.010
 Smoked salmon would go and teach 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.570
 Graphic salmon dish probably 

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:25.820
 suggestion would be better which salmon we 

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:27.800
 maybe a little too soon, too 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.460
 made super healthy relatively quickly 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.460
 delicious 

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:36.140
 that's my taste and sweetened sweet 

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:38.060
 chili sauce to the course alternative 

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:41.410
 to peanut butter would fit very well 

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.410
 or both hold
