00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
made in the USA i think that anything

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.420 
made in the USA i think that anything
that<00:02:57.070> is<00:02:57.310> made<00:02:57.430> in<00:02:57.580> in<00:02:57.700> in<00:02:57.940> france<00:02:58.870> is<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.590> little

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
that is made in in in france is a little

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.200 
that is made in in in france is a little
bit<00:03:00.580> better<00:03:01.420> quality<00:03:02.070> but<00:03:03.070> especially<00:03:03.880> i

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
bit better quality but especially i

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.750 
bit better quality but especially i
would<00:03:04.570> expect<00:03:04.930> that<00:03:04.990> with<00:03:05.530> these<00:03:05.740> purses<00:03:06.610> to

honest<00:04:32.349> with<00:04:32.500> you<00:04:32.650> is<00:04:32.860> because<00:04:33.039> I<00:04:33.669> just

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
honest with you is because I just

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.219 
honest with you is because I just
thought<00:04:34.389> that<00:04:34.449> this<00:04:34.840> is<00:04:34.990> such<00:04:35.169> a<00:04:35.199> nice<00:04:35.530> and

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
thought that this is such a nice and

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.870 
thought that this is such a nice and
expensive<00:04:38.229> investment<00:04:39.009> that<00:04:39.250> I<00:04:39.280> thought<00:04:39.610> that

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
expensive investment that I thought that

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.640 
expensive investment that I thought that
it<00:04:39.970> would<00:04:40.090> might<00:04:40.389> as<00:04:40.569> well<00:04:40.780> get<00:04:41.020> a<00:04:41.080> pop<00:04:41.440> of

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
it would might as well get a pop of

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.370 
it would might as well get a pop of
color<00:04:41.949> I<00:04:42.190> might<00:04:42.789> as<00:04:42.880> well<00:04:43.060> make<00:04:43.690> it<00:04:43.750> stand<00:04:44.169> out

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
color I might as well make it stand out

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.930 
color I might as well make it stand out
more<00:04:44.620> because<00:04:44.860> it<00:04:45.009> already<00:04:45.160> is<00:04:45.430> such<00:04:45.910> a

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
more because it already is such a

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.409 
more because it already is such a
special<00:04:46.419> bag<00:04:46.569> because<00:04:47.470> of<00:04:47.620> how<00:04:48.490> pretty<00:04:48.849> the

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
special bag because of how pretty the

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.870 
special bag because of how pretty the
Vernie<00:04:50.080> leather<00:04:50.380> looks<00:04:50.740> I<00:04:51.039> thought<00:04:51.550> I<00:04:51.580> might

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
Vernie leather looks I thought I might

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.450 
Vernie leather looks I thought I might
as<00:04:52.030> well<00:04:52.150> go<00:04:52.360> for<00:04:52.569> the<00:04:52.810> red<00:04:53.229> so<00:04:53.919> that<00:04:54.130> is<00:04:54.280> how<00:04:54.430> I

decided<00:04:54.910> on<00:04:55.120> that<00:04:55.270> um<00:04:56.169> I<00:04:56.229> believe<00:04:56.590> I<00:04:56.979> have

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
decided on that um I believe I have

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.050
