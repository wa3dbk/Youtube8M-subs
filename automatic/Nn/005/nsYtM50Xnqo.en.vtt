the<00:00:50.460> current<00:00:50.789> state<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:52.969> little<00:00:53.969> bit<00:00:54.090> of

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
the current state so a little bit of

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.330 
the current state so a little bit of
trimming<00:00:54.449> up<00:00:54.809> that's<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.530> contacts<00:00:55.980> event

you're<00:00:56.460> seeing<00:00:56.699> pull<00:00:56.879> up<00:00:57.059> they're<00:00:57.270> not<00:00:57.300> tape

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
you're seeing pull up they're not tape

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.549 
you're seeing pull up they're not tape
residue<00:00:58.789> it<00:00:59.789> does<00:01:00.030> seem<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.449> have<00:01:00.719> held<00:01:00.930> pretty

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
residue it does seem to have held pretty

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.860 
residue it does seem to have held pretty
well<00:01:01.890> let's<00:01:02.370> see<00:01:02.489> even<00:01:02.789> now<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.480> I'm<00:01:03.629> seeing

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
well let's see even now and I'm seeing

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.050 
well let's see even now and I'm seeing
cracks<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.159> couldn't<00:01:05.489> see<00:01:05.640> when<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> tape

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
cracks that I couldn't see when the tape

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.899 
cracks that I couldn't see when the tape
was<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.770> so<00:01:07.770> basically<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.400> problem<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.850> I

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
was in so basically the problem that I

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.240 
was in so basically the problem that I
have<00:01:09.180> with<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.510> foam<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.780> like<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.890> repair

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
have with this foam is like you repair

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.859 
have with this foam is like you repair
one<00:01:11.460> crack<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.060> then<00:01:12.150> another<00:01:12.390> one<00:01:12.540> appears

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
one crack and then another one appears

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.990 
one crack and then another one appears
above<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.460> keeps<00:01:14.729> happening

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
above it and it just keeps happening

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.780 
above it and it just keeps happening
over<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.600> over<00:01:15.720> again<00:01:16.250> and<00:01:17.250> I've<00:01:17.580> already

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
over and over again and I've already

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.480 
over and over again and I've already
done<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.720> small<00:01:18.990> section<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.860> Sun

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
done this in a small section of a Sun

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.870 
done this in a small section of a Sun
beater<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:21.090> beater<00:01:21.720> pair<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.140> these<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.380> had

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
beater a beater pair of these I had

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.460 
beater a beater pair of these I had
where<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.090> whole<00:01:24.659> toppers<00:01:25.140> are<00:01:25.290> kind<00:01:25.439> of

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
where the whole toppers are kind of

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.109 
where the whole toppers are kind of
messed<00:01:25.680> up<00:01:25.890> these<00:01:26.189> these<00:01:26.400> uppers<00:01:26.759> are<00:01:26.790> really

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
messed up these these uppers are really

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.319 
messed up these these uppers are really
pretty<00:01:27.360> clean<00:01:27.720> there's<00:01:28.790> not<00:01:29.790> much<00:01:29.939> wrong<00:01:30.210> with

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
pretty clean there's not much wrong with

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.410 
pretty clean there's not much wrong with
it<00:01:30.479> at<00:01:30.570> all<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:34.009> just<00:01:35.009> do<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.299> air

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
it at all and just do you the air

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.440 
it at all and just do you the air
bubbles<00:01:36.810> are<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.049> little<00:01:37.200> bit<00:01:37.350> ago<00:01:37.590> but<00:01:38.450> anyway

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
bubbles are a little bit ago but anyway

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.560 
bubbles are a little bit ago but anyway
the<00:01:39.659> problem<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.850> continually<00:01:41.850> happens<00:01:42.299> is

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
the problem that continually happens is

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.990 
the problem that continually happens is
they<00:01:42.720> just<00:01:42.930> keep<00:01:43.710> finding<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.250> new<00:01:44.460> layer<00:01:44.729> to

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
they just keep finding a new layer to

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.789 
they just keep finding a new layer to
split<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> new<00:01:45.659> layer<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.020> split<00:01:46.320> above<00:01:46.590> the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
split and a new layer to split above the

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.319 
split and a new layer to split above the
one<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.189> glued<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.909> just<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.299> like

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
one that you glued and it just is like

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.170 
one that you glued and it just is like
this<00:01:48.659> never-ending<00:01:48.990> process<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:50.180> eventually

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
this never-ending process and eventually

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.340 
this never-ending process and eventually
end<00:01:51.329> up<00:01:51.420> with<00:01:51.479> more<00:01:51.720> glue<00:01:52.020> than<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.259> have

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
end up with more glue than you have

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.859 
end up with more glue than you have
phone<00:01:53.000> so<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.060> doesn't<00:01:54.360> look<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:54.540> I'll<00:01:54.780> be

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
phone so it doesn't look like I'll be

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.920 
phone so it doesn't look like I'll be
able<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.170> wear<00:01:55.320> these<00:01:55.500> today<00:01:56.750> which<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.780> a

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
able to wear these today which is a

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.749 
able to wear these today which is a
shame<00:01:58.229> because<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.829> think<00:01:58.890> they<00:01:59.189> literally

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
shame because I think they literally

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
so it's midsole a bit swap this will

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.270 
so it's midsole a bit swap this will
swap<00:02:11.810> or<00:02:12.050> bust<00:02:12.320> on<00:02:12.560> these<00:02:12.740> there's<00:02:13.100> really

swap or bust on these there's really

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.050 
swap or bust on these there's really
nothing<00:02:13.700> more<00:02:13.850> that<00:02:13.910> can<00:02:14.360> be<00:02:14.420> done<00:02:16.060> it's
