we're<00:01:15.810> going<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.080> be<00:01:16.250> modeling<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.460> piece<00:01:18.450> of

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
we're going to be modeling a piece of

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.149 
we're going to be modeling a piece of
toast<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:20.900> in<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.110> description<00:01:22.350> box<00:01:23.479> I've

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
toast and in the description box I've

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.240 
toast and in the description box I've
I've<00:01:26.240> linked<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.630> an<00:01:27.720> image<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.860> our

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
I've linked to an image this is our

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.969 
I've linked to an image this is our
reference<00:01:29.939> image<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.780> also<00:01:31.020> our<00:01:31.439> texture

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
reference image it is also our texture

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.050 
reference image it is also our texture
so<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.900> was<00:01:34.380> really<00:01:34.590> sloppy<00:01:35.040> put<00:01:35.490> together<00:01:35.700> by

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
so it was really sloppy put together by

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.740 
so it was really sloppy put together by
me<00:01:36.979> but<00:01:37.979> we'll<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.579> pull<00:01:38.850> up<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.180> image<00:01:39.390> oh

your cube here oh by the way two things
no<00:02:05.909> two<00:02:06.390> things<00:02:06.689> actually<00:02:07.369> well<00:02:08.869> this<00:02:09.869> object

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
no two things actually well this object

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.890 
no two things actually well this object
if<00:02:11.340> you're<00:02:11.580> if<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.150> are<00:02:12.239> like<00:02:12.420> me<00:02:12.599> when<00:02:12.780> you're

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
if you're if you are like me when you're

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.200 
if you're if you are like me when you're
using<00:02:13.140> blender

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
using blender

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.860 
using blender
you<00:02:15.210> move<00:02:16.170> around<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.620> objects<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.130> lot<00:02:17.870> don't

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
you move around the objects a lot don't

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.660 
you move around the objects a lot don't
do<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.200> when<00:02:19.800> you're<00:02:19.920> modeling<00:02:20.220> for<00:02:20.430> source

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
do that when you're modeling for source

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.440 
do that when you're modeling for source
because<00:02:21.420> if<00:02:22.080> if<00:02:22.560> your<00:02:22.980> your<00:02:23.640> object<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.270> off

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
because if if your your object is off

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.740 
because if if your your object is off
centered<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.170> off<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.790> scene<00:02:27.270> center<00:02:28.130> then

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
centered is off the scene center then

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.950 
centered is off the scene center then
they're<00:02:30.750> going<00:02:30.960> to<00:02:31.080> show<00:02:31.290> up<00:02:31.500> off<00:02:32.660> centered<00:02:33.660> in

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
they're going to show up off centered in

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.990 
they're going to show up off centered in
half-life<00:02:34.620> 2<00:02:35.600> so<00:02:36.600> don't<00:02:37.050> do<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.550> just<00:02:38.550> keep

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
half-life 2 so don't do that just keep

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.740 
half-life 2 so don't do that just keep
the<00:02:39.510> object<00:02:39.840> in<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.080> middle<00:02:40.320> am<00:02:41.630> in<00:02:42.630> the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
the object in the middle am in the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.949 
the object in the middle am in the
middle<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.200> scene<00:02:43.520> also<00:02:44.520> this<00:02:45.360> grid<00:02:45.750> here

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
middle of the scene also this grid here

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.300 
middle of the scene also this grid here
is<00:02:46.140> our<00:02:46.680> ground<00:02:47.160> plane<00:02:47.400> so<00:02:48.950> what<00:02:49.950> we<00:02:50.130> need<00:02:50.250> to

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
is our ground plane so what we need to

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.670 
is our ground plane so what we need to
remember<00:02:50.940> is<00:02:51.270> that<00:02:51.360> we<00:02:51.900> need<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.260> keep<00:02:52.500> our

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
remember is that we need to keep our

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.540 
remember is that we need to keep our
objects<00:02:53.550> above<00:02:54.540> this<00:02:55.050> ground<00:02:55.380> plane<00:02:55.620> if<00:02:56.340> I

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
objects above this ground plane if I

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.050 
objects above this ground plane if I
were<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.300> don't<00:02:57.900> export<00:02:58.739> this<00:02:59.280> object<00:02:59.790> and

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
were to I don't export this object and

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.270 
were to I don't export this object and
compile<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:00.780> get<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.590> into<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:02.010> half<00:03:02.100> life

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
compile it and get it into a half life

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.470 
compile it and get it into a half life
two<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:03.060> would<00:03:03.380> go<00:03:04.380> through<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.770> floor<00:03:05.040> I

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
two it would go through the floor I

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.260 
two it would go through the floor I
think<00:03:06.590> yeah<00:03:07.590> at<00:03:07.860> least<00:03:08.100> if<00:03:08.370> we<00:03:08.580> was<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.790> static

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
think yeah at least if we was a static

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.750 
think yeah at least if we was a static
object<00:03:11.780> so<00:03:12.780> just<00:03:13.350> keep<00:03:13.560> this<00:03:13.800> above<00:03:14.400> the

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
object so just keep this above the

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.850 
object so just keep this above the
ground<00:03:14.910> plane<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:15.720> we'll<00:03:16.050> go<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.290> side<00:03:16.620> view

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
ground plane so we'll go to side view

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.620 
ground plane so we'll go to side view
and<00:03:17.070> get<00:03:17.910> this<00:03:18.120> above<00:03:18.690> this<00:03:19.080> line<00:03:19.500> here<00:03:20.630> okay

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
and get this above this line here okay

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:30.830 
and get this above this line here okay
okay<00:03:22.489> so<00:03:24.950> what<00:03:25.950> we're<00:03:26.160> going<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.430> do<00:03:29.390> like<00:03:30.390> I'll

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
okay so what we're going to do like I'll

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.720 
okay so what we're going to do like I'll
I'll<00:03:31.560> hardly<00:03:32.100> call<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:32.430> modeling<00:03:33.060> even<00:03:33.390> it<00:03:33.600> is

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
I'll hardly call it modeling even it is

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.259 
I'll hardly call it modeling even it is
really<00:03:35.730> really<00:03:36.030> easy<00:03:36.209> we're<00:03:36.989> just<00:03:37.230> going<00:03:37.440> to

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
you you're adding new vertices so what

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.789 
you you're adding new vertices so what
you<00:04:02.640> just<00:04:02.880> want<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.239> do<00:04:03.390> is<00:04:03.660> just<00:04:06.410> just<00:04:07.410> add<00:04:07.590> new

you just want to do is just just add new

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.569 
you just want to do is just just add new
vertices<00:04:08.220> and<00:04:09.739> let<00:04:10.739> it<00:04:10.769> follow<00:04:11.100> the<00:04:11.280> outline

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
vertices and let it follow the outline

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.539 
vertices and let it follow the outline
of<00:04:11.910> this<00:04:12.360> toast<00:04:12.750> you<00:04:13.350> gotta<00:04:13.620> be<00:04:14.250> pretty

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
of this toast you gotta be pretty

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.880 
of this toast you gotta be pretty
thorough<00:04:15.269> because<00:04:15.900> this<00:04:16.290> is<00:04:16.440> going<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.709> be<00:04:16.769> our

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
thorough because this is going to be our

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:23.180 
thorough because this is going to be our
texture<00:04:17.370> too<00:04:17.579> and<00:04:20.030> it<00:04:21.030> will<00:04:21.570> look<00:04:21.930> best<00:04:22.169> if<00:04:22.470> you

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
texture too and it will look best if you

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.350 
texture too and it will look best if you
can<00:04:23.400> see<00:04:23.840> you<00:04:24.840> can<00:04:25.020> see<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.289> crumbs

game yeah let's see you also our goals
for<00:05:17.569> this<00:05:17.689> piece<00:05:18.139> of<00:05:18.289> toast<00:05:18.500> is<00:05:18.800> that<00:05:19.069> we<00:05:19.449> we

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
for this piece of toast is that we we

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:22.300 
for this piece of toast is that we we
want<00:05:20.659> to<00:05:20.719> have<00:05:20.840> a<00:05:20.870> nice<00:05:21.050> texture<00:05:21.469> for<00:05:21.740> it<00:05:21.860> and

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
want to have a nice texture for it and

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.330 
want to have a nice texture for it and
also<00:05:22.849> we<00:05:23.240> want<00:05:23.449> to<00:05:23.509> make<00:05:23.629> it<00:05:23.659> destructible<00:05:24.439> so

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
also we want to make it destructible so

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:32.709 
also we want to make it destructible so
if<00:05:26.770> if<00:05:27.939> it<00:05:28.939> is<00:05:29.360> if<00:05:29.719> we<00:05:30.229> shoot<00:05:30.589> this<00:05:31.389> this<00:05:32.389> piece

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:32.719 
if if it is if we shoot this this piece

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:36.070 
if if it is if we shoot this this piece
of<00:05:32.870> toast<00:05:33.139> it<00:05:33.919> will<00:05:34.159> break<00:05:34.400> into<00:05:35.080> smaller

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
of toast it will break into smaller

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.790 
of toast it will break into smaller
pieces<00:05:36.440> of<00:05:36.830> toast<00:05:37.129> and<00:05:40.479> yeah<00:05:41.479> so<00:05:42.440> I've<00:05:42.650> done

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
pieces of toast and yeah so I've done

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.709 
pieces of toast and yeah so I've done
this<00:05:43.009> for<00:05:44.589> you<00:05:45.589> you<00:05:46.339> gotta<00:05:46.550> add<00:05:46.759> the<00:05:46.789> loops<00:05:47.360> for

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:47.719 
this for you you gotta add the loops for

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:54.850 
this for you you gotta add the loops for
this<00:05:48.440> side<00:05:49.039> too<00:05:49.310> and<00:05:50.229> just<00:05:51.229> I<00:05:52.810> don't<00:05:53.810> know<00:05:54.020> what

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
this side too and just I don't know what

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.760 
this side too and just I don't know what
I<00:05:55.099> should<00:05:55.189> talk<00:05:55.879> about<00:05:56.060> while<00:05:56.419> I'm<00:05:56.539> doing<00:05:56.719> this

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.600 

I'm<00:06:00.770> probably<00:06:01.250> adding<00:06:02.110> too<00:06:03.110> many<00:06:03.289> loop<00:06:04.279> cuts

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
I'm probably adding too many loop cuts

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.769 
I'm probably adding too many loop cuts
now<00:06:04.990> Busta<00:06:05.990> I<00:06:06.259> think<00:06:07.069> I<00:06:07.189> might<00:06:07.460> need<00:06:08.300> them<00:06:08.509> when

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:08.779 
now Busta I think I might need them when

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:14.769 
now Busta I think I might need them when

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:14.779 
i go to work on when i go to work up

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:18.870

here

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.850 

by<00:06:19.840> the<00:06:19.900> way<00:06:20.050> this<00:06:20.260> way<00:06:20.500> of<00:06:20.680> modeling<00:06:22.860> it's

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
by the way this way of modeling it's

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.380 
by the way this way of modeling it's
rarely<00:06:24.730> ever<00:06:26.130> is<00:06:27.130> it<00:06:27.370> a<00:06:27.400> good<00:06:27.640> idea<00:06:27.790> to<00:06:28.060> use

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.390 
rarely ever is it a good idea to use

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:34.350 
rarely ever is it a good idea to use
this<00:06:28.660> way<00:06:28.900> of<00:06:29.050> modeling<00:06:29.880> so<00:06:31.320> like<00:06:32.320> I<00:06:33.360> hardly

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
this way of modeling so like I hardly

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:45.030 
this way of modeling so like I hardly
ever<00:06:34.480> model<00:06:35.380> like<00:06:35.590> this<00:06:41.640> yeah<00:06:43.110> it's<00:06:44.110> just<00:06:44.500> for

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.040 
ever model like this yeah it's just for

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:50.750 
ever model like this yeah it's just for
the<00:06:45.370> sake<00:06:45.580> of<00:06:45.610> this<00:06:45.850> tutorial<00:06:46.180> and<00:06:47.280> oh<00:06:48.280> I<00:06:49.150> added

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:50.760 
the sake of this tutorial and oh I added

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.990 
the sake of this tutorial and oh I added
well<00:06:52.050> we<00:06:53.050> can<00:06:53.200> do<00:06:53.350> it<00:06:53.470> with<00:06:53.980> pieces<00:06:54.280> of<00:06:54.550> toast

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.000 
well we can do it with pieces of toast

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.900 
well we can do it with pieces of toast
but<00:06:55.900> I<00:06:56.170> can't<00:06:57.010> really<00:06:57.220> come<00:06:57.460> up<00:06:57.490> with<00:06:57.790> any

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:57.910 
but I can't really come up with any

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:02.180 
but I can't really come up with any
other<00:06:58.090> examples<00:06:58.720> now<00:06:59.610> I've<00:07:00.610> made<00:07:00.970> a<00:07:01.270> pretty

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:02.190 
other examples now I've made a pretty

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.460 
other examples now I've made a pretty
pretty<00:07:03.190> nice<00:07:03.520> outline<00:07:04.480> of<00:07:04.780> this<00:07:05.080> toast

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:05.470 
pretty nice outline of this toast

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.300 
pretty nice outline of this toast
follows<00:07:06.160> it<00:07:06.310> pretty<00:07:06.670> good<00:07:06.760> I<00:07:08.010> need<00:07:09.010> to<00:07:09.130> add<00:07:09.280> a

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:09.310 
follows it pretty good I need to add a

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.750 
follows it pretty good I need to add a
texture<00:07:09.900> now<00:07:10.900> the<00:07:10.960> reason<00:07:11.320> that<00:07:11.560> I<00:07:12.010> don't<00:07:12.640> know

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:12.760 
texture now the reason that I don't know

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.790 
texture now the reason that I don't know
if<00:07:12.970> I<00:07:13.090> mentioned<00:07:13.240> this<00:07:13.600> the<00:07:14.320> reason<00:07:14.500> that<00:07:14.680> I

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 
if I mentioned this the reason that I

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.460 
if I mentioned this the reason that I
followed<00:07:15.310> it<00:07:15.430> so<00:07:15.700> perfectly<00:07:16.360> was<00:07:16.840> that<00:07:17.050> it<00:07:17.230> was

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:17.470 
followed it so perfectly was that it was

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:22.770 
followed it so perfectly was that it was
going<00:07:17.890> to<00:07:18.010> become<00:07:18.520> the<00:07:18.760> texture<00:07:19.270> to<00:07:19.770> you
