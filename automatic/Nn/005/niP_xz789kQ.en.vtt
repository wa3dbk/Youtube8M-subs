more distinct advantage is we have an

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
the disconnect system shuts down this

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.959 
the disconnect system shuts down this
section<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.500> drive<00:00:46.739> line<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.820> when

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
section of the drive line and so when

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.450 
section of the drive line and so when
you<00:00:48.059> don't<00:00:48.180> need<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.480> if<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.649> shuts<00:00:49.920> off<00:00:50.190> and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
you don't need it if it shuts off and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.860 
you don't need it if it shuts off and
then<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.700> get<00:00:50.850> better<00:00:51.030> fuel<00:00:51.120> economy<00:00:51.480> as<00:00:51.840> a
