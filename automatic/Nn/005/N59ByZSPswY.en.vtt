00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
want to do that doesn't seem very

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.629 
want to do that doesn't seem very
powerful<00:04:42.610> and<00:04:43.229> let's<00:04:44.229> on<00:04:44.410> tap<00:04:44.650> our<00:04:44.889> tundra

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
powerful and let's on tap our tundra

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.150 
powerful and let's on tap our tundra
because<00:04:46.240> we<00:04:46.360> have<00:04:46.479> a<00:04:46.510> sword<00:04:46.720> splasher<00:04:47.199> so<00:04:47.530> that

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
because we have a sword splasher so that

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.350 
because we have a sword splasher so that
seemed<00:04:48.400> like<00:04:48.490> a<00:04:48.580> pretty<00:04:48.760> good<00:04:48.910> turn<00:04:49.090> for<00:04:49.270> me

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
seemed like a pretty good turn for me

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.460 
seemed like a pretty good turn for me
although<00:04:49.510> I<00:04:49.599> don't<00:04:49.720> have<00:04:49.870> a<00:04:49.930> counter<00:04:50.169> magic

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
planes rigged it so hard to deal with I

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.600 
planes rigged it so hard to deal with I
mean<00:04:59.260> she<00:04:59.349> doesn't<00:04:59.470> have<00:04:59.710> haste<00:04:59.949> most<00:05:00.460> of<00:05:00.550> the

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.950 
mean she doesn't have haste most of the

time so he must have a grip of

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.629 
time so he must have a grip of
countering<00:05:02.500> removal<00:05:02.919> I<00:05:02.979> don't<00:05:03.190> know<00:05:03.400> what<00:05:03.550> he

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
countering removal I don't know what he

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:04.560 
countering removal I don't know what he
would<00:05:03.729> have<00:05:03.789> kept<00:05:04.090> me<00:05:04.270> he's<00:05:04.389> got

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
would have kept me he's got

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.370 
would have kept me he's got
planeswalkers

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.990 

so<00:05:10.380> could<00:05:10.530> run<00:05:10.740> sand<00:05:11.100> triplets<00:05:11.430> into<00:05:11.610> a<00:05:11.639> hinder

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
so could run sand triplets into a hinder

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.580 
so could run sand triplets into a hinder
of<00:05:12.120> some<00:05:12.300> kind<00:05:12.510> and<00:05:12.870> I'm<00:05:13.020> not<00:05:13.169> really<00:05:13.440> like

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
of some kind and I'm not really like

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.290 
of some kind and I'm not really like
that<00:05:13.830> concerned<00:05:14.430> about<00:05:14.550> central<00:05:15.150> plus

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
that concerned about central plus

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.870 
that concerned about central plus
getting<00:05:15.479> hindered<00:05:15.949> if<00:05:16.949> I<00:05:17.100> mind-twisting<00:05:17.729> he's

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
getting hindered if I mind-twisting he's

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.000 
getting hindered if I mind-twisting he's
definitely<00:05:18.270> on<00:05:18.360> a<00:05:18.389> counter<00:05:18.750> it<00:05:18.900> so<00:05:19.680> I<00:05:19.710> could

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
definitely on a counter it so I could

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.490 
definitely on a counter it so I could
can<00:05:20.370> I<00:05:20.430> mind<00:05:20.639> twist<00:05:20.880> him<00:05:21.000> first<00:05:21.300> no<00:05:22.020> I<00:05:22.050> can't<00:05:22.350> do

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
can I mind twist him first no I can't do

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.920 
can I mind twist him first no I can't do
that<00:05:22.530> I<00:05:22.919> know<00:05:23.729> I'd<00:05:24.000> rather<00:05:24.180> keep<00:05:24.419> Elspeth

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
that I know I'd rather keep Elspeth

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.700 
that I know I'd rather keep Elspeth
around<00:05:26.990> we're<00:05:27.990> just<00:05:28.110> going<00:05:28.229> to<00:05:28.290> play<00:05:28.470> some

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
around we're just going to play some

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:35.519 
around we're just going to play some
triplets<00:05:29.190> then<00:05:31.100> so<00:05:32.100> we<00:05:32.190> have

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:35.529 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:44.999 

one<00:05:36.219> two<00:05:37.829> lights<00:05:40.559> blue<00:05:43.559> maybe<00:05:44.559> counters<00:05:44.889> oh

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:45.009 
one two lights blue maybe counters oh

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:48.319 
one two lights blue maybe counters oh
that's<00:05:45.219> fine<00:05:45.489> you<00:05:45.909> can<00:05:46.089> definitely<00:05:46.359> do<00:05:46.629> that<00:05:46.659> I

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:48.329 
that's fine you can definitely do that I

00:05:48.329 --> 00:05:50.639 
that's fine you can definitely do that I
guess<00:05:49.329> I<00:05:49.449> could<00:05:49.599> have<00:05:49.719> one<00:05:50.109> when<00:05:50.439> he's<00:05:50.529> not

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:50.649 
guess I could have one when he's not

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:53.759 
guess I could have one when he's not
countering<00:05:51.069> it<00:05:52.019> pretty<00:05:53.019> sweet<00:05:53.229> i<00:05:53.289> can<00:05:53.439> pachuca

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:53.769 
countering it pretty sweet i can pachuca

00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:56.059 
countering it pretty sweet i can pachuca
Bhagyam<00:05:54.189> there's<00:05:54.759> nothing<00:05:54.969> in<00:05:55.029> his<00:05:55.119> graveyard

00:06:03.929 --> 00:06:03.939 
it's perfectly we have a counterspell we

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:05.129 
it's perfectly we have a counterspell we
really<00:06:04.179> don't<00:06:04.329> make<00:06:04.539> it<00:06:04.689> it's<00:06:04.779> mind<00:06:05.049> control
