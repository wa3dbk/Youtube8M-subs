00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.890
 hi crimin I'm sorry because yesterday I did not 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.810
 I was able to upload videos and today I was 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.030
 trying but I have had problems with 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:13.050
 the computer has broken down a bit and 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.190
 I'm trying to fix it 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.870
 what happens then what 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.880
 it is very bad 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:22.620
 I'm reviewing the antivirus and other 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.620
 things to erase data 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.320
 They may be spoiling my homework 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.949
 it's a foot 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.180
 smoking for the music team 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.340
 an antenna for wireless headphones 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.490
 some guitar picks this is 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.730
 study 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.350
 It is a multi effects well for guitar 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.430
 there's more around here this is a plug 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:55.010
 mobile 1 mp3 already with a lot of years 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.440
 it still works this is the mobile with a 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.640
 cable for microphone functions with what 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.640
 who recorded the 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.140
 an oriental pen 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.679
 with permanent markers and pens that 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.189
 they no longer paint a Chinese toothpick and a ball 

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:16.189
 from when I was a small fisherman 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.189
 damned 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.210
 a very large pen that I found in 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.210
 the field I do not know what it is 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.910
 brushes that I use rather for the 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:31.290
 powder some colored pens 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.290
 bracelets and chinitos 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.720
 jose there's my guitar 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.400
 a graphic tablet 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.079
 the pen of the graphic tablet 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:53.070
 with vaseline pendant for the lips 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.070
 Do not drop cancÃºn 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.590
 and that's how eating my desk 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.740
 the dust 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.799
 good 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.090
 I will try to continue arranging the 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.090
 computer 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.780
 I'm going to prepare the special 7000 that 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.780
 is what I was doing 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.099
 I 'm working hard to make 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.040
 this time it comes out better and the videos in 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.349
 which some of you speak 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.730
 erase the noise they have and the noise 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:30.290
 that can have my microphone too 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.290
 so that everything sounds nicer 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.240
 you enjoyed this award and see you 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.500

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.500
