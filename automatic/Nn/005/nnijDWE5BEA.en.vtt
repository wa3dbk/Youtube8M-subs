he slides back I can't punish I can't

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.050 
he slides back I can't punish I can't

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
hate his aerial mobility he can't move

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.990 
hate his aerial mobility he can't move
he<00:05:47.590> can't<00:05:47.830> really<00:05:48.100> get<00:05:48.340> away<00:05:48.370> from<00:05:48.580> anything

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
he can't really get away from anything

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.600 
he can't really get away from anything
so<00:05:49.330> I'm<00:05:49.420> stuck<00:05:49.660> getting<00:05:49.930> scraped<00:05:50.350> by<00:05:51.190> certain

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
so I'm stuck getting scraped by certain

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.470 
so I'm stuck getting scraped by certain
characters<00:05:52.060> and<00:05:52.330> I<00:05:53.320> hate<00:05:54.010> his<00:05:54.130> range<00:05:54.480> those

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
characters and I hate his range those

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.120 
characters and I hate his range those
are<00:05:55.720> three<00:05:55.870> things<00:05:56.140> that<00:05:56.260> I<00:05:56.410> like<00:05:56.590> I<00:05:56.830> think<00:05:57.040> if

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
are three things that I like I think if

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.860 
are three things that I like I think if
Luigi<00:05:57.490> had<00:05:57.610> better<00:05:57.880> all<00:05:58.240> does<00:05:58.570> he'd<00:05:58.720> probably

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
Luigi had better all does he'd probably

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.720 
Luigi had better all does he'd probably
be<00:05:59.020> top<00:05:59.260> five<00:05:59.470> I<00:05:59.500> think<00:05:59.680> he<00:05:59.980> would<00:06:00.160> be<00:06:00.190> because

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:00.730 
be top five I think he would be because

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.160 
be top five I think he would be because
he's<00:06:00.910> got<00:06:01.060> one<00:06:01.240> of<00:06:01.270> the<00:06:01.420> best<00:06:01.450> move<00:06:01.810> sets<00:06:02.080> in

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.170 
he's got one of the best move sets in

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.930 
he's got one of the best move sets in
the<00:06:02.260> game<00:06:02.440> so<00:06:03.400> I<00:06:03.430> talked<00:06:03.700> to<00:06:03.790> you<00:06:03.850> earlier
