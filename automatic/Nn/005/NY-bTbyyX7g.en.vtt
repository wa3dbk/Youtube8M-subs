00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.200 
location for these sculpin Caves are
very<00:00:58.440> unique<00:00:58.770> environments<00:00:59.489> when<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.059> go

very unique environments when you go
underground<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.960> there's<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.230> lack<00:01:01.410> of

underground and there's the lack of
light<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.789> completely<00:01:03.239> different<00:01:03.449> world

the<00:01:08.610> grotto<00:01:08.880> sculpin<00:01:08.939> are<00:01:09.390> unique<00:01:09.720> because

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
the grotto sculpin are unique because

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.960 
the grotto sculpin are unique because
they're<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.439> transition<00:01:11.070> phase<00:01:11.310> they're

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
they're in the transition phase they're

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.060 
they're in the transition phase they're

cave environment and that makes it very

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.899 
cave environment and that makes it very
unique<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:16.860> an<00:01:16.979> interesting<00:01:17.280> way<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.640> study

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909

to the future of this beautiful and

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
Perry County is just that people are

Perry County is just that people are
