00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
hole for the pin which basically fits on

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.119 
hole for the pin which basically fits on
a<00:01:01.950> belt<00:01:02.280> loop<00:01:02.520> let<00:01:03.300> me<00:01:03.329> show<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.629> guys<00:01:04.129> how

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
a belt loop let me show you guys how

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.740 
a belt loop let me show you guys how
that<00:01:05.369> works<00:01:07.580> so<00:01:08.580> basically<00:01:08.940> as<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.360> see

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
that works so basically as you can see

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.260 
that works so basically as you can see
it<00:01:09.899> you<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.710> hoes<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.160> a<00:01:11.250> belt<00:01:11.490> loop

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.230 

so<00:01:17.270> imagine<00:01:17.570> I<00:01:17.869> have<00:01:18.049> a<00:01:18.080> pin<00:01:18.619> right<00:01:18.650> here<00:01:19.240> what

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
so imagine I have a pin right here what

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.750 
so imagine I have a pin right here what
you<00:01:20.330> would<00:01:20.450> do<00:01:20.630> is<00:01:20.869> let's<00:01:21.440> press<00:01:21.830> it<00:01:22.010> down<00:01:22.190> and

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
you would do is let's press it down and

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.550 
you would do is let's press it down and
it<00:01:23.240> will<00:01:23.420> stay<00:01:24.729> stationary<00:01:25.729> like<00:01:26.240> that<00:01:26.560> you

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
it will stay stationary like that you

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.140 
it will stay stationary like that you
can<00:01:27.680> put<00:01:27.830> your<00:01:27.979> shirt<00:01:28.190> over<00:01:28.369> it<00:01:28.490> so<00:01:28.940> it's

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
can put your shirt over it so it's

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.210 
can put your shirt over it so it's
basically<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:31.060> concealed<00:01:32.060> weapon
