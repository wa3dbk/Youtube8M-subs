a<00:02:11.560> little<00:02:12.190> bit<00:02:12.360> towel<00:02:13.360> dried<00:02:13.800> instead<00:02:14.800> of

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
a little bit towel dried instead of

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.410 
a little bit towel dried instead of
soaking<00:02:15.069> wet<00:02:15.370> because<00:02:15.790> it<00:02:15.910> allows<00:02:16.150> the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
soaking wet because it allows the

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.830 
soaking wet because it allows the
product<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.959> penetrate<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.500> lot<00:02:17.650> deeper<00:02:17.800> so

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
product to penetrate a lot deeper so

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.690

in its most fragile state okay and then

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.569 
in its most fragile state okay and then
I<00:03:02.069> take<00:03:02.340> my<00:03:02.930> conditioner<00:03:04.819> put<00:03:05.819> about<00:03:06.209> I<00:03:07.579> would

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
say like a quarter size amount a product

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.150 
say like a quarter size amount a product
but<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.060> kind<00:03:12.209> of<00:03:12.239> depends<00:03:12.569> on<00:03:12.890> you<00:03:13.890> know<00:03:13.980> how

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
but it kind of depends on you know how

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
take it just use it right under the

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.180 
take it just use it right under the
roots<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:23.220> down<00:03:24.120> into<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.599> ends<00:03:25.069> and<00:03:26.069> you

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
roots and down into the ends and you

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.470 
roots and down into the ends and you
really<00:03:26.370> want<00:03:26.519> to<00:03:26.579> concentrate<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:27.150> product

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
really want to concentrate the product

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.720 
really want to concentrate the product
on<00:03:27.569> the<00:03:27.660> ends<00:03:28.019> because<00:03:28.170> that<00:03:29.129> is<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.400> oldest

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
on the ends because that is the oldest

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.869 
on the ends because that is the oldest
part<00:03:29.879> of<00:03:30.000> your<00:03:30.060> hair<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.599> tends<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.230> be<00:03:31.879> the

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
most dry the tends to be the driest part

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.210 
most dry the tends to be the driest part
of<00:03:36.209> your<00:03:36.299> hair<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:37.530> most<00:03:37.739> acceptable<00:03:37.950> to

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.270 
of your hair and the most acceptable to
damage<00:03:38.549> so<00:03:39.120> then<00:03:39.470> you<00:03:40.470> want<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.680> take<00:03:40.889> another

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
damage so then you want to take another

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.599 
damage so then you want to take another
part<00:03:41.989> and<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.109> reason<00:03:43.350> why<00:03:43.410> I<00:03:43.470> do<00:03:43.620> my<00:03:43.650> hair<00:03:43.980> in

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
part and the reason why I do my hair in

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.470 
part and the reason why I do my hair in
sections<00:03:45.389> is<00:03:46.049> because<00:03:46.889> I<00:03:47.310> actually<00:03:48.000> used<00:03:48.359> to

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
sections is because I actually used to

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.150 
sections is because I actually used to
just<00:03:48.690> kind<00:03:48.840> of<00:03:48.900> flip<00:03:49.079> my<00:03:49.170> hair<00:03:49.380> over<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:49.950> apply

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
just kind of flip my hair over and apply

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.910 
just kind of flip my hair over and apply
the<00:03:50.280> conditioner<00:03:50.970> but<00:03:51.660> I<00:03:51.989> realized<00:03:52.440> that<00:03:52.709> you

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
the conditioner but I realized that you

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.410 
the conditioner but I realized that you
know<00:03:53.040> indeed<00:03:53.430> in<00:03:53.639> this<00:03:53.819> section<00:03:54.030> of<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.239> hair

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
know indeed in this section of the hair

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.330 
know indeed in this section of the hair
was<00:03:54.569> he<00:03:54.660> was<00:03:55.260> always<00:03:55.440> like<00:03:55.680> really<00:03:55.709> tangley

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
was he was always like really tangley

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.470 
was he was always like really tangley
and<00:03:56.549> it<00:03:56.609> was<00:03:56.700> because<00:03:56.940> I<00:03:56.970> was<00:03:57.150> never<00:03:57.329> getting

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
and it was because I was never getting

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.110 
and it was because I was never getting
any<00:03:57.720> conditioner<00:03:58.139> there<00:03:58.290> so<00:03:58.910> that's<00:03:59.910> why<00:04:00.090> I

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
any conditioner there so that's why I

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.900 
any conditioner there so that's why I
did<00:04:00.359> it<00:04:00.389> in<00:04:00.510> sections

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.930 

right<00:04:05.630> underneath<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:06.170> roots<00:04:06.700> and<00:04:07.700> on<00:04:07.790> the

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
right underneath the roots and on the

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.590 
right underneath the roots and on the

Pantene and things like that because

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.350 
Pantene and things like that because
those<00:05:31.250> are<00:05:31.370> really<00:05:31.400> meant<00:05:31.790> to<00:05:31.850> be<00:05:31.910> rinse<00:05:32.210> out

to leave on the hair for 15 to 20
minutes<00:05:42.110> that<00:05:42.260> generally<00:05:42.680> means<00:05:42.710> it's<00:05:43.040> a

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
minutes that generally means it's a

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.280 
minutes that generally means it's a
pretty<00:05:43.310> good<00:05:43.580> deep<00:05:43.760> conditioner<00:05:44.210> but<00:05:45.140> there
