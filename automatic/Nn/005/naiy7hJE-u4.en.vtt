you're gonna put in a failing box it's

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.010 
you're gonna put in a failing box it's
going<00:01:16.880> to<00:01:16.940> go<00:01:17.030> right<00:01:17.240> back<00:01:17.420> down<00:01:17.479> you're<00:01:17.899> going

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
going to go right back down you're going

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.780 
going to go right back down you're going
to<00:01:18.080> roll<00:01:18.229> it<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:18.500> you<00:01:19.160> can<00:01:19.310> drive<00:01:19.520> right<00:01:19.580> over

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
to roll it and you can drive right over

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.790 
to roll it and you can drive right over
the<00:01:20.060> road<00:01:20.240> once<00:01:20.840> that's<00:01:21.050> done<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.380> second

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
the road once that's done the second

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.710 
the road once that's done the second
piece<00:01:21.920> of<00:01:21.950> the<00:01:22.070> processes<00:01:22.610> we<00:01:23.060> seal<00:01:23.330> it<00:01:23.360> with<00:01:23.600> a

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
piece of the processes we seal it with a

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.450 
piece of the processes we seal it with a
product<00:01:24.110> called<00:01:24.200> micro<00:01:24.560> seal<00:01:24.800> and<00:01:25.039> then

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
product called micro seal and then

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.950 
product called micro seal and then
essentially<00:01:25.850> you<00:01:26.030> have<00:01:26.060> a<00:01:26.180> brand<00:01:26.450> new<00:01:26.539> road<00:01:26.720> at

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
essentially you have a brand new road at

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.719 
essentially you have a brand new road at
a<00:01:27.229> fraction<00:01:27.590> of<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:27.920> cost<00:01:27.950> with<00:01:28.340> a<00:01:28.369> typically

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
a fraction of the cost with a typically

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.550 
a fraction of the cost with a typically
would<00:01:28.970> cost<00:01:29.119> to<00:01:29.299> do<00:01:29.390> a<00:01:29.420> miller<00:01:29.659> fill<00:01:29.900> now

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
would cost to do a miller fill now

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.250 
would cost to do a miller fill now
