00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 the pentagon is testing a new weapon that can transfer to take tub 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.750
 the decision to kill 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.750
 are unmanned aerial aircraft capable of 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:15.689
 computer program 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:19.239
 this year your happy good evening is a clear news that scared 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.419
 Can you explain to us what the story is about a machine? 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.419
 to decide who should be killed 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.029
 andrea these planes will recognize some of the others are 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.579
 an airplane will identify the second aircraft will confirm and a land vehicle 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.899
 after checking the damage authorize air with one of the two aircraft to shoot one 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.580
 missile against a target 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.670
 The most serious problems will first be identified in the case of a 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.480
 human being 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.210
 will be a partial recognition is much more difficult to be done 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.260
 or will be generic from a kind of uniform is a skin color 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.160
 the second problem will be even greater doubt 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.930
 if recognition was only approximated 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.350
 how will this be resolved the mission will be suspended 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.630
 if the program accepts margin of error, the mission can go ahead 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.310
 and be easy to justify an error because the responsibility will be the worse this 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.500
 from anyone 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.640
 Cobos the clear has no discernment or compassion 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.710
 though it is hard to speak discernment and compassion 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.180
 It is an irony that says that human beings have 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.430
 thousands of years ago in a way with petit the anonymity mother the kings of the kidney of 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.370
 the Roman emperors personally commanded to crucify 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.170
 alive thousands of human beings 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.170
 in the 20th century the responsibility was diluted 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.170
 and to compassion disappeared levels 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.960
 Its beautiful 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.470
 the cut never took responsibility were the regimes led by them that 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.710
 killed millions of human beings 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.220
 active hunger or in gas chambers 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.820
 and as the massacres became even more anonymous they remained 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.860
 also worse the bombing of the city of Dresden at the end of the second war 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.870
 world 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.099
 dump 4,000 tons of explosives in the city 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:15.409
 would have been the most efficient way of destroying the killing already effected by being 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:16.599
 human 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.629
 only six months later she was overcome by the atomic bomb that destroyed 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:21.869
 himaxime 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:26.629
 the crew of the gay enola 29 who threw the bomb said they did not have 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.929
 remorse after the mission 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:31.659
 clear when things are done at a distance 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.109
 the death of minuit 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.739
 with the use of unmanned airplanes choosing the album alone 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:42.549
 we can only disappear at a time determined by algorithms and 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.429
 accentuated by computers 

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:48.199
 almost 30 years ago andrÃ© 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:52.409
 and they are humans from the poor group put it into a song 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.079
 it's the killing by numbers 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.239
 so easy to learn 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.259
 abc 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:04.259

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:09.429
 in this area 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:11.139
 for this year 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:14.139
 it's not that the website 

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:16.069
 to ring 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.400

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.079
 now it's me 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.209
 I do not
