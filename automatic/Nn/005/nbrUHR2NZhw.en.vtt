and I bought her a little gift

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.830 
and I bought her a little gift
earlier<00:00:07.440> I<00:00:07.529> was<00:00:07.890> out<00:00:08.040> shopping<00:00:08.389> so<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:09.420> got<00:00:09.660> her

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
earlier I was out shopping so I got her

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.140 
earlier I was out shopping so I got her
a<00:00:09.870> present<00:00:10.250> it's<00:00:11.250> not<00:00:11.429> her<00:00:11.550> birthday<00:00:11.730> or

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150

anything<00:00:12.420> but<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:13.110> just<00:00:13.500> figured<00:00:14.009> I'd<00:00:14.130> wrap<00:00:14.370> it

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549

anything but I just figured I'd wrap it
up<00:00:14.700> for<00:00:14.730> her<00:00:15.120> because<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:15.480> would<00:00:15.570> be<00:00:15.719> more<00:00:15.929> fun

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960
