hey this is Todd Walker like to welcome
everybody<00:00:55.550> back<00:00:55.789> for<00:00:55.940> another<00:00:56.030> video<00:00:56.239> drum

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:56.569 
everybody back for another video drum

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:58.930 
everybody back for another video drum
lesson<00:00:56.899> what<00:00:57.589> you<00:00:57.679> just<00:00:57.829> saw<00:00:58.039> is<00:00:58.069> my<00:00:58.370> take<00:00:58.670> on

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
lesson what you just saw is my take on

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.290 
lesson what you just saw is my take on
grooving<00:00:59.569> in<00:00:59.690> 78<00:01:00.289> time<00:01:00.589> to<00:01:01.219> 11<00:01:01.640> 8<00:01:01.760> times<00:01:02.059> so<00:01:02.269> a

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
grooving in 78 time to 11 8 times so a

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.439 
grooving in 78 time to 11 8 times so a
two-bar<00:01:02.859> rhythm<00:01:03.859> and<00:01:04.129> basically<00:01:05.059> here's<00:01:05.300> the

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
two-bar rhythm and basically here's the

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:06.730 
two-bar rhythm and basically here's the
most<00:01:05.570> important<00:01:06.080> thing<00:01:06.260> when<00:01:06.409> you're<00:01:06.530> looking

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
most important thing when you're looking

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.580 
most important thing when you're looking

numbers<00:01:25.430> I<00:01:25.610> decided<00:01:26.299> to<00:01:26.479> use<00:01:26.600> four<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.170> three

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
numbers I decided to use four and three

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.730

three four one two three sometimes it's

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.499 
three four one two three sometimes it's
just<00:01:33.770> a<00:01:33.950> lot<00:01:34.100> easier<00:01:34.310> to<00:01:34.520> think<00:01:34.850> that<00:01:35.060> way<00:01:35.270> and

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
just a lot easier to think that way and

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.330 
just a lot easier to think that way and
it<00:01:35.960> makes<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.320> rhythm<00:01:36.590> feel<00:01:36.619> a<00:01:36.890> little<00:01:37.189> bit

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
it makes the rhythm feel a little bit

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.069 
it makes the rhythm feel a little bit
easier<00:01:37.789> when<00:01:37.939> you're<00:01:38.060> working<00:01:38.210> on<00:01:38.539> odd<00:01:38.750> times

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
easier when you're working on odd times

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.789 
easier when you're working on odd times
so<00:01:39.770> for<00:01:39.979> instance<00:01:40.100> here<00:01:40.640> 70<00:01:41.270> phrased<00:01:42.109> four<00:01:42.560> and

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
so for instance here 70 phrased four and

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:53.660 
so for instance here 70 phrased four and
three<00:01:43.180> one<00:01:44.180> two<00:01:44.210> three<00:01:44.539> four<00:01:45.229> one<00:01:45.560> two<00:01:45.590> three

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
now in the 11 e I kept the same exact

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.999 
now in the 11 e I kept the same exact
phrase<00:01:57.340> four<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:58.270> three<00:01:58.600> and<00:01:58.840> added<00:01:59.770> an<00:01:59.890> extra

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
phrase four and three and added an extra

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.210 
phrase four and three and added an extra
four<00:02:00.490> on<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:00.909> end<00:02:01.090> one<00:02:01.840> two<00:02:02.140> three<00:02:02.560> four<00:02:02.830> one

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
11 e now there are many ways to look at

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.250 
11 e now there are many ways to look at
these<00:02:09.130> time<00:02:09.520> signatures<00:02:10.209> that<00:02:10.569> I'm<00:02:10.810> using<00:02:11.110> now

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
these time signatures that I'm using now

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.650 
these time signatures that I'm using now
and<00:02:11.650> phrase<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:12.100> your<00:02:12.250> own<00:02:12.459> way<00:02:12.489> but<00:02:13.420> here's

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
and phrase it your own way but here's

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.340 
and phrase it your own way but here's
the<00:02:13.720> phrasing<00:02:14.410> for<00:02:14.709> an<00:02:14.920> 11<00:02:15.459> e<00:02:15.580> rhythm<00:02:16.330> one<00:02:17.020> two

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
the phrasing for an 11 e rhythm one two

the phrasing for an 11 e rhythm one two
three<00:02:17.770> four<00:02:18.040> one<00:02:18.430> two<00:02:18.459> three<00:02:18.790> one<00:02:19.209> two<00:02:19.510> three

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:37.680 
three four one two three one two three
four<00:02:35.130> so<00:02:36.130> all<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:36.340> did<00:02:36.489> was<00:02:36.700> put<00:02:37.120> these<00:02:37.450> two

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
four so all I did was put these two

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.380 
four so all I did was put these two
measures<00:02:37.900> together<00:02:38.730> seven<00:02:39.730> eight<00:02:39.850> and<00:02:39.970> eleven

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
measures together seven eight and eleven

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.870 
measures together seven eight and eleven
e<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:41.230> first<00:02:41.530> seven<00:02:41.950> is<00:02:42.069> phrase<00:02:42.310> four<00:02:42.700> and

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
e the first seven is phrase four and

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.220 
e the first seven is phrase four and
three<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:44.140> 11<00:02:44.650> is<00:02:44.830> phrased<00:02:45.630> 434<00:02:46.630> so

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
three and the 11 is phrased 434 so

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.550 
three and the 11 is phrased 434 so
here's<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.560> two<00:02:47.739> measures<00:02:48.160> together<00:02:49.260> one<00:02:50.260> two

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
here's the two measures together one two

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.009 
here's the two measures together one two
three<00:02:50.980> four<00:02:51.250> one<00:02:51.610> two<00:02:51.640> three<00:02:52.360> one<00:02:52.690> two<00:02:52.720> three

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
three four one two three one two three

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.000 

now<00:03:09.549> you<00:03:10.030> can<00:03:10.209> look<00:03:10.329> at<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.540> as<00:03:10.859> seven<00:03:11.859> eight

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
now you can look at it as seven eight

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.759 
now you can look at it as seven eight
seventy<00:03:12.579> and<00:03:12.730> forty<00:03:12.820> it<00:03:13.570> can<00:03:13.959> equate<00:03:14.350> a<00:03:14.380> bunch

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
seventy and forty it can equate a bunch

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.590 
seventy and forty it can equate a bunch
of<00:03:14.920> different<00:03:15.220> ways<00:03:15.370> but<00:03:15.609> I<00:03:15.790> was<00:03:16.090> thinking<00:03:16.120> it

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
of different ways but I was thinking it

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.530 
of different ways but I was thinking it
has<00:03:16.720> seven<00:03:17.109> in<00:03:17.410> 211<00:03:18.250> so<00:03:18.970> I'm<00:03:19.030> not<00:03:19.180> going<00:03:19.359> to<00:03:19.420> put

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
has seven in 211 so I'm not going to put

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.349 
has seven in 211 so I'm not going to put
a<00:03:19.570> transcription<00:03:20.440> up<00:03:20.560> on<00:03:20.739> this<00:03:21.060> but<00:03:22.060> if<00:03:22.209> you're

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
a transcription up on this but if you're

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.300 
a transcription up on this but if you're
interested<00:03:22.390> in<00:03:23.019> experimenting<00:03:23.680> with<00:03:24.040> odd

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.720 
interested in experimenting with odd
times<00:03:24.840> pick<00:03:25.840> an<00:03:25.989> odd<00:03:26.140> number<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.890> then<00:03:27.310> divide

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
times pick an odd number and then divide

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.550 
times pick an odd number and then divide
it<00:03:27.760> a<00:03:28.090> few<00:03:28.329> different<00:03:28.420> ways<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:28.989> count<00:03:29.320> those

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
it a few different ways and count those

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.710 
it a few different ways and count those
subdivisions<00:03:30.070> this<00:03:30.489> is<00:03:30.609> a<00:03:30.640> very<00:03:30.850> standard<00:03:31.269> way

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
subdivisions this is a very standard way

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.140 
subdivisions this is a very standard way
of<00:03:31.750> learning<00:03:32.260> an<00:03:32.470> odd<00:03:32.590> time<00:03:32.890> so<00:03:33.880> once<00:03:34.060> again

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
of learning an odd time so once again

00:03:34.150 --> 00:04:25.480 
of learning an odd time so once again
let's<00:03:34.390> go<00:03:34.540> back<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:34.959> performance<00:03:35.560> tempo

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.860 

alright<00:04:26.490> so<00:04:26.700> there<00:04:26.940> you<00:04:27.120> go<00:04:27.150> quick<00:04:27.570> little

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
alright so there you go quick little

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.340 
alright so there you go quick little
study<00:04:28.169> in<00:04:28.380> developing<00:04:28.950> odd<00:04:29.190> time<00:04:29.760> signatures

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
study in developing odd time signatures

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.240 
study in developing odd time signatures
again<00:04:31.350> there's<00:04:31.590> so<00:04:31.919> many<00:04:32.130> different

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
again there's so many different

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.460 
again there's so many different
approaches<00:04:32.850> to<00:04:33.060> this<00:04:33.330> but<00:04:33.720> I<00:04:33.780> think<00:04:34.050> one<00:04:34.229> thing

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
approaches to this but I think one thing

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.500 
approaches to this but I think one thing
remains<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:34.979> same<00:04:35.250> when<00:04:35.970> you're<00:04:36.090> playing<00:04:36.300> in

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
remains the same when you're playing in

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.270 
remains the same when you're playing in
an<00:04:36.600> odd<00:04:36.720> time<00:04:37.050> there's<00:04:37.710> a<00:04:37.800> few<00:04:38.160> different

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
an odd time there's a few different

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.550 
an odd time there's a few different
numbers<00:04:38.910> that<00:04:39.120> you<00:04:39.150> can<00:04:39.450> use<00:04:39.630> to<00:04:39.900> add<00:04:40.080> up<00:04:40.110> to

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
numbers that you can use to add up to

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.250 
numbers that you can use to add up to
that<00:04:40.740> odd<00:04:41.010> time<00:04:41.400> signature<00:04:42.060> and<00:04:42.240> using<00:04:42.270> groups

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
that odd time signature and using groups

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.159 
that odd time signature and using groups
of<00:04:43.530> twos<00:04:43.979> threes<00:04:44.010> and<00:04:44.850> fours<00:04:45.210> will<00:04:45.990> work

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
of twos threes and fours will work

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.110 
of twos threes and fours will work
really<00:04:46.500> well<00:04:46.680> so<00:04:47.340> once<00:04:47.520> again<00:04:47.669> I'm<00:04:47.880> Todd

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
really well so once again I'm Todd

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.120 
really well so once again I'm Todd
Walker<00:04:48.479> thanks<00:04:49.050> for<00:04:49.169> watching<00:04:49.200> I'll<00:04:49.710> see<00:04:49.770> you

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
Walker thanks for watching I'll see you

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.340 
Walker thanks for watching I'll see you
soon
