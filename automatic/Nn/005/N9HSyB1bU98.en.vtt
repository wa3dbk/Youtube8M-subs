00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
a cockpit and went racing how different

One drivers an incredible testament to
rich<00:04:19.450> management<00:04:19.989> but<00:04:20.620> I<00:04:20.650> do<00:04:20.799> believe<00:04:21.310> there's

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
rich management but I do believe there's

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.460 
rich management but I do believe there's
liberties<00:04:22.090> being<00:04:22.330> taken<00:04:22.720> today<00:04:22.990> on<00:04:23.140> the<00:04:23.260> track

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
liberties being taken today on the track

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.800 
liberties being taken today on the track
that<00:04:23.710> should<00:04:23.980> not<00:04:24.220> be<00:04:24.400> taken<00:04:24.820> and<00:04:25.000> I<00:04:25.420> think<00:04:25.690> the

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
that should not be taken and I think the

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.630 
that should not be taken and I think the
penalties<00:04:26.380> that<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:26.680> governing<00:04:27.070> body<00:04:27.280> should

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
penalties that the governing body should

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.630 
penalties that the governing body should
hand<00:04:27.910> out<00:04:28.120> for<00:04:28.600> those<00:04:28.780> arrows<00:04:29.380> and<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:30.370> manner

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
hand out for those arrows and the manner

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.790 
hand out for those arrows and the manner
in<00:04:30.910> which<00:04:30.940> some<00:04:31.480> of<00:04:31.510> these<00:04:31.810> maneuvers<00:04:32.380> take

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
in which some of these maneuvers take

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.370 
in which some of these maneuvers take
place<00:04:33.100> is<00:04:33.400> a<00:04:33.790> reason<00:04:34.360> to<00:04:34.570> be<00:04:34.720> concerned<00:04:34.960> about

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
place is a reason to be concerned about

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.000 
place is a reason to be concerned about
and<00:04:35.860> therefore<00:04:36.550> I<00:04:36.580> think<00:04:36.940> if<00:04:37.090> they<00:04:37.270> were<00:04:37.330> to

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
and therefore I think if they were to

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.550 
and therefore I think if they were to
readjust<00:04:39.010> themselves<00:04:39.670> to<00:04:40.630> the<00:04:40.750> potential<00:04:41.350> of

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
readjust themselves to the potential of

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.530 
readjust themselves to the potential of
what<00:04:41.590> can<00:04:42.070> happen<00:04:42.100> it<00:04:42.610> would<00:04:42.760> not<00:04:43.060> be<00:04:43.270> a<00:04:43.300> bad

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
what can happen it would not be a bad

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.810 
what can happen it would not be a bad
thing<00:04:43.650> but<00:04:44.650> just<00:04:44.919> bring<00:04:45.010> it<00:04:45.160> back<00:04:45.190> to<00:04:45.310> it<00:04:45.520> said

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
thing but just bring it back to it said

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.480 
thing but just bring it back to it said
for<00:04:46.030> a<00:04:46.060> moment<00:04:46.419> it's<00:04:47.169> you<00:04:47.500> know<00:04:47.800> normal<00:04:48.220> at<00:04:48.430> a

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
for a moment it's you know normal at a

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.830 
for a moment it's you know normal at a
time<00:04:48.730> when<00:04:48.970> there's<00:04:49.150> a<00:04:49.210> loss<00:04:49.360> that<00:04:49.600> everyone

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
time when there's a loss that everyone

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.110 
time when there's a loss that everyone
will<00:04:49.930> find<00:04:50.200> that<00:04:50.440> the<00:04:50.770> good<00:04:51.010> in<00:04:51.220> someone<00:04:51.280> but<00:04:52.090> I

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
will find that the good in someone but I

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.420 
will find that the good in someone but I
think<00:04:52.540> maybe<00:04:53.020> you<00:04:53.560> could<00:04:53.830> put<00:04:54.010> into<00:04:54.160> words

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
think maybe you could put into words

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.370 
think maybe you could put into words
just<00:04:54.850> what<00:04:55.090> kind<00:04:55.270> of<00:04:55.390> a<00:04:55.480> man<00:04:55.690> he<00:04:55.900> was<00:04:56.050> as<00:04:56.290> an

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
just what kind of a man he was as an

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.750 
just what kind of a man he was as an
