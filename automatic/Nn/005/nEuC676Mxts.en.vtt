00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
a lot he's more of a finesse player when

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.340 
a lot he's more of a finesse player when
they<00:02:25.730> played<00:02:26.060> LSU<00:02:26.540> in<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.810> n-c-double-a

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.120 
tournament he spent most of that game in
the<00:02:28.850> second<00:02:29.210> row<00:02:29.330> but<00:02:29.900> he<00:02:30.050> is<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.260> good<00:02:30.530> prospect

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
the second row but he is a good prospect

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.590 
the second row but he is a good prospect
I<00:02:31.190> liken<00:02:31.430> him<00:02:31.670> a<00:02:31.700> little<00:02:31.910> bit<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.120> Chris<00:02:32.360> Bosh

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
I liken him a little bit to Chris Bosh

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
questions in the affirmative and

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.320 
questions in the affirmative and
LaMarcus<00:02:40.430> Aldridge<00:02:40.580> he's<00:02:40.910> going<00:02:41.060> to<00:02:41.120> have<00:02:41.210> to

LaMarcus Aldridge he's going to have to

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.970 
LaMarcus Aldridge he's going to have to
get<00:02:41.450> a<00:02:41.480> lot<00:02:41.630> stronger<00:02:41.960> but<00:02:42.470> he<00:02:42.560> might<00:02:42.740> be<00:02:42.860> able

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
get a lot stronger but he might be able

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.030 
get a lot stronger but he might be able
to<00:02:43.130> do<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.370> same<00:02:43.550> thing<00:02:43.760> as<00:02:43.850> Bob
