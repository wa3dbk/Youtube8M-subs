still<00:01:54.940> felt<00:01:55.360> like<00:01:55.659> spite<00:01:55.930> was<00:01:56.110> being<00:01:56.290> pushed

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
still felt like spite was being pushed

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.770 
still felt like spite was being pushed
to<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.890> side<00:01:57.130> but<00:01:57.729> I<00:01:57.760> do<00:01:57.909> like<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.540> scene

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
to the side but I do like the scene

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.390 
to the side but I do like the scene
where<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.050> rest<00:01:59.290> of<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.500> town<00:01:59.680> are<00:01:59.890> watching

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
where the rest of the town are watching

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.830 
where the rest of the town are watching
what<00:02:00.550> could<00:02:00.729> easily<00:02:01.090> have<00:02:01.180> been<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.510> events

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
what could easily have been the events

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.990 
what could easily have been the events
of<00:02:01.960> one<00:02:02.080> of<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.260> two<00:02:02.440> parties<00:02:02.950> it<00:02:03.700> kind<00:02:03.940> of

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
of one of the two parties it kind of

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.670 
of one of the two parties it kind of
reminded<00:02:04.330> me<00:02:04.390> of<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.540> concept<00:02:05.020> of<00:02:05.140> sonder

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
reminded me of the concept of sonder

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.770 
reminded me of the concept of sonder
being<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.370> idea<00:02:06.729> that<00:02:06.940> you<00:02:07.240> are<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.630> main

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
being the idea that you are the main

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.479 
being the idea that you are the main
character<00:02:08.319> in<00:02:08.409> the<00:02:08.500> events<00:02:08.800> of<00:02:08.920> your<00:02:09.039> own<00:02:09.190> life

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
character in the events of your own life

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.000 
character in the events of your own life
while<00:02:10.119> each<00:02:10.149> supporting<00:02:10.899> character<00:02:11.379> or<00:02:11.500> extra

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
while each supporting character or extra

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.710 
while each supporting character or extra
in<00:02:12.069> your<00:02:12.190> own<00:02:12.280> life<00:02:12.459> is<00:02:12.760> also<00:02:13.030> living<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.510> life

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
in your own life is also living a life

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.020 
in your own life is also living a life
as<00:02:13.930> dividend<00:02:14.349> complex<00:02:14.950> as<00:02:15.099> your<00:02:15.280> own<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:15.819> just

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
as dividend complex as your own you just

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.850 
as dividend complex as your own you just
aren't<00:02:16.180> aware<00:02:16.420> of<00:02:16.480> it<00:02:16.720> most<00:02:16.840> of<00:02:16.989> the<00:02:17.049> time<00:02:17.110> for

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
aren't aware of it most of the time for

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.619 
aren't aware of it most of the time for
example<00:02:18.250> I<00:02:18.370> really<00:02:18.580> like<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.909> idea<00:02:18.940> that<00:02:19.269> from

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
example I really like the idea that from

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.199 
example I really like the idea that from
say<00:02:19.870> Octavia's<00:02:20.680> perspective<00:02:21.280> spike<00:02:21.970> to

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
say Octavia's perspective spike to

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.940 
say Octavia's perspective spike to
rampaging<00:02:22.840> over<00:02:23.019> Ponyville<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.590> secret<00:02:23.860> of

my excess white have disrupted a
performance<00:02:26.080> she<00:02:26.260> was<00:02:26.349> giving<00:02:26.620> at<00:02:26.739> a<00:02:26.769> time<00:02:27.010> it

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
performance she was giving at a time it

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.670 
performance she was giving at a time it
really<00:02:27.970> helps<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.540> make<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.870> world<00:02:28.900> see<00:02:29.379> more

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
enough of a window into what really

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.330 
enough of a window into what really

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
might have really happened now it's

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.290 
might have really happened now it's
interesting<00:03:00.740> that<00:03:00.950> Lara<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.580> bonbon<00:03:02.060> are

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
interesting that Lara and bonbon are

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.700 
interesting that Lara and bonbon are
probably<00:03:02.630> given<00:03:02.960> the<00:03:03.050> most<00:03:03.200> character

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
for mute characters I've always been

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.530 
for mute characters I've always been
fascinated<00:03:54.590> by<00:03:55.040> how<00:03:55.310> well<00:03:55.550> fleshed<00:03:55.970> out<00:03:56.240> and

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
fascinated by how well fleshed out and

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.300 
fascinated by how well fleshed out and
define<00:03:56.870> certain<00:03:57.290> writers<00:03:57.740> are<00:03:57.860> able<00:03:58.040> to<00:03:58.160> make

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
define certain writers are able to make

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.310 
define certain writers are able to make
characters<00:03:58.730> that<00:03:59.120> never<00:03:59.450> say<00:03:59.720> a<00:03:59.750> single<00:03:59.930> word

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
characters that never say a single word

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.980 
characters that never say a single word
in<00:04:00.800> the<00:04:01.520> case<00:04:01.760> of<00:04:01.790> things<00:04:02.180> like<00:04:02.360> wallace<00:04:02.750> and

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
in the case of things like wallace and

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.960 
in the case of things like wallace and
gromit<00:04:03.020> and<00:04:03.560> phineas<00:04:03.980> and<00:04:04.220> ferb<00:04:04.460> they'd

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
gromit and phineas and ferb they'd

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.970 
gromit and phineas and ferb they'd
probably<00:04:05.300> make<00:04:05.510> for<00:04:05.960> the<00:04:06.050> best<00:04:06.200> characters

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
probably make for the best characters

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.070 
probably make for the best characters
even<00:04:07.310> in<00:04:07.550> the<00:04:07.640> case<00:04:07.850> of<00:04:07.880> this<00:04:08.180> show<00:04:08.420> y<00:04:08.720> know<00:04:08.900> a

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
corner episode in season I don't think

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.080 
corner episode in season I don't think
it's<00:05:20.500> inconceivable<00:05:21.010> but<00:05:21.400> it<00:05:21.550> could<00:05:21.790> happen

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
it's inconceivable but it could happen

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.910 
it's inconceivable but it could happen
at<00:05:22.330> some<00:05:22.510> point<00:05:22.570> but<00:05:23.500> for<00:05:23.650> the<00:05:23.710> time<00:05:23.860> being

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:23.920 
at some point but for the time being

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.980 
at some point but for the time being
this<00:05:24.460> scene<00:05:24.730> worked<00:05:25.060> to<00:05:25.390> show<00:05:25.570> that<00:05:25.720> there<00:05:25.870> is

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
this scene worked to show that there is

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.110 
this scene worked to show that there is
more<00:05:26.140> of<00:05:26.260> a<00:05:26.320> normal<00:05:26.650> side<00:05:27.160> to<00:05:27.370> them<00:05:27.490> they<00:05:27.880> have

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
more of a normal side to them they have

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.630 
more of a normal side to them they have
weaknesses<00:05:28.780> get<00:05:29.170> emotional<00:05:29.860> and<00:05:30.070> fight<00:05:30.400> from

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
weaknesses get emotional and fight from

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.910 
weaknesses get emotional and fight from
time<00:05:30.850> to<00:05:31.030> time<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:31.450> same<00:05:31.630> as<00:05:31.780> anypony<00:05:32.170> I<00:05:32.410> would

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
time to time the same as anypony I would

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.020 
time to time the same as anypony I would
have<00:05:33.010> liked<00:05:33.280> the<00:05:33.400> seem<00:05:33.610> to<00:05:33.700> be<00:05:33.820> a<00:05:33.850> little

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
have liked the seem to be a little

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.970 
have liked the seem to be a little
longer<00:05:34.360> but<00:05:34.780> thought<00:05:34.990> it<00:05:35.020> was<00:05:35.320> it<00:05:35.650> worked

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
longer but thought it was it worked

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.980 
longer but thought it was it worked
really<00:05:36.370> well<00:05:36.520> of<00:05:37.300> course<00:05:37.570> I<00:05:37.660> could<00:05:37.720> keep

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
really well of course I could keep

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.510 
really well of course I could keep
talking<00:05:38.350> about<00:05:38.470> all<00:05:38.710> the<00:05:38.830> other<00:05:38.980> cameos<00:05:39.310> and

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
talking about all the other cameos and

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.610 
talking about all the other cameos and
references<00:05:40.180> that<00:05:40.420> are<00:05:40.450> in<00:05:40.630> this<00:05:40.750> episode<00:05:40.960> but

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
references that are in this episode but

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.020 
references that are in this episode but
there<00:05:41.740> really<00:05:41.830> isn't<00:05:42.040> much<00:05:42.160> point<00:05:42.280> as<00:05:42.760> I<00:05:42.850> don't

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
there really isn't much point as I don't

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.490 
there really isn't much point as I don't
have<00:05:43.150> much<00:05:43.330> to<00:05:43.510> say<00:05:43.540> about<00:05:43.780> them<00:05:44.080> other<00:05:44.200> than

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
have much to say about them other than

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.500 
have much to say about them other than
most<00:05:44.980> of<00:05:45.130> them<00:05:45.280> maybe<00:05:45.310> laughs<00:05:45.760> I<00:05:46.060> just<00:05:46.360> have

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
most of them maybe laughs I just have

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.340 
most of them maybe laughs I just have
one<00:05:46.690> last<00:05:46.900> question<00:05:47.820> is<00:05:48.820> this<00:05:49.180> episode<00:05:49.690> can<00:05:50.110> in

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
one last question is this episode can in

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.470 
one last question is this episode can in
the<00:05:50.770> show's<00:05:51.010> overall<00:05:51.580> storyline<00:05:52.030> does<00:05:52.390> it

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.480 
the show's overall storyline does it

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.000 
the show's overall storyline does it
really<00:05:52.630> make<00:05:52.810> any<00:05:52.930> sense<00:05:53.320> that<00:05:53.500> the<00:05:53.560> main<00:05:53.740> six

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
really make any sense that the main six

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.710 
really make any sense that the main six
wouldn't<00:05:54.370> be<00:05:54.460> invited<00:05:54.850> to<00:05:54.970> Cranky's<00:05:55.360> wedding

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
wouldn't be invited to Cranky's wedding

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.480 
wouldn't be invited to Cranky's wedding
although<00:05:56.260> the<00:05:56.620> rest<00:05:56.800> of<00:05:56.920> the<00:05:56.980> town's<00:05:57.220> folk

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
although the rest of the town's folk

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.380 
although the rest of the town's folk
would<00:05:57.670> just<00:05:57.880> go<00:05:58.030> about<00:05:58.120> their<00:05:58.330> normal

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
would just go about their normal

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.570 
would just go about their normal
day-to-day<00:05:58.900> lives<00:05:59.470> while<00:05:59.770> a<00:05:59.800> monster<00:06:00.310> attack

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
day-to-day lives while a monster attack

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.460 
day-to-day lives while a monster attack
was<00:06:00.730> going<00:06:00.970> on<00:06:01.060> on<00:06:01.240> the<00:06:01.930> other<00:06:02.080> hand<00:06:02.230> there<00:06:02.440> are

was going on on the other hand there are

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.110 
was going on on the other hand there are
some<00:06:02.650> clear<00:06:02.890> continuity<00:06:03.490> here<00:06:03.640> to<00:06:03.760> previous

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
some clear continuity here to previous

like<00:06:36.220> some<00:06:36.400> really<00:06:36.640> clever<00:06:36.790> self-parody<00:06:37.630> gags

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
like some really clever self-parody gags

like some really clever self-parody gags
there<00:06:38.380> are<00:06:38.500> also<00:06:38.710> some<00:06:39.010> large<00:06:39.250> parts<00:06:39.610> of<00:06:39.670> the

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:39.760 
there are also some large parts of the

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.100 
there are also some large parts of the
episode<00:06:40.060> that<00:06:40.330> were<00:06:40.420> really<00:06:40.660> nothing<00:06:40.960> but

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
episode that were really nothing but

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.050 
episode that were really nothing but
jokes<00:06:41.380> and<00:06:41.680> references<00:06:41.860> but<00:06:42.640> i<00:06:42.760> think<00:06:42.970> the

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.060 
jokes and references but i think the

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.030 
jokes and references but i think the
moral<00:06:43.390> at<00:06:43.510> the<00:06:43.600> end<00:06:43.750> by<00:06:44.050> their<00:06:44.290> their<00:06:44.530> helps
