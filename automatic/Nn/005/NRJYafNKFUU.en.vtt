one<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.719> don't<00:00:49.020> really<00:00:49.230> agree<00:00:49.500> with<00:00:49.590> leak<00:00:49.950> in

the<00:00:50.190> gameplay<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.760> think<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.780> little

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
the gameplay I think it's a little

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.020 
the gameplay I think it's a little
unfair<00:00:52.140> on<00:00:52.500> rock<00:00:52.649> star<00:00:52.920> but<00:00:53.039> two<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.489> actually

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
unfair on rock star but two I actually

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.490 
unfair on rock star but two I actually
give<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> lot<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.780> respect<00:00:55.140> for<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.320> guy<00:00:55.440> who

give a lot of respect for the guy who

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.189 
give a lot of respect for the guy who
leaked<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.160> purely<00:00:56.730> because<00:00:56.969> he<00:00:57.899> didn't

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
leaked it purely because he didn't
