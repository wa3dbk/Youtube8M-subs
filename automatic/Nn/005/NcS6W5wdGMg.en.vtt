00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
based on a completely different medical

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.450 
based on a completely different medical
model<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:42.960> Western<00:00:43.290> medicine<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:44.010> it's<00:00:44.219> based

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
model in Western medicine so it's based

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.049 
model in Western medicine so it's based
on<00:00:44.640> an<00:00:44.789> energetic<00:00:45.270> model<00:00:45.840> which<00:00:45.989> means<00:00:46.320> that

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
on an energetic model which means that

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.580 
on an energetic model which means that
for<00:00:48.059> starters<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.480> vocabulary<00:00:49.050> tends<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.469> be

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
for starters the vocabulary tends to be

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.020 
for starters the vocabulary tends to be
different<00:00:49.920> which<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.219> why<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.460> two<00:00:50.760> camps

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
different which is why the two camps

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.700 
different which is why the two camps
seem<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.600> struggle<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:52.020> little<00:00:52.140> bit<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.500> being

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
seem to struggle a little bit and being

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.439 
seem to struggle a little bit and being
able<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.980> speak<00:00:53.190> with<00:00:53.340> each<00:00:53.460> other<00:00:53.699> but

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
able to speak with each other but

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.150 
able to speak with each other but
Chinese<00:00:54.750> medicine<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.260> based<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
Chinese medicine is based on the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.860 
Chinese medicine is based on the
understanding<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.910> energy<00:00:57.449> should<00:00:57.480> always

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
understanding that energy should always

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.630 
understanding that energy should always
be<00:00:58.050> moving<00:00:58.500> freely<00:00:58.800> throughout<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.309> body<00:00:59.489> and

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
be moving freely throughout the body and

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.950 
be moving freely throughout the body and
that<00:00:59.879> when<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.149> gets<00:01:00.300> stuck<00:01:00.539> that's<00:01:00.809> when

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
that when it gets stuck that's when

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.959 
that when it gets stuck that's when
illness<00:01:01.170> results<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.609> illness<00:01:02.820> will

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
illness results and so the illness will

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.240 
illness results and so the illness will
come<00:01:03.120> up<00:01:03.239> with<00:01:03.390> different<00:01:03.480> symptoms<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:05.010> so

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
come up with different symptoms and so

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.130 
come up with different symptoms and so
when<00:01:05.790> I'm<00:01:05.939> talking<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.360> patients<00:01:06.780> about<00:01:06.840> this

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
when I'm talking to patients about this

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.740 
when I'm talking to patients about this
I<00:01:07.260> it's<00:01:07.619> almost<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.580> given<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:09.420> when<00:01:09.600> people

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
I it's almost a given that when people

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.910 
I it's almost a given that when people
come<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.110> with<00:01:10.140> something<00:01:10.439> they've<00:01:10.680> probably

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
come in with something they've probably

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.649 
come in with something they've probably
had<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.310> for<00:01:11.520> at<00:01:11.580> least<00:01:11.729> 10<00:01:12.060> years<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.540> if

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
had it for at least 10 years and if

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.060 
had it for at least 10 years and if
you're<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.260> know<00:01:13.350> substantially<00:01:13.950> older

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
you're you know substantially older

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.179 
you're you know substantially older
might<00:01:14.340> even<00:01:14.520> be<00:01:14.640> 20<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:16.380> way<00:01:16.560> chinese

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
might even be 20 and the way chinese

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.800 
might even be 20 and the way chinese
medicine<00:01:17.549> looks<00:01:17.729> at<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.720> know

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
medicine looks at is that you know

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.690 
medicine looks at is that you know
probably<00:01:18.990> about<00:01:19.140> 10<00:01:19.439> years<00:01:19.619> ago<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.950> had<00:01:20.280> some

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
probably about 10 years ago you had some

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.899 
probably about 10 years ago you had some
energetic<00:01:21.270> shift<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:22.500> if<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.250> are<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> very

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
energetic shift that if you are a very

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.370 
energetic shift that if you are a very
skilled<00:01:24.030> acupuncturist<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:24.960> might<00:01:25.140> be<00:01:25.290> able

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
tend to be a little more fleeting you

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.480 
tend to be a little more fleeting you
know<00:01:33.990> things<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.380> don't<00:01:34.829> register<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.340> an

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
know things that don't register on an

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.069 
know things that don't register on an
x-ray<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.939> how<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.060> describe<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:36.930> you

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
x-ray is how I describe that so like you

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.140 
x-ray is how I describe that so like you
get<00:01:37.229> headaches<00:01:37.619> or<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.670> stomach<00:01:39.000> pain

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
get headaches or you have stomach pain

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.060 
get headaches or you have stomach pain
when<00:01:39.329> you're<00:01:39.450> stressed<00:01:39.720> or<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.439> know<00:01:40.979> you

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
when you're stressed or you know you

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.700 
when you're stressed or you know you
have<00:01:41.310> things<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:42.420> aren't<00:01:42.930> measurable

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
have things that that aren't measurable

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.399 
have things that that aren't measurable
and<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.790> usually<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> way<00:01:45.540> medicine<00:01:45.960> in

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
and so usually the way medicine in

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.020 
and so usually the way medicine in
Western<00:01:47.130> medicine<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.700> know<00:01:47.759> that's<00:01:47.970> not

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
Western medicine you know that's not

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.580 
Western medicine you know that's not
something<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.689> deal<00:01:48.930> with<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.110> lots<00:01:49.439> of

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
something that you deal with a lots of

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.080 
something that you deal with a lots of
people<00:01:49.920> just<00:01:50.040> sort<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.250> hope<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.939> maybe

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
people just sort of hope that maybe

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.090 
people just sort of hope that maybe
it'll<00:01:51.270> go<00:01:51.390> away<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:51.960> time<00:01:52.290> will<00:01:52.439> go<00:01:52.500> on<00:01:52.799> and

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
it'll go away and so time will go on and

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.800 
it'll go away and so time will go on and
they'll<00:01:53.729> end<00:01:53.939> up<00:01:54.030> having<00:01:54.299> more<00:01:54.420> physical

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
they'll end up having more physical

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.270 
they'll end up having more physical
symptoms<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.320> they<00:01:55.470> may<00:01:55.619> have<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.860> herniated

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
symptoms like they may have a herniated

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.219 
symptoms like they may have a herniated
disk<00:01:56.670> or<00:01:56.880> they'll<00:01:57.000> end<00:01:57.180> up<00:01:57.270> with<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:58.110> know

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
disk or they'll end up with a you know

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.990 
disk or they'll end up with a you know
ulcer<00:01:58.799> they'll<00:01:59.009> end<00:01:59.130> up<00:01:59.250> with<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.430> tumor<00:01:59.790> and

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
ulcer they'll end up with a tumor and

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.520 
ulcer they'll end up with a tumor and
that's<00:02:00.450> when<00:02:00.630> they<00:02:00.719> end<00:02:00.869> up<00:02:00.990> going<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.320> see<00:02:01.439> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
that's when they end up going to see the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.679 
that's when they end up going to see the
doctor<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.670> know<00:02:02.759> what<00:02:02.969> ten

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
doctor so this is you know what ten

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.999 
doctor so this is you know what ten
years<00:02:03.719> later<00:02:03.960> or<00:02:04.259> something<00:02:04.439> like<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.680> and

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
years later or something like that and

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.069 
years later or something like that and
the<00:02:05.670> doctor<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.360> always<00:02:06.509> feel<00:02:06.719> badly<00:02:06.930> for

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
the doctor that I always feel badly for

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.479 
the doctor that I always feel badly for
them<00:02:07.259> because<00:02:07.439> they're<00:02:07.710> ending<00:02:07.979> up<00:02:08.099> working

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
them because they're ending up working

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.469 
them because they're ending up working
with<00:02:08.520> something<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.000> trying<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.300> shift

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
with something and trying to shift

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.940 
with something and trying to shift
something<00:02:09.840> that's<00:02:09.989> now<00:02:10.140> much<00:02:10.470> more<00:02:10.709> physical

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
something that's now much more physical

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.940 
something that's now much more physical
when<00:02:11.370> 10<00:02:11.580> years<00:02:11.610> ago<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.270> was<00:02:12.420> energized

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
when 10 years ago it was energized

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.309 
when 10 years ago it was energized
much<00:02:13.220> easier<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.670> work<00:02:13.790> with<00:02:13.849> so<00:02:14.720> we<00:02:14.930> work<00:02:15.170> with

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
much easier to work with so we work with

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.309 
much easier to work with so we work with
people<00:02:15.500> in<00:02:15.830> all<00:02:16.459> areas<00:02:17.360> of<00:02:17.450> that<00:02:17.569> spectrum<00:02:17.989> we

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
people in all areas of that spectrum we

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.449 
people in all areas of that spectrum we
have<00:02:18.500> people<00:02:18.769> who<00:02:18.830> come<00:02:19.040> in<00:02:19.160> with<00:02:19.280> something

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
have people who come in with something

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.070 
have people who come in with something
very<00:02:19.700> physical<00:02:20.269> and<00:02:20.420> we<00:02:20.599> can<00:02:20.900> make<00:02:21.050> a

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
very physical and we can make a

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.020 
very physical and we can make a
difference<00:02:21.290> with<00:02:21.650> that<00:02:21.860> because<00:02:22.670> we<00:02:22.819> treat

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
difference with that because we treat

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.240 
difference with that because we treat
that<00:02:23.209> as<00:02:23.269> well<00:02:23.660> as<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.930> root<00:02:24.170> which<00:02:24.830> started

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
that as well as the root which started

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.070 
that as well as the root which started
you<00:02:25.760> know<00:02:25.849> whatever<00:02:26.269> period<00:02:26.569> of<00:02:26.750> time<00:02:26.930> before

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
you know whatever period of time before

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.410 
you know whatever period of time before
so<00:02:27.980> being<00:02:28.190> able<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.489> work<00:02:28.640> with<00:02:28.879> both<00:02:29.060> of<00:02:29.269> those

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
so being able to work with both of those

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.390 
so being able to work with both of those
allows<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.140> person<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.530> get<00:02:30.800> better<00:02:31.010> for<00:02:31.310> the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
allows the person to get better for the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.309 
allows the person to get better for the
main<00:02:31.610> reason<00:02:31.970> that<00:02:32.090> they're<00:02:32.269> here<00:02:32.569> as<00:02:32.720> well<00:02:32.989> as

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
main reason that they're here as well as

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.270 
main reason that they're here as well as
being<00:02:34.130> able<00:02:34.489> to<00:02:35.500> get<00:02:36.500> healthy<00:02:36.890> and<00:02:37.010> then<00:02:37.160> be

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
being able to get healthy and then be

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.009 
being able to get healthy and then be
able<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:37.519> stay<00:02:37.910> healthy<00:02:37.940> which<00:02:38.569> is<00:02:38.690> really<00:02:38.930> the

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
able to stay healthy which is really the

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.320 
able to stay healthy which is really the
