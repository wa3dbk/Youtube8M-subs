00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.410 
jokes are but actually it's the fourth
time<00:02:21.740> I've<00:02:22.040> heard<00:02:22.220> it<00:02:22.340> in<00:02:22.460> it<00:02:22.550> in<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.880> group<00:02:23.150> and

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
time I've heard it in it in a group and

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.720 
time I've heard it in it in a group and
I<00:02:23.750> think<00:02:23.960> it<00:02:24.260> each<00:02:24.500> time<00:02:24.800> it's<00:02:25.010> it's<00:02:25.370> different

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
I think it each time it's it's different

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.460 
I think it each time it's it's different
it's<00:02:26.000> funny<00:02:26.240> because<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.780> show<00:02:27.020> is<00:02:27.170> obviously

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
it's funny because the show is obviously

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.020 
it's funny because the show is obviously
not<00:02:27.650> paced<00:02:29.560> for<00:02:30.560> laughs<00:02:30.710> in<00:02:31.340> in<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.820> sense

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
not paced for laughs in in the sense

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.030 
not paced for laughs in in the sense
that<00:02:32.150> there's<00:02:33.080> no<00:02:33.140> space<00:02:33.500> for<00:02:33.530> them<00:02:33.890> we

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
that there's no space for them we

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.070 
that there's no space for them we
continue<00:02:34.520> on<00:02:34.670> it's<00:02:35.060> very<00:02:35.300> dense

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
continue on it's very dense

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.460 
continue on it's very dense
so<00:02:36.710> a<00:02:36.980> lot<00:02:37.400> of<00:02:37.430> times<00:02:37.700> I<00:02:37.760> think<00:02:37.880> oh<00:02:38.170> yeah<00:02:39.170> they
