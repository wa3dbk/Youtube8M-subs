 and in action on the contrast the 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.770
 discovery is amazing 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.270
 I still did not know what was 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.890

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.250
 nathan of water nobody had wanted me 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.900

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.580
 images or scholars recognized through the 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.680
 world 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.500
 sir malou why this taboo about 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.820
 video games but yes it's clear 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.320
 when palate what this point of view 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.149
 it'll activism is that 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.860
 calls the dynamics of sports for that 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.290

 baptise the laws of own brands 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.489
 So it's on this track that I 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.350
 French was what I was going to discover 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.209
 was amazing before the video games 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.430
 the Nazis was the first wave of 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.470
 conquest already in 1939 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.930
 adolf hitler was manipulated and made 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.390
 cheat codes seen well 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.070
 konami code and it does not stop there 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.200
 for years the clues 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.830
 accumulate rahlves hours the founder 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.070
 video game 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.840
 a German coincidence web is 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.030
 maybe yeah but behind the Nazis 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.850
 the illuminati and the video games are 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.230
 hide the same people but that he 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.150
 I had to find kevin for 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.220
 know more had he discovered the 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.959
 dark truth and we had paid the price 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.880
 so I went directly to 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.100
 research on dark web and secure 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.780
 so hidden where no one dares to surrender 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.630

 I broke the mystery of the video game 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.160
 gentlemen look at these clues 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.240

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.430
 exactly 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.220
 I still allowed if I take this 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.540

 suicide of the ex star of the video game Mario 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.720

 coincidence or whatever else I do not 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.030
 I do not think it's very suspicious 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.150
 felt that I was approaching the goal it makes 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.500

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.750

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.110
 of scrabble I got the anagram 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.380
 almost perfect of suddenly everything was becoming 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.919
