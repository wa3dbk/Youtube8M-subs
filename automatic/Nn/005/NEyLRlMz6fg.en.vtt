Aikido clarity calm I'm gonna just give
you<00:00:26.290> a<00:00:26.320> couple<00:00:26.680> of<00:00:26.739> the<00:00:26.829> things<00:00:27.040> that<00:00:27.279> resonate

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.700 
you a couple of the things that resonate

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.609 
you a couple of the things that resonate
it<00:00:27.820> from<00:00:27.970> me<00:00:28.119> the<00:00:28.270> most<00:00:28.450> from<00:00:29.169> Jimmy's

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
it from me the most from Jimmy's

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.740 
it from me the most from Jimmy's
interview<00:00:30.160> and<00:00:30.369> just<00:00:31.059> kind<00:00:31.210> of<00:00:31.239> walk<00:00:31.540> away

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
interview and just kind of walk away

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.209 
interview and just kind of walk away
with<00:00:31.989> some<00:00:32.110> of<00:00:32.200> the<00:00:32.259> application<00:00:32.860> points<00:00:33.100> that

00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:33.219 
with some of the application points that

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:34.979 
with some of the application points that
you<00:00:33.340> can<00:00:33.489> take<00:00:33.700> about<00:00:33.940> ketosis<00:00:34.660> and<00:00:34.809> also

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
you can take about ketosis and also

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.380 
you can take about ketosis and also
maybe<00:00:35.170> give<00:00:35.350> you<00:00:35.469> some<00:00:35.500> clarity<00:00:36.160> on<00:00:36.429> ketosis

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
maybe give you some clarity on ketosis

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.500 
maybe give you some clarity on ketosis
moving<00:00:37.660> forward<00:00:38.070> begin<00:00:39.070> what<00:00:39.399> our<00:00:39.609> ketones

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
moving forward begin what our ketones

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.270 
moving forward begin what our ketones
well<00:00:40.750> there's<00:00:41.109> three<00:00:41.350> main<00:00:41.559> ketones<00:00:42.010> we<00:00:42.160> have

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
well there's three main ketones we have

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.040 
well there's three main ketones we have
to<00:00:42.460> worry<00:00:42.640> about<00:00:42.789> here<00:00:43.059> there's<00:00:43.239> three<00:00:43.449> there

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
to worry about here there's three there

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.459 
to worry about here there's three there
is<00:00:44.079> a<00:00:44.730> sido<00:00:45.730> acetate<00:00:46.329> that's<00:00:47.109> gonna<00:00:47.289> be<00:00:47.440> a

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
is a sido acetate that's gonna be a

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.739 
is a sido acetate that's gonna be a
ketone<00:00:47.859> that<00:00:47.890> we<00:00:48.100> see<00:00:48.280> in<00:00:48.370> our<00:00:48.489> urine<00:00:48.940> so<00:00:49.659> I'm

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:49.749 
ketone that we see in our urine so I'm

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:55.169 
ketone that we see in our urine so I'm
gonna<00:00:49.870> write<00:00:52.589> urine<00:00:53.589> there<00:00:53.859> we<00:00:54.519> see<00:00:54.730> a<00:00:54.760> beta

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179 
gonna write urine there we see a beta

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:58.229 
gonna write urine there we see a beta
hydroxy<00:00:55.719> butyrate<00:00:56.350> think<00:00:56.980> of<00:00:57.129> be<00:00:57.429> in<00:00:57.699> beta<00:00:57.969> as

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
hydroxy butyrate think of be in beta as

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.079 
hydroxy butyrate think of be in beta as
B<00:00:58.780> for<00:00:59.050> blood<00:00:59.309> that's<00:01:00.309> a<00:01:00.460> good<00:01:00.609> reminder<00:01:01.499> and

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
B for blood that's a good reminder and

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.360 
B for blood that's a good reminder and
then<00:01:04.089> again<00:01:04.330> acetone<00:01:05.170> kind<00:01:05.860> of<00:01:05.920> like<00:01:06.070> nail

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
then again acetone kind of like nail

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.760 
then again acetone kind of like nail
polish<00:01:06.640> acetone<00:01:07.360> that's<00:01:07.960> going<00:01:08.200> to<00:01:08.260> be<00:01:08.410> in

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
polish acetone that's going to be in

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.710 
polish acetone that's going to be in
your<00:01:09.040> breath<00:01:09.280> so<00:01:09.790> there's<00:01:09.970> three<00:01:10.150> ways<00:01:10.360> we<00:01:10.570> can

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
your breath so there's three ways we can

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.760 
your breath so there's three ways we can
measure<00:01:10.870> that<00:01:11.610> urine<00:01:12.610> blood<00:01:13.120> and<00:01:13.450> breath<00:01:16.770> so

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
measure that urine blood and breath so

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.350 
measure that urine blood and breath so
what<00:01:18.040> our<00:01:18.130> ketones<00:01:18.520> these<00:01:18.760> are<00:01:18.850> all<00:01:18.970> fatty

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
what our ketones these are all fatty

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.320 
what our ketones these are all fatty

these<00:01:22.510> fatty<00:01:22.750> acids<00:01:23.170> they<00:01:23.290> go<00:01:23.470> into<00:01:23.710> these

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
these fatty acids they go into these

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.520 
these fatty acids they go into these
various<00:01:24.310> forms<00:01:24.610> and<00:01:24.910> our<00:01:25.000> body<00:01:25.330> once<00:01:26.110> we<00:01:26.350> get

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
various forms and our body once we get

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.000 
various forms and our body once we get
keto<00:01:27.250> adapted<00:01:28.000> our<00:01:28.690> bodies<00:01:29.110> on<00:01:29.260> this<00:01:29.410> constant

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
keto adapted our bodies on this constant

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:40.350 
keto adapted our bodies on this constant

a fat burner so as we start bringing the
fat<00:01:43.630> back<00:01:44.020> up<00:01:44.530> we<00:01:45.400> can<00:01:45.550> start<00:01:45.700> going<00:01:45.970> more<00:01:46.210> into

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
fat back up we can start going more into

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.480 
fat back up we can start going more into
ketosis<00:01:46.840> this<00:01:47.350> is<00:01:47.500> where<00:01:47.710> we<00:01:47.860> want<00:01:48.130> to<00:01:48.190> be<00:01:48.310> this

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
ketosis this is where we want to be this

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.670 
ketosis this is where we want to be this
is<00:01:48.550> ketosis<00:01:49.390> now<00:01:49.990> there<00:01:50.170> are<00:01:50.260> a<00:01:50.290> couple<00:01:50.350> of

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
is ketosis now there are a couple of

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.730 
is ketosis now there are a couple of
things<00:01:50.890> that<00:01:50.980> will<00:01:51.190> push<00:01:51.550> it<00:01:51.730> back<00:01:52.030> down<00:01:52.740> what

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
things that will push it back down what

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.100 
things that will push it back down what
will<00:01:53.800> push<00:01:54.010> it<00:01:54.190> back<00:01:54.370> down<00:01:54.400> is<00:01:54.820> insulin<00:01:55.480> so

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
will push it back down is insulin so

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.790 
will push it back down is insulin so
insulin<00:01:56.560> is<00:01:56.650> a<00:01:56.740> hormone<00:01:56.770> that<00:01:57.280> will<00:01:57.430> drop<00:01:57.790> that

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
insulin is a hormone that will drop that

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.200 
insulin is a hormone that will drop that
right<00:01:59.800> back<00:02:00.040> down<00:02:00.280> so<00:02:00.520> we<00:02:00.640> really<00:02:00.940> have<00:02:01.060> to

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
right back down so we really have to

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.110 
right back down so we really have to
make<00:02:01.390> sure<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.720> carbs<00:02:02.230> are<00:02:02.380> low<00:02:02.620> and<00:02:03.040> also<00:02:03.850> we

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
make sure the carbs are low and also we

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.700 
make sure the carbs are low and also we
have<00:02:04.270> to<00:02:04.330> make<00:02:04.660> sure<00:02:04.840> we're<00:02:04.960> not<00:02:05.080> doing<00:02:05.440> too

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
have to make sure we're not doing too

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.520 
have to make sure we're not doing too
much<00:02:05.980> protein<00:02:06.550> so<00:02:07.360> protein<00:02:07.900> can<00:02:08.140> be<00:02:08.170> another

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
much protein so protein can be another

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.270 
much protein so protein can be another
one<00:02:09.959> so<00:02:10.959> ideally<00:02:11.500> when<00:02:11.590> we're<00:02:11.769> trying<00:02:12.129> to<00:02:12.189> get

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
one so ideally when we're trying to get

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.309 
one so ideally when we're trying to get
in<00:02:12.400> ketosis<00:02:12.700> we<00:02:12.969> really<00:02:13.269> want<00:02:13.510> a<00:02:13.540> high<00:02:13.780> fat

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
in ketosis we really want a high fat

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.989 
in ketosis we really want a high fat
diet<00:02:14.349> that's<00:02:15.189> really<00:02:15.579> going<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.760> be<00:02:15.819> where

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:15.999 
diet that's really going to be where

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:17.059 
diet that's really going to be where
we're<00:02:16.120> at<00:02:16.180> ma

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
we're at ma

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.910 
we're at ma
protein<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:18.030> again<00:02:18.780> definitely<00:02:19.260> lower<00:02:19.439> carbs

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
protein and again definitely lower carbs

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.679 
protein and again definitely lower carbs
and<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.129> carb<00:02:20.489> levels<00:02:20.849> can<00:02:21.060> change<00:02:21.329> for<00:02:21.540> each

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
and the carb levels can change for each

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.289 
and the carb levels can change for each
individual<00:02:22.519> people<00:02:23.519> out<00:02:23.609> there<00:02:23.819> like<00:02:24.060> bang

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
individual people out there like bang

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.199 
individual people out there like bang
greenfield<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:25.140> can<00:02:25.319> do<00:02:26.189> triathlons<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:27.060> so

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
greenfield that can do triathlons and so

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.209 
greenfield that can do triathlons and so
I<00:02:27.239> should<00:02:27.450> do<00:02:27.569> 200<00:02:28.170> grams<00:02:28.439> of<00:02:28.590> carbohydrate<00:02:29.129> it

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:29.219 
I should do 200 grams of carbohydrate it

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:31.580 
I should do 200 grams of carbohydrate it
ain't<00:02:29.459> still<00:02:29.790> in<00:02:30.000> ketosis<00:02:30.599> or<00:02:30.780> people<00:02:31.469> like

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
ain't still in ketosis or people like

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.770 
ain't still in ketosis or people like
Jimmy<00:02:31.980> Moore<00:02:32.219> maybe<00:02:32.519> at<00:02:32.700> 20<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.180> 30<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.629> he's

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
Jimmy Moore maybe at 20 to 30 and he's

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.140 
Jimmy Moore maybe at 20 to 30 and he's
out<00:02:34.019> of<00:02:34.230> ketosis<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:35.489> you<00:02:35.579> really<00:02:35.909> have<00:02:36.030> to

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
out of ketosis so you really have to

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.819 
out of ketosis so you really have to
find<00:02:36.329> out<00:02:36.510> what<00:02:36.689> works<00:02:36.870> for<00:02:37.019> you<00:02:37.170> but<00:02:37.439> this<00:02:37.620> is

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
find out what works for you but this is

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.360 
find out what works for you but this is
the<00:02:38.450> energy<00:02:39.560> pyramid<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.650> energy<00:02:40.980> seesaw

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
the energy pyramid of energy seesaw

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.979 
the energy pyramid of energy seesaw
that's<00:02:41.549> happening<00:02:41.909> here<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.359> we<00:02:42.480> really<00:02:42.810> want

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
that's happening here and we really want

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.990 
that's happening here and we really want
to<00:02:43.049> make<00:02:43.200> sure<00:02:43.230> we're<00:02:43.769> burning<00:02:44.459> fat<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:44.879> that

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
to make sure we're burning fat and that

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.240 
to make sure we're burning fat and that
can<00:02:45.150> take<00:02:45.329> 1<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.079> 2<00:02:46.109> weeks<00:02:46.500> for<00:02:46.859> a<00:02:46.920> healthy

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
can take 1 to 2 weeks for a healthy

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.770 
can take 1 to 2 weeks for a healthy
person<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.670> transition<00:02:48.180> one<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.989> two<00:02:49.139> weeks

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
person the transition one to two weeks

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.649 
person the transition one to two weeks
and<00:02:52.310> again<00:02:53.310> if<00:02:53.579> you<00:02:53.790> are<00:02:53.819> unhealthy<00:02:54.299> it<00:02:54.540> can

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
and again if you are unhealthy it can

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.330 
and again if you are unhealthy it can
take<00:02:54.780> up<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:54.930> one<00:02:55.319> to<00:02:55.500> two<00:02:55.560> months<00:02:55.889> I<00:02:56.099> think<00:02:56.250> in

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
take up to one to two months I think in

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.069 
take up to one to two months I think in
Jimmy's<00:02:56.639> cases<00:02:57.000> at<00:02:57.090> about<00:02:57.299> 2<00:02:57.540> months<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:57.959> would

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
Jimmy's cases at about 2 months it would

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.379 
Jimmy's cases at about 2 months it would
take<00:02:58.230> him<00:02:58.349> to<00:02:58.530> get<00:02:58.650> into<00:02:59.220> ketosis<00:02:59.400> when<00:03:00.299> you

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
take him to get into ketosis when you

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.839 
take him to get into ketosis when you
first<00:03:00.599> try<00:03:00.980> so<00:03:01.980> again<00:03:02.189> how<00:03:02.370> do<00:03:02.430> we<00:03:02.609> get<00:03:02.760> in

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
first try so again how do we get in

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.460 
first try so again how do we get in
ketosis<00:03:03.150> we<00:03:03.389> already<00:03:03.659> kind<00:03:03.840> of<00:03:03.870> alluded<00:03:04.019> some

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
ketosis we already kind of alluded some

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.949 
ketosis we already kind of alluded some
of<00:03:04.560> these<00:03:04.650> things<00:03:04.859> again<00:03:05.760> for<00:03:06.060> most<00:03:06.510> people<00:03:06.870> if

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
of these things again for most people if

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.869 
of these things again for most people if
you<00:03:06.989> don't<00:03:07.109> have<00:03:07.260> too<00:03:07.379> much<00:03:07.500> metabolic<00:03:08.099> damage

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
you don't have too much metabolic damage

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.849 
you don't have too much metabolic damage
so<00:03:09.269> to<00:03:09.329> speak<00:03:09.569> getting<00:03:09.870> down<00:03:09.989> to<00:03:10.139> 50<00:03:10.439> carbs<00:03:10.769> I

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
so to speak getting down to 50 carbs I

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.250 
so to speak getting down to 50 carbs I
think<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.099> a<00:03:11.159> really<00:03:11.370> good<00:03:11.659> place<00:03:12.659> to<00:03:12.840> be<00:03:12.989> if

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
think is a really good place to be if

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.229 
think is a really good place to be if
you're<00:03:13.739> already<00:03:13.950> 50<00:03:14.370> or<00:03:14.519> a<00:03:14.549> hundred<00:03:14.609> pounds

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
you're already 50 or a hundred pounds

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.580 
you're already 50 or a hundred pounds
overweight<00:03:15.419> or<00:03:15.540> have<00:03:15.659> a<00:03:15.750> history<00:03:16.169> of<00:03:16.200> weight

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
overweight or have a history of weight

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.259 
overweight or have a history of weight
issues<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.400> may<00:03:17.549> want<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.790> get<00:03:17.909> down<00:03:18.090> into

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
issues you may want to get down into

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.659 
issues you may want to get down into
that<00:03:18.450> Atkins<00:03:18.900> weak<00:03:19.139> spot<00:03:19.439> up<00:03:19.590> around<00:03:19.769> 20<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.340> 30

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669 
that Atkins weak spot up around 20 to 30

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.240 
that Atkins weak spot up around 20 to 30
but<00:03:21.540> that's<00:03:21.659> your<00:03:21.810> first<00:03:21.989> bet<00:03:22.260> again<00:03:22.919> Jimmy

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
but that's your first bet again Jimmy

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.500 
but that's your first bet again Jimmy
mentioned<00:03:23.579> a<00:03:23.639> couple<00:03:23.909> of<00:03:24.000> foods<00:03:24.239> that<00:03:24.359> were

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
mentioned a couple of foods that were

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.689 
mentioned a couple of foods that were
really<00:03:24.750> beneficial<00:03:25.199> for<00:03:25.349> him<00:03:25.620> he<00:03:26.280> mentioned

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:26.699 
really beneficial for him he mentioned

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:29.689 
really beneficial for him he mentioned
grass-fed<00:03:27.419> meat<00:03:27.810> being<00:03:28.349> really<00:03:28.620> good<00:03:28.799> he<00:03:29.489> also

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:29.699 
grass-fed meat being really good he also

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:31.789 
grass-fed meat being really good he also
mentioned<00:03:30.269> butter<00:03:30.629> grass-fed<00:03:31.290> butter<00:03:31.470> also

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
mentioned butter grass-fed butter also

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.550 
mentioned butter grass-fed butter also
being<00:03:32.250> good<00:03:32.519> he<00:03:33.269> also<00:03:33.449> liked<00:03:33.780> heavy<00:03:34.109> whipping

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
being good he also liked heavy whipping

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.069 
being good he also liked heavy whipping
cream<00:03:35.180> those<00:03:36.180> were<00:03:36.329> a<00:03:36.359> couple<00:03:36.629> of<00:03:36.720> foods<00:03:36.900> that

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
cream those were a couple of foods that

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.990 
cream those were a couple of foods that
he<00:03:37.379> really<00:03:37.590> liked<00:03:37.739> to<00:03:37.769> help<00:03:38.010> get<00:03:38.310> himself<00:03:38.489> into

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
he really liked to help get himself into

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.680 
he really liked to help get himself into
ketosis<00:03:39.269> also<00:03:40.229> bacon<00:03:40.859> and<00:03:41.190> eggs<00:03:41.579> these<00:03:42.540> are

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
ketosis also bacon and eggs these are

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.119 
ketosis also bacon and eggs these are
really<00:03:42.959> high<00:03:43.169> fat<00:03:43.500> foods<00:03:43.799> they're<00:03:43.979> also

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
really high fat foods they're also

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:45.920 
really high fat foods they're also
nutrient-dense<00:03:44.849> especially<00:03:45.569> if<00:03:45.659> you<00:03:45.750> buy

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
nutrient-dense especially if you buy

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.640 
nutrient-dense especially if you buy
them<00:03:46.699> organic<00:03:47.699> all<00:03:48.389> right<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.840> how<00:03:49.379> do<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.590> get

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
them organic all right and how do I get

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.020 
them organic all right and how do I get

into those is we already talked about

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.240 
into those is we already talked about
that<00:03:51.299> keeping<00:03:51.629> the<00:03:51.720> sugar<00:03:51.959> down<00:03:52.139> ketosis<00:03:53.099> and

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
that keeping the sugar down ketosis and

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.890 
that keeping the sugar down ketosis and
hunger<00:03:53.699> so<00:03:53.879> a<00:03:53.909> lot<00:03:54.120> of<00:03:54.150> people<00:03:54.329> they<00:03:54.599> notice

that<00:04:30.599> we're

that we're

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.760 
that we're
dropping<00:04:31.240> the<00:04:31.360> sugar<00:04:31.630> down<00:04:31.870> and<00:04:32.260> we're

dropping the sugar down and we're

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.620 
dropping the sugar down and we're

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
not be spitting out ketones in the urine

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.230 
not be spitting out ketones in the urine
right<00:05:30.070> you<00:05:30.280> may<00:05:30.370> not<00:05:30.520> be<00:05:30.640> producing<00:05:31.060> lunch

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
right you may not be producing lunch

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.420 
right you may not be producing lunch
acetoacetate<00:05:31.720> and<00:05:32.440> your<00:05:32.860> body<00:05:33.070> may<00:05:33.280> actually

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
acetoacetate and your body may actually

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.700 
acetoacetate and your body may actually
shift<00:05:33.910> and<00:05:34.120> produce<00:05:34.330> more

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
shift and produce more

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.470 
shift and produce more
beta-hydroxybutyrate<00:05:35.910> so<00:05:36.910> when<00:05:37.090> this<00:05:37.270> is

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
beta-hydroxybutyrate so when this is

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.990 
beta-hydroxybutyrate so when this is
happening<00:05:37.960> you<00:05:38.260> may<00:05:39.250> need<00:05:39.370> to<00:05:39.490> use<00:05:39.520> blood

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
happening you may need to use blood

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.420 
happening you may need to use blood
testing<00:05:40.930> there's<00:05:41.470> a<00:05:41.560> couple<00:05:41.740> of<00:05:41.890> blood<00:05:42.130> sticks

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
testing there's a couple of blood sticks

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.220 
testing there's a couple of blood sticks
on<00:05:42.610> the<00:05:42.730> market<00:05:43.060> I'll<00:05:43.330> put<00:05:43.630> a<00:05:43.660> reference<00:05:43.840> below

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
on the market I'll put a reference below

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.320 
on the market I'll put a reference below

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
book and then again acetone is kind of a

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.790 
book and then again acetone is kind of a
new<00:05:49.120> technology<00:05:49.750> where<00:05:49.930> they're<00:05:50.170> using

new technology where they're using

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:02.920 
longer-term you can use the beta hydroxy

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.670 
longer-term you can use the beta hydroxy
