00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.119
 ministero.net we are going to make a comparison -2 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:15.480
 and the time and more anticipated of this period and above all the top of the range 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.570
 regarding 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.619
 apple with paypal with type s4 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.410
 and samsung android accounts on galaxy s we turn them on both types 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.470
 different displays 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.210
 super amoled for the sansung the retina display for 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.539
 the source of ours 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:34.809
 great screens 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.649
 stop in the direct sunlight that there are both swivels 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:39.440
 this thing 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.350
 contrast is also very important 3 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.860
 very high part 2 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.249
 air display by 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:47.159
 even more defined 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:49.380
 from nothing before 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.710
 ass comparison several rassu 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.249
 between the internet 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:57.289
 we are immediately under investigation. casperfan occupation 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.440
 to make criticism we decided to connect 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.360
 hi-fi tv phones 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.110
 I clicked at the same time 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.320
 what your mind plays the rendering speed because it is the rai that 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.020
 repeat 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.010
 identical night 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.360
 how do you see the performance yes 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.330
 rt here are worth more or less 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.590
 as for the scrobbling ipod instead see alitalia for seems 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.020
 slightly + that fluid 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.299
 let's try zooming here too 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.409
 to the cumpa greater fluency rt sense of 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.600
 brightness have been different 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.579
 for galaxy s slightly brighter we try to zoom in even more 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.280
 thanks to the resolution 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.810
 and then 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.759
 crazy about characters that I look really printed on the display market galaxy s 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.440
 he made an excellent visualization 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.200
 thanks for the images either 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.020
 text 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.390
 let's try pa 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.880
 to come in 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.530
 in another 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.970
 in the meantime it was 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.170
 opposed a link to brake opens another page for example 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.090
 the news page 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.749
 that changes agreements I love you 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:11.849
 the difference in performance in taking 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.839
 while 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:15.380
 load the page so i try new friends 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.719
 homelite also here 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.319
 maybe file pump 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.319
 a slight fluidity 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:28.700
 nothing transcendental we both repeat with the gaiters if they really get along 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.610
 leader 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.399
 back to the source we see the 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:35.399
 display rotation speed 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.689
 cool i love you insom 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:45.509
 the samsung I kept it too flat redo the test 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:49.839
 maneuvering two phones simultaneously a clutch is not easy with the 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:51.219
 Samsung gaiters 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:52.870
 in this case you type 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.689
 apple because it's faster 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.189
 in the rotation 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.209
 deejay display 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.830
 let's go back to the 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.269
 a prince 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.189
 I wanted 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:03.389
 to go 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.689
 at the berchet gallery 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:06.880
 in downloaded 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.029
 an image 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:09.510
 because this is about art 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.119
 a rendering 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:14.549
 make the difference of the colors of the two displays 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.599
 exceeds them 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.779
 samsung love has colors 

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:19.830
 - natural 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:20.949
 + fired 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:26.270
 + from cartoon let's say a little bit from you lcd so to speak while 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.349
 the digital display. does 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.389
 of the colors a little more 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.039
 natural here we go back to quadrature 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:38.489
 let's try a sea to see also the quality differences of this display 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:43.479
 those of the android gallery 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:47.999
 it does damage cents. image loop 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:52.370
 and so like you when we sleep it turns out to be slightly that square 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.020
 arbor of while 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.940
 in some ways I studied does not do this there are alternatives that 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.180
 they allow a full picture display but resolution 

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:06.780
 that base of android does 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.780
 this in inverted commas 

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:12.610
 even here I personally prefer 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.159
 of colors d 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.990
 art. 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.470
 right for 4 and then those are too fired 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.790
 those of samsung as the unit instead 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.460
 4 then wins 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.249
 wins samsung 

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:27.370
 we return 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.400
 always 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.849
 humor park 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:31.599
 I show 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:32.819
 address book 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.509
 contacts 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:39.039
 we immediately enter the section let's see if I can 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:42.360
 contacts here 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.430
 in this section 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.749
 that the kinetic scrolling between the two phones 3 

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:48.860
 almost the same as 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.380
 speed and how to work the sansung phonebook will go more 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.020
 options you want we can choose is more options than it was 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.570
 the link with 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.129
 running with social networks what aifon one then 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:08.499
 the motorist android you has still played against the integration cont 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:13.069
 the social network surely you will ask us what we will buy 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:14.280
 bought 2 because 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.900
 we are sick 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.900
 huh 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.150
 a tip for cellular dermatitis 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.110
 alkoipa 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.330
 and those of rice book rental problem 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.089
 simsun sole 

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:29.499
 maybe it rotates some more when we go 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.229
 accusing him of both really excellent models depends. from sta 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.180
 just what you prefer ultimate 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.819
 last I love 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:41.000
 but what I do 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.590
 alkymia. I can't show the weight and size 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:50.040
 then dimensions win falcon because the small here it is also here however a 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.660
 smaller display 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.840
 and it is much heavier so in everyday use I preferred samsung 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.490
 purely mattel poorer and being 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.500
 + subject to VAT because it was a plastically back cover 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.259
 add font is completely in vitro by telephone. net andrea galeazzi
