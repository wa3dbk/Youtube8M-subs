00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.290 
millimeter fans that up I had around my

Edition<00:00:13.559> video<00:00:13.740> card<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.809> basically<00:00:15.809> what<00:00:15.990> I

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
Edition video card and basically what I

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.609 
Edition video card and basically what I
did<00:00:16.109> was<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.650> replaced<00:00:17.250> us<00:00:17.609> since<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.439> fan<00:00:19.439> that

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
did was I replaced us since the fan that

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:32.269 
did was I replaced us since the fan that
I<00:00:19.740> had<00:00:19.980> was<00:00:30.320> little<00:00:31.320> dusty<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.800> can<00:00:31.980> see<00:00:32.189> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
I had was little dusty you can see the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.569 
I had was little dusty you can see the
fan<00:00:32.520> blade<00:00:32.790> broke<00:00:33.030> off<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.450> there<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:34.550> had<00:00:35.550> to

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
fan blade broke off of there so had to

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.160 
fan blade broke off of there so had to
improvise<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.480> here's<00:00:36.690> what<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.870> did

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
improvise and here's what I did

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.090 
improvise and here's what I did
she's<00:00:37.890> some<00:00:38.070> rubber<00:00:38.280> bands<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.860> get<00:00:40.860> to

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
she's some rubber bands and get to

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.000

roughly<00:00:49.910> 35<00:00:50.910> CFM<00:00:51.570> each<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:53.300> this<00:00:54.300> one<00:00:54.480> right

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
roughly 35 CFM each and this one right

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.369 
roughly 35 CFM each and this one right
here<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.899> just<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.170> standard<00:00:55.440> three-pin<00:00:56.190> and

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
here is just a standard three-pin and

here is just a standard three-pin and
this<00:00:58.379> one<00:00:58.530> right<00:00:58.680> here<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.039> actually<00:00:59.219> if<00:00:59.550> you

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
this one right here is actually if you

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.119 
this one right here is actually if you
look<00:00:59.670> down<00:00:59.969> here<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.570> see<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.230> little

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
look down here you can see a little

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.650 
look down here you can see a little
temperature<00:01:02.699> probe<00:01:03.030> even<00:01:03.390> though<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.510> don't

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
temperature probe even though I don't

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.210 
temperature probe even though I don't
have<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.989> set<00:01:04.170> up<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.320> work<00:01:04.530> like<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:04.799> right

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
have it set up to work like that right

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.840 
have it set up to work like that right
now<00:01:05.510> and<00:01:07.040> if<00:01:08.040> you're<00:01:08.159> wondering<00:01:08.340> why<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.640> went

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
now and if you're wondering why I went

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.700 
now and if you're wondering why I went

with to 80 millimeter fans this 80
millimeter<00:01:11.130> fan<00:01:11.369> here<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.510> shroud<00:01:12.900> actually

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
millimeter fan here the shroud actually

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.130 
millimeter fan here the shroud actually
blows<00:01:13.590> directly<00:01:14.100> onto<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.520> core<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:15.810> goes

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
blows directly onto the core and goes

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.990 
blows directly onto the core and goes
through<00:01:16.320> here<00:01:16.619> gets<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.490> around<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:17.909> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
through here gets on around on the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.020 
through here gets on around on the
memory<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.600> then<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.380> one<00:01:19.619> here<00:01:20.030> actually

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
memory and then this one here actually

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.820

the heatsink on them at the moment and
if<00:01:35.250> you're<00:01:35.400> wondering<00:01:35.730> why<00:01:35.910> I'm<00:01:35.970> running<00:01:36.270> this

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
if you're wondering why I'm running this

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.690 
if you're wondering why I'm running this
any<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.940> non<00:01:39.870> reference<00:01:40.470> video<00:01:41.160> cards

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
any of the non reference video cards

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.950 
any of the non reference video cards
that<00:01:42.050> have<00:01:43.050> less<00:01:43.410> than<00:01:43.440> I<00:01:44.690> haven't<00:01:45.690> actually

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
that have less than I haven't actually

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.240 
that have less than I haven't actually
measured<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.440> yet<00:01:46.650> but<00:01:46.830> there's<00:01:46.980> a<00:01:47.010> certain

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
measured it yet but there's a certain

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.480 
measured it yet but there's a certain
amount<00:01:47.370> of<00:01:47.580> space<00:01:47.730> here<00:01:48.600> with<00:01:48.810> these<00:01:49.490> stack

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
amount of space here with these stack

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.910 
amount of space here with these stack
DVI<00:01:50.940> ports<00:01:51.510> if<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.750> have<00:01:51.870> standard<00:01:52.350> ports<00:01:52.740> on

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
DVI ports if you have standard ports on

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.800 
DVI ports if you have standard ports on
there<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.430> they're<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:53.910> on<00:01:54.300> the<00:01:54.450> single

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
there and they're just on the single

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.090 
there and they're just on the single
bracket<00:01:55.050> then<00:01:55.350> you're<00:01:55.470> okay<00:01:55.770> but<00:01:55.979> if<00:01:56.040> you're

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
bracket then you're okay but if you're

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.400 
bracket then you're okay but if you're
the<00:01:56.250> stack<00:01:56.520> type<00:01:57.020> you're<00:01:58.020> gonna<00:01:58.140> need<00:01:58.320> a

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
the stack type you're gonna need a

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.050 
the stack type you're gonna need a
certain<00:01:58.740> amount<00:01:58.800> of<00:01:59.010> distance<00:01:59.280> between<00:01:59.729> your

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
certain amount of distance between your

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.000 
certain amount of distance between your
core<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.750> get<00:02:00.870> the<00:02:00.930> shaman<00:02:01.380> there<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.800> more

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
core to get the shaman there a more

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
core to get the shaman there a more
thermal<00:02:02.550> right<00:02:02.729> shaman<00:02:03.300> to<00:02:03.420> fit<00:02:03.890> so<00:02:05.030> basically

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
thermal right shaman to fit so basically

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.880 
thermal right shaman to fit so basically
cannot<00:02:06.300> fit<00:02:06.510> on<00:02:06.630> this<00:02:06.720> video<00:02:07.020> card<00:02:07.320> but<00:02:07.619> I

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
cannot fit on this video card but I

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.639 
cannot fit on this video card but I
don't<00:02:08.820> plan<00:02:09.030> on<00:02:09.090> keeping<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:10.020> video<00:02:10.350> card

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
don't plan on keeping this video card

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.910 
don't plan on keeping this video card
very<00:02:11.010> much<00:02:11.190> longer<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:12.080> this<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.290> my<00:02:13.500> temporary

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
very much longer so this is my temporary

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.090 
very much longer so this is my temporary
solution<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.930> basically<00:02:16.350> this<00:02:16.620> fan<00:02:16.830> over

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
solution and basically this fan over

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.420 
solution and basically this fan over
here<00:02:17.400> has<00:02:17.940> two<00:02:18.240> leads<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:19.160> you<00:02:20.160> got<00:02:20.280> this

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
here has two leads to it you got this

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.210 
here has two leads to it you got this
lead<00:02:20.670> here<00:02:20.970> at<00:02:21.000> C<00:02:21.209> rpm<00:02:21.660> sensor<00:02:22.070> which<00:02:23.070> it

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
lead here at C rpm sensor which it

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.070 
lead here at C rpm sensor which it
actually<00:02:23.520> needs<00:02:23.700> this<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.209> run<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.480> found<00:02:24.870> out

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
actually needs this to run I found out

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.190 
actually needs this to run I found out
and<00:02:26.070> then<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:26.250> my<00:02:26.430> power<00:02:26.670> cables<00:02:30.050> going<00:02:31.050> down

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
and then I my power cables going down

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.050 
and then I my power cables going down
around<00:02:31.350> here<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:33.870> just<00:02:33.950> go<00:02:34.950> in<00:02:35.130> there<00:02:35.310> and

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
around here and I just go in there and

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.580 
around here and I just go in there and
feed<00:02:36.900> into<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.230> fan<00:02:37.470> controller<00:02:38.540> which<00:02:39.540> is

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.770 

right<00:02:42.590> here<00:02:42.980> these<00:02:43.550> two<00:02:43.610> here<00:02:44.150> this<00:02:44.330> is<00:02:44.540> for

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
right here these two here this is for

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.220 
right here these two here this is for
the<00:02:45.340> main<00:02:46.340> one<00:02:46.610> on<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.880> core<00:02:47.150> just<00:02:48.110> the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
the main one on the core just the

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.830 
the main one on the core just the
regular<00:02:48.650> three<00:02:49.070> pen<00:02:49.310> this<00:02:50.090> is<00:02:50.150> for<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.540> VR

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
regular three pen this is for the VR

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.580 
regular three pen this is for the VR
ends<00:02:51.080> here

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
ends here

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:59.510 
ends here
so<00:02:52.220> here's<00:02:52.490> totally<00:02:52.850> silent

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.980 

and<00:03:00.520> then<00:03:00.640> let's<00:03:00.850> do<00:03:01.120> a<00:03:03.480> run<00:03:04.480> them<00:03:04.630> all<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.870> way

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
and then let's do a run them all the way

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:16.730 
and then let's do a run them all the way
up<00:03:05.020> I<00:03:05.290> guess

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.730 

but<00:03:17.010> they<00:03:17.100> do<00:03:17.280> provide<00:03:18.470> quite<00:03:19.470> a<00:03:19.530> good<00:03:19.710> amount

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
but they do provide quite a good amount

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.070 
but they do provide quite a good amount
of<00:03:20.300> warning<00:03:21.300> I<00:03:21.360> don't<00:03:21.510> know<00:03:21.570> if<00:03:21.630> you<00:03:21.840> can<00:03:21.960> hear
