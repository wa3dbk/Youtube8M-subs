00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.569 
expectations are higher because we know
what<00:02:30.350> all<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.590> other<00:02:30.739> teams<00:02:30.980> are<00:02:31.100> like<00:02:31.280> last

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
what all the other teams are like last

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.210 
what all the other teams are like last
year<00:02:31.790> we<00:02:31.880> came<00:02:32.060> in<00:02:32.299> not<00:02:32.810> knowing<00:02:33.109> some<00:02:34.010> of<00:02:34.040> the

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
year we came in not knowing some of the

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.890 
year we came in not knowing some of the
teams<00:02:34.459> in<00:02:34.609> their<00:02:34.730> strength<00:02:35.060> but<00:02:35.239> this<00:02:35.480> year<00:02:35.720> we

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
teams in their strength but this year we

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.479 
teams in their strength but this year we
really<00:02:36.230> know<00:02:36.380> that<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:36.890> I<00:02:37.100> think<00:02:37.340> that<00:02:37.459> that's

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
really know that and I think that that's

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.370 
really know that and I think that that's
going<00:02:37.880> to<00:02:37.940> push

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
going to push

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.160 
going to push
to<00:02:38.590> work<00:02:38.710> harder<00:02:39.190> on<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.880> field<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.480> we<00:02:40.960> know

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
to work harder on the field and we know

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.660 
to work harder on the field and we know
their<00:02:41.380> tactics<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:42.070> we<00:02:42.190> can<00:02:42.340> really<00:02:42.460> use<00:02:42.640> that

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
their tactics and we can really use that

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.250 
their tactics and we can really use that
to<00:02:42.940> our<00:02:42.970> advantage<00:02:43.060> this<00:02:43.510> year<00:02:43.570> so<00:02:43.810> I<00:02:43.900> see<00:02:44.110> us

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
to our advantage this year so I see us

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.380 
to our advantage this year so I see us
winning<00:02:44.560> lots<00:02:44.830> of<00:02:44.980> games<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.520> possibly<00:02:46.180> go<00:02:46.330> to
