so<00:00:02.550> I'm<00:00:02.990> finished<00:00:03.990> adding<00:00:04.230> this<00:00:04.529> weed<00:00:04.890> block

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
so I'm finished adding this weed block

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.629 
so I'm finished adding this weed block
and<00:00:06.140> this<00:00:07.140> nice<00:00:07.440> piece<00:00:07.710> of<00:00:07.740> wood<00:00:08.040> which<00:00:08.460> I

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
and this nice piece of wood which I

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.209 
and this nice piece of wood which I
picked<00:00:09.150> up<00:00:09.269> at<00:00:09.450> in<00:00:09.540> our<00:00:09.660> aquatic<00:00:10.019> store<00:00:10.410> it's

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
picked up at in our aquatic store it's

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.190 
picked up at in our aquatic store it's
pretty<00:00:11.460> cool-looking<00:00:11.759> it's<00:00:12.719> going<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.929> be<00:00:13.049> my

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
pretty cool-looking it's going to be my

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.800 
pretty cool-looking it's going to be my
centerpiece<00:00:13.799> for<00:00:14.660> this<00:00:15.660> variant<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:17.810> what

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
centerpiece for this variant and what

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.670 
centerpiece for this variant and what
I'm<00:00:18.930> planning<00:00:19.170> here<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:20.180> to<00:00:21.180> have<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.689> little

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
I'm planning here is to have a little

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.970 
I'm planning here is to have a little
pool<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:22.949> water<00:00:23.220> up<00:00:24.029> at<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.660> level<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.230> have

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
pool of water up at this level and have

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.790 
pool of water up at this level and have
it<00:00:26.099> run<00:00:26.340> through<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.970> log<00:00:27.650> dripping<00:00:28.650> down

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
it run through the log dripping down

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.220 
it run through the log dripping down
here<00:00:29.189> into<00:00:29.510> this<00:00:30.510> small<00:00:30.869> pond<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.500> corner

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
here into this small pond in the corner

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.770 
here into this small pond in the corner
so<00:00:34.230> I'm<00:00:34.530> almost<00:00:34.680> ready<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.309> add<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.329> great

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
so I'm almost ready to add the great

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.930 
so I'm almost ready to add the great
stuff<00:00:37.110> on<00:00:37.700> the<00:00:38.700> thumb<00:00:39.800> here<00:00:40.800> that's<00:00:41.670> what<00:00:41.820> it

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
stuff on the thumb here that's what it

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.200 
stuff on the thumb here that's what it
looks<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:43.129> it's<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> pretty<00:00:44.309> common<00:00:44.670> method

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
looks like it's a pretty common method

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.900 
looks like it's a pretty common method
you<00:00:45.420> see<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.899> lot<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.460> enclosures<00:00:47.460> using

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
you see it in a lot of enclosures using

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.130 
you see it in a lot of enclosures using
this<00:00:48.059> foam<00:00:48.660> for<00:00:49.050> background<00:00:50.329> so<00:00:51.329> see<00:00:51.930> how<00:00:52.020> it

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
this foam for background so see how it

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:08.649 
this foam for background so see how it
turns<00:00:52.379> out

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.440 

I<00:01:08.749> just<00:01:09.499> finished<00:01:09.770> up<00:01:10.100> using<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.909> great<00:01:11.149> stuff

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
I just finished up using the great stuff

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.109 
I just finished up using the great stuff
um<00:01:11.719> for<00:01:12.049> the<00:01:12.109> background<00:01:12.560> and<00:01:12.770> I'll<00:01:13.520> soon<00:01:14.090> be

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
um for the background and I'll soon be

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.950 
um for the background and I'll soon be
using<00:01:14.990> silicon<00:01:15.530> to<00:01:15.740> cover<00:01:16.009> that<00:01:16.719> followed<00:01:17.719> by

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
using silicon to cover that followed by

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.389 
using silicon to cover that followed by
some<00:01:18.799> cocoa<00:01:19.460> fiber<00:01:19.700> which<00:01:20.630> is<00:01:20.750> dried<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:21.469> some

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
some cocoa fiber which is dried and some

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.020 
some cocoa fiber which is dried and some
gravel<00:01:22.850> and<00:01:24.039> take<00:01:25.039> a<00:01:25.069> look<00:01:25.310> at<00:01:25.429> the<00:01:25.520> back<00:01:25.759> just

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
gravel and take a look at the back just

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.349 
gravel and take a look at the back just
to<00:01:26.329> see<00:01:26.539> what<00:01:27.140> it<00:01:27.200> looks<00:01:27.350> like<00:01:27.500> underneath<00:01:28.359> one

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:29.359 
to see what it looks like underneath one

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:32.289 
to see what it looks like underneath one
of<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.539> air<00:01:29.659> ducts<00:01:29.959> I<00:01:30.429> actually<00:01:31.429> used<00:01:31.789> some

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
of the air ducts I actually used some

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.380 
of the air ducts I actually used some
extra<00:01:32.599> pieces<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.609> they<00:01:34.609> run<00:01:34.880> down<00:01:35.090> there

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
extra pieces and they run down there

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.130 
extra pieces and they run down there
sucking<00:01:36.319> up<00:01:36.439> air<00:01:36.939> from<00:01:37.939> below<00:01:38.119> and<00:01:40.869> this<00:01:41.869> air

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
sucking up air from below and this air

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.539 
sucking up air from below and this air
duct<00:01:42.579> doesn't<00:01:43.579> go<00:01:43.700> as<00:01:43.909> low<00:01:44.770> but<00:01:45.770> it<00:01:46.009> sucks<00:01:46.340> up

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
duct doesn't go as low but it sucks up

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:57.639 
duct doesn't go as low but it sucks up
up<00:01:47.329> air<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:47.780> little<00:01:48.140> bit<00:01:48.259> higher<00:01:48.439> up<00:01:54.700> and<00:01:56.649> the

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
up air a little bit higher up and the

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.919 
up air a little bit higher up and the
water<00:01:57.890> will<00:01:58.219> be<00:01:58.369> coming<00:01:59.000> out<00:01:59.119> from<00:01:59.750> behind

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
water will be coming out from behind

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.130 
water will be coming out from behind
here<00:02:00.640> flowing<00:02:01.640> down<00:02:01.849> into<00:02:01.879> this<00:02:02.420> pool<00:02:02.780> here

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
here flowing down into this pool here

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.059 
here flowing down into this pool here
and<00:02:03.399> then<00:02:04.399> down<00:02:04.819> into<00:02:05.359> the<00:02:05.950> pond<00:02:06.950> down<00:02:07.579> here

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
and then down into the pond down here

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.650 
and then down into the pond down here
and<00:02:10.069> now<00:02:10.789> I'm<00:02:10.970> going<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.209> start<00:02:11.510> using

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
and now I'm going to start using

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.210 
and now I'm going to start using
silicone<00:02:12.319> to<00:02:12.889> cover<00:02:13.220> up<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.579> phone<00:02:15.220> spreading

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220

I'm<00:02:19.579> going<00:02:19.849> to<00:02:19.970> cover<00:02:20.630> with<00:02:21.549> some<00:02:22.549> dried<00:02:22.849> cocoa

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
I'm going to cover with some dried cocoa

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.589 
I'm going to cover with some dried cocoa
fiber<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.989> some<00:02:24.260> gravel<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:25.000> for<00:02:26.000> this<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.359> use

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
fiber and some gravel and for this I use

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.860

I<00:03:22.110> pent<00:03:22.410> finished<00:03:22.860> pouring<00:03:23.190> on<00:03:23.490> the<00:03:23.520> cocoa

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
I pent finished pouring on the cocoa

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.540 
I pent finished pouring on the cocoa
fiber<00:03:24.300> in<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.780> gravel<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.770> I<00:03:25.860> patted<00:03:26.130> it<00:03:26.340> down

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
fiber in the gravel and I patted it down

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.960 
fiber in the gravel and I patted it down
onto<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:27.000> silicon<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:28.430> I'm<00:03:29.430> going<00:03:29.670> to<00:03:29.700> let<00:03:29.850> it

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
onto the silicon and I'm going to let it

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.830 
onto the silicon and I'm going to let it
sit<00:03:30.180> overnight<00:03:30.210> and<00:03:30.870> in<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.620> morning<00:03:31.710> we'll

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
sit overnight and in the morning we'll

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.199 
sit overnight and in the morning we'll
vacuum<00:03:33.840> it<00:03:33.959> off<00:03:34.110> with<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.470> shop<00:03:34.920> vac<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.520> see

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
vacuum it off with a shop vac and see

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.960 
vacuum it off with a shop vac and see
how<00:03:36.330> it<00:03:36.450> turns<00:03:36.660> out<00:03:36.980> after<00:03:37.980> letting<00:03:38.490> it<00:03:38.670> sit

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
how it turns out after letting it sit

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.580 
how it turns out after letting it sit
about<00:03:39.209> 12<00:03:39.690> hours<00:03:39.900> overnight

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
excess the cocoa fiber and this is what

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.000 
excess the cocoa fiber and this is what
the<00:03:48.540> background<00:03:48.720> looks<00:03:49.140> like<00:03:51.709> pretty<00:03:52.709> cool

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
airflow there so now I'm done testing

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.690 
airflow there so now I'm done testing
all<00:05:06.970> the<00:05:07.290> electronics<00:05:08.290> in<00:05:08.440> here<00:05:08.710> I'm<00:05:09.490> gonna

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
all the electronics in here I'm gonna

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.860 
all the electronics in here I'm gonna
add<00:05:10.060> some<00:05:10.120> clay<00:05:10.720> now<00:05:11.590> what<00:05:11.800> I'm<00:05:11.890> using<00:05:12.130> is<00:05:12.870> this

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.550 
stuff that's made by zoo Med it's a
called<00:05:17.980> excavator<00:05:18.700> it's<00:05:19.120> a<00:05:19.510> it's<00:05:20.440> actually

called excavator it's a it's actually
made<00:05:20.890> for<00:05:21.160> desert<00:05:21.990> reptiles<00:05:22.990> and<00:05:23.700> what's<00:05:24.700> good

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
made for desert reptiles and what's good

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.550 
made for desert reptiles and what's good
about<00:05:24.970> it<00:05:25.120> is<00:05:25.240> you<00:05:25.450> can<00:05:25.600> reuse<00:05:25.810> it<00:05:26.200> I<00:05:26.320> was

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
about it is you can reuse it I was

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.810 
about it is you can reuse it I was
actually<00:05:26.770> using<00:05:27.130> it<00:05:27.370> for<00:05:27.640> another<00:05:28.600> tank<00:05:28.930> and<00:05:29.820> I

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
actually using it for another tank and I

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.250 
actually using it for another tank and I
just<00:05:31.120> wet<00:05:31.450> it<00:05:31.480> with<00:05:31.720> some<00:05:31.900> water

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
just wet it with some water

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.460 
just wet it with some water
and<00:05:32.500> it<00:05:32.680> broke<00:05:33.340> down<00:05:33.400> again<00:05:33.880> and<00:05:34.090> I<00:05:34.390> will<00:05:35.350> be

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
and it broke down again and I will be

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.520 
and it broke down again and I will be
filling<00:05:35.980> in<00:05:36.100> around<00:05:36.780> the<00:05:37.780> bottom<00:05:38.170> with<00:05:38.350> this

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
filling in around the bottom with this

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:58.780 
filling in around the bottom with this
clay

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.090 

so<00:05:59.790> I<00:05:59.820> finished<00:06:00.120> setting<00:06:00.720> up<00:06:00.810> the<00:06:00.870> clay<00:06:01.230> I'll

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
so I finished setting up the clay I'll

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.150 
so I finished setting up the clay I'll
let<00:06:02.310> it<00:06:02.340> dry<00:06:02.639> a<00:06:02.669> little<00:06:02.940> bit<00:06:03.120> but<00:06:03.930> I<00:06:04.139> covered<00:06:05.040> it

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
let it dry a little bit but I covered it

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.070 
let it dry a little bit but I covered it
with<00:06:05.280> some<00:06:05.490> Coco<00:06:05.880> fiber<00:06:06.090> and<00:06:06.450> some<00:06:06.900> more

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
with some Coco fiber and some more

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.060 
with some Coco fiber and some more
gravel<00:06:07.500> and<00:06:08.180> I<00:06:09.180> put<00:06:09.780> a<00:06:09.810> little<00:06:10.020> bit<00:06:10.169> of<00:06:10.410> a<00:06:10.650> piece

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
gravel and I put a little bit of a piece

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.629 
gravel and I put a little bit of a piece
of<00:06:11.280> plastic<00:06:11.820> bag<00:06:12.060> in<00:06:12.330> there<00:06:12.510> for<00:06:12.810> a<00:06:12.840> liner<00:06:13.639> so

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
of plastic bag in there for a liner so

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:18.409 
of plastic bag in there for a liner so
the<00:06:14.790> water<00:06:15.000> flows<00:06:15.330> into<00:06:15.600> the<00:06:15.750> pond<00:06:15.990> and<00:06:17.419> for

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
the water flows into the pond and for

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:21.409 
the water flows into the pond and for
the<00:06:18.630> water<00:06:18.870> I'm<00:06:19.830> going<00:06:20.010> to<00:06:20.070> be<00:06:20.400> using<00:06:20.790> this

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
the water I'm going to be using this

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:24.620 
the water I'm going to be using this
stuff<00:06:21.750> called<00:06:22.050> fluorite<00:06:22.740> dark<00:06:23.070> it<00:06:23.340> is<00:06:24.240> made

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
stuff called fluorite dark it is made

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.940 
stuff called fluorite dark it is made
for<00:06:24.900> planted<00:06:25.560> aquariums<00:06:26.270> and<00:06:27.710> that's<00:06:28.710> what<00:06:28.860> it

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:28.950 
for planted aquariums and that's what it

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:34.220 
for planted aquariums and that's what it
looks<00:06:29.130> like<00:06:29.930> and<00:06:32.330> the<00:06:33.330> stuff<00:06:33.600> is<00:06:33.780> it's<00:06:34.020> pretty

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230 
looks like and the stuff is it's pretty

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.190 
looks like and the stuff is it's pretty
dusty<00:06:34.560> so<00:06:35.100> I'll<00:06:35.190> be<00:06:35.370> washing<00:06:35.610> it<00:06:35.910> off<00:06:36.110> so<00:06:37.110> it

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.200 
dusty so I'll be washing it off so it

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.140 
dusty so I'll be washing it off so it
doesn't<00:06:37.260> cloud<00:06:37.680> up<00:06:37.890> the<00:06:38.010> water<00:06:38.220> so<00:06:38.760> this<00:06:39.000> is

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
doesn't cloud up the water so this is

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.740 
doesn't cloud up the water so this is
what<00:06:39.360> the<00:06:39.570> fluoride<00:06:40.470> dark<00:06:40.770> looks<00:06:41.040> like<00:06:41.250> I<00:06:41.750> ran

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750 
what the fluoride dark looks like I ran

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.350 
what the fluoride dark looks like I ran
a<00:06:42.780> lot<00:06:43.020> of<00:06:43.050> water<00:06:43.350> through<00:06:43.680> it<00:06:43.800> and<00:06:44.330> got<00:06:45.330> all

a lot of water through it and got all
the<00:06:45.630> dust<00:06:45.930> out<00:06:46.140> so<00:06:46.650> it<00:06:46.740> won't<00:06:46.830> cloud<00:06:47.130> up<00:06:47.280> the

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 
the dust out so it won't cloud up the

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.480 
the dust out so it won't cloud up the
water<00:06:47.750> I'm<00:06:48.750> going<00:06:48.990> to<00:06:49.050> go<00:06:49.169> ahead<00:06:49.320> and<00:06:49.560> pour<00:06:50.370> the

00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.970 
360 degree view of the tank before I

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.240

let's<00:07:06.510> start<00:07:12.200> definitely<00:07:13.200> a<00:07:13.229> lot<00:07:13.500> of<00:07:13.650> gunk<00:07:14.610> on

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:14.820 
let's start definitely a lot of gunk on

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:21.290 
let's start definitely a lot of gunk on
the<00:07:14.970> glass<00:07:15.240> but<00:07:15.660> I'll<00:07:15.780> clean<00:07:16.710> that<00:07:16.890> up<00:07:20.030> and<00:07:21.030> see

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:21.300 
the glass but I'll clean that up and see

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:27.320 
the glass but I'll clean that up and see
the<00:07:21.450> air<00:07:21.600> ducts<00:07:21.900> in<00:07:22.260> the<00:07:22.380> back<00:07:24.620> and<00:07:26.090> the<00:07:27.090> pump

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:27.330 
the air ducts in the back and the pump

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.980 
the air ducts in the back and the pump
with<00:07:27.660> a<00:07:27.690> little<00:07:28.020> mesh<00:07:28.800> around<00:07:29.010> it<00:07:29.810> stop<00:07:30.810> it

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:30.990 
with a little mesh around it stop it

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:39.170 
with a little mesh around it stop it
from<00:07:31.140> getting<00:07:31.380> clogged<00:07:31.770> up<00:07:37.669> yeah<00:07:38.669> the<00:07:38.910> glass

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.180 
from getting clogged up yeah the glass

00:07:39.180 --> 00:08:04.190 
from getting clogged up yeah the glass
pretty<00:07:39.570> dirty

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:04.200 

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.250 

so<00:08:05.200> it<00:08:05.320> looks<00:08:05.530> pretty<00:08:05.650> good<00:08:05.980> so<00:08:06.220> far
