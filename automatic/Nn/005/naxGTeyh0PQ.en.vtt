00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.670
 hello everyone in this video we see 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.340
 how to make broth at home 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.080
 vegetable an important versatile base 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.510
 for many mac preparations 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.039
 given its simplicity it may seem 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.380
 trivial to propose the recipe of this 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.270
 way but I assure you it is not in 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.610
 how to make a good broth e 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.960
 important to chase some small ones 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.699
 rules 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.650
 I take this opportunity to invite all of you 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.109
 not to buy new ready data 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.609
 preparations found on the market 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.220
 because they are always products 

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:38.070
 industrials rich in salt and manufactured 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.930
 with poor raw materials prepare in 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.960
 home vegetable broth does not require 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.700
 a lot of time you save money and yes 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.250
 always with raw materials 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.250
 present in the kitchen fresh and quality 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.750
 the basic ingredients they can't 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.920
 missing are celery carrot onion or 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.049
 maybe fresh parsley and of course 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.270
 water we can customize the 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.420
 preparation adding according to 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.780
 tastes and gold spring onions 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.780
 garlic potatoes zucchini pepper enters 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.090
 Romatic Italian Larian all 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.610
 vegetables in rather personal pieces 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.979
 in fact it is not necessary to cut in 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.740
 small pieces as the broth will go 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.050
 filtered for vegetable broth 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.890
 we always start with cold water 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:35.590
 we pour the water into a large pot 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.470
 we add the vegetables we cover with a 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.679
 cover we put on the fire and we do 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.110
 reach the boil then lower 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.759
 the flame and cook for about 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.860
 30 minutes 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.990
 personally I don't cook much 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.509
 the broth because I don't think so 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.450
 indispensable for the success of the 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.369
 prepared after half an hour 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.350
 we add some salt and we do 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.180
 flavor for five minutes then 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.280
 turn off the filters to me the broth 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.049
 using a sieve to remove the 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.350
 pieces of vegetables and get a nice one 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.579
 clear broth and here is ours 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.590
 vegetable broth 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:13.980
 now we can decide to use it 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.120
 immediately or keep it for future 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.000
 Preparation 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.010
 I do it this way once done 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.320
 cool I transfer it to a 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.630
 I close it and a glass jar 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.620
 store in the fridge where it will be kept 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.620
 for a week 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:36.360
 another method for having broth 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.790
 always ready to use is that of 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.590
 freeze it by distributing the liquid in a 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.080
 container for making popsicles 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:49.500
 in this way the blog will keep for 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:51.870
 about two months to make the broth 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.120
 vegetable at no cost can we 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.310
 use the vegetable waste in 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.310
 this way further break down i 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.250
 costs and environmental impact will go 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.160
 fine ends of fine carrots 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.160
 celery leaves think of peppers of 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.129
 zucchini but also the skins of onions 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.090
 thus obtaining a darker and broth 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:17.099
 aromatic vegetable broth is ideal for 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.650
 the making of chris lock e 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:23.190
 tortelli but also to cook better 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.129
 In other words, vegetables and soups are real 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.989
 ally in the kitchen 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.970
