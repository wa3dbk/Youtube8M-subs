00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
51-42 by texas instrument is it isn't

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.020 
51-42 by texas instrument is it isn't
the<00:02:12.020> best<00:02:12.230> in<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.650> world<00:02:12.800> but<00:02:13.180> fix<00:02:14.180> one<00:02:14.450> is

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
the best in the world but fix one is

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.630 
the best in the world but fix one is
priced<00:02:18.280> 100<00:02:19.280> years<00:02:19.550> and<00:02:20.650> for<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.739> price<00:02:21.860> is<00:02:22.550> a

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
priced 100 years and for the price is a

priced 100 years and for the price is a
good<00:02:22.849> luck<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:25.550> other<00:02:25.640> technical<00:02:26.980> point<00:02:27.980> is

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
good luck the other technical point is

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:38.550 
good luck the other technical point is
that<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:30.530> operation<00:02:31.220> is<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:32.379> ESL<00:02:34.720> 28<00:02:35.720> 29<00:02:36.230> 1<00:02:36.920> x

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
that the operation is the ESL 28 29 1 x

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.500 
that the operation is the ESL 28 29 1 x
intersil<00:02:40.450> i<00:02:41.450> don't<00:02:42.110> like<00:02:42.700> these

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
intersil i don't like these

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.610 
intersil i don't like these
type<00:02:46.510> of<00:02:47.849> operational<00:02:48.849> cause<00:02:49.620> the

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
type of operational cause the

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.580 
type of operational cause the
elimination<00:02:51.280> is<00:02:51.489> only<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:52.239> power<00:02:52.420> is<00:02:52.750> only<00:02:53.190> 5

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
elimination is only the power is only 5

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.830 
elimination is only the power is only 5
volt<00:02:57.750> but<00:02:58.750> among<00:02:59.680> these<00:03:00.269> operational<00:03:01.269> is<00:03:01.599> one

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
volt but among these operational is one

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:13.190 
volt but among these operational is one
of<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.170> best<00:03:08.370> fuel<00:03:09.720> mix<00:03:10.720> one<00:03:11.049> can<00:03:11.560> be<00:03:11.739> used

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
of the best fuel mix one can be used

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:21.360 
of the best fuel mix one can be used
like<00:03:14.610> portable<00:03:16.260> only<00:03:17.260> one<00:03:17.910> but<00:03:19.380> with<00:03:20.380> his

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
like portable only one but with his

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:29.100 
like portable only one but with his
output<00:03:22.060> I<00:03:22.660> you<00:03:22.989> can<00:03:25.290> use<00:03:26.290> also<00:03:27.090> some<00:03:28.110> portable

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
output I you can use also some portable

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.890 
output I you can use also some portable
amplifier<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:32.200> think<00:03:32.769> that<00:03:33.430> using<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.269> portable

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
amplifier I think that using a portable

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:42.539 
amplifier I think that using a portable
fire<00:03:35.530> is<00:03:36.010> a<00:03:36.040> good<00:03:36.430> idea<00:03:38.819> to<00:03:41.040> obtain<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.310> batter

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
fire is a good idea to obtain the batter

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:51.030 
fire is a good idea to obtain the batter
from<00:03:44.010> physics<00:03:45.010> one<00:03:49.170> other<00:03:50.170> things<00:03:50.560> and<00:03:50.829> that<00:03:51.010> I

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
from physics one other things and that I

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.410 
from physics one other things and that I
want<00:03:51.400> to<00:03:51.609> say<00:03:51.910> is<00:03:52.299> that<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:54.510> feel<00:03:55.510> show

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
want to say is that the feel show

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:04.220 
want to say is that the feel show
sangathan<00:03:58.420> on<00:03:58.959> a<00:03:59.739> site<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:01.650> this<00:04:02.650> graph<00:04:03.130> are

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
sangathan on a site and this graph are

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.590 
sangathan on a site and this graph are
okay<00:04:05.230> they<00:04:05.739> are<00:04:05.769> right<00:04:06.370> I<00:04:07.150> test<00:04:08.019> feel<00:04:09.150> x1<00:04:10.150> and

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
okay they are right I test feel x1 and

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.059 
okay they are right I test feel x1 and
obtain<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:11.590> same<00:04:12.340> Agathe<00:04:13.079> publish<00:04:14.079> it<00:04:14.260> on<00:04:14.530> and

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
obtain the same Agathe publish it on and

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.840 
obtain the same Agathe publish it on and
decide

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:25.690 

okay<00:04:21.460> using<00:04:22.460> a<00:04:22.490> fixed<00:04:23.150> one<00:04:23.360> I<00:04:23.420> use<00:04:23.870> a<00:04:24.460> eaten<00:04:25.460> on

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
okay using a fixed one I use a eaten on

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.810 
okay using a fixed one I use a eaten on
my<00:04:26.560> car<00:04:27.560> with<00:04:27.950> my<00:04:28.130> speaker<00:04:28.610> a<00:04:29.980> good<00:04:30.980> sound<00:04:31.340> I

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.330 
with my home speaker i can say that
fixed<00:05:00.650> one<00:05:00.830> is<00:05:01.100> a<00:05:01.130> good<00:05:02.120> sound<00:05:02.800> balance<00:05:03.800> and

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
fixed one is a good sound balance and

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:11.500 
fixed one is a good sound balance and
not<00:05:05.000> a<00:05:05.200> net<00:05:06.200> neutral<00:05:07.130> and<00:05:07.460> the<00:05:07.490> natural<00:05:09.490> you<00:05:10.510> is

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
not a net neutral and the natural you is

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:23.680 
not a net neutral and the natural you is
also<00:05:12.070> with<00:05:13.070> some<00:05:14.050> dynamic<00:05:15.250> and<00:05:17.410> but<00:05:19.270> you<00:05:22.690> can

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
also with some dynamic and but you can

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.500 
also with some dynamic and but you can
improve<00:05:24.470> all<00:05:25.000> with<00:05:26.000> a<00:05:26.500> portable<00:05:27.500> amplifier

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
improve all with a portable amplifier

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:37.000 
improve all with a portable amplifier
whose<00:05:29.510> a<00:05:30.190> fixed<00:05:31.190> one<00:05:31.750> sport<00:05:32.750> only<00:05:36.010> low

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
whose a fixed one sport only low

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:46.510 
whose a fixed one sport only low

home<00:05:48.700> this<00:05:49.750> is<00:05:50.750> a<00:05:50.810> causal

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:52.969 
home this is a causal

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:58.299 
home this is a causal
the<00:05:53.569> output<00:05:53.719> is<00:05:54.439> only<00:05:55.189> for<00:05:56.029> both<00:05:56.949> big<00:05:57.949> vault

00:05:58.299 --> 00:05:58.309 
the output is only for both big vault

00:05:58.309 --> 00:06:13.659 
the output is only for both big vault
and<00:06:00.099> about<00:06:03.549> 33<00:06:06.189> million<00:06:07.189> pair<00:06:09.939> and<00:06:12.519> for<00:06:13.519> this

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
and about 33 million pair and for this

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:19.149 
and about 33 million pair and for this
reason<00:06:14.709> if<00:06:15.709> you<00:06:15.949> want<00:06:16.539> the<00:06:17.539> batter<00:06:17.860> the<00:06:18.860> best

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:19.159 
reason if you want the batter the best

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:25.979 
reason if you want the batter the best
from<00:06:19.639> these<00:06:20.469> dapa<00:06:21.489> you<00:06:22.489> have<00:06:22.729> to<00:06:24.009> use<00:06:25.009> in

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:25.989 
from these dapa you have to use in

00:06:25.989 --> 00:06:30.089 
from these dapa you have to use in
amplifer<00:06:26.989> portable<00:06:27.499> amplifier<00:06:27.709> or<00:06:28.489> a

amplifer portable amplifier or a
portable<00:06:33.909> pre-amplifier<00:06:38.439> in<00:06:39.439> conclusion<00:06:39.829> I

00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:40.249 
portable pre-amplifier in conclusion I

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:46.659 
portable pre-amplifier in conclusion I
say<00:06:41.149> that<00:06:41.599> is<00:06:42.199> a<00:06:42.829> very<00:06:43.519> good<00:06:44.079> data<00:06:45.079> for<00:06:45.709> 100

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:46.669 
say that is a very good data for 100

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:54.239 
say that is a very good data for 100
years<00:06:46.909> is<00:06:47.569> a<00:06:47.809> good<00:06:48.229> choice<00:06:51.129> ok<00:06:52.329> that's<00:06:53.329> all<00:06:53.599> and

00:06:54.239 --> 00:06:54.249 
years is a good choice ok that's all and

00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:59.619 
years is a good choice ok that's all and
do<00:06:55.249> the<00:06:55.399> next<00:06:55.629> review<00:06:56.629> bye<00:06:57.409> bye
