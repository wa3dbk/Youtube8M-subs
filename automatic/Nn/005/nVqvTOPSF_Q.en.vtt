00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 Orio to this request arose 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.620
 today we are on a part 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.349
 stronger and this must be the subject 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.330
 david today that's why I'm 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.620
 on youtube which they are responsible for 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.450
 ask the question and I tell myself that it 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.820
 might want to know why 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.289
 am I on youtube in this 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.939
 moment why am I a youtube so 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.340
 on the first point I've been 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.039
 addressed as the most important also 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.060
 compared to the reason for me to 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.260
 on Youtube 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.289
 it's really because my only 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.149
 goal is to entertain you 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.770
 goals entertain you every one of 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.390
 you who look at my ideals my goal 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.890
 it's not happening at the right time on 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.480
 walk in order to put you a 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.250
 smile on the face because that's 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.350
 really this piece the main goal 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.260
 for me to do on youtube 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.120
 it's really that I'm going to have a good 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.430
 moment and entertain you on walkie 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.600
 are judged as you may have seen there 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.340
 not long ago I said that nancy has 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.320
 applauded every day and I hope 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.280
 really do you appreciate that choice 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.109
 because that's what it gives a lot 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.760
 of work in addition that I have in 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.219
 revenge rhythm and video a week in 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.449
 advance in a week on two so 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.880
 it is certain that it is difficult and 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.049
 that he has to put effort but I believe 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.729
 that it's worth it because precisely 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.710
 I think when I call all 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.850
 days it allows you to want everyone 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.100
 the days to come by these decisions 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.380
 like those like the weather sweetens a 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.970
 small water soup door to make 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.909
 have a good time on my gold chain 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.170
 jeremy ratcliffe on practices 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.869
 so that's what I think you 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.820
 enjoy the plan every day and 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.520
 that you come for a ride at all 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.600
 days to keep my videos 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.040
 because to be honest with you the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.890
 second thing I would like to address 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.860
 precisely remember that the first is 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.579
 I love seeing your comments 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.509
 will deliver that good the world who 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.220
 appreciate the work I strive 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.049
 but here it makes me so 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.240
 pleasure no you do not have any of what 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.759
 point you're hurt a little comment 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.380
 I read you tapes sometimes that but a 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.189
 smile his thought the source did 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.920
 have a good day 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.990
 it's the same thing that I love and it's 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.420
 really you who motivates me to continue 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.869
 it is you who motivated to call them at 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.869
 everyday 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:14.850
 the guitarist howard 2 ok ok 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.580
 good the gurun however quite critical 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.470
 for him in Spain and I have in front of me 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.150
 so you want the sleeve taking even 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.760
 time the time if it was also for 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.860
 tell you a big thank you to everyone a 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.030
 little look at the 7 fingers on 20 which 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.480
 leave gm which leaves 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.910
 comments 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.570
 sir let him know that she makes me 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.950
 really happy 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.060
 it gives even more instructions 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.130
 risk of playing them videos are going to 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.800
 really good just like this game see 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.150

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.800
 leave high appreciation to all 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.910
 days it's really something that 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.610
 warms my heart and my goal 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.470
 it's really just that each of my 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.600
 subscribers close a good time in my 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.670
 videos and who want to come back to all 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.470
 days to keep the dike all the time 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.700
 the next day but this video that will not 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.010
 to last too long precisely because 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.570
 I wanted it's your time but in 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.790
 this video you're going to watch 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.709
 every day and we will have a good 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.180
 moment I hope so that's it all the 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.810
 world is massively motivated 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.030
 initial 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.110
 2 why I lived everything it really is 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.840

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.580
 you pour and give me a good pass 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.790
 moment and it is precisely thanks to you 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.610
 that I continue to do just as much I 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.410
