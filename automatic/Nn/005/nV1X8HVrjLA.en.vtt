once and

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.760 
once and
a<00:06:16.800> score<00:06:17.550> and<00:06:17.580> try<00:06:18.150> to<00:06:18.210> build<00:06:18.660> a<00:06:18.870> balance<00:06:19.500> in

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
a score and try to build a balance in

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.909 
a score and try to build a balance in
between<00:06:20.210> what's<00:06:21.210> real<00:06:21.720> in<00:06:21.930> the<00:06:22.050> story<00:06:22.349> versus

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919
