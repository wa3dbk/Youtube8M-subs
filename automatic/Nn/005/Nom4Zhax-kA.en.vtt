one<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.200> these<00:00:43.260> pieces<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.800> don't<00:00:43.860> really<00:00:44.100> know

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
one of these pieces I don't really know

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.830 
one of these pieces I don't really know
how<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.430> explain<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:45.000> has<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.270> start<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
how to explain it it has to start on the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.680 
how to explain it it has to start on the
bottom<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.200> solder<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.590> top<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.670> four<00:00:48.450> of

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
bottom of solder on the top and four of

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.350 
bottom of solder on the top and four of
these<00:00:49.350> pistons<00:00:49.920> with<00:00:50.070> pieces<00:00:50.340> they<00:00:51.210> don't

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
these pistons with pieces they don't

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.680 
these pistons with pieces they don't
have<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.570> be<00:00:51.660> sober<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.550> to<00:00:53.550> air<00:00:53.730> buds<00:00:53.940> okay<00:00:56.690> so

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
have to be sober and to air buds okay so

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.689 
have to be sober and to air buds okay so
first<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.320> want<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.680> start<00:00:59.039> out<00:00:59.160> by<00:00:59.399> taking

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
put this aside so take your 2 by 3 brick

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.219 
put this aside so take your 2 by 3 brick
and<00:01:04.110> your<00:01:04.350> 2x4<00:01:04.860> slap<00:01:05.150> and<00:01:06.150> put<00:01:06.360> your<00:01:06.479> 2<00:01:06.720> by<00:01:06.900> 3

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
and your 2x4 slap and put your 2 by 3

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.750 
and your 2x4 slap and put your 2 by 3
brick<00:01:07.950> right<00:01:08.189> there

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
brick right there

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.080 
brick right there
and<00:01:09.330> your<00:01:09.540> 2<00:01:09.689> by<00:01:09.869> 1<00:01:10.049> brick<00:01:10.670> with<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.820> hole<00:01:12.000> in

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
and your 2 by 1 brick with the hole in

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.490 
and your 2 by 1 brick with the hole in
the<00:01:12.180> middle<00:01:12.240> right<00:01:12.450> there<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.960> now<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.380> have

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the middle right there so now you have

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.440 
the middle right there so now you have
this<00:01:13.650> box<00:01:13.920> like<00:01:14.189> shape<00:01:14.490> or<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.790> rectangle<00:01:15.360> or

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
this box like shape or a rectangle or

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.510 
this box like shape or a rectangle or
whatever<00:01:16.220> okay<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.280> now<00:01:18.530> put<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.710> piston<00:01:20.159> on

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
whatever okay so now put the piston on

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:30.230 
whatever okay so now put the piston on
like<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:25.610> 1<00:01:26.610> 2<00:01:26.820> 3<00:01:27.170> 4<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.590> now<00:01:28.820> you<00:01:29.820> have<00:01:29.970> pretty

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
much the base of your engine and now

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.109 
much the base of your engine and now
it's<00:01:32.520> pretty<00:01:32.759> much<00:01:32.880> all<00:01:33.600> v2<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:35.130> take<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.579> the

piece<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.780> don't<00:02:18.989> really<00:02:19.140> know<00:02:19.319> what<00:02:19.440> it's

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
piece I don't really know what it's

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.430 
piece I don't really know what it's
called<00:02:19.709> I<00:02:20.269> don't<00:02:21.269> really<00:02:21.480> care<00:02:21.690> if<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:21.989> do<00:02:22.140> so

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
called I don't really care if you do so

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.850 
called I don't really care if you do so
don't<00:02:22.470> even<00:02:22.920> bother<00:02:23.220> leaving<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.940> comment<00:02:24.860> okay

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
don't even bother leaving a comment okay

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.720 
don't even bother leaving a comment okay
so<00:02:26.810> take<00:02:27.810> your<00:02:27.959> propeller<00:02:28.349> in<00:02:29.099> your<00:02:29.519> last

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
so take your propeller in your last

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.229 
so take your propeller in your last
connector<00:02:30.120> piece<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:31.250> put<00:02:32.250> this<00:02:32.700> part<00:02:33.120> right

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
connector piece and put this part right

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.830 
connector piece and put this part right
there<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.690> grooved<00:02:34.260> side<00:02:34.470> into<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.840> into

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
there the grooved side into that into

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.080 
there the grooved side into that into
that<00:02:36.870> side<00:02:37.200> where<00:02:37.380> it's<00:02:37.530> gonna<00:02:37.739> connect<00:02:38.090> like

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
that side where it's gonna connect like

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.339 
that side where it's gonna connect like
that<00:02:39.329> so<00:02:39.540> now<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:39.720> have<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.959> piece<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:40.170> looks

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
that so now you have a piece that looks

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.360 
that so now you have a piece that looks
something<00:02:40.650> like<00:02:40.829> this

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
something like this

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.850 
something like this
and<00:02:41.519> then<00:02:41.970> clip<00:02:42.299> that<00:02:42.630> connector<00:02:43.140> into<00:02:43.680> that

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
and then clip that connector into that

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.390 
and then clip that connector into that
hole<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:45.480> there<00:02:45.629> you<00:02:45.690> go<00:02:45.810> there<00:02:46.650> is<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.129> Lego

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
hole so there you go there is a Lego

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.150 
hole so there you go there is a Lego
engineered<00:02:47.970> for<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.299> Lego<00:02:48.720> car<00:02:49.019> it's<00:02:49.980> pretty
