00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
not going to let that stop us from the

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.950 
not going to let that stop us from the
geocaching<00:00:11.639> we're<00:00:12.000> here<00:00:12.179> at<00:00:12.300> Ragnar<00:00:12.690> Park

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
geocaching we're here at Ragnar Park

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.509 
geocaching we're here at Ragnar Park
which<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.230> like<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.469> home<00:00:13.650> base<00:00:13.920> there<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.370> are

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
which is like the home base there it are

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.310 
which is like the home base there it are
a<00:00:14.549> couple<00:00:14.820> lab<00:00:15.330> caches<00:00:15.870> here<00:00:15.990> if<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.170> don't

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
a couple lab caches here if you don't

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.349 
a couple lab caches here if you don't
know<00:00:16.410> what<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.560> lab<00:00:16.740> cache<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.430> lab<00:00:17.850> cache<00:00:18.119> is

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
know what a lab cache is a lab cache is

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.510 
know what a lab cache is a lab cache is
a<00:00:18.420> very<00:00:18.779> special<00:00:19.230> cache<00:00:19.439> usually<00:00:20.340> it's<00:00:20.460> a

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
a very special cache usually it's a

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.580 
a very special cache usually it's a
temporary<00:00:20.850> cache<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.449> somehow<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:22.350> have<00:00:22.470> to

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
temporary cache and somehow you have to

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.490 
temporary cache and somehow you have to
find<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.949> secret<00:00:23.279> code<00:00:23.550> word<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.510> log<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.289> cache

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
find a secret code word to log the cache

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.290 
find a secret code word to log the cache
so<00:00:25.800> we're<00:00:26.189> gonna<00:00:26.279> find<00:00:26.550> some<00:00:26.699> lab<00:00:26.849> caches

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
so we're gonna find some lab caches

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.849 
so we're gonna find some lab caches
around<00:00:27.539> here<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:27.900> guess<00:00:28.080> what<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.710> had<00:00:28.800> to

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
around here and guess what you had to

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:29.509 
around here and guess what you had to
come<00:00:29.010> along<00:00:29.160> with<00:00:29.340> us

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
come along with us

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:37.220 
come along with us
let's<00:00:29.820> go<00:00:29.939> find<00:00:30.119> some<00:00:35.540> all<00:00:36.540> right<00:00:36.690> guys<00:00:36.870> we<00:00:37.110> are

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
let's go find some all right guys we are

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.040 
let's go find some all right guys we are
here<00:00:37.260> at<00:00:37.710> one<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.910> lab<00:00:39.149> caches<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.870> one

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
here at one of the lab caches this one

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.400 
here at one of the lab caches this one
is<00:00:40.230> called<00:00:40.500> fear<00:00:41.340> factor<00:00:41.940> cache<00:00:42.629> or<00:00:42.870> addition

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
is called fear factor cache or addition

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.740 
is called fear factor cache or addition
and<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.250> it's<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.730> lab<00:00:44.910> cache<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.420> says<00:00:45.570> face

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
and so it's a lab cache it says face

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.779 
and so it's a lab cache it says face
your<00:00:45.960> fears<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.350> cache<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.370> one<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
your fears this cache is in one of the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.700 
your fears this cache is in one of the
holes<00:00:48.059> all<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.570> have<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.780> do<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.110> reach<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.590> and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
holes all you have to do is reach in and

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.950 
holes all you have to do is reach in and
grab<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.340> there<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> box<00:00:51.390> over<00:00:51.660> here<00:00:51.690> with

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
grab it so there is a box over here with

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.139 
grab it so there is a box over here with
four<00:00:52.320> holes<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.160> one<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> holes

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
four holes in it and one of the holes

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.470 
four holes in it and one of the holes
has<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:55.170> word<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.670> lab<00:00:56.820> cache<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.360> I'm

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
has the word of the lab cache and I'm

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.970 
has the word of the lab cache and I'm
imagining<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:58.230> some<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.620> other<00:00:58.770> things

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
imagining that some of the other things

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.729 
imagining that some of the other things
are<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.250> little<00:00:59.399> gross<00:00:59.699> all<00:01:00.180> right<00:01:00.359> here<00:01:00.600> we<00:01:00.690> are
