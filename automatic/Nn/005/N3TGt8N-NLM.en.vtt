very<00:01:47.619> few<00:01:47.950> of<00:01:48.009> us<00:01:48.070> commit<00:01:48.610> murder<00:01:48.820> and<00:01:49.649> you

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
very few of us commit murder and you

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.410 
very few of us commit murder and you
know<00:01:50.770> so<00:01:51.160> many<00:01:51.280> people<00:01:51.580> get<00:01:51.729> killed<00:01:51.970> within<00:01:52.240> a

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
know so many people get killed within a

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.600 
know so many people get killed within a
space<00:01:52.630> of<00:01:52.690> an<00:01:53.229> hour<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:53.649> a<00:01:53.770> half<00:01:53.950> that's<00:01:54.220> a<00:01:54.399> bad

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
space of an hour and a half that's a bad

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.900 
space of an hour and a half that's a bad
sort<00:01:54.880> of<00:01:54.970> thing<00:01:55.119> but<00:01:55.330> and<00:01:56.289> I<00:01:57.069> think<00:01:57.399> it's<00:01:57.580> just

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
sort of thing but and I think it's just

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:05.960 
sort of thing but and I think it's just
so<00:01:58.270> taught
