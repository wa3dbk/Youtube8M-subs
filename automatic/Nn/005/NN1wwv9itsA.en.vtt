00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:07.710
 for all we knew yesterday we were running 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.210
 the preparations on our departure 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:15.570
 to the training camp in south africa and 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.990
 meeting place was at 18 o'clock over 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:23.100
 travel cloudy year and I have against 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:25.140
 16:20 625 thus about 35 hours after the 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.720
 accident I have first message 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.810
 heard or advice from the consultant 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.710
 side that something should have happened 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.329
 nobody knew what exactly and were so 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.710
 We are uncertain for a long time 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.050
 spent there and only just before 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.250
 actually all were preparations 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.059
 already met we wanted afterwards 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.579
 We wanted to fly to the training camp 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.770
 until about 19 o'clock have this 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.440
 message then condensed and has at the end 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.760
 unfortunately also confirmed that 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.480
 junior in a traffic accident 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.030
 has come and therefore the situation 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.619
 of course totally changed has the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:13.290
 Team the just right bad 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:16.409
 message recorded that dismayed and 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.610
 shocked that yesterday for could believe 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.890
 I'm not really that right yet 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.740
 handle and and believe that 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.000
 that is very clear when you look at it 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.119
 few hours before with each other 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.650
 has trained or take part in one 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.900
 I had then sat in the cabin 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.340
 is that some dramatic band 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.250
 four in the morning still with one still 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.810
 talked to him or have himself 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.540
 Messages exchanged and and from 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.920
 so of course that was total dismay 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.920
 and also very difficult this morning 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.740
 and passes his room in his locker 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.210
 and and become aware that he is 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.549
 will never be with us again and 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.649
 do not train with us 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.899
 I want to play it will be easy 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.579
 will be missing and that's it 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.020
 how bad do you become personally? 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.020
 Do you keep in mind 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.740
 we have already been in during yesterday 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.310
 our statement said that is all 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.200
 have loved him and love all ours 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.900
 play but I believe universe anyway 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.350
 special case when he was in 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.900
 last year came to us and 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.430
 really a beamman of the 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.250
 really always just had a good mood and 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.540
 so inquisitive and wanted to learn 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.370
 wanted to be successful 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.180
 the national team wanted titles 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.820
 wanted to win with us and someone else 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.290
 you had to love so I know 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.990
 none of the team at all 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.930
 the competition is the one of the 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.450
 has seen differently and someone like that 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.670
 has extraordinary abilities and the 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.890
 the really 20 years and he comes 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.090
 really at the very beginning of his career 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.010
 and of course a giant 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.330
 career had been open and so 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.150
 Of course we will remind you 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.130
 of course, if you try to hold 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.810
 can do anything at all for him to 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.170
 Of course, our thoughts are gone 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.170
 and of course first of all 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.020
 direction of the siblings of the father's 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.390
 mother naturally much 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.770
 it is clearly more affected if 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.600
 We believe what we can do then 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.870
 is it because of his senses 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.870
 do
