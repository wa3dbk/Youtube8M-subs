00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:03.439 
and what you're doing for that part is

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:10.599 
and what you're doing for that part is
just<00:03:03.650> getting<00:03:04.989> off<00:03:05.989> a<00:03:09.040> B<00:03:10.040> pentatonic

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
just getting off a B pentatonic

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.149 
just getting off a B pentatonic
basically<00:03:10.969> B<00:03:11.120> minor<00:03:11.329> right<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:12.590> it's<00:03:13.010> just

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
basically B minor right and it's just

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.300 
basically B minor right and it's just
seven<00:03:13.790> seven<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.750> G<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.049> B<00:03:15.079> string<00:03:15.409> and<00:03:15.530> I

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
seven seven the G the B string and I

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.300 
seven seven the G the B string and I
meet<00:03:17.180> on<00:03:17.389> the<00:03:17.480> down<00:03:17.659> stroke<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:18.739> then<00:03:19.010> I<00:03:19.099> hit

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
meet on the down stroke and then I hit

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.089 
meet on the down stroke and then I hit
on<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.549> up<00:03:19.639> stroke

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.259 

I<00:03:26.769> think<00:03:27.769> it<00:03:27.919> gives<00:03:28.040> it<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.370> attack<00:03:28.669> that<00:03:28.969> he

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
I think it gives it the attack that he

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.959 
I think it gives it the attack that he
has<00:03:29.419> on<00:03:29.599> the<00:03:29.629> original<00:03:30.019> recording<00:03:30.459> so<00:03:31.459> seven

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:31.969 
has on the original recording so seven

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:51.660 
has on the original recording so seven
seven

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:09.240 
but it's hard to explain because there's
a<00:05:06.469> lot<00:05:06.620> of<00:05:06.650> different<00:05:06.979> notes<00:05:07.099> and<00:05:08.060> it<00:05:08.180> goes

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
a lot of different notes and it goes

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.679 
a lot of different notes and it goes
I'll<00:05:10.250> play<00:05:10.520> first<00:05:10.909> a<00:05:11.030> normal<00:05:11.330> speed<00:05:11.539> then

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:11.689 
I'll play first a normal speed then

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:21.429 
I'll play first a normal speed then
slowly<00:05:19.180> it's<00:05:20.180> actually<00:05:20.509> in<00:05:20.689> five<00:05:20.960> four<00:05:21.199> two

00:05:21.429 --> 00:05:21.439 
slowly it's actually in five four two

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:38.679 
slowly it's actually in five four two
Steph<00:05:21.620> why<00:05:21.939> so<00:05:22.939> that<00:05:23.120> riff<00:05:23.300> slowly<00:05:23.750> goes<00:05:37.689> jumps

00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:38.689 
Steph why so that riff slowly goes jumps

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:40.809 
Steph why so that riff slowly goes jumps
over<00:05:38.810> one<00:05:39.199> string<00:05:39.500> but<00:05:40.159> since<00:05:40.430> you're<00:05:40.610> on<00:05:40.699> the

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:40.819 
over one string but since you're on the

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:42.459 
over one string but since you're on the
B<00:05:40.939> string<00:05:41.000> the<00:05:41.300> turning<00:05:41.599> changes<00:05:41.930> slightly<00:05:42.110> so

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:42.469 
B string the turning changes slightly so

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:44.649 
B string the turning changes slightly so
the<00:05:42.979> fingerings<00:05:43.400> a<00:05:43.490> little<00:05:43.699> different<00:05:44.060> sounds

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:44.659 
the fingerings a little different sounds

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:55.160 
the fingerings a little different sounds
like<00:05:44.750> this

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.170 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.510 

now<00:05:56.170> the<00:05:56.230> same<00:05:56.560> thing<00:05:56.830> that<00:05:56.950> you<00:05:57.070> did<00:05:57.190> the

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
now the same thing that you did the

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.060 
now the same thing that you did the
first<00:05:57.730> time<00:05:58.140> there<00:05:59.140> except<00:05:59.590> now<00:05:59.770> you're<00:05:59.920> doing

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
first time there except now you're doing

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:21.180 
first time there except now you're doing
it<00:06:00.130> starting<00:06:00.970> on<00:06:01.060> the<00:06:01.180> ninth<00:06:01.390> fret<00:06:20.040> then<00:06:21.040> you

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
it starting on the ninth fret then you

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:27.150 
it starting on the ninth fret then you
grab<00:06:21.430> 12<00:06:22.030> and<00:06:22.270> 12<00:06:23.250> in<00:06:24.250> the<00:06:24.340> B<00:06:24.460> string<00:06:24.760> and<00:06:26.160> you

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 
grab 12 and 12 in the B string and you

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.720 
grab 12 and 12 in the B string and you
just<00:06:27.370> bend<00:06:27.550> them<00:06:27.700> up<00:06:27.820> and<00:06:28.170> you<00:06:29.310> keep<00:06:30.310> them<00:06:30.520> in

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:30.730 
just bend them up and you keep them in

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.220 
just bend them up and you keep them in
the<00:06:30.850> e<00:06:30.880> string<00:06:31.270> for<00:06:31.480> like<00:06:31.600> it's<00:06:31.780> like<00:06:31.900> a<00:06:31.990> step

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:32.230 
the e string for like it's like a step

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:36.660 
the e string for like it's like a step
and<00:06:32.410> a<00:06:32.440> half<00:06:34.950> but<00:06:35.950> it<00:06:36.010> really<00:06:36.130> only<00:06:36.280> sounds

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:36.670 
and a half but it really only sounds

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.280 
and a half but it really only sounds
good<00:06:36.850> if<00:06:36.970> you<00:06:37.420> have<00:06:37.570> you<00:06:37.900> know<00:06:37.990> your<00:06:38.140> amp

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.290 
good if you have you know your amp

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.240 
good if you have you know your amp
cranked<00:06:38.620> to<00:06:38.740> title<00:06:39.070> so<00:06:40.030> the<00:06:40.920> last<00:06:41.920> thing<00:06:42.130> I

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250 
cranked to title so the last thing I

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.430 
cranked to title so the last thing I
guess<00:06:42.400> you<00:06:42.520> would<00:06:42.640> need<00:06:42.730> to<00:06:42.850> know<00:06:43.140> is<00:06:44.140> for<00:06:44.200> the

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 
guess you would need to know is for the

00:06:44.440 --> 00:07:03.650 
guess you would need to know is for the
