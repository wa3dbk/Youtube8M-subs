00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.990 
immediately because it has that with
silicon<00:02:08.869> same<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:10.039> salicylic<00:02:10.280> acid<00:02:10.819> in

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
silicon same and the salicylic acid in

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.699 
silicon same and the salicylic acid in
this<00:02:11.090> is<00:02:11.239> a<00:02:11.269> little<00:02:11.360> bit<00:02:11.690> higher<00:02:11.840> than<00:02:12.230> the

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
this is a little bit higher than the

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.270 
this is a little bit higher than the
regular<00:02:12.920> product<00:02:13.519> so<00:02:13.730> it's<00:02:14.209> just<00:02:14.329> really<00:02:14.540> good

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
regular product so it's just really good

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.089 
regular product so it's just really good
for<00:02:16.989> you<00:02:17.989> Bertie<00:02:18.170> got<00:02:18.290> like<00:02:18.470> once<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.739> month<00:02:18.890> or

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
for you Bertie got like once a month or

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.410 
for you Bertie got like once a month or
even<00:02:19.160> someone<00:02:19.610> who<00:02:19.700> breaks<00:02:19.849> out<00:02:20.090> more<00:02:20.269> often

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
even someone who breaks out more often

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.490 
even someone who breaks out more often
than<00:02:20.810> that<00:02:21.130> can<00:02:22.130> use<00:02:22.340> it<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:23.079> it<00:02:24.079> works<00:02:24.110> really

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
than that can use it and it works really

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.520 
than that can use it and it works really
well<00:02:24.650> so<00:02:24.980> it<00:02:25.040> works<00:02:25.190> faster<00:02:25.579> than<00:02:25.610> regular

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
well so it works faster than regular

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.690 
well so it works faster than regular
acne<00:02:27.530> products<00:02:27.890> because<00:02:28.220> it<00:02:28.340> does<00:02:28.489> have<00:02:28.670> a

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
acne products because it does have a

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.670 
acne products because it does have a

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
higher percentage of salicylic

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.569 
higher percentage of salicylic
