but so yesterday when I sold my amulet

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.910 
but so yesterday when I sold my amulet
of<00:01:53.759> today<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.090> had<00:01:54.420> two<00:01:54.600> options<00:01:55.110> one<00:01:55.500> was<00:01:55.770> to

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
of today I had two options one was to

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.249 
of today I had two options one was to
get<00:01:56.100> fulled<00:01:56.340> haddock<00:01:56.790> which<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.240> did<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.899> the

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
get fulled haddock which I did and the

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.609 
get fulled haddock which I did and the
second<00:01:58.619> one<00:01:58.770> was<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.369> get<00:01:59.520> 70<00:02:00.090> prayer<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.780> I

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
second one was to get 70 prayer and I

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.350 
second one was to get 70 prayer and I
don't<00:02:02.009> know<00:02:02.130> if<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.340> did<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.700> right<00:02:02.850> decision

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
don't know if I did the right decision

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.389 
don't know if I did the right decision
but<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.810> guess<00:02:03.990> at<00:02:04.170> any<00:02:04.380> time<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.710> can<00:02:04.979> just<00:02:05.219> sell

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
but I guess at any time I can just sell

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.719 
but I guess at any time I can just sell
my<00:02:05.549> dog<00:02:05.969> back<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.540> get<00:02:07.170> level<00:02:07.439> 70<00:02:07.860> prayer<00:02:08.099> so

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
my dog back and get level 70 prayer so

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.089 
my dog back and get level 70 prayer so
I'm<00:02:09.209> not<00:02:09.450> sure<00:02:09.509> which<00:02:09.810> one<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.140> better<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.500> guess

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
I'm not sure which one is better I guess

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.309 
I'm not sure which one is better I guess
the<00:02:11.400> piety<00:02:11.819> is<00:02:11.879> better<00:02:12.150> because<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.780> don't<00:02:13.080> use

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
the piety is better because I don't use

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.920 
the piety is better because I don't use

and I have only 81 so it's like 100 to
go<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:52.150> seems<00:02:52.389> that<00:02:52.480> I<00:02:52.629> completed<00:02:53.169> most<00:02:53.470> of

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
go and it seems that I completed most of

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.640

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
the remaining ones are just like 4 3 2

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.429 
the remaining ones are just like 4 3 2
so<00:03:00.519> it's<00:03:00.730> gonna<00:03:00.969> take<00:03:01.299> really<00:03:01.599> a<00:03:01.780> while<00:03:02.109> it's

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.439 
so it's gonna take really a while it's

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.559 
so it's gonna take really a while it's
not<00:03:02.620> like<00:03:02.859> I'm<00:03:03.099> gonna<00:03:03.370> get<00:03:03.609> it<00:03:03.790> in<00:03:03.909> a<00:03:04.120> week<00:03:04.150> or

hopefully it's gonna take a month that's
kind<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.370> not<00:03:10.030> too<00:03:10.060> long<00:03:10.450> I<00:03:10.480> guess<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.340> think

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760
