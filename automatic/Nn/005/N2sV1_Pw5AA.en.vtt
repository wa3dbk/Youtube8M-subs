quite frequently the reason why I love

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.080 
quite frequently the reason why I love
this<00:04:15.530> arena<00:04:15.739> so<00:04:16.009> much<00:04:16.220> is<00:04:16.430> it<00:04:16.639> taught<00:04:16.759> me<00:04:16.940> how

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
this arena so much is it taught me how

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.939 
this arena so much is it taught me how
to<00:04:17.120> improve<00:04:17.479> my<00:04:17.539> air<00:04:17.840> strafing<00:04:18.320> and<00:04:18.560> movement

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
to improve my air strafing and movement

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:21.159 
to improve my air strafing and movement
movement<00:04:19.760> is<00:04:19.880> a<00:04:19.940> very<00:04:20.180> important<00:04:20.810> factor<00:04:21.079> on

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
movement is a very important factor on

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:22.810 
movement is a very important factor on
this<00:04:21.320> stage<00:04:21.469> because<00:04:21.859> if<00:04:22.159> you<00:04:22.460> can<00:04:22.669> be

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
this stage because if you can be

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.010 
this stage because if you can be
unpredictable

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020

your<00:04:24.289> opponent<00:04:24.680> will<00:04:24.770> have<00:04:24.860> a<00:04:24.919> very

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
your opponent will have a very

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.999 
your opponent will have a very
our<00:04:25.419> time<00:04:25.689> and<00:04:26.080> getting<00:04:26.319> you<00:04:26.530> into<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.860> air

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:27.009

our time and getting you into the air
when<00:04:27.550> I<00:04:27.580> first<00:04:27.849> started<00:04:28.210> in<00:04:28.300> this<00:04:28.449> arena<00:04:28.659> I<00:04:28.900> got

when I first started in this arena I got

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.260 
when I first started in this arena I got
very<00:04:29.289> frustrated<00:04:29.949> because<00:04:30.069> once<00:04:30.819> you<00:04:30.970> spawn

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
very frustrated because once you spawn

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.929 
very frustrated because once you spawn
you<00:04:31.870> fall<00:04:32.169> down<00:04:32.349> from<00:04:32.409> the<00:04:32.680> very<00:04:32.860> top<00:04:33.220> this

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:33.939 
you fall down from the very top this

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:35.580 
you fall down from the very top this
gives<00:04:34.240> your<00:04:34.360> opponent<00:04:34.840> a<00:04:34.900> chance<00:04:34.930> to<00:04:35.439> air

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
gives your opponent a chance to air

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.409 
gives your opponent a chance to air
shoot<00:04:35.889> you<00:04:36.039> before<00:04:36.699> you<00:04:36.789> even<00:04:36.819> touch<00:04:37.300> the
