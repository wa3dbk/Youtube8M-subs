00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.990
 hour 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.409
 a little bit of moral ownership of this 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.409
 territory 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.920
 I'm cooking that looks like 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.310
 where I was born where I was 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.960
 high and where I evolved into cooking I 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.230
 learned to cook with books I do not 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.750
 do not know how to cook in the beginning and thanks to 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.970
 my wife who she was very very 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.070
 passionate interested by the part of the 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.560
 cooking his mother was a very good the 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.340
 cook and she had that sense of taste 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.290
 simple and sober not to spoil a 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.570
 product and that's from this 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.600
 know there that cooking at home 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:22.220
 took on a physiognomy of culture and 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:25.470
 knowledge in addition to knowledge 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.950
 of how to make it from the art of 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:33.240
 cook by the act itself to cook 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:35.760
 which is completed by a drawing 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.200
 complete with harmony of tastes 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.870
 complete with aesthetics 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.240
 we are in the painting we are in the 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.090
 music we are in poetry and we are 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.860
 in everything everyone wants to do 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.480
 as artistic and I have known two 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.120
 men who taught me another 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.000
 quality that a cook must have is 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.160
 to give give to others the first 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.350
 roma and aegas borough and the second to 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.420
 rostropovich earth roughly in the 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.510
 same moments and live with people 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.170
 like that it taught me that the 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:11.519
 knowledge that we had received from 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:14.510
 books or thirds we also had the 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.510
 give back to others 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.349
 it comes back 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.480
 choral singing and more 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.739

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.739
 yin and yang 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.860
