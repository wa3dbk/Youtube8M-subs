00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.710 
right there still a great game but you
could<00:04:15.870> have<00:04:15.989> put<00:04:16.169> more<00:04:16.500> into<00:04:16.830> it<00:04:17.359> kind<00:04:18.359> of<00:04:18.419> lazy

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
could have put more into it kind of lazy

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.800 
could have put more into it kind of lazy
if<00:04:18.989> you<00:04:19.140> ask<00:04:19.290> me<00:04:21.560> yeah<00:04:23.000> then<00:04:24.000> there's<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.330> gyro

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
if you ask me yeah then there's the gyro

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.940 
if you ask me yeah then there's the gyro
controls<00:04:25.169> um<00:04:25.820> okay<00:04:26.930> why<00:04:27.930> do<00:04:27.990> we<00:04:28.230> need<00:04:28.350> gyro

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
controls um okay why do we need gyro

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.340 
controls um okay why do we need gyro
controls<00:04:29.360> this<00:04:30.360> is<00:04:30.510> a<00:04:30.540> 3d<00:04:31.169> based<00:04:31.530> system<00:04:33.350> just

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
controls this is a 3d based system just

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.620 
controls this is a 3d based system just
just<00:04:34.740> think<00:04:34.919> about<00:04:35.010> this<00:04:35.250> if<00:04:35.790> you<00:04:35.940> tilt<00:04:36.360> the

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
just think about this if you tilt the

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.219 
just think about this if you tilt the
3ds<00:04:37.050> you<00:04:37.710> lose<00:04:38.130> all<00:04:38.580> your<00:04:38.669> 3d<00:04:39.570> capability

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
3ds you lose all your 3d capability

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.380 
3ds you lose all your 3d capability
basically<00:04:40.680> it<00:04:40.919> becomes<00:04:41.220> blurry

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
basically it becomes blurry

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.810 
basically it becomes blurry
now<00:04:42.990> I<00:04:43.350> know<00:04:43.500> a<00:04:43.590> lot<00:04:43.860> of<00:04:43.920> people<00:04:44.040> don't<00:04:44.430> use<00:04:44.670> the

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
now I know a lot of people don't use the

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.440 
now I know a lot of people don't use the
3d<00:04:45.090> feature<00:04:45.450> as<00:04:45.780> much<00:04:46.020> as<00:04:46.170> they<00:04:46.290> should<00:04:47.450> but

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
3d feature as much as they should but

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.780 
3d feature as much as they should but
that's<00:04:49.350> only<00:04:49.500> because<00:04:49.650> some<00:04:50.400> people<00:04:50.640> get<00:04:50.730> a

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
that's only because some people get a

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.950 
that's only because some people get a
migraine<00:04:51.150> from<00:04:51.750> it<00:04:51.930> I'll<00:04:52.620> play<00:04:53.400> it<00:04:53.640> but<00:04:53.820> I<00:04:54.150> only

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
migraine from it I'll play it but I only

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.570 
migraine from it I'll play it but I only
play<00:04:55.260> it<00:04:55.380> when<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.650> battery<00:04:55.980> chargers<00:04:56.430> on

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
play it when the battery chargers on

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.610 
play it when the battery chargers on
because<00:04:57.090> it'll<00:04:57.300> drain<00:04:57.720> the<00:04:57.900> living<00:04:58.200> hell<00:04:58.440> out

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
because it'll drain the living hell out

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.460 
because it'll drain the living hell out
of<00:04:58.650> your<00:04:58.860> battery<00:04:59.220> I<00:04:59.780> mean<00:05:00.780> it's<00:05:00.960> great<00:05:01.290> and

of your battery I mean it's great and
all<00:05:01.590> but<00:05:01.820> I've<00:05:02.820> noticed<00:05:03.090> a<00:05:03.240> lot<00:05:03.270> of<00:05:03.510> people<00:05:03.690> get

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
all but I've noticed a lot of people get

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.390 
all but I've noticed a lot of people get
migraines<00:05:04.440> from<00:05:04.620> this<00:05:04.770> so<00:05:04.860> we<00:05:04.950> just<00:05:05.100> keep<00:05:05.250> it

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.820 
migraines from this so we just keep it
off<00:05:05.490> but<00:05:05.670> the<00:05:05.790> gyro<00:05:06.090> controls<00:05:06.360> on<00:05:07.290> a<00:05:07.350> handheld

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
off but the gyro controls on a handheld

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.730 
off but the gyro controls on a handheld
just<00:05:08.420> makes<00:05:09.420> you<00:05:09.570> look<00:05:09.660> like<00:05:09.840> a<00:05:09.900> retard<00:05:10.230> in

controls<00:05:51.540> that's<00:05:51.900> my<00:05:52.050> opinion<00:05:52.730> it's<00:05:53.730> not<00:05:53.910> to

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
controls that's my opinion it's not to

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.590 
controls that's my opinion it's not to
buy<00:05:54.300> it's<00:05:54.600> just<00:05:54.870> an<00:05:54.960> opinion<00:05:55.290> where<00:05:55.590> I<00:05:55.620> think<00:05:55.950> I

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
buy it's just an opinion where I think I

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.210 
buy it's just an opinion where I think I
think<00:05:57.600> it<00:05:57.690> just<00:05:57.780> it<00:05:58.590> was<00:05:58.710> a<00:05:58.740> great<00:05:59.040> little

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
think it just it was a great little

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.260 
think it just it was a great little
gimmick<00:05:59.700> and<00:05:59.970> it's<00:06:00.390> maybe<00:06:01.260> like<00:06:01.460> a<00:06:02.460> few<00:06:02.970> games

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
gimmick and it's maybe like a few games

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.290 
gimmick and it's maybe like a few games
like<00:06:03.630> have<00:06:03.840> like<00:06:04.020> a<00:06:04.400> movement<00:06:05.400> feature<00:06:06.000> or

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300

like have like a movement feature or
something<00:06:06.570> like<00:06:06.660> that<00:06:06.720> but<00:06:07.260> not<00:06:07.980> every<00:06:08.670> game

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
something like that but not every game

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.850 
something like that but not every game
needs<00:06:09.210> to<00:06:09.390> have<00:06:09.630> that<00:06:09.930> you<00:06:10.110> know<00:06:10.230> that's<00:06:10.620> why<00:06:10.830> I
