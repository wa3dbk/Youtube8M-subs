00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 r how about youtube friends today I'm going 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.450
 to teach how to play the coldplay song 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.820
 this song is great and it's really 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.740
 simple here we are going to make it much easier 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.630
 let's facilitate the chords 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.490
 we're going to make more simple 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.070
 you know we have video demonstration 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.470
 on this side so well let's go to 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.170
 start perfect standard tuning in 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.060
 the guitar and well let's start with 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.039
 the chord patterns for the start to 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.840
 show if in this simple way you could 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.180
 be normal like that but let's move on 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.630
 our number one finger to what would be 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.469
 the second string and we press the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.469
 seventh fret 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.989
 after this same arrangement we're going to 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.930
 move like this towards what would be fa 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.510
 sustained 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.700
 which normally would be like but nothing that 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.490
 we are traveling like this and then I 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:01:00.200
 here the trick for me is that these 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:02.150
 same fingers these the finger 2 3 and 4 the 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.290
 let's leave in the same position and he 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.210
 I'm going to do like this only from 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.680
 go hand in all the song already 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.680
 that everything would be more or less 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.270
 ok let's use a radio pattern 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.370
 for the whole song that really is 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.750
 simple let's position our 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:43.909
 fingers themselves and we start is common 123 2 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.909
 strum and we return to a 2 3 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.300
 12 32 quick features 1 2 3 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.180
 ah 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.280
 okay 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.280
 do not 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.330
 perfect here as a tip we can also 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.519
 use our our number 4 finger 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.209
 we can move it to what would be the 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.209
 third rope 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.060
 you do not do like you as an additional if you 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.060
 want to do 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.750
 I like how you hear it seemed to me that 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.580
 if he does it in the video he started with 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.520
 the first stanza to a slower being 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.520
 from the normal 321 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.230
 to me 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.730
 and we repeat 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.569
 Y 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.150
 all right 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.150
 ah 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.840
 perfect this is going to be the whole circle 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.090
 for the part of the stanzas really 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.120
 the song is very repetitive and nothing more 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:49.659
 for the choir part will use 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.659
 me 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.470
 sun sustained minor 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.079
 and it is sustained if it is complicated to do 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.650
 the cejil or we can omit what we can 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:03.799
 make the sun sustained lower we can 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.610
 do so we put the finger one more 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.610
 stepping on ropes one two and three 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.200
 this is so as not to cover everything else 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.269
 it hinders them little and the sustained fa 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.070
 we can do as I taught them 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.810
 I would prefer that they get it though 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.519
 do not sound very good at the beginning because 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.250
 so they get practice and strength in 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.850
 the hand so we started with the part 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.850
 from the choir 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.890
 and start with 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.860
 t 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.530
 d 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.940
 and we repeat 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.700
 and pauses and repeats 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.110
 d 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:22.539
 and we have armed all our song is 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:25.000
 a simple repetitive song and it's 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:27.340
 perfect for those who are starting already 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.500
 that does not require much skill you already know 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.750
 that if you have doubts comment do not forget 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.849
 like the video and subscribe to my 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.379
 channel so that in this way the videos 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:37.509
 I'm going up 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:43.439
 directly to your mail that would be all 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:43.439
 by day take care bye
