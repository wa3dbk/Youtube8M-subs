00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
when you do this almost easy to think

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.350 
when you do this almost easy to think
about<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.050> as<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> hinge<00:01:04.710> try<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.550> do<00:01:05.789> one<00:01:06.090> side

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
about it as a hinge try to do one side

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.109 
about it as a hinge try to do one side
first<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.110> then<00:01:07.470> flip<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.979> over<00:01:08.190> to<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> other

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
first and then flip it over to the other

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.370 
first and then flip it over to the other
and<00:01:09.360> what<00:01:09.479> kind<00:01:09.660> of<00:01:09.690> snap<00:01:09.869> into<00:01:10.020> place<00:01:10.080> I'll

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
and what kind of snap into place I'll

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.070 
and what kind of snap into place I'll
show<00:01:10.410> you<00:01:10.619> exactly<00:01:11.490> what<00:01:11.759> we<00:01:11.880> mean<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.960> I'm

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
show you exactly what we mean so I'm

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.249 
show you exactly what we mean so I'm
going<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.289> line<00:01:13.920> up<00:01:14.190> this<00:01:15.090> side<00:01:15.360> first<00:01:15.720> more

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
going to line up this side first more

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.510 
going to line up this side first more
like<00:01:16.440> a<00:01:16.470> hinge<00:01:16.800> it's<00:01:16.979> going<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.190> be<00:01:17.369> almost

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
like a hinge it's going to be almost

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.820 
like a hinge it's going to be almost
complete<00:01:18.060> side<00:01:18.330> when<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.410> nice<00:01:19.619> and

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
complete side when I have it nice and

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.669 
complete side when I have it nice and
smooth<00:01:20.100> I'm<00:01:20.310> going<00:01:20.459> to<00:01:20.520> clip<00:01:20.789> each<00:01:20.970> side<00:01:21.300> to

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
smooth I'm going to clip each side to

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:24.680 
smooth I'm going to clip each side to
hold<00:01:22.679> it<00:01:22.770> into<00:01:22.920> place<00:01:23.300> and<00:01:24.300> then<00:01:24.360> I'm<00:01:24.509> going<00:01:24.600> to

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
hold it into place and then I'm going to

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.770 
hold it into place and then I'm going to
slowly<00:01:24.899> work<00:01:25.200> my<00:01:25.259> way<00:01:25.590> around<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:27.270> phone<00:01:29.780> and

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
slowly work my way around the phone and

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.029 
slowly work my way around the phone and
then<00:01:30.899> when<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.080> go<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.229> snap<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.890> other

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
then when you go to snap in the other

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:34.639 
then when you go to snap in the other
side<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.369> find<00:01:32.759> it's<00:01:32.940> easier<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.390> kind<00:01:33.569> of<00:01:33.750> try

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
side I find it's easier to kind of try

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.680 
side I find it's easier to kind of try
to<00:01:34.679> you'll<00:01:35.459> have<00:01:35.640> little<00:01:35.910> teeth<00:01:36.119> groups<00:01:36.479> and

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
to you'll have little teeth groups and

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.699 
to you'll have little teeth groups and
you're<00:01:36.780> going<00:01:36.899> to<00:01:36.959> want<00:01:37.080> to<00:01:37.170> try<00:01:37.319> to<00:01:37.349> slide

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:37.709 
you're going to want to try to slide

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:39.169 
you're going to want to try to slide
them<00:01:37.860> into<00:01:38.039> each<00:01:38.250> other<00:01:38.459> red<00:01:38.610> then<00:01:38.819> just<00:01:39.030> push

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
them into each other red then just push

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:40.969 
them into each other red then just push
them<00:01:39.330> directly<00:01:39.780> down<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.319> top<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.679> each<00:01:40.800> other

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
them directly down on top of each other

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.249 
them directly down on top of each other
it's<00:01:41.729> easier<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.149> break<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:43.410> way<00:01:45.259> we're

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
it's easier to break this way we're

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.010 
it's easier to break this way we're
gonna<00:01:46.349> work<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.560> away<00:01:46.860> down<00:01:47.849> on<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.179> phone<00:01:48.450> and

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
gonna work it away down on the phone and

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.300 
gonna work it away down on the phone and
then<00:01:49.170> I'm<00:01:49.259> just<00:01:49.319> going<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.560> work<00:01:49.800> each<00:01:50.069> little

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
then I'm just going to work each little

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.150 
then I'm just going to work each little
piece<00:01:50.869> until<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:51.929> can<00:01:52.289> snap<00:01:52.679> it<00:01:52.709> together<00:01:52.890> and

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
piece until I can snap it together and

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.859 
piece until I can snap it together and
you'll<00:01:53.280> be<00:01:53.429> able<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.640> tell<00:01:53.849> when<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.420> all

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
you'll be able to tell when it is all

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.059 
you'll be able to tell when it is all
the<00:01:54.990> way<00:01:55.080> connected<00:01:55.349> it<00:01:55.590> would<00:01:55.679> be<00:01:55.860> nice<00:01:56.039> and

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
the way connected it would be nice and

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.719 
the way connected it would be nice and
solid<00:01:56.959> now<00:01:57.959> I've<00:01:58.110> solid<00:01:58.470> corners<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.459> once

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
solid now I've solid corners and once

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.120 
solid now I've solid corners and once
you<00:01:59.880> have<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.149> snapped<00:02:00.509> in<00:02:00.810> you'll<00:02:01.739> be<00:02:01.860> able<00:02:01.979> to

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
you have it snapped in you'll be able to

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.529 
you have it snapped in you'll be able to
see<00:02:02.580> it<00:02:02.759> because<00:02:03.030> it's<00:02:03.119> gonna<00:02:03.209> be<00:02:03.300> a<00:02:03.360> nice

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.589 
see it because it's gonna be a nice
solid<00:02:04.250> line<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.640> won't<00:02:05.789> notice<00:02:05.970> any<00:02:06.179> of<00:02:06.450> the

00:02:06.589 --> 00:02:06.599 
solid line you won't notice any of the

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:09.680 
solid line you won't notice any of the
separations<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:07.789> on<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.090> rubber<00:02:09.300> piece

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
separations and on the rubber piece

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.930 
separations and on the rubber piece
you'll<00:02:10.619> see<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:10.890> little<00:02:11.069> black<00:02:11.340> insert<00:02:11.910> a

line<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.360> can<00:02:12.480> still<00:02:12.660> see<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.870> rubber<00:02:13.020> even

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
line you can still see the rubber even

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.380 
line you can still see the rubber even
with<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.650> plastic<00:02:14.069> on<00:02:14.190> this<00:02:14.880> is<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.060> good

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
with the plastic on this is a good

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.540 
with the plastic on this is a good
indication<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:16.020> we<00:02:16.230> have<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.560> in<00:02:16.739> place<00:02:17.010> if

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
indication that we have it in place if

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.280 
indication that we have it in place if
for<00:02:17.700> whatever<00:02:17.790> reason<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.330> may<00:02:18.750> have<00:02:19.020> seen

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
for whatever reason you may have seen

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.979 
for whatever reason you may have seen
that<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.709> black<00:02:19.980> rubber<00:02:20.730> piece<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.239> jammed<00:02:21.720> up

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
that the black rubber piece is jammed up

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.390 
that the black rubber piece is jammed up
against<00:02:22.319> one<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.650> sides<00:02:22.829> of<00:02:22.920> plastic<00:02:23.280> you

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
against one of the sides of plastic you

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.130 
against one of the sides of plastic you
can<00:02:23.519> pull<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:23.879> out<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.629> don't<00:02:24.780> have<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.959> remove

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
can pull it out you don't have to remove

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.050 
can pull it out you don't have to remove
the<00:02:25.260> whole<00:02:25.379> case

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
the whole case

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.449 
the whole case
and<00:02:27.180> then<00:02:27.420> when<00:02:27.510> we<00:02:27.540> go<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.750> remove<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.380> I<00:02:28.620> find

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
and then when we go to remove it I find

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.990 
and then when we go to remove it I find
it<00:02:29.580> easiest<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.150> try<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.420> do<00:02:30.599> on<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.870> top<00:02:31.140> area

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
it easiest to try to do on the top area

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.300 
it easiest to try to do on the top area
because<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.120> have<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.330> little<00:02:33.630> bit<00:02:33.780> more<00:02:33.989> of<00:02:34.080> a

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
because you have a little bit more of a

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.020 
because you have a little bit more of a
space<00:02:35.330> in<00:02:36.330> between<00:02:36.390> these<00:02:36.840> two<00:02:37.050> holes<00:02:38.030> with

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
space in between these two holes with

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.940 
space in between these two holes with
the<00:02:39.150> plastic<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.750> makes<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.080> less<00:02:40.349> susceptible

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
the plastic it makes it less susceptible

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.640 
the plastic it makes it less susceptible
of<00:02:41.040> getting<00:02:41.310> broken<00:02:41.780> so<00:02:42.780> what<00:02:43.020> I<00:02:43.050> try<00:02:43.319> to<00:02:43.349> do<00:02:43.560> is

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
of getting broken so what I try to do is

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.280 
of getting broken so what I try to do is
I<00:02:43.739> try<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:43.920> lift<00:02:44.160> up<00:02:44.400> on<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.670> teeth<00:02:45.450> on<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:46.260> top

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
I try to lift up on the teeth on the top

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.170 
I try to lift up on the teeth on the top
area<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.430> then<00:02:47.519> again<00:02:47.760> i'm<00:02:47.880> going<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.060> go

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
area and then again i'm going to go

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.750 
area and then again i'm going to go
through<00:02:48.450> i'm<00:02:48.569> going<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.810> open<00:02:49.370> each<00:02:50.370> side

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
through i'm going to open each side

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.540 
through i'm going to open each side
separately<00:02:51.239> I<00:02:51.690> like<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.590> start<00:02:52.860> with<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.280> side

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
separately I like to start with the side

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.809 
separately I like to start with the side
that<00:02:54.300> doesn't<00:02:54.569> have<00:02:54.840> any<00:02:55.050> of<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.319> holes<00:02:55.819> just

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
that doesn't have any of the holes just

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.930 
that doesn't have any of the holes just
because<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.390> seems<00:02:57.690> it's<00:02:58.080> easier<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:59.010> break<00:02:59.370> if

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
because it seems it's easier to break if

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.300 
because it seems it's easier to break if
I<00:03:00.090> were<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.299> start<00:03:00.510> with<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.989> actual<00:03:01.380> volume

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
I were to start with the actual volume

I were to start with the actual volume
