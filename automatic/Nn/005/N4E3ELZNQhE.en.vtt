with the full house redraw so we're

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.089

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
when they have wheat your hands but

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.059 
when they have wheat your hands but
that's<00:02:35.819> obviously<00:02:36.230> at<00:02:37.230> Elle<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.500> against<00:02:37.980> a

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
that's obviously at Elle and against a

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.320 
that's obviously at Elle and against a
good<00:02:38.250> player<00:02:38.459> you<00:02:38.850> don't<00:02:39.000> want<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.209> do<00:02:39.299> that

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
good player you don't want to do that

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.449 
good player you don't want to do that
yeah<00:02:39.900> even<00:02:40.290> against<00:02:40.500> bad<00:02:40.739> players<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.190> tend<00:02:41.400> not

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
yeah even against bad players I tend not

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.260 
yeah even against bad players I tend not
to<00:02:41.730> do<00:02:41.850> that

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
to do that

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.570 
to do that
just<00:02:43.370> just<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.550> remain<00:02:45.530> unexplainable<00:02:46.580> anyway

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
just just to remain unexplainable anyway

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.250 
just just to remain unexplainable anyway
so<00:02:47.640> bet<00:02:48.240> that<00:02:48.420> amount<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:50.030> he<00:02:51.030> calls<00:02:51.270> now<00:02:51.990> I'm

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
so bet that amount and he calls now I'm

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.420 
so bet that amount and he calls now I'm
thinking<00:02:52.470> he's<00:02:52.770> got<00:02:53.130> like<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.430> hand<00:02:53.850> like<00:02:54.120> 75

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
thinking he's got like a hand like 75

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.940 
thinking he's got like a hand like 75
maybe<00:02:56.690> 7546<00:02:58.820> something<00:02:59.820> like<00:02:59.940> that<00:03:00.150> or<00:03:00.950> you

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
maybe 7546 something like that or you

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.580 
maybe 7546 something like that or you
know<00:03:02.040> three<00:03:02.340> pair<00:03:02.580> or<00:03:03.120> maybe<00:03:03.300> like<00:03:03.450> 7<00:03:03.720> 544<00:03:04.140> or

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
know three pair or maybe like 7 544 or

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:12.620 
know three pair or maybe like 7 544 or
like<00:03:04.770> Queen<00:03:07.160> 54<00:03:08.690> something<00:03:09.690> or<00:03:11.420> some<00:03:12.420> hand

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
like Queen 54 something or some hand

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.890 
like Queen 54 something or some hand
like<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:12.950> possibly<00:03:13.950> maybe<00:03:14.940> just<00:03:15.330> a<00:03:15.510> queen

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
like that possibly maybe just a queen

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.130 
like that possibly maybe just a queen
that<00:03:16.380> turned<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.860> flush<00:03:17.160> draw<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.460> go<00:03:17.700> with<00:03:17.880> it

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
that turned the flush draw to go with it

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.840 
that turned the flush draw to go with it
or<00:03:19.580> maybe<00:03:20.580> a<00:03:21.000> hand<00:03:21.570> like<00:03:21.720> 7-5<00:03:22.260> 6-4<00:03:22.830> you<00:03:23.760> know

might have said that already anyways he

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.070 
might have said that already anyways he

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
definitely go down a street and he could

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.110 
definitely go down a street and he could

their rivers a flush car we don't like
to<00:03:37.470> see<00:03:37.680> it<00:03:37.769> but<00:03:38.069> you<00:03:38.700> checked<00:03:39.510> so<00:03:40.400> against

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
to see it but you checked so against

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.150 
to see it but you checked so against
this<00:03:41.459> player<00:03:41.730> I'm<00:03:42.030> pretty<00:03:42.750> sure<00:03:42.900> he'd<00:03:43.110> been<00:03:43.470> a

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
this player I'm pretty sure he'd been a

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.640 
this player I'm pretty sure he'd been a
king<00:03:44.849> hike<00:03:45.030> or<00:03:45.360> queen<00:03:45.810> higher<00:03:46.019> or<00:03:46.349> probably

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
king hike or queen higher or probably

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.710 
king hike or queen higher or probably
even<00:03:46.739> a<00:03:46.890> jack<00:03:47.160> I<00:03:47.310> flush<00:03:47.670> for<00:03:47.879> value<00:03:48.209> in<00:03:48.450> to<00:03:48.599> be

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
even a jack I flush for value in to be

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.369 
even a jack I flush for value in to be
here<00:03:49.099> like<00:03:50.099> ninety<00:03:51.000> percent<00:03:51.150> of<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.510> time<00:03:52.280> and

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
here like ninety percent of the time and

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:59.350 
here like ninety percent of the time and
or<00:03:55.379> maybe<00:03:55.739> even<00:03:55.860> those<00:03:56.370> medium<00:03:56.790> flushes<00:03:57.209> and<00:03:57.950> I

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
or maybe even those medium flushes and I

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.500 
or maybe even those medium flushes and I
and<00:04:00.650> I<00:04:01.650> think<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.670> range<00:04:02.879> of<00:04:03.030> hands<00:04:03.209> i<00:04:03.390> was

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
and I think the the range of hands i was

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.170 
and I think the the range of hands i was
putting<00:04:03.720> him<00:04:03.870> on<00:04:03.989> most<00:04:04.440> of<00:04:04.650> them<00:04:04.830> don't<00:04:05.730> aren't

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
putting him on most of them don't aren't

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.120 
putting him on most of them don't aren't
flush<00:04:06.720> draw<00:04:06.959> hands<00:04:07.170> especially<00:04:07.410> backdoor

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
flush draw hands especially backdoor

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.940 
flush draw hands especially backdoor
flushes<00:04:08.519> so<00:04:08.880> I'm<00:04:09.690> not<00:04:09.900> too<00:04:10.140> concerned<00:04:10.410> with<00:04:10.739> it

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
flushes so I'm not too concerned with it

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.240

however<00:04:11.360> in<00:04:12.360> this<00:04:12.720> spot<00:04:12.930> if<00:04:13.260> I<00:04:13.440> do<00:04:13.500> bet<00:04:13.950> it's

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.550

as we had been playing for quite a while

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.719 
as we had been playing for quite a while
so<00:04:41.910> i<00:04:42.750> go<00:04:43.530> ahead<00:04:43.590> and<00:04:43.710> make<00:04:43.889> a<00:04:43.919> spin<00:04:44.250> value<00:04:44.550> been

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
so i go ahead and make a spin value been

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.430 
so i go ahead and make a spin value been
hoping<00:04:45.090> you'll<00:04:45.419> make<00:04:45.570> a<00:04:45.600> hero<00:04:45.840> call<00:04:46.110> with<00:04:46.289> two

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
hoping you'll make a hero call with two

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.360 
hoping you'll make a hero call with two
pair<00:04:46.680> or<00:04:46.919> like<00:04:47.100> a<00:04:47.130> small<00:04:47.880> set<00:04:48.150> and<00:04:49.250> to<00:04:50.250> my

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
pair or like a small set and to my

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.089 
pair or like a small set and to my
surprise<00:04:50.400> he<00:04:50.760> jammed<00:04:51.389> on<00:04:51.660> me<00:04:51.840> so<00:04:52.200> it's<00:04:52.860> kind<00:04:53.039> of

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
surprise he jammed on me so it's kind of

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:57.650 
surprise he jammed on me so it's kind of
sick<00:04:53.840> and<00:04:55.970> against<00:04:56.970> like<00:04:57.090> ninety-nine

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
sick and against like ninety-nine

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.120 
sick and against like ninety-nine
percent<00:04:57.900> of<00:04:58.139> opponents<00:04:58.620> you<00:04:58.740> should<00:04:58.889> fold

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
percent of opponents you should fold

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.180 
percent of opponents you should fold
here<00:04:59.310> because<00:04:59.910> most<00:05:00.180> people<00:05:01.169> who<00:05:01.349> play<00:05:01.590> pot

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
against those players let me be clear

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.360 
against those players let me be clear
you<00:05:10.050> shouldn't<00:05:10.440> even<00:05:10.590> be<00:05:10.830> betting<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:11.220> river

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
you shouldn't even be betting the river

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.379 
you shouldn't even be betting the river
in<00:05:11.520> the<00:05:11.610> first<00:05:11.849> place<00:05:13.340> but<00:05:14.340> against<00:05:15.270> this

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
percent sure they doesn't have a

percent sure they doesn't have a
king-high<00:05:20.039> flush<00:05:20.099> because<00:05:20.960> I'm<00:05:22.550> positive<00:05:23.550> he

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
king-high flush because I'm positive he

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.850 
king-high flush because I'm positive he
would<00:05:23.849> bet<00:05:24.030> it<00:05:24.180> into<00:05:24.450> me<00:05:24.570> because<00:05:24.750> he<00:05:25.710> would

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
would bet it into me because he would

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.070 
would bet it into me because he would
expect<00:05:26.190> me<00:05:26.400> to<00:05:26.520> check<00:05:26.760> back<00:05:27.030> a<00:05:27.060> hand<00:05:27.450> like<00:05:27.690> a

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
expect me to check back a hand like a

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.490 
expect me to check back a hand like a
straight<00:05:28.710> or<00:05:28.889> possibly<00:05:29.430> a<00:05:29.520> set<00:05:29.849> and<00:05:30.169> not<00:05:31.169> bet

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
straight or possibly a set and not bet

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.990 
straight or possibly a set and not bet
it<00:05:31.650> then<00:05:33.110> even<00:05:34.110> though<00:05:34.260> he's<00:05:35.190> seen<00:05:35.430> me<00:05:35.580> three

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
it then even though he's seen me three

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.460 
it then even though he's seen me three
barrel<00:05:36.270> a<00:05:36.360> couple<00:05:36.630> times<00:05:36.750> he<00:05:37.080> would<00:05:37.169> still

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
barrel a couple times he would still

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.529 
barrel a couple times he would still
expect<00:05:38.010> me<00:05:38.370> to<00:05:38.490> do<00:05:38.669> that<00:05:38.849> a<00:05:38.880> lot<00:05:39.120> of<00:05:39.180> the<00:05:39.300> time

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
expect me to do that a lot of the time

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:42.740 
expect me to do that a lot of the time
so<00:05:40.520> I'm<00:05:41.520> not<00:05:41.760> giving<00:05:42.060> him<00:05:42.180> a<00:05:42.210> king-high<00:05:42.659> flush

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
so I'm not giving him a king-high flush

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.510 
so I'm not giving him a king-high flush
in<00:05:43.289> if<00:05:43.380> he<00:05:43.469> doesn't<00:05:43.770> have<00:05:43.830> a<00:05:43.890> king<00:05:44.099> I<00:05:44.250> feel<00:05:44.430> if

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
in if he doesn't have a king I feel if

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.020 
in if he doesn't have a king I feel if
he's<00:05:45.180> probably<00:05:45.390> not<00:05:45.690> jamming<00:05:46.140> here<00:05:46.320> so<00:05:46.590> I<00:05:47.030> just

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
he's probably not jamming here so I just

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.550 
he's probably not jamming here so I just
think<00:05:48.180> he's<00:05:48.300> full<00:05:48.479> of<00:05:48.510> shit<00:05:48.750> a<00:05:48.810> lot<00:05:48.990> here<00:05:49.289> and

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
think he's full of shit a lot here and

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.350 
think he's full of shit a lot here and
based<00:05:49.770> on<00:05:49.890> most<00:05:50.310> of<00:05:50.430> the<00:05:50.520> hands<00:05:50.789> I<00:05:50.849> was<00:05:51.000> giving

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
based on most of the hands I was giving

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.750 
based on most of the hands I was giving
him<00:05:51.479> I<00:05:51.740> think<00:05:52.740> it's<00:05:52.860> a<00:05:52.950> good<00:05:53.070> spot<00:05:53.310> for<00:05:53.370> a<00:05:53.580> hero

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
him I think it's a good spot for a hero

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.660 
him I think it's a good spot for a hero
call

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.670 
call

00:05:54.670 --> 00:06:00.750 
call
I<00:05:54.790> decided<00:05:55.780> to<00:05:56.080> and<00:05:56.640> I<00:05:57.640> was<00:05:58.060> good<00:05:59.400> he<00:06:00.400> decided

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
I decided to and I was good he decided

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.170 
I decided to and I was good he decided
that<00:06:01.120> he<00:06:01.900> knew<00:06:02.080> is<00:06:02.290> to<00:06:02.950> pair<00:06:03.160> wasn't<00:06:04.000> good

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
that he knew is to pair wasn't good

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.470 
that he knew is to pair wasn't good
after<00:06:04.930> the<00:06:05.200> river<00:06:05.410> and<00:06:06.090> he's<00:06:07.090> probably

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:07.480 
after the river and he's probably

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.230 
after the river and he's probably
putting<00:06:07.930> me<00:06:08.080> up<00:06:08.200> on<00:06:08.440> like<00:06:09.310> a<00:06:09.340> medium<00:06:09.850> flush<00:06:10.090> at

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
putting me up on like a medium flush at

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.440 
putting me up on like a medium flush at
that<00:06:10.390> point<00:06:10.660> and<00:06:11.130> thinking<00:06:12.130> that<00:06:12.340> he<00:06:13.150> can<00:06:13.330> get

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
that point and thinking that he can get

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.290 
that point and thinking that he can get
me<00:06:13.630> to<00:06:13.780> just<00:06:13.990> lay<00:06:14.140> it<00:06:14.260> down<00:06:14.640> because<00:06:15.640> my<00:06:16.120> most

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
me to just lay it down because my most

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.790 
me to just lay it down because my most
likely<00:06:16.630> and<00:06:16.810> when<00:06:16.960> I<00:06:16.990> bet<00:06:17.230> that<00:06:17.260> river<00:06:17.650> is<00:06:17.680> a

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
likely and when I bet that river is a

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.850 
likely and when I bet that river is a
backdoor<00:06:18.310> medium<00:06:19.030> flush<00:06:19.360> or<00:06:19.780> like<00:06:20.230> queen-high

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
backdoor medium flush or like queen-high

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.990 
backdoor medium flush or like queen-high
flush<00:06:20.920> something<00:06:21.520> like<00:06:21.760> that<00:06:22.830> and<00:06:24.000> and

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
flush something like that and and

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.560 
flush something like that and and
possibly<00:06:25.900> 680<00:06:26.440> but<00:06:26.860> I<00:06:27.160> I<00:06:27.520> don't<00:06:28.270> think<00:06:28.450> he

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.570 
possibly 680 but I I don't think he

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.060 
possibly 680 but I I don't think he
would<00:06:28.660> expect<00:06:28.990> me<00:06:29.140> to<00:06:29.260> bid<00:06:29.410> for<00:06:29.620> value<00:06:29.890> that

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.070 
would expect me to bid for value that

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.720 
would expect me to bid for value that
often<00:06:30.460> even<00:06:31.120> though<00:06:31.240> I<00:06:31.330> did<00:06:31.570> and<00:06:32.430> so<00:06:33.430> yeah<00:06:33.640> it

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:33.730 
often even though I did and so yeah it

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.310 
often even though I did and so yeah it
was<00:06:33.850> kind<00:06:34.030> of<00:06:34.090> interesting<00:06:34.660> non-standard

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
was kind of interesting non-standard

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.340 
was kind of interesting non-standard
hand<00:06:35.530> but<00:06:36.270> like<00:06:37.270> I<00:06:37.390> said<00:06:37.450> against<00:06:37.990> ninety

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350 
hand but like I said against ninety

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.380 
hand but like I said against ninety
percent<00:06:38.500> of<00:06:38.740> opponents<00:06:39.310> who<00:06:40.030> played<00:06:40.240> this

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.390 
percent of opponents who played this
