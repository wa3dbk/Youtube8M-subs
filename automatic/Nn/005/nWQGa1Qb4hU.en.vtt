navigation now I just chose these

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.390 
navigation now I just chose these
numbers<00:02:41.569> randomly<00:02:42.569> so<00:02:43.380> we<00:02:43.830> don't<00:02:43.980> really<00:02:44.160> know

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
numbers randomly so we don't really know

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.610 
numbers randomly so we don't really know
where<00:02:44.610> it's<00:02:44.700> gonna<00:02:44.760> pop<00:02:45.030> up<00:02:45.300> and<00:02:45.630> yes<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.440> want

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
to go to that Waypoint instead and you

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.979 
to go to that Waypoint instead and you
can<00:02:49.260> see<00:02:49.440> that's<00:02:49.620> where<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:49.920> am<00:02:50.630> you<00:02:51.630> can<00:02:51.780> kind
