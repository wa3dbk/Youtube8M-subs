00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.350 
in Iraq in a power rack and the barbell
rests<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:02.310> barbell<00:02:02.759> here's<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.090> bunch<00:02:03.299> of

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
rests the barbell here's a bunch of

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.719 
rests the barbell here's a bunch of
barbells<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:04.070> barbell<00:02:05.070> rests<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.060> pins<00:02:07.729> and

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
barbells a barbell rests in the pins and

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.190 
barbells a barbell rests in the pins and
then<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.060> press<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.330> weight<00:02:09.599> off<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.959> pins

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
then you press the weight off the pins

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.809 
then you press the weight off the pins
at<00:02:10.410> whatever<00:02:10.709> desired<00:02:11.220> height<00:02:11.459> you'd<00:02:11.700> like

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
at whatever desired height you'd like

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.759 
at whatever desired height you'd like
such<00:02:13.629> a<00:02:13.659> three<00:02:14.019> are<00:02:14.310> recommended<00:02:15.310> sets<00:02:16.299> of<00:02:16.450> one

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
such a three are recommended sets of one

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.309 
such a three are recommended sets of one
are<00:02:17.769> good<00:02:18.159> but<00:02:18.760> also<00:02:18.939> very<00:02:19.299> freakin<00:02:19.840> painful

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
are good but also very freakin painful

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.289 
are good but also very freakin painful
so<00:02:20.499> be<00:02:20.620> careful<00:02:21.010> with<00:02:21.069> those<00:02:21.280> I<00:02:21.609> would<00:02:22.150> do

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
so be careful with those I would do

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.830 
so be careful with those I would do
triples<00:02:22.810> or<00:02:22.989> sets<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.349> five<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:25.510> can<00:02:25.659> also

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
triples or sets of five and you can also

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.830 
triples or sets of five and you can also
set<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.769> pin<00:02:27.010> fairly<00:02:27.909> low<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.209> start<00:02:28.689> your

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
set the pin fairly low to start your

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.050 
set the pin fairly low to start your
sets<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.530> start<00:02:29.769> your<00:02:29.889> workout<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.609> you<00:02:30.939> can

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
sets to start your workout and you can

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.449 
sets to start your workout and you can
raise<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.450> pin<00:02:31.659> height<00:02:31.900> up<00:02:32.109> as<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.409> go<00:02:32.620> as<00:02:32.950> it

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
raise the pin height up as you go as it

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.069 
raise the pin height up as you go as it
gets<00:02:33.609> to<00:02:33.730> be<00:02:33.849> harder<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.299> harder<00:02:34.599> so<00:02:34.780> for

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
gets to be harder and harder so for

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.199 
gets to be harder and harder so for
example<00:02:35.560> let's<00:02:36.219> say<00:02:36.310> you<00:02:36.400> do<00:02:36.549> a<00:02:36.579> pin<00:02:36.909> press

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
example let's say you do a pin press

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.940 
example let's say you do a pin press
let's<00:02:37.540> say<00:02:37.659> it's<00:02:37.810> just<00:02:37.870> half<00:02:38.139> way<00:02:38.170> half<00:02:38.650> range

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
let's say it's just half way half range

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.179 
let's say it's just half way half range
of<00:02:39.099> motion<00:02:39.480> let's<00:02:40.480> say<00:02:40.629> you<00:02:40.689> do<00:02:40.959> three<00:02:41.739> fifteen

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:42.189 
of motion let's say you do three fifteen

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:44.729 
of motion let's say you do three fifteen
four<00:02:42.519> set<00:02:42.730> of<00:02:42.849> three<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:44.049> can<00:02:44.169> raise<00:02:44.349> the<00:02:44.530> pins

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
four set of three you can raise the pins

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.490 
four set of three you can raise the pins
up<00:02:44.980> an<00:02:45.189> inch<00:02:45.340> or<00:02:45.459> two<00:02:45.780> two<00:02:46.780> inches<00:02:47.019> or<00:02:47.139> so<00:02:47.319> and

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
up an inch or two two inches or so and

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.500 
up an inch or two two inches or so and
do<00:02:48.040> another<00:02:48.250> heavy<00:02:48.549> set<00:02:48.819> of<00:02:48.909> three<00:02:49.090> add<00:02:49.269> some

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
do another heavy set of three add some

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.420 
do another heavy set of three add some
weight<00:02:49.659> on<00:02:49.689> there<00:02:50.019> you<00:02:50.590> can<00:02:50.709> raise<00:02:50.889> it<00:02:50.919> up<00:02:51.129> once

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
weight on there you can raise it up once

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.099 
weight on there you can raise it up once
again<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:52.030> do<00:02:52.090> another<00:02:52.120> heavy<00:02:52.569> set<00:02:52.810> of<00:02:52.900> three

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
again and do another heavy set of three

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.140 
again and do another heavy set of three
so<00:02:53.260> now<00:02:53.409> you<00:02:53.469> got<00:02:53.739> in<00:02:53.949> a<00:02:54.159> couple<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:55.030> really

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
so now you got in a couple of really

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.649 
so now you got in a couple of really
good<00:02:55.389> overloads<00:02:55.900> off<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.919> pins<00:02:57.449> the<00:02:58.449> pin

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
good overloads off the pins the pin

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.920 
good overloads off the pins the pin
press<00:02:58.900> also<00:02:59.290> kind<00:02:59.560> of<00:02:59.650> helps<00:02:59.919> you<00:03:00.099> with

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
press also kind of helps you with

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.509 
press also kind of helps you with
learning<00:03:01.930> how<00:03:01.959> to<00:03:02.079> accelerate<00:03:02.680> into<00:03:03.099> a<00:03:03.219> dead

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
learning how to accelerate into a dead

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.970 
learning how to accelerate into a dead
weight<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:04.269> weights<00:03:04.510> are<00:03:04.719> are<00:03:05.199> resting<00:03:05.799> on

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
weight the weights are are resting on

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.429 
weight the weights are are resting on
the<00:03:06.189> pins<00:03:06.489> there's<00:03:06.849> no<00:03:07.090> acceleration<00:03:07.840> that

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:08.439 
the pins there's no acceleration that

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.020 
the pins there's no acceleration that
has<00:03:08.590> happened<00:03:08.980> previously<00:03:09.219> the<00:03:09.699> weights<00:03:09.879> are

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
has happened previously the weights are

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.589 
has happened previously the weights are
just<00:03:10.239> on<00:03:10.389> there<00:03:10.719> it's<00:03:11.349> a<00:03:11.500> dead<00:03:11.739> stop<00:03:12.099> so<00:03:12.599> it's

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
just on there it's a dead stop so it's

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.800 
just on there it's a dead stop so it's
going<00:03:13.719> to<00:03:13.810> help<00:03:14.019> you<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.439> learn<00:03:14.650> how<00:03:14.709> to<00:03:14.919> become

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
going to help you to learn how to become

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.719 
going to help you to learn how to become
explosive<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:17.169> learn<00:03:17.319> how<00:03:17.470> to<00:03:17.530> turn<00:03:17.859> on<00:03:18.069> those

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:18.729 
explosive and learn how to turn on those

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:20.640 
explosive and learn how to turn on those
triceps<00:03:19.389> when<00:03:19.599> they're<00:03:19.780> when<00:03:20.319> they're<00:03:20.349> most
