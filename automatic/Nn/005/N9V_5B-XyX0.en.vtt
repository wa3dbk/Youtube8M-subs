00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.590
 save guys here who speaks is the be of 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.789
 freestyle skaters and I'm going to give a 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.880
 Hard genius tip for you guys I found 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:34.380
 here it was the American brand and 11 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.450
 full and mail with whom average arrives 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.420
 excellent to lend to whoever 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.260
 not see a deficit is different from the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.230
 street 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.930
 he is kind of small, answers who 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.379
 does not fit the purpose of 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:58.309
 always are all and several others 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:58.309
 freestyle excellent stage maneuvers 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.050
 street fusion 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:12.470
 certainly some new ones on little one 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:17.820
 little more complicated than walking from here 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:21.270
 the 12 here is excellent 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.119
 difference of the differences is 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:29.460
 wheelbase is a distance between 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:34.549
 much smaller than the district has 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.549
 some maneuvers for me is very high 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:59.310
 not a being much longer than 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:08.640
 you use a shape street 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:10.720
 the chip without the 15 and not spend as much 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.180
 world fast 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.400
 the work that must and that is what makes the 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.580
 difference making sliding stick much 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:26.500
 better to perform certain modes and 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:27.640
 come here is a sauce and know where you 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.200
 it is 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:34.600
 I just got it here to apply the 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.650
 enrolled who already comes to the kitchen 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:43.060
 you went the drill it's bored it opens it 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:46.330
 kosinski put to volleyball and then 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:50.350
 Next video next I'll show you one 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:56.380
 bit of the sun the trance tanks and it was 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:03:00.840
 being on the 7th and 9th as an example 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.840
