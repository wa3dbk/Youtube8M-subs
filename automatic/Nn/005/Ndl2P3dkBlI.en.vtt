really<00:02:57.260> like<00:02:57.770> a<00:02:57.800> bad<00:02:58.160> size<00:02:58.580> but<00:02:58.940> I<00:02:58.970> mean<00:02:59.120> it<00:02:59.210> is

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
really like a bad size but I mean it is

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.540 
really like a bad size but I mean it is
pretty<00:03:00.170> small<00:03:00.260> in<00:03:00.680> there<00:03:00.920> um<00:03:01.160> if<00:03:01.400> you're

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
pretty small in there um if you're

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.320 
pretty small in there um if you're
looking<00:03:01.760> for<00:03:01.820> something<00:03:02.060> a<00:03:02.090> little<00:03:02.240> bit

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
looking for something a little bit

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.060 
looking for something a little bit
bigger<00:03:02.570> I<00:03:02.990> feel<00:03:03.380> a<00:03:03.410> lot<00:03:03.560> bigger<00:03:03.830> you<00:03:03.920> might

want to go with the regular size hipster
which<00:03:07.550> i<00:03:07.610> think<00:03:07.730> is<00:03:07.850> one<00:03:07.970> more<00:03:08.030> expensive<00:03:08.420> a

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
which i think is one more expensive a

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.570 
which i think is one more expensive a
game<00:03:08.630> it's<00:03:08.750> like<00:03:08.780> $56<00:03:09.650> well<00:03:09.830> this<00:03:09.950> is<00:03:10.070> like<00:03:10.190> 48

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
game it's like $56 well this is like 48

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.950 
game it's like $56 well this is like 48
so<00:03:10.910> I<00:03:10.940> don't<00:03:11.150> know<00:03:11.240> I<00:03:11.270> can't<00:03:11.540> something<00:03:11.810> like<00:03:11.930> a
