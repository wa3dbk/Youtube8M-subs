00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:01.990 
keloids now this was made flat and then
a<00:04:00.109> fractional<00:04:00.560> co2<00:04:00.799> and<00:04:01.280> then<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.489> V<00:04:01.609> beam<00:04:01.790> can

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
a fractional co2 and then the V beam can

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.640 
a fractional co2 and then the V beam can
get<00:04:02.150> rid<00:04:02.239> of<00:04:02.299> the<00:04:02.480> color<00:04:02.690> and<00:04:02.959> these<00:04:03.320> are<00:04:03.470> red

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
get rid of the color and these are red

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.650 
get rid of the color and these are red

doctor do you have to have adoptions
only<00:04:16.070> be<00:04:16.220> done<00:04:16.400> by<00:04:16.459> a<00:04:16.730> trained<00:04:17.420> aesthetic

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
only be done by a trained aesthetic

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.390 
only be done by a trained aesthetic
physician<00:04:18.320> like<00:04:18.500> a<00:04:18.560> dermatologist<00:04:19.280> or

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
physician like a dermatologist or

physician like a dermatologist or
plastic<00:04:19.760> surgeon<00:04:20.120> x4<00:04:20.510> we<00:04:20.630> go<00:04:20.750> so<00:04:21.049> here<00:04:21.320> we<00:04:21.350> have

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
plastic surgeon x4 we go so here we have

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.810 
plastic surgeon x4 we go so here we have
the<00:04:21.980> center<00:04:22.940> on<00:04:23.090> e<00:04:23.300> matrix<00:04:23.870> this<00:04:24.530> uses<00:04:24.860> sublet

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
the center on e matrix this uses sublet

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.180 
the center on e matrix this uses sublet
of<00:04:26.000> radio<00:04:26.690> frequencies<00:04:27.320> so<00:04:27.500> it<00:04:27.650> goes<00:04:27.800> through

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
of radio frequencies so it goes through

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.340 
of radio frequencies so it goes through
the<00:04:28.340> skin<00:04:28.610> to<00:04:28.880> deliver<00:04:29.180> energy<00:04:29.390> and<00:04:29.810> these<00:04:30.200> are

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
the skin to deliver energy and these are

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.780 
the skin to deliver energy and these are
treatments<00:04:30.740> that<00:04:30.770> we<00:04:30.980> couldn't<00:04:31.280> do<00:04:31.430> in<00:04:31.580> skin

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
treatments that we couldn't do in skin

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.160 
treatments that we couldn't do in skin
of<00:04:31.910> color<00:04:31.940> before<00:04:32.360> because<00:04:32.900> it<00:04:33.020> would

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
of color before because it would

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.510 
of color before because it would
increase<00:04:33.500> risk<00:04:33.860> of<00:04:33.980> scarring<00:04:34.250> or

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
increase risk of scarring or

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.640 
increase risk of scarring or
discoloration<00:04:35.210> so<00:04:35.720> here<00:04:35.930> we<00:04:36.080> have<00:04:36.110> erica

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
discoloration so here we have erica

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.500 
discoloration so here we have erica

radiofrequency<00:04:47.480> it's<00:04:47.930> not<00:04:48.080> laser<00:04:48.380> so<00:04:48.740> you

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
radiofrequency it's not laser so you

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.620 
radiofrequency it's not laser so you
don't<00:04:49.040> need<00:04:49.250> goggles<00:04:49.520> to<00:04:49.970> use<00:04:50.150> it<00:04:50.360> and<00:04:50.600> when

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
don't need goggles to use it and when

don't need goggles to use it and when
you<00:04:50.930> hold<00:04:51.170> it<00:04:51.350> against<00:04:51.740> the<00:04:51.860> skin<00:04:52.160> you<00:04:52.910> can

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
you hold it against the skin you can

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.820 
you hold it against the skin you can
just<00:04:53.210> press<00:04:53.450> and<00:04:53.810> you<00:04:54.110> get<00:04:54.230> that<00:04:54.260> little<00:04:54.380> click

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
uncomfortable and she could put make up

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.240 
uncomfortable and she could put make up
and<00:05:08.660> go<00:05:08.780> because<00:05:09.170> i'm<00:05:09.380> really<00:05:09.740> going<00:05:09.890> through

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
and go because i'm really going through

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.220 
and go because i'm really going through
the<00:05:10.550> skin<00:05:10.820> and<00:05:11.090> after<00:05:11.750> about<00:05:11.840> three

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
the skin and after about three

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.540 
the skin and after about three
treatments<00:05:12.680> you<00:05:12.770> can<00:05:12.800> see<00:05:13.070> the<00:05:13.190> before<00:05:13.520> and

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
treatments you can see the before and

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.190 
treatments you can see the before and
afters<00:05:14.060> here<00:05:14.210> this<00:05:14.390> is<00:05:14.510> only<00:05:14.660> after<00:05:14.870> one
