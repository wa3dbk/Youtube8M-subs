00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.580
 obama 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.810
 there was at least a strong 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.169
 So here we are in the process of realizing the 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.009
 what is called the task ages of the life of the vineyard 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:30.810
 he comes from us 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.100
 she speaks 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.010
 londers reaches several meters 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.010
 the signs are sometimes difficult negotiations around a picnic 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.140
 for three days called a great challenge 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.480
 these works will spread to the ground at the grand-theater broken parliament 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.140
 and in any case we will not be able to answer and reasons of quality at 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.200
 practical plan natasha giggs 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.120
 with a material 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.440
 relatively advice 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.100
 ultimate wet we can do it too with the losc is open every scene 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.920
 is infected 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.440
 quite frequently 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.010
 used in the region 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.900
 this material lends itself 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.660
 very very well at this event 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.660
 he shows just do a little bit of sahel woman 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.640
 and it's finished the harm is done two of the three points advanced on the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.700
 second 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.920
 but we will block everything 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.560
 on the other hand this winter it will fall apart all this will still be 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.560
 resolved but there will be no doubt that it happened 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.229
 both used since 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.420
 very very long two inhabitants of Anatolia press 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.930
 it is based on the region 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.930
 but it is very topical because it allows to go quickly 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.230
 the work schedule is breaking or some compatriots who have 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.230
 lifted their mug number of outbreaks 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.750
 the plane had to climb to put the neighbor 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.960
 he was exposed to the sun 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.390
 the island of tasmania 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.990
 affected two 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.140
 this is the middle 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.780
 the first rays of sun 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.980
 green 'to africa 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.110
 for 2010 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.320
 employment is far from 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.790
 off the field 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.600
