00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:11.210
 Hello guys 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:11.210
 the source of the defective xbox 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.330
 I'll try to pass on to you that I did. 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.660
 this source 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:25.019
 first the source does not know what 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:01:55.130
 It was the problem that she had a 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:01:55.130
 heating and also one here I 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.570
 basically these two components 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.220
 now I'll show you guys how common 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.520
 take the test 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:22.520
 the very simple test first place 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.520
 put on the resistance scale in the 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:03:25.160
 continuity even simple test can 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:58.910
 replace the component has returned to 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.910
 replace the component with the source 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:20.570
 generally the staff that replaces the 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.570
 source
