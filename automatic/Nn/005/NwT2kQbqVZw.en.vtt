hitch<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:24.330> hitch<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.750> important<00:00:25.320> because<00:00:26.119> it

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
hitch the hitch is important because it

hitch the hitch is important because it
took<00:00:27.390> me<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.689> took<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.199> long<00:00:28.380> time<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.680> engineer

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
took me it took a long time to engineer

took me it took a long time to engineer
the<00:00:29.640> hitch<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:29.970> actually<00:00:30.300> took<00:00:30.449> me<00:00:30.599> longer<00:00:30.929> to

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
trailer you know I found a little bit of

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.450 
trailer you know I found a little bit of
information<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.620> internet<00:00:38.219> which<00:00:38.430> is

information on the internet which is
very<00:00:38.820> helpful<00:00:39.030> but<00:00:40.020> there<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.440> wasn't

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
very helpful but there just wasn't

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.250 
very helpful but there just wasn't
hardly<00:00:42.120> anything<00:00:42.540> out<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.870> I'm<00:00:42.960> making<00:00:43.230> a

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
hardly anything out that I'm making a

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.220 
hardly anything out that I'm making a
hitch<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.739> here's<00:00:44.579> what<00:00:44.789> makes<00:00:44.930> making<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
hitch and here's what makes making the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.220 
hitch and here's what makes making the
hitch<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:46.620> tricky<00:00:47.180> so<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.570> bike<00:00:48.899> it's<00:00:49.170> not

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
hitch so tricky so on a bike it's not

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.700 
hitch so tricky so on a bike it's not
just<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.129> simple<00:00:50.340> matter<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:51.710> hooking

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
just a simple matter of hooking

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.600 
just a simple matter of hooking
something<00:00:53.280> up<00:00:53.460> because<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.510> bike<00:00:55.610> sometimes

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
something up because a bike sometimes

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.729 
something up because a bike sometimes
has<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.059> go<00:00:57.180> left<00:00:57.449> while<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.780> trailer<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.530> at<00:00:58.710> a

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
has to go left while the trailer is at a

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.979 
has to go left while the trailer is at a
different<00:00:58.890> angle<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.879> while<00:01:00.719> you're<00:01:00.840> going

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
different angle and while you're going

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.820 
different angle and while you're going
up<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.320> may<00:01:01.530> be<00:01:01.730> angling<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.239> either<00:01:04.170> angle

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
up you may be angling so either angle

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.800 
up you may be angling so either angle
and<00:01:05.040> let<00:01:06.000> up<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.840> need<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> turn<00:01:07.320> as<00:01:08.280> well

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
and let up but you need to turn as well

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.289 
and let up but you need to turn as well
you<00:01:09.810> may<00:01:09.960> have<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.170> do<00:01:10.320> all<00:01:10.500> three<00:01:10.680> at<00:01:10.830> once<00:01:11.299> and

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
you may have to do all three at once and

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.480 
you may have to do all three at once and
you<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.780> see<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:14.040> have<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.340> capability

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
you can see that you have the capability

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.520 
you can see that you have the capability
to<00:01:15.150> do<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.619> and<00:01:17.840> we'll<00:01:18.840> show<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.020> how<00:01:19.140> we<00:01:19.259> did

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
to do that and we'll show you how we did

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.640 
to do that and we'll show you how we did
that<00:01:21.229> now<00:01:22.229> zoom<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.400> here<00:01:24.049> see<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.229> like<00:01:25.470> an

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
that now zoom in here see that like an

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.640 
that now zoom in here see that like an
automotive<00:01:26.090> hitch<00:01:27.090> I've<00:01:27.509> got<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:28.020> chain<00:01:28.320> here

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
automotive hitch I've got a chain here

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.590 
automotive hitch I've got a chain here
is<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> emergency<00:01:29.520> case<00:01:30.270> my<00:01:30.450> hitch<00:01:30.659> does<00:01:31.049> fail

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
is the emergency case my hitch does fail

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.020 
is the emergency case my hitch does fail
the<00:01:33.600> real<00:01:33.810> trick<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:37.430> it's<00:01:38.430> really<00:01:38.909> a

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
the real trick is it's really a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.569 
the real trick is it's really a
universal<00:01:39.329> joint<00:01:40.640> so<00:01:43.070> let's<00:01:44.070> see<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> top<00:01:44.549> of

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
universal joint so let's see the top of

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.780 
universal joint so let's see the top of
this<00:01:45.320> we've<00:01:46.320> got<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:46.950> it'll<00:01:47.100> turn<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.520> way

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
this we've got it so it'll turn this way

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.319 
this we've got it so it'll turn this way
this<00:01:48.509> part<00:01:48.899> turns<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.409> way<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:51.090> is

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
this part turns this way and this is

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.399 
this part turns this way and this is
actually<00:01:52.140> an<00:01:52.380> air<00:01:52.890> hose<00:01:53.100> fitting<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.409> part

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
actually an air hose fitting in it part

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.010 
actually an air hose fitting in it part
that<00:01:55.560> rotates<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.820> we<00:01:57.000> can<00:01:57.119> rotate<00:01:57.299> we<00:01:57.840> can

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
that rotates so we can rotate we can

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.240 
that rotates so we can rotate we can
turn<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.590> make<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.890> up<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.280> down<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.890> what

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
turn it and make it up and down and what

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.510 
turn it and make it up and down and what
I<00:02:02.280> did<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:03.030> just<00:02:03.649> drilled<00:02:04.649> right<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.219> hole

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
I did is I just drilled right a hole

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.449 
I did is I just drilled right a hole
right<00:02:05.549> through<00:02:06.439> arrows<00:02:07.439> hose<00:02:07.920> fitting<00:02:08.369> to

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
right through arrows hose fitting to

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.389 
right through arrows hose fitting to
keep<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.789> as<00:02:08.879> short<00:02:08.910> as<00:02:09.270> possible

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
keep it as short as possible

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.039 
keep it as short as possible
and<00:02:11.209> I<00:02:12.340> welded<00:02:13.340> a<00:02:13.549> couple<00:02:14.060> tabs<00:02:14.269> onto<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:14.720> solid

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
and I welded a couple tabs onto a solid

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.430 
and I welded a couple tabs onto a solid
piece<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.500> steel<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:17.330> it's<00:02:17.840> all<00:02:18.140> held

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
piece of steel and it's all held

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.300 
piece of steel and it's all held
together<00:02:18.620> with<00:02:18.920> quarter<00:02:19.549> inch<00:02:19.580> bolts<00:02:20.239> and

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
together with quarter inch bolts and

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.259 
together with quarter inch bolts and
nylock<00:02:22.310> nuts<00:02:22.760> these<00:02:23.090> are<00:02:23.590> special<00:02:24.590> nuts<00:02:24.799> that

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
nylock nuts these are special nuts that

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.280 
nylock nuts these are special nuts that
don't<00:02:26.269> come<00:02:26.480> off<00:02:26.629> very<00:02:26.810> easily

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.619 

yeah<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.739> air<00:02:30.920> Fang<00:02:31.220> is<00:02:31.519> just<00:02:31.940> a<00:02:32.060> standard<00:02:32.299> air

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
yeah the air Fang is just a standard air
