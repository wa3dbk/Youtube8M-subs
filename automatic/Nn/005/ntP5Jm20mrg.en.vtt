this back portion here feels like kind

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.600 
this back portion here feels like kind
of<00:00:35.360> like<00:00:35.450> a<00:00:35.540> nylon<00:00:35.750> I<00:00:36.250> don't<00:00:37.250> know<00:00:37.340> if<00:00:37.400> you<00:00:37.490> can

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610

see<00:00:37.880> it<00:00:38.000> very<00:00:38.210> well<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:41.470> overall<00:00:42.470> I<00:00:42.860> think<00:00:43.220> that

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
see it very well so overall I think that

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.560 
see it very well so overall I think that
the<00:00:43.579> craftsmanship<00:00:44.570> is<00:00:45.020> pretty<00:00:45.829> good<00:00:46.070> I<00:00:46.700> don't

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
the craftsmanship is pretty good I don't

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.000 
the craftsmanship is pretty good I don't
really<00:00:47.780> have<00:00:47.930> any<00:00:48.110> complaints<00:00:48.230> I<00:00:48.590> just<00:00:48.770> really

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
really have any complaints I just really

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.680 
really have any complaints I just really
like<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:49.310> colorway<00:00:49.700> this<00:00:49.940> golden-green

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
like the colorway this golden-green

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.220 
like the colorway this golden-green
really<00:00:51.260> stands<00:00:51.530> out<00:00:51.739> pretty<00:00:52.280> nicely<00:00:53.050> and<00:00:54.050> then

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
really stands out pretty nicely and then

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.110 
really stands out pretty nicely and then
like<00:00:54.500> it's<00:00:54.649> saying<00:00:54.829> like<00:00:55.010> this<00:00:55.280> darker<00:00:55.880> green

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
like it's saying like this darker green

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.959 
like it's saying like this darker green
here<00:00:56.510> and<00:00:56.720> then<00:00:56.870> it's<00:00:57.050> on<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.290> bottom<00:00:57.620> as<00:00:57.739> well

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
here and then it's on the bottom as well

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.209 
here and then it's on the bottom as well
both<00:00:58.969> on<00:00:59.000> the<00:00:59.360> solid<00:00:59.960> rubber<00:01:00.140> and<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:00.739> file<00:01:01.010> on

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
both on the solid rubber and the file on

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.490 
both on the solid rubber and the file on
hip<00:01:01.510> along<00:01:02.510> with<00:01:02.660> the<00:01:02.750> midsole<00:01:03.079> I<00:01:03.140> think<00:01:03.380> it's

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
hip along with the midsole I think it's

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.910 
hip along with the midsole I think it's
just<00:01:03.649> a<00:01:03.739> really<00:01:03.950> clean<00:01:04.189> look<00:01:05.770> nothing<00:01:06.770> really

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
just a really clean look nothing really

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.740 
just a really clean look nothing really
to<00:01:07.100> go<00:01:07.220> over<00:01:07.490> I<00:01:07.760> think<00:01:07.970> that<00:01:08.090> laces<00:01:08.479> are<00:01:08.630> in

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
to go over I think that laces are in

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.039 
to go over I think that laces are in
here

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
here

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.350 
here
they<00:01:12.049> came<00:01:12.260> a<00:01:12.290> darker<00:01:12.950> green<00:01:13.130> laces<00:01:13.400> which<00:01:14.000> I

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
they came a darker green laces which I

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.230 
they came a darker green laces which I
thought<00:01:14.600> was<00:01:14.720> kind<00:01:14.990> of<00:01:15.080> random<00:01:15.200> I<00:01:15.620> thought

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
thought was kind of random I thought

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.520 
thought was kind of random I thought
like<00:01:17.240> I<00:01:17.360> know<00:01:17.420> why<00:01:17.659> they<00:01:17.900> came<00:01:18.080> with<00:01:18.260> them<00:01:18.380> but

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
like I know why they came with them but

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.830 
like I know why they came with them but
I<00:01:18.590> think<00:01:18.799> that<00:01:18.950> like<00:01:19.130> a<00:01:19.159> gold<00:01:19.430> lace<00:01:19.790> or<00:01:20.150> a<00:01:20.210> white

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
I think that like a gold lace or a white

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.740 
I think that like a gold lace or a white
lace<00:01:21.049> would<00:01:21.290> have<00:01:21.409> been<00:01:21.650> a<00:01:21.979> little<00:01:22.250> bit<00:01:22.369> nicer

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
lace would have been a little bit nicer

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.320 
lace would have been a little bit nicer
but<00:01:23.750> I<00:01:23.780> do<00:01:23.900> have<00:01:24.400> white<00:01:25.400> laces<00:01:25.670> like

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
but I do have white laces like

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.789 
but I do have white laces like
additional<00:01:26.840> white<00:01:26.960> laces<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:27.440> it's<00:01:27.530> not<00:01:27.590> a<00:01:27.650> big

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
additional white laces so it's not a big

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.740 
additional white laces so it's not a big
deal<00:01:27.950> I<00:01:28.010> can<00:01:28.250> try<00:01:28.460> that<00:01:28.670> see<00:01:29.360> how<00:01:29.420> it<00:01:29.570> looks

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
deal I can try that see how it looks

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.260 
deal I can try that see how it looks
later<00:01:30.490> but<00:01:31.490> here<00:01:31.670> is<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.470> tongue<00:01:33.470> patch<00:01:34.270> lower

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
later but here is the tongue patch lower

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.469 
later but here is the tongue patch lower
focus<00:01:35.630> there<00:01:36.260> it<00:01:36.350> goes<00:01:36.560> I<00:01:36.950> just<00:01:37.939> really<00:01:38.330> like

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
these I don't know why I just I don't

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.100 
these I don't know why I just I don't
even<00:01:40.400> like<00:01:40.640> green<00:01:40.970> but<00:01:41.210> this<00:01:41.450> colorway<00:01:41.840> just

on a shoe but you know I'm just gonna
wear<00:02:18.409> these<00:02:18.560> casually<00:02:19.099> I'm<00:02:19.189> not<00:02:19.340> gonna<00:02:19.489> do

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
wear these casually I'm not gonna do

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.940 
wear these casually I'm not gonna do
anything<00:02:19.909> crazy<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:20.780> so<00:02:20.930> it's<00:02:21.110> not<00:02:21.290> a<00:02:21.319> you

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
anything crazy and so it's not a you

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.050 
anything crazy and so it's not a you
know<00:02:21.980> huge<00:02:22.370> deal<00:02:22.579> for<00:02:22.760> me

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
know huge deal for me

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.030 
know huge deal for me
plus<00:02:23.780> they're<00:02:23.959> not<00:02:24.079> really<00:02:24.319> expensive<00:02:24.890> either

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
plus they're not really expensive either

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.860 
plus they're not really expensive either
they're<00:02:25.310> under<00:02:25.549> $100<00:02:26.209> so<00:02:26.450> I<00:02:26.480> think<00:02:26.629> that

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
they're under $100 so I think that

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.119 
they're under $100 so I think that
that's<00:02:26.959> fine

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
that's fine

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.130 
that's fine
one<00:02:28.970> thing<00:02:29.120> that<00:02:29.239> I<00:02:29.269> do<00:02:29.360> think<00:02:29.629> is<00:02:29.720> cool<00:02:29.930> though

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
one thing that I do think is cool though

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.349 
one thing that I do think is cool though
is<00:02:30.170> that<00:02:30.379> the<00:02:30.590> synthetic<00:02:31.090> overlay<00:02:32.090> that<00:02:32.209> they

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:32.359 
is that the synthetic overlay that they

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:34.720 
is that the synthetic overlay that they
have<00:02:32.510> here<00:02:32.720> on<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.930> swoosh<00:02:33.549> actually<00:02:34.549> has

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
have here on the swoosh actually has

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.250 
have here on the swoosh actually has
yellow<00:02:35.090> behind<00:02:35.450> it<00:02:35.599> which<00:02:35.840> is<00:02:35.959> kind<00:02:36.170> of

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
yellow behind it which is kind of

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.569 
yellow behind it which is kind of
interesting<00:02:36.709> it's<00:02:36.859> got<00:02:37.010> a<00:02:37.040> weird<00:02:37.250> kind<00:02:37.489> of

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
interesting it's got a weird kind of

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:38.890 
interesting it's got a weird kind of
contrast<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.239> it<00:02:38.359> I<00:02:38.420> think<00:02:38.599> it<00:02:38.659> looks<00:02:38.810> pretty

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
contrast to it I think it looks pretty

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.280 
contrast to it I think it looks pretty
cool<00:02:39.340> so<00:02:40.340> but<00:02:40.970> yeah<00:02:41.060> nothing<00:02:41.480> on<00:02:41.659> this<00:02:41.870> shoe<00:02:42.079> is

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
cool so but yeah nothing on this shoe is

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.539 
cool so but yeah nothing on this shoe is
actually<00:02:42.709> like<00:02:42.970> premium<00:02:43.970> quality<00:02:44.209> whatsoever

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
actually like premium quality whatsoever

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.680 
actually like premium quality whatsoever

yeah<00:03:38.239> I<00:03:38.269> think<00:03:38.389> that<00:03:38.629> dunks<00:03:39.019> are<00:03:39.139> just<00:03:39.319> a

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
yeah I think that dunks are just a

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:40.899 
yeah I think that dunks are just a
classic<00:03:39.799> silhouette<00:03:39.980> you<00:03:40.250> can't<00:03:40.579> really<00:03:40.730> go

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:40.909 
classic silhouette you can't really go

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:44.080 
classic silhouette you can't really go
wrong<00:03:40.940> with<00:03:41.359> them<00:03:42.430> it's<00:03:43.430> one<00:03:43.579> of<00:03:43.669> those<00:03:43.729> shoes

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
wrong with them it's one of those shoes

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.119 
wrong with them it's one of those shoes
that's<00:03:44.449> pretty<00:03:45.109> much<00:03:45.229> iconic<00:03:45.739> like<00:03:45.919> it'll

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
that's pretty much iconic like it'll

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:47.920 
that's pretty much iconic like it'll
never<00:03:46.280> go<00:03:46.489> out<00:03:46.609> of<00:03:46.639> style<00:03:46.760> it's<00:03:47.569> like<00:03:47.629> a<00:03:47.720> Air

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
never go out of style it's like a Air

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.619 
never go out of style it's like a Air
Force<00:03:48.169> one<00:03:48.669> it's<00:03:49.669> just<00:03:49.849> really<00:03:50.030> really<00:03:50.359> clean

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
Force one it's just really really clean

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.680 
Force one it's just really really clean
so<00:03:51.310> in<00:03:52.310> that<00:03:52.430> sense<00:03:52.760> you<00:03:53.209> know<00:03:53.299> I<00:03:53.359> think<00:03:53.449> that

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
so in that sense you know I think that

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.189 
so in that sense you know I think that
these<00:03:53.780> are<00:03:53.840> dope<00:03:54.139> but<00:03:55.479> as<00:03:56.479> far<00:03:56.659> as<00:03:56.720> like<00:03:56.900> actual

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:57.199 
these are dope but as far as like actual

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:58.689 
these are dope but as far as like actual
quality<00:03:57.709> goes<00:03:57.859> if<00:03:58.010> you're<00:03:58.099> gonna<00:03:58.220> compare

00:03:58.689 --> 00:03:58.699 
quality goes if you're gonna compare

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:00.879 
quality goes if you're gonna compare
quality<00:03:59.180> to<00:03:59.359> things<00:04:00.019> like<00:04:00.290> it's<00:04:00.470> not<00:04:00.650> there

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
quality to things like it's not there

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:03.039 
quality to things like it's not there
like<00:04:01.370> sorry<00:04:01.639> to<00:04:01.909> tell<00:04:02.060> you<00:04:02.239> but<00:04:02.419> the<00:04:02.840> leather

like sorry to tell you but the leather

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.759 
like sorry to tell you but the leather
is<00:04:03.319> is<00:04:04.220> just<00:04:05.000> as<00:04:05.180> crappy<00:04:05.599> here<00:04:05.900> as<00:04:06.139> it<00:04:06.319> is<00:04:06.440> on

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
is is just as crappy here as it is on

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.680 
is is just as crappy here as it is on
most<00:04:07.669> Nike<00:04:08.449> retro<00:04:08.840> releases<00:04:09.609> and<00:04:10.690> it's

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
most Nike retro releases and it's

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.439 
most Nike retro releases and it's
actually<00:04:12.079> crappier<00:04:12.560> than<00:04:12.849> quite<00:04:13.849> a<00:04:13.879> few<00:04:14.180> of

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:14.449 
actually crappier than quite a few of

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:17.699 
actually crappier than quite a few of
the<00:04:14.690> Jordan<00:04:15.349> Brand<00:04:15.470> releases<00:04:15.949> in<00:04:16.220> my<00:04:16.489> opinion

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
the Jordan Brand releases in my opinion

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.719 
the Jordan Brand releases in my opinion
actually<00:04:18.709> it's<00:04:18.829> not<00:04:18.919> really<00:04:19.190> opinion<00:04:19.579> it's

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
actually it's not really opinion it's

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.759 
actually it's not really opinion it's
actually<00:04:20.090> fact<00:04:20.359> like<00:04:20.599> you<00:04:20.720> can<00:04:20.870> see<00:04:21.079> it<00:04:21.229> the

here<00:04:41.199> naturally<00:04:42.199> and<00:04:42.469> I<00:04:42.530> mean<00:04:42.740> like<00:04:42.860> they<00:04:43.009> have

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:43.099 
here naturally and I mean like they have

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:45.279 
here naturally and I mean like they have
to<00:04:43.219> cut<00:04:43.430> it<00:04:43.580> in<00:04:43.669> two<00:04:43.789> layers<00:04:44.000> and<00:04:44.330> they<00:04:44.960> spread

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
to cut it in two layers and they spread

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.670 
to cut it in two layers and they spread
that<00:04:45.500> layer<00:04:45.770> out<00:04:46.129> amongst<00:04:47.530> thousands<00:04:48.530> of

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
that layer out amongst thousands of

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.029 
that layer out amongst thousands of
shoes<00:04:48.889> not<00:04:49.370> thousands<00:04:49.789> but<00:04:49.819> hundreds<00:04:51.039> whereas

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
shoes not thousands but hundreds whereas

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.029 
shoes not thousands but hundreds whereas
like<00:04:52.370> these<00:04:52.699> like<00:04:53.599> if<00:04:53.870> it<00:04:54.020> was<00:04:54.110> like<00:04:54.229> a<00:04:54.289> thicker

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
like these like if it was like a thicker

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:57.029 
like these like if it was like a thicker
grain<00:04:55.430> like<00:04:55.639> what's<00:04:55.819> on<00:04:55.939> the<00:04:56.030> Jordan<00:04:56.330> six

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
grain like what's on the Jordan six

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.700 
grain like what's on the Jordan six
retro<00:04:58.039> Olympic<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:58.669> most<00:04:59.000> recent<00:04:59.360> one<00:04:59.710> like

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
retro Olympic the most recent one like

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.350 
retro Olympic the most recent one like
that's<00:05:00.889> like<00:05:01.039> a<00:05:01.099> nice<00:05:01.370> thick<00:05:01.729> kind<00:05:02.060> of<00:05:02.150> grain

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
that's like a nice thick kind of grain

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.350 
that's like a nice thick kind of grain
leather<00:05:02.599> so<00:05:03.250> that's<00:05:04.250> closer<00:05:04.550> to<00:05:04.729> a<00:05:04.819> full<00:05:05.090> grain

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
leather so that's closer to a full grain

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.320 
leather so that's closer to a full grain
than<00:05:05.539> this<00:05:05.690> but<00:05:06.440> um<00:05:06.680> yeah<00:05:07.550> other<00:05:07.940> than<00:05:08.030> that<00:05:08.300> I
