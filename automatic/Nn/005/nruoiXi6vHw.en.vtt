on a different system did I yeah I mean
it<00:02:14.390> was<00:02:14.480> different<00:02:14.690> to<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.050> internal<00:02:15.440> one

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.840 

okay<00:02:29.150> but<00:02:29.709> most<00:02:30.709> the<00:02:30.860> time<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.400> ain't<00:02:31.580> got<00:02:31.700> any

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
okay but most the time you ain't got any

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.320 
okay but most the time you ain't got any
Sun<00:02:32.150> without<00:02:32.630> so<00:02:33.110> fecking<00:02:33.380> ever<00:02:34.000> might<00:02:35.000> be<00:02:35.300> a

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
Sun without so fecking ever might be a

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.860 
Sun without so fecking ever might be a
voiceover<00:02:35.989> jobby<00:02:37.300> with<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.420> base<00:02:38.600> of<00:02:38.780> you

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
voiceover jobby with the base of you

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.440 
voiceover jobby with the base of you
that<00:02:39.020> aren't<00:02:39.290> on<00:02:39.650> screen<00:02:42.520> single<00:02:43.520> tear

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
that aren't on screen single tear

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.430 
that aren't on screen single tear
single<00:02:45.319> tear<00:02:45.560> falling<00:02:45.980> down<00:02:49.209> I<00:02:50.379> think<00:02:51.379> I

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
single tear falling down I think I

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.390 
single tear falling down I think I
should<00:02:51.500> probably<00:02:51.709> get<00:02:51.980> you<00:02:52.099> on<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.220> security

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
should probably get you on the security

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:03.190 
should probably get you on the security
team<00:02:53.030> now<00:02:54.220> where's<00:02:55.220> Pizza<00:02:55.550> i<00:03:01.959> think<00:03:02.959> is<00:03:03.050> not

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
team now where's Pizza i think is not

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.610 
team now where's Pizza i think is not
one<00:03:03.470> solution<00:03:03.800> to<00:03:04.130> it<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:04.640> should<00:03:05.510> go<00:03:05.660> up<00:03:05.840> hi

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
one solution to it I should go up hi

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.530 
one solution to it I should go up hi
Pierre<00:03:06.950> yeah<00:03:07.130> it's<00:03:07.370> Emma<00:03:07.580> here<00:03:07.790> basically<00:03:08.030> I

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
Pierre yeah it's Emma here basically I

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.979 
Pierre yeah it's Emma here basically I
completely<00:03:09.260> an<00:03:09.590> utterly<00:03:09.830> messed<00:03:10.160> up

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
completely an utterly messed up

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.690 
completely an utterly messed up
basically<00:03:11.989> all<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.650> recording<00:03:13.040> we<00:03:13.099> did<00:03:13.280> we

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
basically all the recording we did we

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.030 
basically all the recording we did we
did<00:03:13.910> with<00:03:14.030> no<00:03:14.180> sound<00:03:14.450> so<00:03:14.900> I'm<00:03:15.110> just<00:03:15.349> I'm

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
did with no sound so I'm just I'm

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.190 
did with no sound so I'm just I'm
basically<00:03:16.580> going<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:16.880> go<00:03:17.030> in<00:03:17.209> tell<00:03:17.959> them<00:03:18.170> not

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
basically going to go in tell them not

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.050 
basically going to go in tell them not
to<00:03:18.590> change<00:03:18.860> me<00:03:19.130> off<00:03:19.220> security<00:03:19.459> I<00:03:19.700> think<00:03:19.940> it's

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
to change me off security I think it's

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.670 
to change me off security I think it's
probably<00:03:20.269> best<00:03:20.599> if<00:03:20.750> I<00:03:20.870> join<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:21.170> security

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
probably best if I join the security

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.890 
probably best if I join the security
team<00:03:21.890> so<00:03:22.730> I'm<00:03:22.790> going<00:03:22.970> to<00:03:23.000> go<00:03:23.150> get<00:03:23.329> my<00:03:23.510> stuff<00:03:23.569> and
