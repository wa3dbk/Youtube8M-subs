00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.720
 all welcome to a new ministerial 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:10.240
 and I sing following the theme of the skin of 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.790
 the themes to customize your computer 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.879
 with the windows operating system in this 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.310
 case windows 7 as you will have noticed 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.950
 in other videos we have uploaded themes for 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.290
 customize to customize your 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.560
 computer with the android theme another with 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:30.550
 the windows phone7 other with the game of 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.590
 angry birds and this time touches the skin a 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.740
 pack so you can customize 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:40.090
 your computer with the operating system of 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:43.330
 iPod or their iphone and it's very 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:46.600
 easy here they have the two files for 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:49.840
 the 32-bit operating system and another 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.910
 to 64 choose the one that is 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.360
 compatible with your operating system in 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:58.300
 this case I am using a system 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.760
 operative windows 7 in a premiere with the 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:05.970
 32 bit version so I'm going to 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:09.900
 install the 86's and it's very simple 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.480
 you only click on it you follow the 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.790
 installation assistant the same happens 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.409
 with the other 64 file in case 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.590
 have the operating system with 64 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.259
 We put next we accept what 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.350
 we continue with next and here we will 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.270
 show the files as they are going 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.530
 to change the visual style of the 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:37.040
 dron wallpaper cursors widget 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.310
 ousted from the menu skin 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.170
 all the tabular and all the files 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.980
 everything that leads to changing the way 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.700
 as if it were an iphone or an ipad or a 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:53.130
 they installed it we hope that it 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.579
 do the installation 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:01.039
 but that takes a little bit so if we see 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.039
 that he delays because we cause and continue 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.740
 installation 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.880
 but it looks like it's going to be faster 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.390
 we're going to wait 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.200
 once it's over, he's going to ask you to 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.560
 restart the computer 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.020
 or leave it for later 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.940
 we are going to restart the computer 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.220
 so that the experts are done and they will see 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.640
 that is going to change everything practically 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:31.160
 all the taskbar icons the 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.140
 folders all files 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.880
 with this one that I have removed and will know 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.610
 what they are used to 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.400
 work with the operating system with the 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.030
 operating system and they are going to have 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.690
 to see how it will look like or equal 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.970
 what they have in their smartphone lopez 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.970
 does not ask to see us restart 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.640
 let's tell you later to be able 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.520

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.680

 the operating system restarts not 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.350
 we could record it then I made a 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.090
 capture as you can see here start of 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.370
 screen should normally start like this 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.490
 when you start on it once and have 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:11.130
 installed the skin or the pack or the theme 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.080
 to customize the first window 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.180
 when the computer restarts we go to 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.870
