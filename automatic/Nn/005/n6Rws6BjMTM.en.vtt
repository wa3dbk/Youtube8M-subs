 we are at the institute of aromatic and medicinal plants since the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.980
 road 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.430
 we have different activities 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.200
 around this house of the highest for the valuation of these plants we 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.430
 have outdoor hikes 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.090
 with a facilitator 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.360
 philippe pear tree 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.360
 so these hikes take place all year round 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.140
 to break a stable that sega these envelopes 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.750
 this relates to the subsidiary company this do 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.620
 we have a garden of scents we have the hang of two varieties of 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.590
 aromatic and medicinal plants 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.080
 and then we usually do and tasting herbal teas we make 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.480
 soap workshops 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.250
 in europe few things as interactive 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.030
 for especially for children 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.640
 we visited the museum it's a visit on one on three floors 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.530
 brings a lot of knowledge about lavender crafts and all plants 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.530
 aromatic and medicinal thyme rosemary and xterra 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.600
 aromatic and medicinal plants are so entered the territory 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.330
 which forged reason is forged by climate culture the landscape in 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.330
 actually they are linked to 7% to this series at night 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.549
 at all levels so obviously when we talk about plants we talk about 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.079
 history we talk about culture the road we talk about production in 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.909
 europe and elsewhere and we talk about the news finally we talk about the title of 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.480
 present and future 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.480
 the territory and the environment 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:23.499
 worst
