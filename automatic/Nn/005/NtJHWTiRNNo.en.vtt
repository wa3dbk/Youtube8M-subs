00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
events we don't know what attribute is

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.860 
events we don't know what attribute is
I'm<00:00:44.550> going<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.789> assume<00:00:44.969> dark<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.539> mean<00:00:45.750> that

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
I'm going to assume dark I mean that

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.170 
I'm going to assume dark I mean that
just<00:00:45.989> kind<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.260> makes<00:00:46.590> sense<00:00:46.770> really<00:00:47.180> let's

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
just kind of makes sense really let's

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.700 
just kind of makes sense really let's
see<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.510> requires<00:00:48.809> 12<00:00:49.170> or<00:00:49.350> one<00:00:49.500> or<00:00:49.530> more

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
see it requires 12 or one or more

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.160 
see it requires 12 or one or more
non-tuner<00:00:50.070> monsters<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:50.940> generic<00:00:51.420> also

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
non-tuner monsters so it is generic also

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.990 
non-tuner monsters so it is generic also
here's<00:00:52.590> its<00:00:52.770> effect<00:00:53.010> when<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.250> take<00:00:53.430> 400<00:00:53.910> or

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530

it's it's gonna have to be nerfed a
little<00:01:32.640> bit<00:01:32.729> because<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:33.150> actually<00:01:33.630> pretty

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
little bit because it's actually pretty

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.660 
little bit because it's actually pretty
broken<00:01:34.140> at<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.409> moment<00:01:34.500> though<00:01:34.950> being<00:01:35.460> able

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
broken at the moment though being able

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.940 
broken at the moment though being able
to<00:01:35.729> send<00:01:35.880> any<00:01:36.060> card<00:01:36.479> like<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.619> could

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
to send any card like that that could

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.280 
to send any card like that that could
lead<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.340> lot<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.579> scary<00:01:39.290> different

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
lead to a lot of scary different

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.450 
lead to a lot of scary different
strategies<00:01:40.680> right<00:01:40.920> there<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.159> mean<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.369> can

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
strategies right there I mean you can

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.950 
strategies right there I mean you can
send<00:01:41.640> cards<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.119> want<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.509> get<00:01:42.630> too<00:01:42.750> good

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
send cards that you want to get too good

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.990 
send cards that you want to get too good
for<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.140> easily<00:01:43.530> for<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.579> know<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.850> all

for it easily for you know just all
kinds<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.299> three<00:01:45.450> strange<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.780> mean<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.409> too

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
kinds of three strange I mean it's too

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.130 
kinds of three strange I mean it's too
many<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.950> name<00:01:46.979> honestly<00:01:47.909> how<00:01:48.390> easily<00:01:48.780> you

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
many to name honestly how easily you

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.870 
many to name honestly how easily you
could<00:01:49.290> do<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:50.460> yeah<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.640> would

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
could do that so yeah you would

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.429 
could do that so yeah you would
basically<00:01:51.060> want<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.720> take<00:01:51.869> damage<00:01:52.110> not<00:01:52.380> only

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
basically want to take damage not only

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.980 
basically want to take damage not only
that<00:01:52.740> too<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.729> also<00:01:54.000> get<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.509> gain<00:01:54.720> attack

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
that too you also get to gain attack

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.630 
that too you also get to gain attack
which<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.439> pretty<00:01:55.680> awesome<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:56.189> see<00:01:56.399> that

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
which is pretty awesome I see that

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.310 
which is pretty awesome I see that
effect<00:01:57.180> remaining<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.869> other<00:01:58.020> one<00:01:58.140> being

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
effect remaining and the other one being

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.899 
effect remaining and the other one being
like<00:01:58.530> maybe<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.100> top<00:01:59.310> card<00:01:59.549> from<00:01:59.759> your<00:01:59.850> deck

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
like maybe the top card from your deck

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.370 
like maybe the top card from your deck
or<00:02:00.390> something<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.840> what<00:02:00.990> they<00:02:01.079> would<00:02:01.229> change

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
or something is what they would change

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.859 
or something is what they would change
it<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.799> would<00:02:02.430> be<00:02:02.579> probably<00:02:03.090> my<00:02:03.299> best<00:02:03.450> gifts

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
it to would be probably my best gifts

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.450 
it to would be probably my best gifts
but<00:02:04.619> yeah<00:02:04.710> what<00:02:04.920> do<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.009> guys<00:02:05.100> think<00:02:05.159> about

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
but yeah what do you guys think about

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.679 
but yeah what do you guys think about
this<00:02:05.640> dragon<00:02:06.060> do<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.210> think<00:02:06.390> it's<00:02:06.509> better

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
this dragon do you think it's better

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.290 
this dragon do you think it's better
than<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.170> five<00:02:07.530> DS<00:02:07.710> version<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.970> dragon

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
than the five DS version of the dragon

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.750 
than the five DS version of the dragon
that<00:02:09.420> we<00:02:09.509> got<00:02:09.690> in<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.989> anime<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:11.310> actually

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
that we got in the anime I actually

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.040 
that we got in the anime I actually
think<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.239> is

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
think it is

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.470 
think it is
like<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:14.100> like<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.550> older<00:02:14.790> version<00:02:14.820> dragons

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
like I like the older version dragons

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.210 
like I like the older version dragons
but<00:02:15.630> this<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:16.020> another<00:02:16.500> dull<00:02:16.740> dragon<00:02:17.100> that

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
but this is another dull dragon that

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.990 
but this is another dull dragon that
seems<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.580> be<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.700> little<00:02:18.030> bit<00:02:18.150> better<00:02:18.390> than<00:02:18.930> its

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
seems to be a little bit better than its

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.660 
seems to be a little bit better than its
original<00:02:21.000> counterpart<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.600> guess<00:02:21.780> really<00:02:22.080> i

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
original counterpart I guess really i

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.700 
original counterpart I guess really i
think<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:24.000> card<00:02:24.300> especially<00:02:25.020> if<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.260> has<00:02:25.290> if

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
think this card especially if it has if

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.170 
think this card especially if it has if
it<00:02:25.800> has<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.040> same<00:02:26.250> effect<00:02:26.430> it's<00:02:26.820> going<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.060> be

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
it has the same effect it's going to be

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.460 
it has the same effect it's going to be
used<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.510> lot<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.840> it's<00:02:27.930> gonna<00:02:28.050> be<00:02:28.170> freaking

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
used a lot and it's gonna be freaking

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.080 
used a lot and it's gonna be freaking
scary<00:02:28.800> i<00:02:28.890> really<00:02:29.430> do<00:02:29.550> think<00:02:29.580> though<00:02:29.940> they're

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
scary i really do think though they're

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.700 
scary i really do think though they're
going<00:02:30.210> to<00:02:30.270> have<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.450> nerf<00:02:30.660> its<00:02:30.870> effect<00:02:31.170> have<00:02:31.590> to

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
going to have to nerf its effect have to

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.890 
going to have to nerf its effect have to
do<00:02:31.830> something<00:02:32.130> like<00:02:33.120> i<00:02:33.240> said<00:02:33.390> maybe<00:02:33.540> instead

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
do something like i said maybe instead

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.270 
do something like i said maybe instead
of<00:02:33.960> you<00:02:34.140> know<00:02:34.170> they<00:02:34.350> just<00:02:34.470> send<00:02:34.710> a<00:02:34.830> card<00:02:35.040> it'd

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
of you know they just send a card it'd

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.070 
of you know they just send a card it'd
be<00:02:35.430> like<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.700> top<00:02:35.880> card<00:02:36.120> every<00:02:36.330> day<00:02:36.480> or<00:02:36.900> some

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
be like the top card every day or some

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.680 
be like the top card every day or some
that<00:02:37.230> way<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.350> can't<00:02:37.590> choose<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.070> cards<00:02:38.430> and

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
that way you can't choose the cards and

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.790 
that way you can't choose the cards and
even<00:02:39.690> with<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:39.990> i<00:02:40.230> think<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.560> still<00:02:40.680> has<00:02:40.770> a

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
even with that i think it still has a

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.620 
even with that i think it still has a
pretty<00:02:41.040> awesome<00:02:41.220> effect<00:02:41.670> see<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.180> tell<00:02:42.420> me<00:02:42.480> what

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630

you guys say about this card if it had

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.370 
you guys say about this card if it had
its<00:02:44.340> end<00:02:44.820> may<00:02:44.940> affect<00:02:45.270> right<00:02:45.570> now<00:02:45.780> or<00:02:46.170> the

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
its end may affect right now or the

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.350 
its end may affect right now or the
effect<00:02:46.440> like<00:02:46.710> I<00:02:46.830> said<00:02:47.070> like<00:02:47.100> if<00:02:47.490> it<00:02:47.640> would<00:02:47.970> just

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
effect like I said like if it would just

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.700 
effect like I said like if it would just
be<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.570> top<00:02:48.810> card<00:02:48.990> deck<00:02:49.200> would<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.530> use<00:02:49.620> this
