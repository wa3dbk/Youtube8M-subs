00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.240
 very good I am imp and today I bring you 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.609
 a new trick in gta 5 online in the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.680
 update 110 and it's to be done 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.140
 completely invisible both the 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.760
 character as in the radar we need 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.680
 the help of a partner and whoever wants 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.570
 do the trick will enter with a car to 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.640
 the saints just and without repairing or anything 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.619
 comes out and when our partner does not 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.170
 blinking has to hit us 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.260
 It's worth just blinking 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.239
 collide as you see we hit him equal to ya 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.309
 it does not appear on the minimap nor do we see it 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.829
 him or his vehicle is worth 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.260
 completely invisible is a very trick 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.090
 very easy and the truth is you get some 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.340
 good laughs because you can troll 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.350
 everyone not and good with this trick 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.660
 I would like it to burst is the button 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.180
 likes because he deserves it and also me 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.590
 motivates aissami to upload these tricks 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.750
 OK 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.790
 Now I'm going to explain a couple of things 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.910
 about this trick so you do not have 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.250
 problems if it does not come out it's worth to us with 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.710
 our luxury vehicles did not come out 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.930
 We do not know why but when we went out 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.940
 from the garage the cinematic was born then 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.820
 We could not do the trick if it happens to you 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.890
 that you take a car from the street and what 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.530
 do with a street car and with a 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.360
 Street car or it will work 100% 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.670
 sure if it does not work is because you 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.369
 you do it badly it is practical and fair 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.530
 it comes out blinks and you choc eyes and 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.460
 have to go out and practice a bit because 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.649
 with practice it is made very safe and good 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.470
 I will say the other fault of this trick 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.110
 when we do the trick well we will be the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.910
 invisible character the minimap not 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.740
 we will leave and our vehicle too 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.990
 will be invisible then with the vehicle 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.789
 that we do the trick we get down and we 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.830
 let's ride in that vehicle it will always be 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.350
 invisible but if we change vehicles 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.680
 the new vehicle that we take will not be 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.690
 invisible will be visible to others 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.910
 then they will see the car as if it will walk 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.229
 only because nobody shows up inside 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.310
 they see us invisible as in the 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.979
 mini map 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.349
 the car just for them I'm telling you for 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.870
 that you know it and also know that it is 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.000
 another way of trolling the vouchers that 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.680
 say host like the car is walking alone 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.569
 not as you are seeing inside the 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.430
 vehicle does not appear nobody but yes that 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.650
 is really true and well I would like 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.300
 that you all say to likes because this 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.450
 It's a great trick that deserves it and 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.640
 It's super easy on top, you know that 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.530
 Like is free, it does not bite or make 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.930
 nothing and if it does something really that does not 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.030
 it hurts you put a band-aid and it is not 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.580
 and good I leave you with the end of the video 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.230
 I hope you liked to like it 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.880
 comment appears of any doubt in 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.890
 the comments if you are not subscribed 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.290
 subscribe because you are not going to 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.580
 regret a greeting and until the next 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.580
 goodbye video
