00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
once again Malaysian I've never had

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
I guess it was a little bit shiny in the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.040 
I guess it was a little bit shiny in the
beginning<00:00:50.489> like<00:00:50.520> they<00:00:50.879> get<00:00:51.059> upset<00:00:51.300> interviews

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
beginning like they get upset interviews

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.500 
beginning like they get upset interviews
and<00:00:52.199> stuff<00:00:52.320> like<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:52.920> once<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.449> start

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
and stuff like that but once you start

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.650 
and stuff like that but once you start
to<00:00:54.719> wash<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.350> actually<00:00:55.739> um<00:00:56.360> do<00:00:57.360> things

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
to wash it and actually um do things

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.299 
to wash it and actually um do things
with<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:57.899> like<00:00:58.140> straighten<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:59.219> know

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
with it like straighten and you know

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.369 
with it like straighten and you know
what<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.300> regularly<00:01:00.570> do<00:01:00.690> with<00:01:00.840> hair<00:01:01.079> it

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
what you regularly do with hair it

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.590 
what you regularly do with hair it
