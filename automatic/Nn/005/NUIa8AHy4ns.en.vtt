00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 now they do not tell me again 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.210
 roof the election day in september moves 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.849
 closer and always for them 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.349
 depressing expectant polls 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:12.630
 try spd and green always 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.299
 desperate a change of mood in the 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.000
 to make people's choice by one like that 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.470
 said shoulder conclusion 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.510
 shouldering means the rows will be 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.460
 so firmly closed that no one else 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.550
 a chance has to get through it 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.650
 in the best case , the rows looks like this 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.380
 firmly closed that you can not even 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.410
 can see more of where would the way when 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.630
 one the continuous but closed 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.700
 rows are more important to the voter than to 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.460
 know what lies behind the knowledge 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.579
 also the green ones but the green ones want 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.989
 of course, prove that they 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.420
 are happy to talk without being in 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.379
 to argue 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.440
 That's why there was a green party day 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.949
 At the weekend of 2006, there were 100 amendments 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.960
 to be decided on the election program and 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.899
 then there was accordingly violent 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.180
 let's talk about it 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.790
 that a party day lasts two days 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.729
 and the generated actually every 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.049
 day twelve hours days then we may 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.979
 certainly another two hours a day 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.630
 pull it off 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.909
 for the out of holding slogans 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.590
 Closed doors and if possible 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.659
 original insults of 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.880
 political opponent's existing talk 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.009
 the big-headed one, if we go now 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.930
 generously neglect the time 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.540
 for the polls themselves and various 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.170
 procedural rules are left so 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.290
 20 hours for the discussion before 2600 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.530
 amendments for everyone 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.770
 amendment is just under 28 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.560
 seconds of discussion time available 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.960
 only for comparison in time the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.780
 they had listened to me so far 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.350
 We discuss three amendments 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.170
 have to 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.600
 such a thing is of course rubbish with sauce 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.579
 and also know the green, the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.799
 Amendments are therefore also in 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.399
 The rarest fall to something there 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.950
 to change 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.920
 they simulate a democratic one 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.079
 Discussion culture and the professionals 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.890
 among the greens, even those simulate 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.580
 amendments before the party day 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.900
 profiled the green 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.690
 Prime Minister Winfried Kretschmann 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.569
 with fierce criticism of the tax plans 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.760
 in the election program of his party one 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.720
 But this amendment was not 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.980
 first submitted 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.180
 no, he only blocked statesmanship 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.670
 judgment on the burden on the citizens 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.920
 demanded then with all others 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.440
 to vote unanimously for what he did 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.290
 previously criticized and I have the 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.010
 headline misses green star calls 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.940
 augenmaÃŸ 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.730
