00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello everyone thanks for watching our 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.010
 evans channel and if here on youtube 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.490
 today we are going to teach you how you 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.280
 can determine the polarity of the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.859
 your car horns here my husband what 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.160
 what is doing is removing some 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.660
 speakers that come with the car 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.300
 originally when they do not buy it the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.580
 killer and here he is seeing everything that 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.510
 is doing is right now what is going to 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.349
 do is cut these cables that are 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.500
 here 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:39.820
 here he teaches them and he's going to peel them 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.339
 that you can determine and teach them to 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.100
 you that the side is negative and that the 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:47.620
 side is being positive and what is 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.110
 doing is that with this battery they're going 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.990
 to teach here one and the other side 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.850
 and when the kitchen itself starts to 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.760
 move like they are seeing here in the 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:04.229
 video and it starts to be a pop 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:08.909
 means that you connected this this 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.100
 cook the right way then there 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.040
 you can already determine that the side is 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.580
 positive and that the side is negative in 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.860
 this is the example we are teaching 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.320
 here the blue side has been the 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.930
 positive and here we are teaching you to 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.869
 you the new speakers that are 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.510
 aftermarket which is a facility that 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:36.570
 you are going to make this car look here 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:39.210
 The good thing about these is that they are coming 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.830
 with the instructions of what is the side 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.050
 positive what is the negative side 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.440
 so so it makes them all a lot 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.000
 easier and also teaches that the side 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.880
 it's for twitter that the side is for 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.700
 the kitchen so they are made much more 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.380
 easy also to you then here already 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.780
 all connections are put how is 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.880
 teaching my husband and thank you very much to 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.490
 my husband for this precious video many 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.100
 thank you because I know that this video 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.170
 will teach those who want 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.149
 put horns in your car or want 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.070
 know secrets how to determine what is 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.959
 negative which is positive 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.770
 this will facilitate for you a 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:19.170
 good heap here is teaching you 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:22.470
 after he put the crossover on 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.680
 positive and the negative and so that 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.900
 you see here 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.409
 is connecting it again to the speaker 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.799
 and look like this new horn that is 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:36.079
 after market sand jump look at this 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.790
 pop up down then 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:41.810
 that means everything is connected 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.030
 fine and now that it's just secured 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.819
 that everything is connected well and he did 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.409
 more to teach you how 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.750
 verify that everything is connected 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:55.909
 well he comes and will end this 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:58.099
 installation and here you see that little box 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:02.389
 the one that is being the crossover he does not 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:06.200
 he leaves it alone like this and we always go up 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:09.379
 this is placed as well as he 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.790
 is teaching here so that when the 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.530
 person go driving do not go 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.689
 listening there a pac pac pac of the 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.780
 box moves from the side of a 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:20.180
 side by side and we do not want the 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.430
 connections are damaged then that's another 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.560
 which you should have in 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.069
 mind that they want everything to be in their 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.959
 place and keep it stable 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.810
 during the time that people walk 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.189
 driving the car clear good we hope 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.010
