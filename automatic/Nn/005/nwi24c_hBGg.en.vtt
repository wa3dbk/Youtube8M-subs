00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.230
 listen 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.690
 I think 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.550
 use the resources 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.310
 we started really we are 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:36.880
 A type plastic bag or waxed paper 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.360
 with plastic 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.640
 and we are going to use an anti-Cuban syrup 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.500
 maybe they do not come prepared 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.500
 you have to know the big known 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.080
 and suppliers but good the point is 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.080
 this 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.309
 some texts an example completed 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.039
 we always write on a surface 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.670
 flat this time I'm going to do it in 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.670
 a blank sheet 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.710
 obvious I am 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.659
 in fact I will use 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.659
 by far let's say it with the right hand 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.720
 and so that the letters look better 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.920
 understandable 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.170
 and legible let's say 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.790
 we use the right hand as the 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.649
 positive and the left as support for 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.250
 describe happy birthday we are going to 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:34.119
 to live it this way all this is from 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.119
 33 italic 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.159
 if they are fixed 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:01.270
 the fist you should use it to squeeze 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:04.659
 correctly without oppressing in some 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.210
 moment to write the strongest the most 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.550
 slowly trying to make 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.980
 Let the letters be the same size if 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.050
 they understand me 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.260
 a small defect and is corrected 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.260
 now 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.130
 Now I'm going to put you this happy day 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.130
 example 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.930
 very well they saw us happy day 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.189
 let's see for example 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.230
 for example this 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.640
 Congratulations
