00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.049
 hello in this season the frosts are 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:10.940
 become the main enemy of 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:13.580
 our plants damaging both leaves 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.349
 young as flowers of course 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.419
 that suffer most are the species 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.789
 from warm climates such as 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:21.980
 bougainvillea and hibiscus there are also 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.930
 species of massifs that resist very badly 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.059
 frosts like dahlias and 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.180
 chrysanthemums in relation to fruit trees 

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:31.070
 both apples and pears are very resistant 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.430
 bad like many species of 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.980
 our garden 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.050
 frost damage is avoided reviewing the 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.030
 location worrying about avoiding 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.970
 put sensitive species in places 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.590
 In addition, it is recommended not to water in 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.270
 the night since the water is going to act like 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.660
 a cooler that is going to damage our 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.660
 estate 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.440
 both for pot plants and 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.780
 for the massifs it is very important 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.390
 Protecting your roots is a good option 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.339
 is to cover them with pine bark which 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.339
 it will also work as a composting 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.890
 a very good technique to protect the 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.619
 neck of our plants is to stack 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.810
 ground at its base this technique is known 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.830
 as re chock and is very useful for you 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.830
 smooth and rosso 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.170
 puri is not written and asks if it is 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.720
 enough to apply manure in a 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.700
 orchard every three or four irr pure and 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.010
 in truth that frequency is too much 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.020
 high for manure when you apply 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.210
 as fertilizer a decomposed manure 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.270
 this can have an effect that 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.890
 It lasts between 1 to 2 years therefore it is not 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.940
 you need to be repeating your application 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.940
 so often 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.730
 when we have many sensitive species 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.800
 in flowerpots the recommended thing is 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.530
 group them and cover them with a plastic 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.650
 that does remember the next day remove 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.650
 I 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.040
 If you have any doubt, you can return 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.230
 to see this program in do it 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.120
 same point cl where you can also 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.330
 Ask us all your questions that are 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.330
 all right
