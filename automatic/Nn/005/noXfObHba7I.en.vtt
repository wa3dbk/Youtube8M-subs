00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
beneath the seat yeah it actually this

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:31.730 
beneath the seat yeah it actually this
tube<00:01:22.619> was<00:01:24.170> really<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.320> front<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.710> me<00:01:27.829> like<00:01:30.740> this

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
tube was really in front of me like this

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.550 
tube was really in front of me like this
was<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> really<00:01:32.220> big<00:01:32.430> obstacle<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.780> get<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
was a really big obstacle to get to the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.830 
was a really big obstacle to get to the
back<00:01:35.130> balls<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.840> sensor<00:01:37.610> so<00:01:38.840> basically

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
back balls of the sensor so basically

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.109 
back balls of the sensor so basically
what<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.200> did<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.799> just

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
what I did I just

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.359 
what I did I just
first<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.049> took<00:01:43.110> out<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:44.540> white<00:01:45.540> part<00:01:46.369> from

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
first I took out this white part from

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.410 
first I took out this white part from
here<00:01:47.640> took<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.689> out<00:01:49.070> snapped<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.250> out<00:01:50.369> then<00:01:51.180> I

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
here took it out snapped it out then I

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.810 
here took it out snapped it out then I
pulled<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.770> bigger<00:01:53.430> black<00:01:53.820> part<00:01:54.149> out<00:01:55.820> came

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
pulled this bigger black part out came

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.499 
pulled this bigger black part out came
up<00:01:57.000> fairly<00:01:57.360> easily<00:01:58.280> so<00:01:59.280> after<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.119> had<00:02:00.479> a

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
up fairly easily so after that I had a

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.670 
up fairly easily so after that I had a
ton<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.869> space<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.590> do<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:03.780> screw<00:02:04.020> out<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.469> last

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
ton of space to do to screw out the last

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.040 
ton of space to do to screw out the last
bolt<00:02:05.990> so<00:02:07.429> that<00:02:08.429> what<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.879> is<00:02:09.060> what<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.720> looks

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
bolt so that what that is what it looks

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.480 
bolt so that what that is what it looks
like

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.190 

mm<00:02:13.770> there's<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:15.070> right<00:02:15.280> part<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.930> right<00:02:16.930> part

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
mm there's the right part of right part

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.020 
mm there's the right part of right part
of<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.560> tubing<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:19.920> two-count<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.130> here<00:02:21.880> is

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
of the tubing a two-count and here is

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.570 
of the tubing a two-count and here is
the<00:02:22.990> left<00:02:23.290> part<00:02:23.380> still<00:02:23.950> attached<00:02:24.870> as<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:27.430> can

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
the left part still attached as you can

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.990 
the left part still attached as you can
see<00:02:27.880> it<00:02:28.150> takes<00:02:29.100> quite<00:02:30.100> a<00:02:30.160> lot<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.550> space<00:02:30.970> there

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
see it takes quite a lot of space there

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.620 
see it takes quite a lot of space there
there's<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:32.820> left<00:02:33.820> side<00:02:34.120> of<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.420> black

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
there's the left side of the black

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.680 
there's the left side of the black
tubing<00:02:35.520> that<00:02:36.520> I<00:02:36.580> didn't<00:02:37.030> have<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.270> take<00:02:37.420> out<00:02:37.660> of

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
tubing that I didn't have to take out of

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.060 
tubing that I didn't have to take out of
course<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:39.270> yeah<00:02:40.270> I<00:02:40.540> can<00:02:41.470> take<00:02:41.680> out<00:02:41.830> the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
course and yeah I can take out the

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:49.980 
course and yeah I can take out the
sensor<00:02:42.490> still<00:02:44.760> just<00:02:46.170> pull<00:02:47.170> it<00:02:47.320> out<00:02:47.350> and<00:02:48.990> here
