America<00:00:38.850> yet<00:00:39.059> or<00:00:39.270> Japan<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.440> until<00:00:40.920> then<00:00:41.280> we

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
America yet or Japan so until then we

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.639 
America yet or Japan so until then we
just<00:00:42.210> have<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.540> assume<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.410> only

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
just have to assume that this is only

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.250 
just have to assume that this is only
for<00:00:44.340> your<00:00:44.579> rough<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.059> with<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.450> let's<00:00:46.079> get

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
for your rough so with that let's get

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.420 
for your rough so with that let's get
into<00:00:46.440> my<00:00:46.680> thoughts<00:00:46.920> about<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:48.469> so<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.860> think

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
into my thoughts about this so I think

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.880 
into my thoughts about this so I think
that's<00:00:50.670> pretty<00:00:50.969> cool<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:51.660> as<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.620> right<00:00:52.680> now

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
that's pretty cool but as of right now

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.790 
that's pretty cool but as of right now
we<00:00:53.760> only<00:00:53.940> know<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.199> coming<00:00:55.500> out<00:00:55.590> in

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
we only know that it's coming out in

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.130 
we only know that it's coming out in
Europe<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.579> UK<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.390> there's<00:00:57.960> no

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
Europe in the UK so there's no

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.689 
Europe in the UK so there's no
confirmation<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.070> even<00:00:59.219> coming<00:00:59.670> to

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
confirmation that it's even coming to

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.900 
confirmation that it's even coming to
North<00:00:59.969> America<00:01:00.059> or<00:01:00.870> even<00:01:01.230> Japan<00:01:01.609> which<00:01:02.609> would

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
North America or even Japan which would

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.740 
North America or even Japan which would
suck<00:01:03.210> immensely<00:01:03.960> because<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.830> feel<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.750> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
suck immensely because I feel that the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.590 
suck immensely because I feel that the
UK<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:08.040> Europe<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.610> general<00:01:08.790> gets<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.360> little

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
UK and Europe in general gets a little

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.800 
UK and Europe in general gets a little
bit<00:01:09.900> too<00:01:10.080> much<00:01:10.680> catering<00:01:11.430> from<00:01:11.790> nitendo<00:01:12.330> in

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
bit too much catering from nitendo in

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.450 
bit too much catering from nitendo in
general<00:01:13.680> especially<00:01:14.010> for<00:01:14.760> being<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.900> worst

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
general especially for being the worst

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.859 
general especially for being the worst
market<00:01:17.460> for<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> wii<00:01:18.030> u<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.420> we<00:01:18.570> was

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
market for the wii u that we was

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.499 
market for the wii u that we was
basically<00:01:19.470> dead<00:01:19.979> out<00:01:20.189> there<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.759> get<00:01:21.479> that

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
basically dead out there I get that

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.749 
basically dead out there I get that
they're<00:01:21.840> trying<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.409> give<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.250> lot<00:01:23.700> of

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
they're trying to give a lot of

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.210 
they're trying to give a lot of
incentive<00:01:24.420> for<00:01:24.630> people<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.990> buy<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.680> out<00:01:25.950> there

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
incentive for people to buy it out there

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.880 
incentive for people to buy it out there
but<00:01:26.490> at<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.670> same<00:01:26.909> time<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.110> seems<00:01:28.560> like

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
but at the same time it just seems like

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.749 
but at the same time it just seems like
Nintendo<00:01:29.820> hates<00:01:30.380> us<00:01:31.380> North<00:01:31.740> Americans<00:01:32.310> with

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
Nintendo hates us North Americans with

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.280 
Nintendo hates us North Americans with
these<00:01:32.939> when<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.420> comes<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.720> these<00:01:33.840> special

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
these when it comes to these special

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.810 
these when it comes to these special
editions<00:01:34.770> because<00:01:35.040> we<00:01:35.220> rarely<00:01:35.549> get<00:01:35.939> them<00:01:36.500> so

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
editions because we rarely get them so

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.399 
editions because we rarely get them so
hopefully<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.180> announced<00:01:39.659> for<00:01:39.869> North

that<00:02:19.200> up<00:02:19.709> on<00:02:19.950> display<00:02:20.370> if<00:02:20.489> it<00:02:20.670> came<00:02:21.209> out<00:02:21.420> here

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
that up on display if it came out here

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.170 
that up on display if it came out here
and<00:02:22.019> as<00:02:22.950> far<00:02:23.250> as<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.579> it<00:02:23.760> doesn't<00:02:24.060> look<00:02:24.120> like

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
and as far as that it doesn't look like

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.720 
and as far as that it doesn't look like
you<00:02:24.810> have<00:02:25.049> any<00:02:25.349> additional<00:02:25.680> content<00:02:26.519> or

you have any additional content or
anything<00:02:27.150> like<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:27.359> so<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.260> just<00:02:28.530> get<00:02:28.739> this

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
anything like that so you just get this

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.280

doubted<00:02:38.129> but<00:02:38.519> they<00:02:38.730> would<00:02:38.909> have<00:02:39.000> said

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
doubted but they would have said

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.199 
doubted but they would have said
something<00:02:39.239> so<00:02:40.099> the<00:02:41.099> box<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.549> good<00:02:41.760> enough<00:02:42.000> for

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
something so the box is good enough for

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.500 
something so the box is good enough for
me<00:02:42.359> definitely<00:02:43.310> so<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.670> looks<00:02:44.730> really<00:02:45.150> cool
