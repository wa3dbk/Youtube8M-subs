00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.660
 I'll end up opening 2 pecs of this here 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.359
 for us to arrive and not at home that 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.230
 people had thought of doing the other 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:53.760
 time too 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.160
 besides I'm with few know 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.100

 black mba season and best of the world 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.110
 or rest of the world to see if you have any 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.960
 good thing opening the first pec 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:19.200
 come on let only player perin 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.660
 give here her 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.960
 jade that I think his name is 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:29.370
 defender here gives German and barbo jadson 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.110
 perin must find the muriel nice 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:39.900
 probably should not be worth too much 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:42.630
 worth price says card and more then 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.360
 It sure is not worth much and left everything 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.430
 world here 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.190
 There goes the second pack there so let's see if 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.170
 we get a report is not bad at all 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.160
 to take a cristiano ronaldo or even 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.290
 A kiss, right? 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.120
 Let's see, this is what we give a little bit 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.010
 more fortunate since in this first pec 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:06.360
 Just watch that player report 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:10.410
 It's there to see two who pac and do not come 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.550
 no one again from vaio cana its 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.859
 wellington does not see it says nokia 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.840
 alexandre walker sister fernanda towers 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:20.840
 ben arfa and diego alves 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.790
 We managed to catch the blue player. 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.650
 there is the opening of pec is very relative 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.930
 sometimes a guy can open a pack 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.070
 of 7500 with the player's display imposing is 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.660
 toth 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.400
 sometimes you spend 1 million and you do not see 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.080
 nothing but that's it 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.650
 I hope you liked the video 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:45.390

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.770
 see if we 're lucky I 'll go 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.460
 Opening, I'm going to be rolling a lot. 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:55.500
 To see who wanted it, who will be? 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:59.030
 Let's go, let's see. 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.030
