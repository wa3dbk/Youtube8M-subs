00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.879
 [Music] 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.099
 so if we have found that 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.160
 or mean that the dog is too fat 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.289
 then you should with possibility first 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.609
 talk to his vet for it 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.140
 It may well be that the dog is not 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.420
 too fat because I'm feeding him too fat 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.840
 or too much to feed but that 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.029
 actually is sick because of me 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.099
 a thyroid subfunction holder 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.930
 stored water as well as I too 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.860
 much has nothing at all with that 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.620
 to do lining 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.500
 yes he can take certain medications if he 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.809
 Medication gets regular and this 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.489
 Medicines have as side effect that 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.440
 he gets fat then that's up to it 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.230
 the medicines and not ours 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.510
 Feeding or the life effect of 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.899
 Medications can also become fat 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.670
 just stop and that can do them all 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.500
 explain in detail to vet 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.390
 and there should definitely be one 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.140
 first check health check and 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.090
 a blood test if we have the dog 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.159
 then and when we found out then 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.500
 have that dog actually 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.750
 organically healthy is there we need one 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.320
 look for suitable feed medium 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.840
 also because of ths can help and 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.189
 then the daily ration is set 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.180
 just how much he can for now 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.630
 really eat 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.100
 important is that of the daily ration 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.979
 then the yummy again 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.479
 subtracted from 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.600
 should in principle from the table even 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.960
 nothing can be fed with it 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.900
 daily ration not necessarily 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.840
 cluttered is movement 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.659
 Of course, should be important in the 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.369
 appropriate frameworks take place 20 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.259
 you can not kilo heavy lids 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.820
 be sure to run five kilometers 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.920
 just so that the weight has lost that 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.310
 he does not think so because of that 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.659
 we'll see that's a fair one 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.369
 Movement is the best 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.030
 Movement types are actually 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.830
 steady movements like jogging 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.619
 cycling swim that's all 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.240
 persevering types of movement stop and the 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.899
 are actually the most effective for 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.899
 such matters
