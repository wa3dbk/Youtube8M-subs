pretty cool I think that's awesome um
looks<00:03:29.489> really<00:03:29.700> nice<00:03:29.910> of<00:03:30.720> course<00:03:31.080> um<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.920> bulb

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
looks really nice of course um the bulb

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.920 
looks really nice of course um the bulb
is<00:03:32.310> in<00:03:32.430> there<00:03:32.610> and<00:03:32.790> of<00:03:32.850> course<00:03:33.090> on<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.660> top

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
is in there and of course on the top

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.259 
is in there and of course on the top
also<00:03:34.170> it's<00:03:34.470> pretty<00:03:34.620> clear<00:03:34.860> so<00:03:34.890> you<00:03:35.400> can<00:03:35.850> flash

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
also it's pretty clear so you can flash

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.370 
also it's pretty clear so you can flash
it<00:03:36.299> and<00:03:37.160> I<00:03:38.160> guess<00:03:38.340> uh<00:03:38.450> it<00:03:39.450> could<00:03:39.660> act<00:03:39.840> kind<00:03:40.290> of

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
it and I guess uh it could act kind of

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.840 
it and I guess uh it could act kind of
as<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.890> flashlight<00:03:41.250> so<00:03:42.680> if<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:43.860> may<00:03:44.220> be<00:03:44.280> trying<00:03:44.760> to

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
as a flashlight so if I may be trying to

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.090 
as a flashlight so if I may be trying to
dim<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.209> lights<00:03:45.420> a<00:03:45.510> little<00:03:45.600> bit<00:03:45.750> you<00:03:46.709> can<00:03:46.829> see

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
dim the lights a little bit you can see

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.729 
dim the lights a little bit you can see
how<00:03:47.340> bright<00:03:47.549> it<00:03:47.730> is<00:03:47.760> so<00:03:48.570> that's<00:03:49.290> pretty<00:03:49.530> cool

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
how bright it is so that's pretty cool

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
thought that it was going to be kind of

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.560 
thought that it was going to be kind of
like<00:04:06.900> a<00:04:07.340> equip<00:04:08.340> in<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:09.030> back<00:04:09.209> so<00:04:09.360> you<00:04:09.420> could

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
like a equip in the back so you could

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.840 
like a equip in the back so you could
like<00:04:09.720> clip<00:04:09.959> it<00:04:10.110> on<00:04:10.320> your<00:04:10.350> shirt<00:04:10.670> or<00:04:11.670> something

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
like clip it on your shirt or something

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.180 
like clip it on your shirt or something
just<00:04:12.660> like<00:04:12.810> in<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.110> what<00:04:13.769> they<00:04:13.860> do<00:04:13.920> in<00:04:14.100> the

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
just like in the what they do in the

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.069 
just like in the what they do in the
movie<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.579> uniforms<00:04:15.090> but<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:15.840> guess

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
movie and the uniforms but I guess

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.319 
movie and the uniforms but I guess
that's<00:04:16.290> what<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:17.160> action<00:04:17.459> figure<00:04:17.700> stands<00:04:18.090> are

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
that's what the action figure stands are

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.949 
that's what the action figure stands are
for<00:04:18.540> from<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:18.959> play<00:04:19.109> made<00:04:19.290> series<00:04:19.680> so<00:04:20.959> that's

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
for from the play made series so that's

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.529 
for from the play made series so that's
pretty<00:04:22.229> much<00:04:22.320> it<00:04:22.640> still<00:04:23.640> I<00:04:23.849> think<00:04:24.150> it's<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.419> cool

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
I thought there would be sound but of

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.480 
I thought there would be sound but of
course<00:04:28.650> it's<00:04:28.980> a<00:04:29.280> very<00:04:29.760> cheap<00:04:30.950> promo<00:04:31.950> so<00:04:32.220> you

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
can't just expect I expected to make

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.320 
can't just expect I expected to make
sounds<00:04:34.830> and<00:04:34.980> life<00:04:35.160> at<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:35.310> same<00:04:35.460> time<00:04:35.700> but

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
sounds and life at the same time but

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.410 
sounds and life at the same time but
