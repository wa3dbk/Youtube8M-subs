crocodile and now they just got hit by a
three-man<00:00:47.039> zigs<00:00:47.370> alt<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:47.789> let's<00:00:48.000> think<00:00:48.120> about

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
three-man zigs alt so let's think about

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.189 
three-man zigs alt so let's think about
the<00:00:48.559> change<00:00:49.559> here<00:00:49.829> three<00:00:50.430> alts<00:00:50.789> no<00:00:51.149> kill

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
the change here three alts no kill

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.319 
the change here three alts no kill
Renekton<00:00:52.710> gets<00:00:53.039> away<00:00:53.250> Darius<00:00:53.730> gets<00:00:53.910> away<00:00:54.120> but

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
Renekton gets away Darius gets away but

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.069 
Renekton gets away Darius gets away but
now<00:00:54.539> purple<00:00:55.320> team<00:00:55.469> has<00:00:55.500> lost<00:00:56.129> three<00:00:56.699> alts<00:00:57.329> so

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
now purple team has lost three alts so

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.680 
now purple team has lost three alts so
at<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.800> point<00:00:59.160> their<00:00:59.640> ability<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.359> fight<00:01:00.660> a

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
at this point their ability to fight a

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.250 
at this point their ability to fight a
teamfight<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.890> pretty<00:01:02.640> small<00:01:02.969> plus<00:01:03.359> they<00:01:03.930> just

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
teamfight is pretty small plus they just

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.080 
teamfight is pretty small plus they just
did<00:01:05.150> three<00:01:06.150> times<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.380> damage<00:01:07.880> that<00:01:08.880> he

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
did three times the damage that he

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.700 
did three times the damage that he
normally<00:01:09.299> would<00:01:09.659> get<00:01:09.810> out<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.110> his<00:01:10.229> own<00:01:10.409> so

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
normally would get out of his own so

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.620 
normally would get out of his own so
right<00:01:11.460> there<00:01:11.670> should<00:01:11.909> be<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> clue<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.479> it's

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
right there should be a clue that it's

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.050 
right there should be a clue that it's
time<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.869> back<00:01:13.140> down<00:01:13.350> but<00:01:13.590> no<00:01:14.100> at<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.970> point

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
time to back down but no at this point

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.940 
time to back down but no at this point
purple<00:01:15.780> team<00:01:15.930> should<00:01:16.229> be<00:01:16.259> falling<00:01:16.680> back<00:01:16.920> to

quick
but<00:02:21.920> this<00:02:22.099> is<00:02:22.340> really<00:02:22.640> important<00:02:23.299> and<00:02:23.390> I<00:02:23.540> can

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
but this is really important and I can

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.809 
but this is really important and I can
revisit<00:02:24.170> this<00:02:24.560> in<00:02:24.829> the<00:02:24.980> future<00:02:25.310> if<00:02:25.519> you<00:02:25.670> guys

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
revisit this in the future if you guys

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.190 
revisit this in the future if you guys
want<00:02:26.150> me<00:02:26.239> to<00:02:26.269> talk<00:02:26.510> more<00:02:26.540> about<00:02:26.780> it<00:02:26.989> on<00:02:27.079> my

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
want me to talk more about it on my

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.319 
want me to talk more about it on my
stream<00:02:27.469> or<00:02:27.620> whatever<00:02:27.859> we<00:02:28.819> can<00:02:29.000> go<00:02:29.150> over<00:02:29.299> it

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
stream or whatever we can go over it

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.270 
stream or whatever we can go over it
because<00:02:29.599> momentum<00:02:29.810> is<00:02:30.230> key<00:02:30.500> when<00:02:30.890> a<00:02:30.950> team<00:02:31.250> gets

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
because momentum is key when a team gets

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.759 
because momentum is key when a team gets
a<00:02:31.730> lead<00:02:31.939> or<00:02:32.239> when<00:02:32.359> a<00:02:32.390> team<00:02:32.659> has<00:02:32.900> an<00:02:33.079> alt<00:02:33.319> lead<00:02:33.530> or
