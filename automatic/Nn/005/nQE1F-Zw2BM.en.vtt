up swiping it a second time well there
is<00:00:35.489> something<00:00:35.790> equivalent<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.570> so

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
is something equivalent to that so

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.479 
is something equivalent to that so
you'll<00:00:37.380> notice<00:00:37.559> here<00:00:37.680> at<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.010> very<00:00:38.219> top<00:00:38.460> of

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489

you'll notice here at the very top of
the<00:00:38.760> screen<00:00:39.030> there<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.510> time<00:00:39.840> this

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
the screen there is this time this

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.619 
the screen there is this time this
little<00:00:40.980> countdown<00:00:41.520> that's<00:00:41.850> taking<00:00:42.149> place<00:00:42.180> if

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
little countdown that's taking place if

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.700 
little countdown that's taking place if
you<00:00:43.320> get<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> card<00:00:43.980> error<00:00:44.690> when<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.719> put<00:00:46.559> your

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.160 
you get a card error when you put your
phone<00:00:47.010> next<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.640> wait<00:00:48.149> until<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.840> timer

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
phone next to it wait until this timer

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.380 
phone next to it wait until this timer
completes<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.160> then<00:00:50.579> what<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.850> do<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.239> you

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
completes and then what you do is you

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.180 
completes and then what you do is you
try<00:00:51.600> again<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.440> once<00:00:52.620> again<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:53.010> little

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
try again so once again that little

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.100 
try again so once again that little
timing<00:00:53.699> single<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.239> equivalent<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.899> doing

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
timing single is the equivalent of doing

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.049 
timing single is the equivalent of doing
a<00:00:55.379> swipe<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.219> you're<00:00:56.340> going<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.489> wait<00:00:56.760> into

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
a swipe so you're going to wait into

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.029 
a swipe so you're going to wait into
that<00:00:57.210> finishes<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.230> then<00:00:58.590> you'll<00:00:58.710> use<00:00:58.859> your

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
that finishes and then you'll use your

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.360 
that finishes and then you'll use your
fingerprint<00:00:59.460> again<00:00:59.699> to<00:01:00.350> initiate<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.620> swipe

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
fingerprint again to initiate that swipe

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.850 
fingerprint again to initiate that swipe
again<00:01:02.609> though<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.059> digital<00:01:03.480> swipe<00:01:03.719> now<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
again though the digital swipe now the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.080
