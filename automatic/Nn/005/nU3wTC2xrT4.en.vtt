pressure<00:01:11.159> sore<00:01:11.400> right<00:01:11.549> here<00:01:11.729> well<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.510> does

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
pressure sore right here well this does

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.330 
pressure sore right here well this does
is<00:01:12.870> it<00:01:12.990> completely<00:01:13.380> avoids<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.190> get

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
is it completely avoids that so you get

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.670 
is it completely avoids that so you get
the<00:01:14.460> benefits<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.940> a<00:01:15.060> full<00:01:15.240> face<00:01:15.420> mask<00:01:15.690> without

Respironics<00:01:20.430> they<00:01:20.549> have<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:21.000> version<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.659> this

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
Respironics they have a version of this

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.039 
Respironics they have a version of this
as<00:01:21.990> well<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.439> called<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.649> FitLife<00:01:22.890> and

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
as well it's called the FitLife and

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.300 
as well it's called the FitLife and
resident<00:01:25.049> wants<00:01:25.140> small<00:01:25.500> where<00:01:25.770> Respironics

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
resident wants small where Respironics

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.429 
resident wants small where Respironics
want<00:01:26.490> extra<00:01:26.820> big<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.299> Respironics<00:01:28.140> has<00:01:28.259> when

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
want extra big so Respironics has when

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.969 
want extra big so Respironics has when
it<00:01:28.530> goes<00:01:28.619> all<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.890> way<00:01:29.130> around<00:01:29.310> here<00:01:30.979> ResMed

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
it goes all the way around here ResMed

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.950 
it goes all the way around here ResMed
said<00:01:32.250> let's<00:01:32.490> make<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.820> smaller<00:01:33.119> just<00:01:33.750> go

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
said let's make it smaller just go

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.810 
said let's make it smaller just go
around<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.350> mouth<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.859> then<00:01:35.219> two<00:01:35.490> problems

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
around the mouth and then two problems

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.099 
around the mouth and then two problems
in<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.939> nose<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.359> still<00:01:36.539> functions<00:01:36.719> as<00:01:37.079> a

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109 
in the nose and it still functions as a

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:38.929 
in the nose and it still functions as a
full<00:01:37.350> face<00:01:37.530> mask<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.609> great<00:01:38.820> if<00:01:38.909> people

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
full face mask so it's great if people

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.420 
full face mask so it's great if people
are<00:01:39.149> getting<00:01:39.240> pressure<00:01:39.539> sores<00:01:40.189> this<00:01:41.189> has

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
are getting pressure sores this has

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.959 
are getting pressure sores this has
pretty<00:01:41.969> much<00:01:42.140> I<00:01:43.399> would<00:01:44.399> say<00:01:44.520> it's<00:01:44.670> probably

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
pretty much I would say it's probably

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:47.990 
pretty much I would say it's probably
easier<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.750> fit<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.320> sealed<00:01:46.649> in<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:47.009> most<00:01:47.729> full

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
easier to fit and sealed in a most full

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.940 
easier to fit and sealed in a most full
face<00:01:48.240> mask<00:01:48.539> for<00:01:49.140> people<00:01:49.380> with<00:01:49.530> difficult

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
noses like myself prominent proboscis

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.609 
noses like myself prominent proboscis
because<00:01:53.789> what<00:01:53.909> they<00:01:54.000> call<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.439> thing

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
because what they call it and this thing

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.410 
because what they call it and this thing
has<00:01:55.770> some<00:01:55.979> cool<00:01:56.159> features<00:01:56.369> though<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.149> lot

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
has some cool features though that a lot

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.349 
has some cool features though that a lot
of<00:01:57.539> nasal<00:01:57.750> pillows<00:01:58.229> don't<00:01:58.890> have<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.850> for<00:02:00.210> one

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:00.359 
of nasal pillows don't have so for one

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:02.840 
of nasal pillows don't have so for one
you<00:02:00.479> can<00:02:00.600> see<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:01.020> each<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.289> these<00:02:01.850> nasal

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
you can see that each of these nasal

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.050 
you can see that each of these nasal
pillows<00:02:03.359> come<00:02:04.200> out<00:02:04.350> individually<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:05.909> what

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
pillows come out individually so what

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.029 
pillows come out individually so what
that<00:02:06.179> means<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.780> then<00:02:07.259> they<00:02:07.380> have<00:02:07.740> small

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
that means and then they have small

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.950 
that means and then they have small
medium<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.369> large<00:02:08.460> coming<00:02:08.940> with<00:02:09.060> each<00:02:09.179> one<00:02:09.390> so

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
medium and large coming with each one so

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.140 
medium and large coming with each one so
this<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.590> what<00:02:10.740> it<00:02:10.830> looks<00:02:11.009> like<00:02:11.100> and<00:02:11.520> then<00:02:12.000> you

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
this is what it looks like and then you

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.550 
this is what it looks like and then you
just<00:02:12.390> pop<00:02:12.570> it<00:02:12.750> through<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.960> bottom<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.319> pull

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
just pop it through the bottom and pull

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.230 
just pop it through the bottom and pull
them<00:02:13.710> out<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:14.460> can<00:02:14.580> actually<00:02:14.730> cut<00:02:15.090> these

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
them out you can actually cut these

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.780 
them out you can actually cut these
right<00:02:15.510> here<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.350> could<00:02:16.560> have<00:02:16.740> a<00:02:17.220> small

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
right here and so you could have a small

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.580 
right here and so you could have a small
pillow<00:02:18.060> on<00:02:18.420> one<00:02:18.930> if<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.200> have<00:02:19.319> a<00:02:19.350> small

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
pillow on one if you have a small

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.750 
pillow on one if you have a small
nostril<00:02:20.010> then<00:02:20.220> if<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.370> have<00:02:20.460> a<00:02:20.490> larger

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
nostril then if you have a larger

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.190 
nostril then if you have a larger
nostril<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.180> can<00:02:21.330> use<00:02:21.450> either<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.780> medium<00:02:22.080> or

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
nostril you can use either the medium or

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.640 
nostril you can use either the medium or
the<00:02:22.230> large<00:02:23.360> so<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:25.050> know<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.320> kind<00:02:25.530> of

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
the large so you know that kind of

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.130 
the large so you know that kind of
versatility<00:02:26.100> is<00:02:26.460> fantastic<00:02:27.300> since<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:28.050> know

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
versatility is fantastic since you know

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.450 
versatility is fantastic since you know
all<00:02:28.290> of<00:02:28.320> our<00:02:28.470> faces<00:02:28.740> learning
