00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
I'm the kind of person who is just like

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.109 
I'm the kind of person who is just like
oh<00:00:16.560> I'll<00:00:16.800> just<00:00:16.859> make<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.160> black<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.520> white<00:00:17.609> make

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
oh I'll just make a black and white make

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.470 
oh I'll just make a black and white make
it<00:00:18.240> look<00:00:18.330> nice<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:19.820> the<00:00:20.820> first<00:00:21.060> thing<00:00:21.270> I'm

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
it look nice so the first thing I'm

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.509 
it look nice so the first thing I'm
going<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.660> do<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.080> go<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.710> layer<00:00:23.160> new

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
going to do is go to layer new

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.790 
going to do is go to layer new
adjustment<00:00:24.000> layer<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.869> then<00:00:25.320> black<00:00:25.619> and

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
adjustment layer and then black and

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.259 
adjustment layer and then black and
white<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.369> reason<00:00:26.640> I'm<00:00:26.760> doing<00:00:26.789> this<00:00:27.029> is

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
white and the reason I'm doing this is

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.470 
white and the reason I'm doing this is
because<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:28.140> black<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.680> white<00:00:28.710> layer<00:00:29.480> will

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
because this black and white layer will

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.150 
because this black and white layer will
be<00:00:30.570> able<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.840> pull<00:00:31.080> out<00:00:31.109> some<00:00:31.529> texture<00:00:32.040> and

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
be able to pull out some texture and

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.639 
be able to pull out some texture and
detail<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.489> normally<00:00:33.350> you<00:00:34.350> wouldn't<00:00:34.530> be

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
detail that normally you wouldn't be

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.420 
detail that normally you wouldn't be
able<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.950> get<00:00:36.320> so<00:00:37.879> let's<00:00:38.879> go<00:00:39.210> ahead<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:40.430> set

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
able to get so let's go ahead and set

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.280 
able to get so let's go ahead and set
this<00:00:41.579> layer<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.149> multiply<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.140> can

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
this layer to multiply so that you can

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.950 
this layer to multiply so that you can
see<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.680> as<00:00:43.829> you're<00:00:44.070> going<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:45.000> again<00:00:45.870> I'm

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
see it as you're going and again I'm

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.150 
see it as you're going and again I'm
just<00:00:45.989> playing<00:00:46.469> with<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.980> yellows<00:00:47.850> Reds<00:00:48.690> I

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
just playing with the yellows Reds I

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.069 
just playing with the yellows Reds I
like<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.280> well<00:00:50.700> we<00:00:51.030> could<00:00:51.210> change<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.660> also

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
like to well we could change this also

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.369 
like to well we could change this also
when<00:00:52.260> we<00:00:52.350> add<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:53.370> other<00:00:53.520> layers<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:54.600> to

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
when we add the other layers to but to

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.549 
when we add the other layers to but to
begin<00:00:55.530> I'm<00:00:55.980> going<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:57.260> kind<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.320> make

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
begin I'm going to kind of make

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.000 
begin I'm going to kind of make
everything<00:00:58.949> just<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.190> little<00:00:59.399> bit<00:00:59.520> darker

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
everything just a little bit darker

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.319 
everything just a little bit darker
we're<00:01:02.010> going<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.190> keep<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.460> greens<00:01:02.789> pretty

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
we're going to keep the greens pretty

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.060 
we're going to keep the greens pretty
low<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.809> picture<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.199> also<00:01:04.350> depends<00:01:04.860> what

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
low on this picture it also depends what

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.370 
low on this picture it also depends what
kind<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.309> picture<00:01:05.610> you're<00:01:05.850> using<00:01:06.030> my<00:01:07.020> picture

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
kind of picture you're using my picture

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.750 
kind of picture you're using my picture
is<00:01:07.610> primarily<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:09.140> green<00:01:10.140> scenery<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.369> it's

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
is primarily a green scenery so it's

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.020 
is primarily a green scenery so it's
again<00:01:12.479> going<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.810> change<00:01:13.790> so<00:01:14.790> you're<00:01:14.880> going<00:01:15.000> to

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
again going to change so you're going to

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.060 
again going to change so you're going to
want<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.360> adjust<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.990> according<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.950> your

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
want to adjust it according to your

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
want to adjust it according to your
picture<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.700> its<00:01:18.060> colors<00:01:18.470> um<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:20.430> next<00:01:20.580> step

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
picture and its colors um the next step

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.200 
picture and its colors um the next step
we<00:01:21.840> are<00:01:21.869> going<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.320> go<00:01:22.500> over<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.009> layer<00:01:23.340> new

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
we are going to go over to layer new

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.850 
we are going to go over to layer new
adjustment<00:01:24.240> layer<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.869> then<00:01:25.140> gradient<00:01:25.560> map

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
adjustment layer and then gradient map

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.960 
adjustment layer and then gradient map
and<00:01:26.930> we're<00:01:27.930> going<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.110> just<00:01:28.229> keep<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.770> at<00:01:29.189> a

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
and we're going to just keep this at a

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.420 
and we're going to just keep this at a
black<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.570> white<00:01:30.829> and<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:31.979> can<00:01:32.100> already<00:01:32.250> see

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
black to white and you can already see

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.960 
black to white and you can already see
it<00:01:32.700> kind<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.909> looks<00:01:33.090> nice<00:01:33.750> already<00:01:34.970> don't

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
it kind of looks nice already don't

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.819 
it kind of looks nice already don't
worry<00:01:36.210> if<00:01:36.479> it's<00:01:36.689> looking<00:01:36.900> too<00:01:37.229> dark<00:01:37.470> or<00:01:37.619> too

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
worry if it's looking too dark or too

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.800 
worry if it's looking too dark or too
light<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.130> can<00:01:38.250> always<00:01:38.520> change<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.630> black

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
light you can always change the black

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.050 
light you can always change the black
and<00:01:40.020> white<00:01:40.170> layer<00:01:40.350> towards<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:41.820> that's

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
and white layer towards that so that's

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.350 
and white layer towards that so that's
literally<00:01:42.689> what<00:01:42.899> I'm<00:01:42.960> going<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.110> do<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:44.360> let's

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
literally what I'm going to do and let's

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.469 
literally what I'm going to do and let's
go<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.689> layer<00:01:46.680> new<00:01:47.040> adjustment<00:01:47.640> layer<00:01:48.149> and

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
go to layer new adjustment layer and

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.770 
go to layer new adjustment layer and
then<00:01:48.570> curves<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.439> end<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.540> what<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.570> like

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
then curves to end this and what I like

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.069 
then curves to end this and what I like
to<00:01:51.930> do<00:01:52.049> mostly<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.920> pull<00:01:53.189> down<00:01:53.630> or<00:01:54.630> I'm

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
to do mostly is to pull down or I'm

sorry pull up this and kind of give it
some<00:02:00.270> more<00:02:01.610> texture<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.909> face<00:02:03.119> even<00:02:03.570> it

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960

some more texture in the face even it
gives<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.200> like<00:02:04.320> an<00:02:04.439> another<00:02:05.100> tonal<00:02:05.610> range<00:02:05.820> if

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
gives it like an another tonal range if

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.469 
gives it like an another tonal range if
you<00:02:06.270> will<00:02:06.979> I'm<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.789> playing<00:02:09.209> around<00:02:09.330> with

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
you will I'm just playing around with

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.449 
you will I'm just playing around with
that<00:02:09.800> and<00:02:10.800> I'm<00:02:10.890> going<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.069> show<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.220> guys<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
that and I'm going to show you guys the

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.130 
that and I'm going to show you guys the
difference<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:11.879> is<00:02:11.940> with<00:02:12.239> no<00:02:12.270> black<00:02:12.959> and

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
difference this is with no black and

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.790 
difference this is with no black and
white

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
white

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.000 
white
if<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.520> your<00:02:14.670> style<00:02:14.970> then<00:02:15.710> you<00:02:16.710> can<00:02:16.890> keep

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
if this is your style then you can keep

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.470 
if this is your style then you can keep
it<00:02:17.130> like<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.400> but<00:02:17.640> this<00:02:17.790> is<00:02:17.970> with<00:02:18.120> also<00:02:18.450> with

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
it like that but this is with also with

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.440 
it like that but this is with also with
a<00:02:18.600> curves<00:02:18.960> -<00:02:19.350> so<00:02:19.770> this<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.070> curves<00:02:20.550> this<00:02:21.300> is

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
a curves - so this is curves this is

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.300 
a curves - so this is curves this is
without<00:02:21.570> curves<00:02:22.820> curves<00:02:23.820> without<00:02:24.450> curves<00:02:24.870> I

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
without curves curves without curves I

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.650 
without curves curves without curves I
like<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.460> with<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.730> curves<00:02:26.940> because<00:02:27.360> again

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
like it with the curves because again

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.010 
like it with the curves because again
just<00:02:28.520> dropping<00:02:29.520> this<00:02:29.760> point<00:02:30.150> down<00:02:30.270> just<00:02:30.810> gives

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
just dropping this point down just gives

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.990 
just dropping this point down just gives
it<00:02:31.170> some<00:02:31.740> more<00:02:32.240> depth<00:02:33.240> into<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.900> picture<00:02:34.110> and

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
it some more depth into the picture and

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.430 
it some more depth into the picture and
if<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.120> want<00:02:36.300> it<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.450> be<00:02:36.540> pure<00:02:36.870> black<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.290> can

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
if you want it to be pure black you can

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.710 
if you want it to be pure black you can
just<00:02:37.590> drop<00:02:37.740> this<00:02:37.950> all<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.130> way<00:02:38.220> down<00:02:38.720> but

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
just drop this all the way down but

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.210 
just drop this all the way down but
personally<00:02:40.320> for<00:02:40.350> me<00:02:40.590> I<00:02:40.620> like<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:40.950> have<00:02:41.100> my

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
personally for me I like to have my

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.720 
personally for me I like to have my
pictures<00:02:41.790> like<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.150> great<00:02:42.450> black<00:02:43.340> or<00:02:44.340> just<00:02:44.460> gray

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
pictures like a great black or just gray

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.920 
pictures like a great black or just gray
what<00:02:45.060> did<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:45.240> see<00:02:45.420> career<00:02:45.600> back<00:02:47.690> so<00:02:48.690> just<00:02:48.720> don't

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
what did I see career back so just don't

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.040 
what did I see career back so just don't
play<00:02:49.230> around<00:02:49.470> with<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:49.770> a<00:02:49.830> little<00:02:49.980> bit<00:02:50.130> so

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
play around with that a little bit so

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.110 
play around with that a little bit so
I'm<00:02:52.050> going<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.260> go<00:02:52.320> ahead<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.940> make<00:02:53.940> this

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
I'm going to go ahead and make this

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.840 
I'm going to go ahead and make this
visible<00:02:54.600> this<00:02:54.870> layer<00:02:55.050> visible<00:02:55.470> again<00:02:55.850> I'm

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
visible this layer visible again I'm

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.430 
visible this layer visible again I'm
going<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.540> just<00:02:57.690> going<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.840> play<00:02:58.080> it<00:02:58.110> on<00:02:58.290> with

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
going to just going to play it on with

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:06.530 
going to just going to play it on with
it<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.880> see<00:03:04.580> now<00:03:05.580> you<00:03:05.640> see<00:03:05.880> if<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.060> bring<00:03:06.270> up<00:03:06.390> the

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
it and see now you see if I bring up the

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.880 
it and see now you see if I bring up the
green<00:03:06.750> it's<00:03:06.990> going<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.170> bring<00:03:07.290> out<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.680> rest

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
green it's going to bring out the rest

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
green it's going to bring out the rest
of<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.040> green<00:03:08.160> from<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.370> background<00:03:08.820> I<00:03:13.910> think

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
of the green from the background I think

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.450 
of the green from the background I think
this<00:03:15.030> is<00:03:15.210> just<00:03:16.110> personally<00:03:16.890> my<00:03:17.040> technique

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
this is just personally my technique

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.010 
this is just personally my technique
that<00:03:17.640> Lily<00:03:17.910> will<00:03:18.150> just<00:03:18.300> go<00:03:18.420> through<00:03:18.480> each<00:03:18.720> and

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
that Lily will just go through each and

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.470 
that Lily will just go through each and
every<00:03:19.140> color<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.740> just<00:03:19.860> test<00:03:20.730> out<00:03:20.970> each<00:03:21.209> one

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
every color and just test out each one

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.920 
every color and just test out each one
just<00:03:21.720> because<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:21.990> like<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.230> be<00:03:22.350> sure<00:03:22.890> of<00:03:23.930> what

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
just because I like to be sure of what

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.020 
just because I like to be sure of what
it's<00:03:25.590> doing<00:03:25.980> I'm<00:03:26.130> just<00:03:26.550> going<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.850> go<00:03:26.910> ahead

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
it's doing I'm just going to go ahead

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.699 
it's doing I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:03:27.120> lower<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:27.510> opacity<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:28.110> because<00:03:28.500> I<00:03:28.560> don't

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
and lower the opacity to because I don't

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.370 
and lower the opacity to because I don't
want<00:03:28.830> to<00:03:28.890> get<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.190> be<00:03:29.310> full<00:03:29.550> opacity<00:03:30.110> even<00:03:31.110> just

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
want to get to be full opacity even just

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.199 
want to get to be full opacity even just
adding<00:03:31.770> in<00:03:31.890> a<00:03:31.980> little<00:03:32.310> bit<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:32.520> texture<00:03:32.820> even

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
adding in a little bit of texture even

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.050 
adding in a little bit of texture even
to<00:03:33.300> the<00:03:33.420> face<00:03:33.660> as<00:03:33.990> you<00:03:34.110> can<00:03:34.260> tell<00:03:34.850> you<00:03:35.850> see<00:03:35.880> how

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
to the face as you can tell you see how

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.570 
to the face as you can tell you see how
it's<00:03:36.209> adding<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:36.630> a<00:03:36.780> little<00:03:37.020> bit<00:03:37.260> more<00:03:37.580> over

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
it's adding it a little bit more over

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.210 
it's adding it a little bit more over
here<00:03:39.240> some<00:03:39.480> more<00:03:39.630> color<00:03:39.860> even<00:03:40.860> that<00:03:41.010> just

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
here some more color even that just

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.470 
here some more color even that just
makes<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.459> huge<00:03:41.640> difference<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.150> picture

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
makes a huge difference to the picture

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:49.220 
makes a huge difference to the picture
and<00:03:43.370> I<00:03:44.810> love<00:03:45.810> what<00:03:46.380> curves<00:03:46.770> is<00:03:46.920> doing<00:03:48.080> let's<00:03:49.080> go

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
and I love what curves is doing let's go

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.320 
and I love what curves is doing let's go
to<00:03:49.290> layer<00:03:49.860> new<00:03:49.890> adjustment<00:03:50.310> layer<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.090> then

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
to layer new adjustment layer and then

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.150 
to layer new adjustment layer and then
brightness<00:03:51.810> contrast<00:03:51.990> and<00:03:52.500> we're<00:03:52.890> just<00:03:53.040> going

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
brightness contrast and we're just going

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.350 
brightness contrast and we're just going
to<00:03:53.220> add<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.370> little<00:03:53.700> bit<00:03:53.970> more<00:03:54.090> brightness<00:03:56.360> get

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
to add a little bit more brightness get

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.230 
to add a little bit more brightness get
that<00:03:57.540> old<00:03:58.400> look<00:04:01.190> and<00:04:02.190> something<00:04:02.790> else<00:04:03.030> that<00:04:03.120> I

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
that old look and something else that I

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.140 
that old look and something else that I
like<00:04:03.390> to<00:04:03.480> do<00:04:03.630> is<00:04:03.870> if<00:04:04.050> you<00:04:04.200> go<00:04:04.350> to<00:04:04.380> solid<00:04:05.370> make<00:04:06.120> a

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
like to do is if you go to solid make a

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.660 
like to do is if you go to solid make a
solid<00:04:06.480> color<00:04:06.750> layer<00:04:06.900> at<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.200> very<00:04:07.590> bottom<00:04:07.770> and

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
solid color layer at the very bottom and

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.570 
solid color layer at the very bottom and
then<00:04:08.850> you<00:04:08.940> pick<00:04:09.180> like<00:04:09.360> a<00:04:09.390> really<00:04:09.780> pale<00:04:10.580> like

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
then you pick like a really pale like

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.670 
then you pick like a really pale like
weird<00:04:12.260> color<00:04:14.630> it<00:04:15.630> could<00:04:15.780> be<00:04:15.900> like<00:04:16.020> some<00:04:16.290> weird

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
weird color it could be like some weird

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.780 
weird color it could be like some weird
car<00:04:16.919> like<00:04:17.100> that<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.609> if<00:04:18.540> you<00:04:18.660> set<00:04:18.870> it<00:04:18.989> to

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
car like that and if you set it to

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.420 
car like that and if you set it to
exclusion<00:04:20.989> and<00:04:21.989> then<00:04:22.200> you<00:04:22.350> lower<00:04:22.680> this<00:04:23.100> all

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
exclusion and then you lower this all

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.840 
exclusion and then you lower this all
the<00:04:23.729> way<00:04:23.910> to<00:04:23.970> about<00:04:24.510> 10

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
the way to about 10

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.710 
the way to about 10
it's<00:04:26.300> very<00:04:26.900> very<00:04:27.590> subtle<00:04:27.920> but<00:04:28.240> this<00:04:29.240> really

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
it's very very subtle but this really

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.900 
it's very very subtle but this really
does<00:04:29.930> make<00:04:30.140> a<00:04:30.200> difference<00:04:30.650> especially<00:04:31.250> if

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
does make a difference especially if

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.760 
does make a difference especially if
you're<00:04:32.060> using<00:04:32.210> other<00:04:32.420> pictures<00:04:32.870> and<00:04:33.200> there's

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
you're using other pictures and there's

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.050 
you're using other pictures and there's
other<00:04:33.950> layers<00:04:34.190> on<00:04:34.400> top<00:04:34.430> of<00:04:34.580> it

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.000 

and<00:04:38.470> as<00:04:39.470> you<00:04:39.620> can<00:04:39.770> tell<00:04:39.830> the<00:04:40.610> more<00:04:40.880> I'm

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
and as you can tell the more I'm

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.230 
and as you can tell the more I'm
bringing<00:04:43.010> up<00:04:43.070> up<00:04:43.250> past<00:04:43.460> you<00:04:43.700> can<00:04:43.850> see<00:04:44.090> that

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
bringing up up past you can see that

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.970 
bringing up up past you can see that
what<00:04:44.540> it's<00:04:44.660> doing<00:04:44.990> to<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.230> picture<00:04:47.860> so<00:04:48.860> this

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
what it's doing to the picture so this

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.090 
what it's doing to the picture so this
is<00:04:49.160> a<00:04:49.310> more<00:04:49.640> contrasted<00:04:50.420> look<00:04:50.690> and<00:04:50.990> if<00:04:51.740> I<00:04:51.890> add

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
is a more contrasted look and if I add

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.260 
is a more contrasted look and if I add
in<00:04:52.340> this<00:04:52.430> exclusion<00:04:52.940> layer<00:04:53.270> it's<00:04:53.740> making<00:04:54.740> it

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
in this exclusion layer it's making it

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.500 
in this exclusion layer it's making it
less<00:04:56.270> contrasted<00:04:57.850> so<00:04:58.850> it's<00:04:59.000> bringing<00:04:59.270> back

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
less contrasted so it's bringing back

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.060 
less contrasted so it's bringing back
values<00:05:00.170> right<00:05:00.410> here<00:05:00.440> I<00:05:02.290> just<00:05:03.290> turned<00:05:03.770> off<00:05:03.890> the

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
values right here I just turned off the

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.460 
values right here I just turned off the
brightness<00:05:04.460> and<00:05:04.610> contrast<00:05:04.700> layer<00:05:05.120> so<00:05:05.960> if<00:05:06.350> you

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
brightness and contrast layer so if you

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.980 
brightness and contrast layer so if you
wanted<00:05:06.680> something<00:05:08.380> with<00:05:09.380> less<00:05:09.680> contrast<00:05:10.460> then

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
wanted something with less contrast then

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.850 
wanted something with less contrast then
having<00:05:11.990> a<00:05:12.080> layer<00:05:12.200> like<00:05:12.380> this<00:05:12.470> really<00:05:12.740> does

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
having a layer like this really does

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.820 
having a layer like this really does
help<00:05:15.220> you<00:05:16.220> can<00:05:16.370> always<00:05:16.960> up<00:05:17.960> the<00:05:18.260> contrast<00:05:18.710> for

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
help you can always up the contrast for

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.180 
help you can always up the contrast for
this<00:05:19.040> too<00:05:20.650> let<00:05:21.650> me<00:05:21.770> show<00:05:21.920> you<00:05:22.010> guys<00:05:22.070> the

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
this too let me show you guys the

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.040 
this too let me show you guys the
difference<00:05:22.610> again<00:05:22.910> it's<00:05:23.060> bringing<00:05:23.540> back<00:05:23.780> more

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
difference again it's bringing back more

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.720 
difference again it's bringing back more
details<00:05:25.420> this<00:05:26.420> it's<00:05:26.810> literally<00:05:27.800> just<00:05:27.980> this<00:05:28.160> is

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
I don't even I'm a graphics that I

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.510 
I don't even I'm a graphics that I
didn't<00:05:34.820> even<00:05:34.880> know<00:05:35.090> my<00:05:35.210> colors<00:05:35.510> but<00:05:36.370> so<00:05:37.370> it's

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
didn't even know my colors but so it's

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.840 
didn't even know my colors but so it's
bringing<00:05:37.790> back<00:05:37.940> back<00:05:38.450> a<00:05:38.480> lot<00:05:38.780> of<00:05:38.960> the<00:05:39.850> details

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
bringing back back a lot of the details

bringing back back a lot of the details
that<00:05:41.060> weren't<00:05:41.240> there<00:05:41.480> before<00:05:42.310> so<00:05:43.390> it's<00:05:44.390> pretty
