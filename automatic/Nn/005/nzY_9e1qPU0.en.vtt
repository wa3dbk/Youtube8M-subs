00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.920 
gotten in there it's because he's
already<00:01:20.310> got<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:20.759> forms<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.689> team<00:01:21.900> of

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
already got to in forms and a team of

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.780 
already got to in forms and a team of
the<00:01:22.110> year<00:01:22.140> which<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.680> 98<00:01:23.189> rated<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.670> his

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
the year which is 98 rated and his

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.690

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
highest in form is 96 rated so if he

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.030 
highest in form is 96 rated so if he
goes<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.180> gets<00:01:27.270> another<00:01:27.600> inform<00:01:28.170> that's<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.439> 97

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
goes and gets another inform that's a 97

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.230 
goes and gets another inform that's a 97
and<00:01:29.130> they<00:01:29.490> won't<00:01:29.670> be<00:01:29.759> able<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.000> give<00:01:30.119> him

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
and they won't be able to give him

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.490 
and they won't be able to give him
another<00:01:30.299> inform<00:01:30.930> after<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.259> they're<00:01:31.409> not

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
another inform after that they're not

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.929 
another inform after that they're not
going<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.680> make<00:01:31.829> him<00:01:31.950> 99<00:01:32.250> unless<00:01:32.700> it's<00:01:32.880> a

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
going to make him 99 unless it's a

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.999 
going to make him 99 unless it's a
really<00:01:33.240> special<00:01:33.600> card<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.229> as<00:01:34.650> well<00:01:34.829> as<00:01:34.890> that

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
really special card and as well as that

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.140 
really special card and as well as that
you<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.340> think<00:01:35.490> about<00:01:35.610> team<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
you have to think about team of the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.469 
you have to think about team of the
season<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.950> know<00:01:38.070> he<00:01:38.340> might<00:01:38.670> turn<00:01:39.360> an

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
season so you know he might turn an

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.819 
season so you know he might turn an
absolute<00:01:39.780> shit<00:01:39.960> might<00:01:40.170> not<00:01:40.320> make<00:01:40.470> team<00:01:40.680> and

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
absolute shit might not make team and

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.620 
absolute shit might not make team and
say<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:40.979> but<00:01:41.159> that's<00:01:41.280> extremely<00:01:41.939> unlikely<00:01:42.180> so

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
say so but that's extremely unlikely so

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.300 
say so but that's extremely unlikely so
he's<00:01:42.750> probably<00:01:42.930> going<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.170> get<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.350> 97<00:01:43.979> team<00:01:44.220> of

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
he's probably going to get a 97 team of

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.130 
he's probably going to get a 97 team of
the<00:01:44.369> season<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.210> i<00:01:45.240> don't<00:01:45.509> think<00:01:45.659> we<00:01:45.780> will<00:01:45.899> see

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
the season so i don't think we will see

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.929 
the season so i don't think we will see
another<00:01:46.500> messing<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.159> form<00:01:47.430> i<00:01:47.549> could<00:01:47.790> be<00:01:47.909> wrong

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
another messing in form i could be wrong

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.940 
another messing in form i could be wrong
