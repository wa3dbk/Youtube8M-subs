inhibitors<00:04:51.259> you<00:04:51.590> have<00:04:51.710> to<00:04:51.860> think<00:04:52.009> by<00:04:52.220> having

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
inhibitors you have to think by having

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.490 
inhibitors you have to think by having
that<00:04:52.669> chase<00:04:53.030> happen<00:04:53.419> they<00:04:53.720> did<00:04:53.990> but<00:04:54.020> I<00:04:54.289> mean

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
that chase happen they did but I mean

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.080 
that chase happen they did but I mean
that<00:04:54.680> the<00:04:54.889> next<00:04:55.160> push<00:04:55.370> will<00:04:55.550> come<00:04:55.729> there<00:04:56.000> are

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
that the next push will come there are

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.520 
that the next push will come there are
no<00:04:56.240> weight<00:04:56.479> reduction<00:04:57.050> when<00:04:57.229> you're<00:04:57.409> in<00:04:57.500> that

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
no weight reduction when you're in that

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.339 
no weight reduction when you're in that
yard<00:04:57.860> old<00:04:58.130> form<00:04:58.490> I<00:04:58.759> just<00:04:59.449> feels<00:04:59.720> like<00:04:59.870> LG

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
yard old form I just feels like LG

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:01.600 
yard old form I just feels like LG
they're<00:05:00.470> getting<00:05:00.680> prayed<00:05:00.949> up<00:05:01.130> I<00:05:01.250> think<00:05:01.430> its

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
they're getting prayed up I think its

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.640 
they're getting prayed up I think its
uses<00:05:01.970> off<00:05:02.120> though<00:05:02.360> yeah<00:05:02.720> that's<00:05:02.960> because<00:05:03.139> our

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
uses off though yeah that's because our

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.469 
uses off though yeah that's because our
tail<00:05:03.919> is<00:05:04.159> most<00:05:04.370> definitely<00:05:04.610> dead<00:05:05.120> as<00:05:05.240> we<00:05:05.330> get

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
tail is most definitely dead as we get

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:06.730 
tail is most definitely dead as we get
