00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.630
 hello people i'm going to do today and titulaer about how to be without dignity 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.650
 sharma in the makers world can 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.880
 that did not occur this year for the first time, twente won twice 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.039
 both 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.210
 and I have heard of you 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.669
 in te 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:19.579
 I am I am only cap and own 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:22.579
 And yes, you have to go to the river district twice 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.460
 the kitchen that shows 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.460
 beilen you can use the and 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.000
 and then you have to put on 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.840
 and both not to stay sharp then you go but I became I go for a moment 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.679
 to the 

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:40.019
 light version and from that I don't have the full version 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.420
 and because they see erem and keep demanding time years when i think i have you 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.560
 nothing to it 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.800
 and therefore effectively a new binding 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.740
 you both have to do something, even the previous version cannot handle another 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.310
 important that does not work 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.660
 and 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.260
 yes i don't have much to do from this because your basket didn't do it to me 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.780
 had 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.640
 from 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.640
 are off the bus and cannot be made so date 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.150
 so i'm winning your imagination as well 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.800
 10 i am 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.580
 she the single year 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.670
 he did nothing anymore 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.670
 to make 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.470
 yes that criticism the army it is natural to take 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.770
 guardian divisions and 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.760
 and so you are your life 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.990
 so take a look 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.229
 You now have no leaks at all 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.590
 in his weather prices left the car or nothing 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.730
 we get it with someone but I have it 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.749
 that you shorten look here 

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:52.630
 are going to take it instead of the critical injection 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.280
 2 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.280
 That 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.640
 I had to read messages like this 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.970
 in los angeles fans to the market leaders so companies look and see you next 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.170
 work extremely hard
