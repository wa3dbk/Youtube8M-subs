00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.680
 Hi girls, today I 'll show you 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.340
 How do I model my hair? 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.420
 which is in the chanel beak cut with 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.939
 fringe 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.980
 I can model the back 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:23.189
 Full is the front part of the hair 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.200
 and I decided to make this video 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.009
 here to see you're 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.820
 I hope you like it and then we'll go. 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:35.370
 tutorial 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.930
 first I wait for my hair to dry 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.450
 Natural 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.280
 and that's when I get the dryer and go 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.040
 the dryer in the whole hair not with the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.950
 intention to dry but with the intention of 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:55.110
 to give a modeled type the more I 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:58.230
 step hand in hair and compared in 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.390
 dryer and also using the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.670
 Dedication mystic it gets 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.920
 you already know that my hair is 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.409
 curly 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.140
 So I 'm going to comb my hair and I'll leave the 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.010
 hair in crazy or even with the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.720
 hair dryer just to help give 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:25.380
 one stretched and then I'll comb the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:31.760
 hair and divide one into four parts two 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.760
 parts at the front and two parts behind 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:43.680
 It's important to leave that back 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:48.750
 encaixadinho well do with a cache to 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:52.970
 this part should be more rounded 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:57.540
 there I'm going to the iron 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:01.409
 because that back was already made 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.150
 The straight hair in her hair does not 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.280
 stay right 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.530
 with this cut at least that's what the 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.950
 be in my hair 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.550
 so I have to model well round 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.700
 behind 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:23.180
 good also inside as 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:27.580
 You can see there and then I go and I pass. 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:31.550
 the fingers in the middle there and separating this 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:35.960
 African and giving a more natural air 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:39.440
 you can see but it is important that the 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.290
 the entire back is done so 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:50.920
 well that good turn even with the 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:50.920
 and then just pass a god after 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.680
 Then I'll move on to the part 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.960
 the front and the front of the whole I 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.700
 I will not go on duty 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.590
 Then into the room like I did the 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:16.520
 back is important that it stays 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:22.310
 a little straighter to be able to stay 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:26.540
 so that the nozzle can appear and there 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.810
 I'll divide it into flour and then 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.030
 curling iron 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.550
 only as love doing its part 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.710
 a little bit behind 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.920
 I'm giving that curl a little 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.170
 more in the team part even if it is in this 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.000
 front but here you will find 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.480
 with the back 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:53.350
 I try to get one round of situation 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:56.300
 Then I take it round and that too 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:59.000
 type divided in two that part I already give 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.860
 even around the dinha more than the 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.160
 middle front is just gonna make a 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.650
 a little more suitable for her to be able 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:14.210
 be straight and in the hair and getting 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:20.270
 modeling knowing I'm just going to make a 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:22.850
 little more rounded and then this victory 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:26.480
 will be right at the very front 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:33.440
 how far is the rich I will do a little 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:37.240
 more delicate and so grows and 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.240
 even procedural and fifth on the other side 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.060
 Sometimes I like them too, too. 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.000
 I'm helping because the hair that is so 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:04.160
 hot time passing the iron 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.660
 Then I'll iron my hair and wear it. 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.050
 aid for not having the toed 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.050
 leaning 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:31.760
 So that's it and then when is it coming? 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.420
 here in the upper part is the same 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:40.660
 only thing that time there which left the 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:43.310
 my fringe is a bit more separate 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.930
 separates the province so I can do the 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.240
 rest of the hair because if not mine 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:51.290
 beach does not look right either 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:58.100
 if I do 11 the rest of my hair has to 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:06:05.240
 be made individually fell due to 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:07.600
 my beach also the two playgrounds or 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.600
 three 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:20.530
 and there she goes round the line to 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:23.610
 front and then when I start to model the 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.610
 hair the way I want it 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:35.170
 and then just put a spray on that hair 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:39.610
 is ready and jet and this me in the end 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:41.290
