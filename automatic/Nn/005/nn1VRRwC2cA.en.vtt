00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
important for me I find this such a long

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.620 
important for me I find this such a long
long<00:01:27.590> season<00:01:28.039> so<00:01:28.280> every<00:01:28.909> year<00:01:29.060> you<00:01:29.240> try<00:01:29.270> and

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
long season so every year you try and

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.700 
long season so every year you try and
modify<00:01:30.590> how<00:01:31.780> early<00:01:32.780> you<00:01:32.810> start<00:01:33.109> and<00:01:33.380> how<00:01:33.530> much

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.859 
modify how early you start and how much
training<00:01:33.950> you<00:01:34.189> do<00:01:34.340> so<00:01:35.179> that<00:01:35.210> you<00:01:35.450> still<00:01:35.689> have

energy<00:01:36.079> by<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.380> time<00:01:36.590> you<00:01:36.710> get<00:01:36.829> to<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.039> first

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
energy by the time you get to the first

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.090 
energy by the time you get to the first
race<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:38.479> you<00:01:38.630> feel<00:01:38.899> you<00:01:39.679> feel<00:01:39.859> like<00:01:39.979> your

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100

the mountains now come down down back to

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.260 
the mountains now come down down back to
kind<00:01:50.990> of<00:01:51.079> sea<00:01:51.229> level<00:01:51.380> it's<00:01:52.369> so<00:01:52.820> much<00:01:52.939> easier<00:01:52.969> to

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
kind of sea level it's so much easier to

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.669 
kind of sea level it's so much easier to
breathe<00:01:53.479> down<00:01:53.689> here<00:01:53.749> what<00:01:54.320> does<00:01:54.499> work

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
breathe down here what does work

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.210
