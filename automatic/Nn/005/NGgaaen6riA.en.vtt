00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
wicked loud fan we'll get to that in a

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.780 
wicked loud fan we'll get to that in a
little<00:01:31.890> bit<00:01:36.110> and<00:01:37.110> last<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.890> alzo<00:01:38.220> 3000

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
little bit and last is the alzo 3000

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.190 
little bit and last is the alzo 3000
which<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.479> somewhat<00:01:39.720> unique<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.140> that

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
which is somewhat unique in that

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.260 
which is somewhat unique in that
everything<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.430> contained<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.090> head

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
everything is contained in the head

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.179 
everything is contained in the head
itself<00:01:42.659> there<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> fan<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:43.860> here<00:01:44.040> but

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
itself there is a fan in here but

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.370 
itself there is a fan in here but
there's<00:01:44.340> no<00:01:44.399> ballast<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.810> all<00:01:46.140> there

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
there's no ballast so this is all there

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.380 
there's no ballast so this is all there
is<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.710> there's<00:01:46.860> actually<00:01:47.159> just<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.520> inline

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
is to it there's actually just a inline

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.170 
is to it there's actually just a inline
switch<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.049> power<00:01:49.229> cord<00:01:49.909> for<00:01:50.909> your<00:01:51.030> wall

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
switch and a power cord for your wall

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.749 
switch and a power cord for your wall
connection<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.720> that's<00:01:51.810> that's<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.649> makes<00:01:53.610> it

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
connection and that's that's it makes it

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.109 
connection and that's that's it makes it
really<00:01:53.970> portable<00:01:54.350> all<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.649> lights<00:01:55.829> come<00:01:56.070> with

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
really portable all the lights come with

some sort of dish this is the sky lux
this<00:02:01.229> one's<00:02:01.500> for<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.799> fotodiox<00:02:02.250> they<00:02:03.240> are<00:02:03.420> all

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
this one's for the fotodiox they are all

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.810 
this one's for the fotodiox they are all

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
only difference is the alsos is just the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.110 
only difference is the alsos is just the
the<00:02:12.890> tabs<00:02:13.130> under<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.460> little<00:02:13.730> bigger<00:02:13.880> so<00:02:13.940> they

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
the tabs under a little bigger so they

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.640 
the tabs under a little bigger so they
don't<00:02:14.300> fit<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.660> other<00:02:14.810> two<00:02:14.990> lights<00:02:15.230> even

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
don't fit the other two lights even

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.960 
don't fit the other two lights even
though<00:02:15.710> they<00:02:15.830> are<00:02:15.920> technically<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.490> same<00:02:16.760> I

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
though they are technically the same I

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.210 
though they are technically the same I
believe<00:02:17.300> so<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.290> fan<00:02:18.500> itself<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.040> sky

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
believe so the fan itself and the sky

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.400 
believe so the fan itself and the sky
Lux<00:02:19.430> is<00:02:19.580> pretty<00:02:19.970> quiet<00:02:20.240> but<00:02:20.510> with<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.230> dish

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
Lux is pretty quiet but with the dish

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.580 
Lux is pretty quiet but with the dish
mounted<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.820> actually<00:02:23.210> is<00:02:23.840> noticeably<00:02:24.410> louder

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
mounted it actually is noticeably louder

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.980 
mounted it actually is noticeably louder
I<00:02:27.970> don't<00:02:28.970> know<00:02:29.030> if<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.210> can<00:02:29.300> solve<00:02:29.480> that<00:02:29.690> with

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
I don't know if you can solve that with

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.560 
I don't know if you can solve that with
some<00:02:30.170> gaff<00:02:30.350> tape<00:02:30.380> or<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:31.010> different<00:02:31.390> dish<00:02:32.390> if

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
some gaff tape or a different dish if

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.970 
some gaff tape or a different dish if
you<00:02:32.600> need<00:02:32.810> one<00:02:32.990> or<00:02:33.080> a<00:02:33.110> softbox<00:02:33.530> or<00:02:33.740> something

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
you need one or a softbox or something

we<00:02:34.070> didn't<00:02:34.220> get<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:34.370> chance<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:35.300> test<00:02:35.480> that<00:02:35.720> but

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
we didn't get a chance to test that but

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.320 
we didn't get a chance to test that but
it's<00:02:36.050> worth<00:02:36.260> noting<00:02:36.620> so<00:02:37.610> we<00:02:37.730> tested<00:02:37.970> all<00:02:38.150> three

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
it's worth noting so we tested all three

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.760 
it's worth noting so we tested all three
lights<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.780> see<00:02:38.810> what<00:02:39.110> kind<00:02:39.290> of<00:02:39.320> output<00:02:39.500> they

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
lights to see what kind of output they

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.650 
lights to see what kind of output they
had<00:02:39.920> and<00:02:40.430> what<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.670> color<00:02:40.850> looked<00:02:41.090> like<00:02:41.270> the

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
had and what the color looked like the

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.000 
had and what the color looked like the
lights<00:02:41.840> themselves<00:02:41.990> are<00:02:42.350> really<00:02:42.470> simple<00:02:42.920> if

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
lights themselves are really simple if

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.210 
lights themselves are really simple if
you<00:02:43.100> have<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.790> LED<00:02:44.200> diode<00:02:45.200> itself<00:02:45.980> in<00:02:46.130> the

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
you have the LED diode itself in the

you have the LED diode itself in the

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
not a lot of high tech in here like any

not a lot of high tech in here like any
light<00:02:53.750> but<00:02:53.990> we<00:02:54.560> wanted<00:02:54.830> to<00:02:54.920> see<00:02:55.070> if<00:02:55.250> there's

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
light but we wanted to see if there's

actually any difference in the color of
