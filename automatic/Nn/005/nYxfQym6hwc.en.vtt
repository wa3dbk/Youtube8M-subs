i came across the book drawing with

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.840 
i came across the book drawing with

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
away by her philosophy that there's no

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.790 
away by her philosophy that there's no
right<00:00:20.220> or<00:00:20.460> wrong<00:00:20.699> in<00:00:21.090> art<00:00:21.420> anybody<00:00:22.410> can<00:00:22.650> learn

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
right or wrong in art anybody can learn

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.490 
right or wrong in art anybody can learn
how<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.490> draw<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:24.630> like<00:00:24.929> learning<00:00:25.109> enough

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
how to draw it's like learning enough

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.640 
how to draw it's like learning enough
abit<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.830> shapes<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:27.050> there<00:00:28.050> are<00:00:28.140> five<00:00:28.320> basic

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
abit of shapes and there are five basic

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.519 
abit of shapes and there are five basic
elements<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.460> shape<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.419> once<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.869> learn<00:00:31.169> to

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
elements of shape and once you learn to

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.069 
elements of shape and once you learn to
recognize<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.279> just<00:00:32.460> like<00:00:32.580> ABC<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.480> then<00:00:33.960> you

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
recognize it just like ABC and then you

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.590 
recognize it just like ABC and then you
can<00:00:34.260> write<00:00:34.410> your<00:00:34.590> name<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.100> then<00:00:36.000> sentences

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
can write your name and then sentences

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.190 
can write your name and then sentences
it's<00:00:36.900> the<00:00:37.050> same<00:00:37.640> process<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.330> you<00:00:39.390> start<00:00:39.840> very

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
it's the same process so you start very

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.830 
it's the same process so you start very
simply<00:00:40.500> knowing<00:00:41.370> these<00:00:41.640> five<00:00:41.910> basic<00:00:42.360> elements

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
simply knowing these five basic elements

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.960 
simply knowing these five basic elements
putting<00:00:43.230> them<00:00:43.320> together<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.860> create<00:00:44.280> drawings

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
putting them together to create drawings

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.760 
putting them together to create drawings
so<00:00:45.720> I<00:00:45.750> studied<00:00:46.440> with<00:00:46.620> her<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.190> then<00:00:47.510> in<00:00:48.770> 1995

individually rather than just a group
and<00:01:21.540> it's<00:01:22.290> really<00:01:22.560> important<00:01:23.130> for<00:01:23.190> them<00:01:23.460> for

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
and it's really important for them for

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.500 
and it's really important for them for
their<00:01:24.590> creativity<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:26.010> self-esteem<00:01:27.000> and

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
it's amazing to see for me the growth of

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.120 
it's amazing to see for me the growth of
students<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.260> really<00:01:31.620> don't<00:01:31.860> know<00:01:31.980> how<00:01:32.070> to

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
students that really don't know how to

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.670 
students that really don't know how to
draw<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.670> how<00:01:32.880> if<00:01:33.390> they<00:01:33.690> stay<00:01:34.050> with<00:01:34.409> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
draw and how if they stay with the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.570 
draw and how if they stay with the
program

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
program

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.550 
program
they<00:01:36.030> learn<00:01:36.360> how<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.570> draw<00:01:36.840> on<00:01:36.870> their<00:01:37.050> own<00:01:37.230> and

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
they learn how to draw on their own and

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.300 
they learn how to draw on their own and
that's<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.950> goal

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.060
