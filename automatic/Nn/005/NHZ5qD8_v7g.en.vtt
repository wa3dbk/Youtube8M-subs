00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
one or two mistakes I made while I was

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.470 
one or two mistakes I made while I was
making<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.010> video<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.610> I'll<00:00:50.730> point<00:00:51.059> them<00:00:51.300> out

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
making this video so I'll point them out

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.380 
making this video so I'll point them out
like<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.590> peg<00:00:53.010> right<00:00:53.309> there

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
like that peg right there

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.920 
like that peg right there
you'll<00:00:54.989> notice<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.829> has<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.370> uh<00:00:56.719> it<00:00:57.719> was

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
you'll notice that it has that uh it was

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.990 
you'll notice that it has that uh it was
in<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.170> wrong<00:00:58.410> place<00:00:58.640> earlier<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.850> video

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
in the wrong place earlier in the video

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.060 
in the wrong place earlier in the video
so<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.480> have<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.809> move<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:01.559> more<00:01:01.800> peg

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
so you have to move that one more peg

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.030 
so you have to move that one more peg
down<00:01:02.340> don't<00:01:02.850> pay<00:01:03.030> attention<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:04.650> little

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
down don't pay attention to that little

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.830 
down don't pay attention to that little
detail<00:01:05.460> when<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.820> first<00:01:06.060> shows<00:01:06.360> up<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
detail when it first shows up in the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.130 
detail when it first shows up in the
video<00:01:07.850> her<00:01:08.850> should<00:01:09.330> have<00:01:09.450> written<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.840> script

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
doesn't honestly look all that

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.710 
doesn't honestly look all that
complicated<00:01:31.430> but<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.759> know<00:01:32.939> once<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.299> start

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
complicated but you know once you start

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.480 
complicated but you know once you start
building<00:01:34.020> him<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.680> realize<00:01:35.220> there's

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
building him you realize there's

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.999

Bionicle oh my series is so muscular I
work<00:03:32.610> out<00:03:32.880> like<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:33.480> lot<00:03:34.050> in<00:03:34.290> real<00:03:34.530> life<00:03:34.800> and<00:03:35.130> I

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
work out like a lot in real life and I

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.470 
work out like a lot in real life and I
will<00:03:35.430> never<00:03:35.840> realistically<00:03:36.840> be<00:03:37.019> that<00:03:37.290> buff

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
see I always sort of imagines Ares is

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.780 
see I always sort of imagines Ares is
like<00:03:42.570> a<00:03:42.870> cross<00:03:43.800> between<00:03:44.480> Superman<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:45.510> spawn

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
like a cross between Superman and spawn

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.690 
like a cross between Superman and spawn
see<00:03:48.360> his<00:03:48.739> personality<00:03:49.739> and<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.220> lot<00:03:50.430> of<00:03:50.459> his

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
see his personality and a lot of his

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.630 
see his personality and a lot of his
demonic<00:03:51.150> abilities<00:03:51.930> like<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.950> black<00:03:53.220> fire

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
demonic abilities like the black fire

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.479 
demonic abilities like the black fire
the<00:03:54.000> telekinesis<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.349> mind<00:03:55.650> control<00:03:56.280> the

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
the telekinesis the mind control the

the telekinesis the mind control the
resurrecting<00:03:57.120> zombies<00:03:57.689> I<00:03:58.370> fairly<00:03:59.370> sure<00:03:59.549> spawn

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
resurrecting zombies I fairly sure spawn

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.910 
resurrecting zombies I fairly sure spawn
couldn't<00:04:00.420> resurrect<00:04:00.840> some<00:04:01.019> bees<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:01.439> was<00:04:01.680> my

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
couldn't resurrect some bees that was my

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.470 
couldn't resurrect some bees that was my
idea<00:04:02.390> so<00:04:04.069> there's<00:04:05.069> like<00:04:05.400> that<00:04:05.670> demonic<00:04:06.060> side

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
idea so there's like that demonic side

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.970 
idea so there's like that demonic side
of<00:04:06.659> him<00:04:06.780> but<00:04:06.989> then<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.349> flight<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:07.890> the

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
of him but then the flight and the

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.949 
of him but then the flight and the
super-strength<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:08.909> the<00:04:09.060> super<00:04:09.450> speed<00:04:09.750> and

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
super-strength and the super speed and

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.440 
super-strength and the super speed and
the<00:04:10.019> involuntary<00:04:10.319> bility<00:04:10.950> was<00:04:11.640> like<00:04:11.909> directly

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
the involuntary bility was like directly

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.180 
the involuntary bility was like directly
inspired<00:04:12.870> by<00:04:13.200> Superman<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:15.440> well<00:04:16.440> I<00:04:16.470> prefer

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
inspired by Superman and well I prefer

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.279 
inspired by Superman and well I prefer
Marvel<00:04:17.880> Comics<00:04:18.329> but<00:04:18.539> I<00:04:18.720> honestly<00:04:18.870> think

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
Marvel Comics but I honestly think

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.009 
Marvel Comics but I honestly think
Superman<00:04:20.220> is<00:04:20.430> an<00:04:20.729> interesting<00:04:21.419> character

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
Superman is an interesting character

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.330 
Superman is an interesting character
he's<00:04:22.979> kind<00:04:23.280> of<00:04:23.400> boring<00:04:23.789> like<00:04:24.360> on<00:04:24.600> his<00:04:24.810> own<00:04:25.340> but

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
he's kind of boring like on his own but

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.330 
he's kind of boring like on his own but
I<00:04:26.550> always<00:04:26.820> thought<00:04:27.570> he<00:04:27.630> was<00:04:27.960> way<00:04:28.260> more

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
I always thought he was way more

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.740 
I always thought he was way more
interesting<00:04:29.340> when<00:04:29.520> he<00:04:29.550> was<00:04:29.880> evil

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
interesting when he was evil

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.990 
interesting when he was evil
so<00:04:31.380> that<00:04:31.650> was<00:04:31.830> actually<00:04:32.010> a<00:04:32.400> big<00:04:32.639> part<00:04:32.850> of

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
so that was actually a big part of

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.560 
so that was actually a big part of
Zuri's<00:04:33.449> inspiration<00:04:34.289> right<00:04:34.800> there<00:04:35.190> all<00:04:36.150> right

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
Zuri's inspiration right there all right

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.800 
Zuri's inspiration right there all right
well<00:04:36.960> that's<00:04:37.380> my<00:04:37.680> time<00:04:37.710> for<00:04:38.280> today<00:04:38.729> I<00:04:39.539> hope

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
well that's my time for today I hope
