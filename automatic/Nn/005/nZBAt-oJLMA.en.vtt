the<00:02:21.420> trouble<00:02:21.630> was<00:02:21.840> your<00:02:21.959> biggest<00:02:22.080> complaint

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
the trouble was your biggest complaint

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.229 
the trouble was your biggest complaint
about<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.680> m80<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.190> XS<00:02:23.610> has<00:02:23.880> sought<00:02:24.209> to

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
about the m80 the XS has sought to

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.720 
about the m80 the XS has sought to
address<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:24.900> somewhat<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:26.160> mid<00:02:26.340> range<00:02:26.489> for

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
address that somewhat the mid range for

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.259 
address that somewhat the mid range for
the<00:02:26.820> most<00:02:26.970> part<00:02:27.620> sound<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.739> same<00:02:29.269> maybe

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
the most part sound the same maybe

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.880 
the most part sound the same maybe
they're<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.540> little<00:02:30.600> bit<00:02:30.900> wider<00:02:31.230> on<00:02:31.410> these<00:02:31.680> but

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
they're a little bit wider on these but

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.380 
they're a little bit wider on these but
I<00:02:31.950> guess<00:02:32.160> that's<00:02:32.340> because<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.820> mid<00:02:33.030> bass<00:02:33.180> has

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
I guess that's because the mid bass has

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.290 
I guess that's because the mid bass has
been<00:02:33.540> toned<00:02:33.780> down<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:34.380> those<00:02:34.560> vocals<00:02:35.300> been

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
been toned down and so those vocals been

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.970 
been toned down and so those vocals been
taken<00:02:36.600> down<00:02:36.720> just<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.989> little<00:02:37.019> bit<00:02:37.230> but<00:02:37.890> they

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
taken down just a little bit but they

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.920 
taken down just a little bit but they
sound<00:02:38.250> fantastic<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:39.390> problems<00:02:39.720> from<00:02:39.780> the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
sound fantastic the problems from the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.479 
sound fantastic the problems from the
original<00:02:40.320> m80<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:40.800> have<00:02:40.920> crossed<00:02:41.070> over<00:02:41.280> to

at 100 also I've noticed that since this

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.750 
at 100 also I've noticed that since this
case<00:03:22.320> is<00:03:22.530> so<00:03:23.519> compact<00:03:23.940> when<00:03:24.180> it's<00:03:24.299> folded<00:03:24.600> up

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.780 
case is so compact when it's folded up
you<00:03:26.760> basically<00:03:27.470> can't<00:03:28.470> really<00:03:28.709> fit<00:03:29.069> the<00:03:29.520> cord

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
turn them sideways then you see how

sit<00:05:59.260> there<00:05:59.470> and<00:05:59.650> I<00:06:00.100> try<00:06:00.310> to<00:06:00.340> drown<00:06:01.030> the<00:06:01.240> world

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
sit there and I try to drown the world

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.180 
sit there and I try to drown the world
out<00:06:01.660> so<00:06:01.780> I<00:06:01.810> can<00:06:01.990> concentrate<00:06:02.200> on<00:06:02.620> whatever<00:06:03.010> I'm

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
out so I can concentrate on whatever I'm

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.930 
out so I can concentrate on whatever I'm
doing<00:06:04.410> usually<00:06:05.410> can't<00:06:05.650> videos<00:06:05.980> so<00:06:06.610> the<00:06:06.730> big

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
doing usually can't videos so the big

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.300 
doing usually can't videos so the big
question<00:06:07.090> arises<00:06:07.810> how<00:06:08.650> well<00:06:08.950> do<00:06:09.160> these

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
question arises how well do these

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
question arises how well do these
isolate<00:06:10.020> well<00:06:11.280> since<00:06:12.280> they<00:06:12.490> use<00:06:12.730> basically

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
isolate well since they use basically

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.990 
isolate well since they use basically
the<00:06:13.480> same<00:06:13.660> exact<00:06:14.050> ear<00:06:14.230> pads<00:06:14.470> is<00:06:14.620> the<00:06:14.740> m80<00:06:15.100> they

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
the same exact ear pads is the m80 they

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.940 
the same exact ear pads is the m80 they
isolate<00:06:16.480> about<00:06:16.720> exactly<00:06:17.290> the<00:06:17.530> same<00:06:17.710> as<00:06:17.860> the

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 
isolate about exactly the same as the

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.220 
isolate about exactly the same as the
m80<00:06:18.250> which<00:06:19.000> isn't<00:06:19.150> a<00:06:19.330> bad<00:06:19.540> thing<00:06:19.870> I<00:06:20.020> mean<00:06:20.050> on

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:20.230 
m80 which isn't a bad thing I mean on

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.050 
m80 which isn't a bad thing I mean on
the<00:06:20.350> subway<00:06:20.740> and<00:06:20.770> on<00:06:20.950> buses<00:06:21.010> it's<00:06:21.550> fine<00:06:21.850> you

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
the subway and on buses it's fine you

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.520 
the subway and on buses it's fine you
can<00:06:22.120> still<00:06:22.420> hear<00:06:22.540> the<00:06:22.660> noise<00:06:22.930> coming<00:06:23.260> through

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
can still hear the noise coming through

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.680 
can still hear the noise coming through
you<00:06:24.220> know<00:06:24.340> nothing's<00:06:24.670> gonna<00:06:24.790> isolate<00:06:25.090> as<00:06:25.390> well

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
you know nothing's gonna isolate as well

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.500 
you know nothing's gonna isolate as well
as<00:06:25.810> a<00:06:25.840> pair<00:06:26.110> of<00:06:26.140> IEMs<00:06:27.060> but<00:06:28.060> it's<00:06:28.180> it's

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
as a pair of IEMs but it's it's

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.300 
as a pair of IEMs but it's it's
tolerable<00:06:28.720> and<00:06:29.200> if<00:06:29.650> your<00:06:29.770> music<00:06:30.070> is<00:06:30.160> loud

enough don't turn it up too loud that's

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.200 
enough don't turn it up too loud that's
bad<00:06:32.740> for<00:06:32.920> your<00:06:32.980> ears<00:06:33.130> but<00:06:33.850> if<00:06:33.940> you<00:06:34.030> add<00:06:34.180> a

one of the biggest complaints about the

about three weeks of constant use before

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.670 
about three weeks of constant use before
