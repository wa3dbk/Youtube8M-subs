well<00:00:08.140> I<00:00:08.170> guess<00:00:08.440> I've<00:00:08.650> got<00:00:08.680> one<00:00:08.980> I<00:00:09.010> guess<00:00:09.280> it's

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:09.460 
well I guess I've got one I guess it's

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.810 
well I guess I've got one I guess it's
there<00:00:09.700> it's<00:00:10.030> sort<00:00:10.660> of<00:00:10.750> doing<00:00:11.170> things

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
there it's sort of doing things

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.610 
there it's sort of doing things
most<00:00:12.820> the<00:00:12.940> time<00:00:13.299> don't<00:00:13.959> really<00:00:14.170> know<00:00:14.290> what<00:00:14.469> is

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:14.620 
most the time don't really know what is

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.100 
most the time don't really know what is
doing<00:00:14.950> I<00:00:15.100> don't<00:00:15.940> have<00:00:16.090> any<00:00:16.209> in-depth

doing I don't have any in-depth
technical<00:00:17.529> knowledge<00:00:17.920> about<00:00:18.189> the<00:00:18.340> brain<00:00:18.550> I

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:18.790 
technical knowledge about the brain I

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.060 
technical knowledge about the brain I
know<00:00:19.330> where<00:00:19.480> it<00:00:19.540> is<00:00:19.750> suppose<00:00:20.680> that's<00:00:20.860> why<00:00:20.980> I'm

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
know where it is suppose that's why I'm

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.090 
know where it is suppose that's why I'm
interested<00:00:21.279> in<00:00:21.550> seeing<00:00:22.300> it<00:00:22.570> I<00:00:22.779> think<00:00:23.680> it's<00:00:23.980> a

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100 
interested in seeing it I think it's a

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.580 
interested in seeing it I think it's a
great<00:00:24.279> opportunity<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:26.199> actually<00:00:26.289> have<00:00:26.560> a

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
great opportunity to actually have a

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.099 
great opportunity to actually have a
look<00:00:26.740> inside<00:00:26.890> my<00:00:27.100> own<00:00:27.250> head<00:00:27.369> and<00:00:27.580> see<00:00:28.109> possibly

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
look inside my own head and see possibly

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:31.410 
look inside my own head and see possibly
what's<00:00:29.350> going<00:00:29.590> on<00:00:29.680> there<00:00:30.060> at<00:00:31.060> the<00:00:31.150> end<00:00:31.240> of<00:00:31.330> it

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
what's going on there at the end of it

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.200 
what's going on there at the end of it
I'll<00:00:31.750> have<00:00:31.930> something<00:00:32.160> great<00:00:33.160> to<00:00:33.220> show<00:00:33.550> I<00:00:33.879> have

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
I'll have something great to show I have

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.610 
I'll have something great to show I have
a<00:00:34.239> picture<00:00:34.720> my<00:00:34.809> brain<00:00:35.050> I<00:00:35.080> can<00:00:35.320> put<00:00:35.440> on<00:00:35.530> my

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
a picture my brain I can put on my

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.340 
a picture my brain I can put on my
facebook<00:00:36.100> site

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.770 

my<00:00:41.920> feelings<00:00:42.220> about<00:00:42.340> the<00:00:42.460> scan<00:00:42.730> now<00:00:43.000> I<00:00:43.390> suppose

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
my feelings about the scan now I suppose

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.840 
my feelings about the scan now I suppose
I'm<00:00:43.989> a<00:00:44.079> bit<00:00:44.260> ambiguous<00:00:44.530> because<00:00:44.950> I'm<00:00:45.520> still

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
I'm a bit ambiguous because I'm still

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.479 
I'm a bit ambiguous because I'm still
really<00:00:46.059> interested<00:00:46.450> to<00:00:46.480> get<00:00:46.690> me<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:48.100> result

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
really interested to get me the result

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.610 
really interested to get me the result
but<00:00:49.210> I'm<00:00:49.360> getting<00:00:49.690> slightly<00:00:50.200> more<00:00:50.350> nervous

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
but I'm getting slightly more nervous

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.500 
but I'm getting slightly more nervous
about<00:00:50.890> the<00:00:51.190> process<00:00:51.610> after<00:00:51.820> saying<00:00:52.270> about

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
about the process after saying about

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.530 
about the process after saying about
being<00:00:53.500> put<00:00:53.710> into<00:00:53.920> I<00:00:54.460> don't<00:00:54.730> mind<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.180> confined

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
being put into I don't mind the confined

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.290 
being put into I don't mind the confined
space<00:00:55.680> but<00:00:56.680> it's<00:00:56.860> it's<00:00:57.309> the<00:00:57.519> space<00:00:57.820> with<00:00:58.120> this

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
space but it's it's the space with this

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.400 
space but it's it's the space with this
huge<00:00:58.750> magnetic<00:00:59.290> field<00:01:00.930> I'm<00:01:01.930> wondering<00:01:02.320> if

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
huge magnetic field I'm wondering if

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.869 
huge magnetic field I'm wondering if
I'll<00:01:02.530> come<00:01:02.739> out<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:03.040> same<00:01:03.190> person<00:01:03.580> as<00:01:03.640> I<00:01:03.730> went

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
I'll come out the same person as I went

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:10.080 
I'll come out the same person as I went
in<00:01:08.220> when<00:01:09.220> I<00:01:09.310> looked<00:01:09.550> at<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.700> questionnaire

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
in when I looked at the questionnaire

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.150 
in when I looked at the questionnaire
then<00:01:10.210> I<00:01:10.270> suddenly<00:01:10.619> started<00:01:11.619> to<00:01:11.680> realize<00:01:12.009> it

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
then I suddenly started to realize it

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.359 
then I suddenly started to realize it
actually<00:01:12.640> it's<00:01:12.850> quite<00:01:13.000> this<00:01:13.330> serious<00:01:13.780> process

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
actually it's quite this serious process

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.499 
actually it's quite this serious process
I'd<00:01:15.840> possibly<00:01:16.840> been<00:01:17.170> a<00:01:17.200> bit<00:01:17.850> flippant<00:01:18.850> about

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
I'd possibly been a bit flippant about

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.749 
I'd possibly been a bit flippant about
seeing<00:01:19.990> it<00:01:20.080> as<00:01:20.229> okay<00:01:20.890> it's<00:01:21.009> just<00:01:21.160> I<00:01:21.369> just<00:01:21.640> go

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
seeing it as okay it's just I just go

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:30.180 
seeing it as okay it's just I just go
and<00:01:21.910> I<00:01:21.970> get<00:01:22.030> scanned<00:01:22.450> it's<00:01:22.720> no<00:01:22.840> big<00:01:23.050> deal<00:01:29.190> when

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
and I get scanned it's no big deal when

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.040 
and I get scanned it's no big deal when
I<00:01:30.220> noticed<00:01:30.610> all<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:30.789> questions<00:01:31.210> about<00:01:31.509> metal

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
I noticed all the questions about metal

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.700 
I noticed all the questions about metal
and<00:01:33.270> surgery<00:01:34.270> and<00:01:34.420> clips<00:01:35.050> and<00:01:35.229> things<00:01:35.440> inside

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
and surgery and clips and things inside

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.650 
and surgery and clips and things inside
the<00:01:35.860> body<00:01:36.070> I<00:01:36.369> realized<00:01:37.060> that<00:01:37.210> there<00:01:37.360> you<00:01:37.509> know

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
the body I realized that there you know

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.660 
the body I realized that there you know
there<00:01:37.990> were<00:01:38.080> safety<00:01:38.289> issues<00:01:38.619> involved<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:39.220> it

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
there were safety issues involved and it

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.120 
there were safety issues involved and it
was<00:01:39.880> quite<00:01:40.119> a<00:01:40.149> powerful<00:01:40.450> thing<00:01:41.020> that<00:01:41.289> I'd<00:01:41.950> be

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
was quite a powerful thing that I'd be

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.180 
was quite a powerful thing that I'd be
subjecting<00:01:42.820> myself<00:01:42.970> to<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:44.649> see<00:01:44.800> what<00:01:44.979> I<00:01:45.009> need

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
subjecting myself to and see what I need

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.560 
subjecting myself to and see what I need
you<00:01:45.400> to<00:01:45.840> remove<00:01:46.840> all<00:01:47.110> your<00:01:47.170> metal<00:01:47.560> items<00:01:48.009> so

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
you to remove all your metal items so

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:57.770 
you to remove all your metal items so
any<00:01:49.570> necklaces

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.450 

it's<00:01:58.780> sort<00:01:59.079> of<00:01:59.110> fairly<00:01:59.460> straightforward

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
it's sort of fairly straightforward

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.120 
it's sort of fairly straightforward
process<00:02:00.880> gradually<00:02:01.659> you<00:02:02.290> find<00:02:02.740> is<00:02:02.799> have<00:02:02.920> more

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
process gradually you find is have more

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.420 
process gradually you find is have more

and more constrained like from what in

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.419 
and more constrained like from what in
my<00:02:06.640> imagination<00:02:07.210> was<00:02:07.299> just<00:02:07.539> hearing<00:02:07.750> me

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
my imagination was just hearing me

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.199 
my imagination was just hearing me

unfettered going through this machine
you<00:02:10.720> know<00:02:10.810> sort<00:02:11.019> of<00:02:11.050> lying<00:02:11.319> down<00:02:11.530> in<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:11.830> sort

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
you know sort of lying down in the sort

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.030

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.750 
and then you get this sort of strange

then<00:02:27.760> I<00:02:27.910> think<00:02:28.120> I<00:02:28.239> was<00:02:28.769> if<00:02:29.769> I<00:02:29.950> had<00:02:30.100> been

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
then I think I was if I had been

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.039 
then I think I was if I had been
claustrophobic<00:02:30.880> I<00:02:31.000> probably<00:02:31.239> would<00:02:31.480> have<00:02:31.600> you

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
claustrophobic I probably would have you

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.050 
claustrophobic I probably would have you
know<00:02:32.080> not<00:02:32.470> been<00:02:32.650> very<00:02:32.830> happy<00:02:33.010> at<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.430> point

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.619 

you<00:02:37.060> ready<00:02:37.209> to<00:02:37.330> go<00:02:37.450> here<00:02:38.440> we<00:02:38.530> go

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.280

it's<00:02:45.890> very<00:02:46.040> noisy<00:02:46.190> there's<00:02:46.819> the<00:02:47.090> noise<00:02:47.239> which

it's very noisy there's the noise which

it's very noisy there's the noise which
is<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:48.560> think<00:02:48.800> is<00:02:49.099> it<00:02:49.220> some<00:02:49.370> pulses<00:02:49.700> from<00:02:50.300> the

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
is I think is it some pulses from the

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.670 
is I think is it some pulses from the
magnet<00:02:52.010> it's<00:02:52.400> almost<00:02:52.550> like<00:02:52.700> a<00:02:52.930> 12<00:02:53.930> minute<00:02:54.140> walk

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
I think previously I thought it is a big

I think previously I thought it is a big
just<00:03:54.950> a<00:03:55.069> sort<00:03:55.250> of<00:03:55.280> general<00:03:55.670> mass<00:03:56.329> but<00:03:56.660> now<00:03:56.780> I'm

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
just a sort of general mass but now I'm

just a sort of general mass but now I'm

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
distinguished parts of it so it might

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.789 
distinguished parts of it so it might
change<00:04:02.209> how<00:04:02.870> I<00:04:02.930> think<00:04:03.049> of<00:04:03.260> my<00:04:03.470> interior

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
change how I think of my interior

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:16.069 
change how I think of my interior
