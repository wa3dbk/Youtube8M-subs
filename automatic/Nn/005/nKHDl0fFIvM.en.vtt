for sending me the plane to take a look
at<00:00:37.640> and<00:00:37.870> I<00:00:38.870> have<00:00:39.019> to<00:00:39.140> say<00:00:39.379> sort<00:00:39.710> of<00:00:39.920> right<00:00:40.220> out

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
of the chute here that I was a little

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.680 
of the chute here that I was a little
concerned<00:00:42.620> when<00:00:42.710> I<00:00:42.800> got<00:00:43.040> the<00:00:43.190> Box<00:00:43.430> cuz<00:00:43.850> it

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
concerned when I got the Box cuz it

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.719 
concerned when I got the Box cuz it
looked<00:00:44.899> like<00:00:45.079> it<00:00:45.260> had<00:00:45.290> gone<00:00:45.559> 12<00:00:46.159> rounds<00:00:46.339> with

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:46.729 
looked like it had gone 12 rounds with

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:48.040 
looked like it had gone 12 rounds with
Mike<00:00:46.909> Tyson

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
Mike Tyson

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.619 
Mike Tyson
it<00:00:48.320> wasn't<00:00:48.890> handled<00:00:49.309> very<00:00:49.850> well<00:00:50.030> and<00:00:50.390> it's

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
it wasn't handled very well and it's

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.869 
it wasn't handled very well and it's
transit<00:00:51.140> from<00:00:51.320> China<00:00:52.159> to<00:00:52.460> a<00:00:52.489> beautiful

British Columbia but when I opened the
Box<00:00:55.340> I<00:00:55.579> was<00:00:55.609> pleasantly<00:00:56.300> surprised<00:00:56.750> to<00:00:56.960> see

Box I was pleasantly surprised to see
that<00:00:57.199> it<00:00:58.039> was<00:00:58.280> really<00:00:58.730> well<00:00:58.850> packed<00:00:59.179> and<00:00:59.539> that

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
that it was really well packed and that

there was no damage whatsoever to any of
the<00:01:01.940> contents<00:01:04.750> one<00:01:05.750> of<00:01:05.869> the<00:01:05.960> more<00:01:06.170> interesting

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
the contents one of the more interesting

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.889 
the contents one of the more interesting
features<00:01:06.830> of<00:01:07.220> this<00:01:07.369> plane<00:01:07.700> is<00:01:07.940> that<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.509> fuse

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
features of this plane is that the fuse

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.139 
features of this plane is that the fuse
is<00:01:09.110> made<00:01:09.289> out<00:01:09.410> of<00:01:09.500> PVC<00:01:09.740> plastic<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:10.940> we'll

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
is made out of PVC plastic and we'll

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.440 
is made out of PVC plastic and we'll
cover<00:01:11.420> that<00:01:11.539> off<00:01:11.810> a<00:01:11.840> little<00:01:12.020> bit<00:01:12.320> more<00:01:12.500> later

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
cover that off a little bit more later

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.120 
cover that off a little bit more later
for<00:01:14.450> now<00:01:14.570> let's<00:01:14.869> just<00:01:14.960> take<00:01:15.380> a<00:01:15.409> look<00:01:15.679> at<00:01:15.830> the

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
for now let's just take a look at the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.530 
for now let's just take a look at the
bits<00:01:16.550> and<00:01:16.700> pieces<00:01:16.940> that<00:01:17.149> come<00:01:17.479> with<00:01:17.630> a<00:01:17.659> kit

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:30.020 

I<00:01:27.710> would<00:01:28.710> say<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.040> for<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.310> most<00:01:29.520> part<00:01:29.640> all

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
I would say that for the most part all

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.970 
I would say that for the most part all
of<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.420> stuff<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.110> came<00:01:31.260> with<00:01:31.440> a<00:01:31.470> kit<00:01:31.800> is

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
of the stuff that came with a kit is

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.720 
of the stuff that came with a kit is
good<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.760> have<00:01:33.480> a<00:01:33.510> few<00:01:33.840> minor<00:01:34.340> issues<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.580> I'd

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
good I have a few minor issues that I'd

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.360 
good I have a few minor issues that I'd
like<00:01:35.940> to<00:01:35.970> take<00:01:36.690> a<00:01:36.750> harder<00:01:37.170> look<00:01:37.320> at<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:37.830> for

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
like to take a harder look at but for

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.420 
like to take a harder look at but for
the<00:01:38.460> most<00:01:38.610> part<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.150> looks<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:40.110> great<00:01:40.430> I'm

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
the most part it looks just great I'm

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.580 
the most part it looks just great I'm
going<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.700> reserve<00:01:41.970> judgment<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.780> anything

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
going to reserve judgment on anything

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.800 
going to reserve judgment on anything
that<00:01:44.010> I<00:01:44.250> think<00:01:44.760> might<00:01:45.030> be<00:01:45.060> an<00:01:45.330> issue<00:01:45.450> right<00:01:45.600> now

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
that I think might be an issue right now

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.719 
that I think might be an issue right now
until<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.440> get<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.710> chance<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.100> build<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.520> plane

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
until I get a chance to build the plane

00:01:47.729 --> 00:02:04.260 
until I get a chance to build the plane
up<00:01:47.880> properly<00:01:48.330> and<00:01:48.570> do<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.870> maiden

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.660 

one<00:02:04.869> thing<00:02:05.049> I<00:02:05.140> noticed<00:02:05.530> is<00:02:05.740> that<00:02:05.770> on<00:02:06.189> all<00:02:06.490> of

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
one thing I noticed is that on all of

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.839 
one thing I noticed is that on all of
the<00:02:06.880> hinged<00:02:07.689> surfaces<00:02:08.560> they're<00:02:09.310> very<00:02:09.520> free

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
the hinged surfaces they're very free

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.670 
the hinged surfaces they're very free
they<00:02:10.090> move<00:02:10.270> very<00:02:10.300> easily<00:02:10.599> there's<00:02:11.200> no<00:02:11.290> break

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
they move very easily there's no break

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.620 
they move very easily there's no break
and<00:02:11.890> required<00:02:12.280> as<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.819> matter<00:02:12.910> of<00:02:13.060> fact<00:02:13.300> there's

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
and required as a matter of fact there's

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.010 
and required as a matter of fact there's
so<00:02:13.840> little<00:02:13.870> foam<00:02:14.530> left<00:02:15.520> to<00:02:16.000> form<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.780> hinge

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
so little foam left to form the hinge

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.830 
so little foam left to form the hinge
that<00:02:17.770> you<00:02:18.520> can<00:02:18.670> see<00:02:18.849> daylight<00:02:19.060> through<00:02:19.270> it<00:02:19.630> and

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
that you can see daylight through it and

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.449 
that you can see daylight through it and
I'm<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.230> little<00:02:20.440> bit<00:02:20.560> concerned<00:02:20.739> that<00:02:21.069> maybe

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
I'm a little bit concerned that maybe

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.670 
I'm a little bit concerned that maybe
it's<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.700> little<00:02:21.819> bit<00:02:22.030> too<00:02:22.209> thin<00:02:22.480> so<00:02:23.200> I'm<00:02:23.500> going

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
it's a little bit too thin so I'm going

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.680 
it's a little bit too thin so I'm going
to<00:02:23.739> be<00:02:23.890> laminating<00:02:24.849> these<00:02:25.000> wings<00:02:25.269> anyway

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
to be laminating these wings anyway

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.540 
to be laminating these wings anyway
because<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.140> understand<00:02:26.800> that<00:02:26.890> they're<00:02:27.220> prone

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
because I understand that they're prone

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.699 
because I understand that they're prone
to<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.730> little<00:02:28.000> bit<00:02:28.060> of<00:02:28.180> flexing<00:02:28.709> especially

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
to a little bit of flexing especially

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.320 
to a little bit of flexing especially
when<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:29.980> get<00:02:30.099> them<00:02:30.340> loaded<00:02:30.550> down<00:02:30.819> with<00:02:30.880> a<00:02:31.090> lot

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
when you get them loaded down with a lot

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.259 
when you get them loaded down with a lot
of<00:02:31.480> weight<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:33.069> laminating<00:02:33.640> will<00:02:33.760> take<00:02:33.970> care

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
of weight the laminating will take care

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.229 
of weight the laminating will take care
of<00:02:34.450> reinforcing<00:02:35.260> all<00:02:35.440> of<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:36.060> hinges<00:02:37.060> on<00:02:37.209> the

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.340 

one<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.330> really<00:02:57.600> cool<00:02:57.750> things<00:02:58.020> about<00:02:58.140> this

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
one of the really cool things about this

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.740 
one of the really cool things about this
plane<00:02:58.740> is<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.370> fuse<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.000> tail<00:03:00.210> assembly

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
plane is that the fuse and tail assembly

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.980 
plane is that the fuse and tail assembly
is<00:03:01.020> all<00:03:01.410> made<00:03:01.590> out<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.890> PVC<00:03:02.280> plastic<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.540> it's

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
is all made out of PVC plastic and it's

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.830 
is all made out of PVC plastic and it's
the<00:03:04.080> same<00:03:04.260> plastic<00:03:04.530> you'd<00:03:05.040> get<00:03:05.250> at<00:03:05.400> Home<00:03:05.640> Depot

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
the same plastic you'd get at Home Depot

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.820 
the same plastic you'd get at Home Depot
when<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:06.960> bought<00:03:07.140> PVC<00:03:07.650> piping<00:03:08.120> super-tough

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
when you bought PVC piping super-tough

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.610 
when you bought PVC piping super-tough
it's<00:03:10.830> going<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.490> certainly<00:03:12.420> eliminate<00:03:13.140> any

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
it's going to certainly eliminate any

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.710 
it's going to certainly eliminate any
hanger<00:03:14.040> rafts<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.520> would<00:03:14.730> current<00:03:15.390> normally

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
hanger rafts that would current normally

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.199 
hanger rafts that would current normally
to<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:15.900> fuse<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.740> suspect<00:03:17.370> it<00:03:17.520> would<00:03:17.880> handle

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
to a fuse and I suspect it would handle

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:26.720 
to a fuse and I suspect it would handle
a<00:03:18.300> crash<00:03:18.540> quite<00:03:18.900> well<00:03:19.050> to<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:25.459> inside<00:03:26.459> of<00:03:26.640> this

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
a crash quite well to the inside of this

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.270 
a crash quite well to the inside of this
plane<00:03:27.030> is<00:03:27.270> just<00:03:27.300> enormous<00:03:28.110> it's<00:03:28.620> like<00:03:28.830> a<00:03:28.860> small

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
plane is just enormous it's like a small

Cup it's going to take a review I know
this<00:04:01.600> is<00:04:01.750> just<00:04:01.780> an<00:04:02.140> unbox<00:04:02.530> video<00:04:02.920> but<00:04:03.130> I

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
this is just an unbox video but I

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.520 
this is just an unbox video but I
normally<00:04:03.700> try<00:04:03.970> to<00:04:04.000> include<00:04:04.720> a<00:04:04.960> little<00:04:05.230> bit<00:04:05.320> of

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
normally try to include a little bit of

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.280 
normally try to include a little bit of
video<00:04:05.710> of<00:04:06.250> what<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.210> plane<00:04:07.450> looks<00:04:07.720> like<00:04:08.020> when

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
video of what the plane looks like when

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.590 
video of what the plane looks like when
it's<00:04:08.470> assembled<00:04:08.850> so<00:04:09.850> in<00:04:09.970> this<00:04:10.120> case<00:04:10.360> I<00:04:10.570> just

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
it's assembled so in this case I just

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.440 
it's assembled so in this case I just
mocked<00:04:11.050> it<00:04:11.230> up<00:04:11.380> -<00:04:11.620> to<00:04:12.130> give<00:04:12.580> you<00:04:12.670> a<00:04:12.760> look<00:04:13.060> at<00:04:13.270> it

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
mocked it up - to give you a look at it

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.920 
mocked it up - to give you a look at it
but<00:04:14.200> my<00:04:14.560> intent<00:04:14.890> is<00:04:15.040> to<00:04:15.359> take<00:04:16.359> it<00:04:16.450> apart<00:04:16.750> and

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
but my intent is to take it apart and

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.830 
but my intent is to take it apart and
build<00:04:17.560> it<00:04:17.680> up<00:04:17.769> properly<00:04:18.390> I'll<00:04:19.390> be<00:04:19.540> getting<00:04:19.810> to

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
build it up properly I'll be getting to

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.810 
build it up properly I'll be getting to
the<00:04:20.080> build<00:04:20.290> on<00:04:20.500> this<00:04:20.680> just<00:04:20.920> as<00:04:21.100> soon<00:04:21.280> as<00:04:21.400> I<00:04:21.549> can

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
the build on this just as soon as I can

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.610 
the build on this just as soon as I can
but<00:04:21.850> I've<00:04:22.210> got<00:04:22.390> a<00:04:22.420> couple<00:04:22.630> of<00:04:22.870> other<00:04:23.050> projects

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
but I've got a couple of other projects

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.710 
but I've got a couple of other projects
on<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:24.100> bench<00:04:24.340> that<00:04:24.700> I<00:04:24.880> need<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.270> get<00:04:25.450> to

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
on the bench that I need to get to

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.860 
on the bench that I need to get to
before<00:04:26.110> I<00:04:26.140> do<00:04:26.230> this<00:04:26.470> one<00:04:26.910> this<00:04:27.910> plane<00:04:28.210> is<00:04:28.450> you

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
before I do this one this plane is you

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.690 
before I do this one this plane is you
know<00:04:28.990> you<00:04:29.230> could<00:04:29.470> just<00:04:29.890> take<00:04:30.070> it<00:04:30.130> up<00:04:30.280> and<00:04:30.490> fly

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
know you could just take it up and fly

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.400 
know you could just take it up and fly
it<00:04:30.760> I<00:04:30.910> suppose<00:04:31.180> but<00:04:31.420> there<00:04:31.960> are<00:04:32.110> a<00:04:32.170> number<00:04:32.290> of

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
it I suppose but there are a number of

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.050 
it I suppose but there are a number of
things<00:04:32.560> that<00:04:32.830> I'd<00:04:33.040> like<00:04:33.190> to<00:04:33.220> do<00:04:33.520> to<00:04:33.700> it<00:04:33.850> before

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
things that I'd like to do to it before

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.870 
things that I'd like to do to it before
its<00:04:34.900> maiden<00:04:35.170> and<00:04:35.490> I'm<00:04:36.490> going<00:04:36.640> to<00:04:36.700> take<00:04:36.850> a

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
its maiden and I'm going to take a

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.420 
its maiden and I'm going to take a
little<00:04:37.090> bit<00:04:37.180> of<00:04:37.240> time<00:04:37.510> to<00:04:38.160> laminate<00:04:39.160> all<00:04:39.280> the

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
little bit of time to laminate all the

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.030 
little bit of time to laminate all the
foam<00:04:39.640> and<00:04:39.910> then<00:04:40.270> there's<00:04:41.140> a<00:04:41.200> modification<00:04:41.710> to

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
foam and then there's a modification to

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.770 
foam and then there's a modification to
the<00:04:42.280> landing<00:04:42.670> gear<00:04:42.850> that<00:04:43.030> I<00:04:43.060> intend<00:04:43.450> to<00:04:43.600> do

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
the landing gear that I intend to do

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.650 
the landing gear that I intend to do
just<00:04:44.590> to<00:04:44.710> make<00:04:44.740> it<00:04:44.919> a<00:04:45.160> little<00:04:45.340> more

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
just to make it a little more

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.570 
just to make it a little more
user-friendly<00:04:46.660> with<00:04:47.230> the<00:04:47.710> flying<00:04:48.070> conditions

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
user-friendly with the flying conditions

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.240 
user-friendly with the flying conditions
that<00:04:48.910> that<00:04:49.240> I<00:04:49.300> have<00:04:49.690> to<00:04:49.870> deal<00:04:50.020> with<00:04:50.080> but<00:04:50.950> aside

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
that that I have to deal with but aside

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.159 
that that I have to deal with but aside
from<00:04:51.310> that<00:04:51.490> I'm<00:04:52.090> really<00:04:52.450> impressed<00:04:52.690> with<00:04:52.930> the

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
from that I'm really impressed with the

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.110 
from that I'm really impressed with the
plane<00:04:53.380> so<00:04:53.590> far<00:04:53.860> and<00:04:54.010> I'm<00:04:54.130> really<00:04:54.850> looking

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
plane so far and I'm really looking

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:15.090 
plane so far and I'm really looking
forward<00:04:55.390> to<00:04:55.540> getting<00:04:55.780> it<00:04:55.960> in<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.230> air

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.100 

the<00:05:16.100> plan<00:05:16.340> for<00:05:16.610> the<00:05:16.820> first<00:05:17.240> few<00:05:17.420> flights<00:05:17.690> will

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
the plan for the first few flights will

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.680 
the plan for the first few flights will
just<00:05:18.620> be<00:05:18.830> to<00:05:19.040> do<00:05:19.190> some<00:05:19.430> line-of-sight<00:05:20.090> fly<00:05:20.390> I

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
just be to do some line-of-sight fly I

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.930 
just be to do some line-of-sight fly I
won't<00:05:21.350> be<00:05:21.470> putting<00:05:21.770> the<00:05:21.890> fpv<00:05:22.400> here<00:05:22.670> on<00:05:22.820> it

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
won't be putting the fpv here on it

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.880 
won't be putting the fpv here on it
right<00:05:23.120> away<00:05:23.150> I<00:05:23.570> just<00:05:23.930> want<00:05:24.110> to<00:05:24.200> make<00:05:24.320> sure<00:05:24.380> that

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
right away I just want to make sure that

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.770 
right away I just want to make sure that
I've<00:05:25.010> got<00:05:25.040> the<00:05:25.220> plane<00:05:25.550> sorted<00:05:26.030> out<00:05:26.180> and<00:05:26.390> that

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
I've got the plane sorted out and that

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:35.230 
I've got the plane sorted out and that
it's<00:05:26.960> behaving<00:05:27.380> well<00:05:33.610> in<00:05:34.610> the<00:05:34.850> first<00:05:35.090> few

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
it's behaving well in the first few

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.060 
it's behaving well in the first few
flight<00:05:35.540> so<00:05:35.870> I'll<00:05:35.930> be<00:05:36.170> searching<00:05:36.620> for<00:05:36.800> the

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
flight so I'll be searching for the

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.770 
flight so I'll be searching for the
perfect<00:05:37.250> center<00:05:37.700> of<00:05:37.790> gravity<00:05:38.210> for<00:05:38.390> this<00:05:38.510> plane

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
perfect center of gravity for this plane

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.470 
perfect center of gravity for this plane
and<00:05:39.140> I'm<00:05:39.860> playing<00:05:40.160> with<00:05:40.340> flop<00:05:40.670> settings<00:05:41.210> and

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.480 
and I'm playing with flop settings and

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.870 
and I'm playing with flop settings and
things<00:05:41.690> like<00:05:41.870> that<00:05:41.930> and<00:05:42.560> slowly<00:05:43.370> adding

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
things like that and slowly adding

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.940 
things like that and slowly adding
weight<00:05:44.120> to<00:05:44.360> simulate<00:05:44.630> what<00:05:44.930> this<00:05:45.410> plane<00:05:45.680> will

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
weight to simulate what this plane will

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.980 
weight to simulate what this plane will
feel<00:05:46.670> like<00:05:46.910> when<00:05:47.120> it's<00:05:47.300> fully<00:05:47.540> loaded<00:05:47.840> with

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
feel like when it's fully loaded with

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.020 
feel like when it's fully loaded with
several<00:05:48.470> flight<00:05:48.770> batteries<00:05:49.250> and<00:05:49.430> all<00:05:49.520> the<00:05:49.640> MPD

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
several flight batteries and all the MPD

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.650 
several flight batteries and all the MPD
here<00:05:51.310> it<00:05:52.310> will<00:05:52.400> also<00:05:52.700> give<00:05:52.880> me<00:05:52.910> a<00:05:53.030> chance<00:05:53.360> to

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
here it will also give me a chance to

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.840 
here it will also give me a chance to
test<00:05:54.050> out<00:05:54.200> the<00:05:54.410> landing<00:05:54.800> gear<00:05:55.040> and<00:05:55.220> make<00:05:55.610> sure

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
test out the landing gear and make sure

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.940 
test out the landing gear and make sure
that<00:05:56.120> I<00:05:56.420> can<00:05:56.690> take<00:05:56.900> off<00:05:57.080> and<00:05:57.260> land<00:05:57.320> properly

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
that I can take off and land properly

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.610 
that I can take off and land properly
with<00:05:58.310> fully<00:05:58.850> loaded<00:05:59.120> plane<00:05:59.420> I've<00:06:00.050> seen<00:06:00.350> some

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
with fully loaded plane I've seen some

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.550 
with fully loaded plane I've seen some
videos<00:06:00.920> where<00:06:01.690> takeoffs<00:06:02.690> off<00:06:02.960> grass<00:06:03.260> have

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
videos where takeoffs off grass have

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.140 
videos where takeoffs off grass have
been<00:06:03.710> problematic<00:06:04.220> so<00:06:04.550> I'll<00:06:04.640> be<00:06:04.760> going<00:06:05.000> to

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
been problematic so I'll be going to

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.050 
been problematic so I'll be going to
larger<00:06:05.540> wheels<00:06:05.810> and<00:06:06.580> reinforcing<00:06:07.580> the<00:06:07.610> area

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
larger wheels and reinforcing the area

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.440 
larger wheels and reinforcing the area
where<00:06:08.360> their<00:06:08.600> gear<00:06:08.960> attaches<00:06:09.530> to<00:06:09.710> diffuse<00:06:10.160> a

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
where their gear attaches to diffuse a

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.600 
where their gear attaches to diffuse a
couple<00:06:11.450> of<00:06:11.600> guys<00:06:11.930> I've<00:06:12.260> torn<00:06:12.590> the<00:06:12.770> gear<00:06:13.070> off<00:06:13.250> on

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
couple of guys I've torn the gear off on

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.210 
couple of guys I've torn the gear off on
bad<00:06:14.510> landings<00:06:15.080> and<00:06:15.290> I'm<00:06:15.440> going<00:06:16.010> to<00:06:16.070> be

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
bad landings and I'm going to be

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.130 
bad landings and I'm going to be
preparing<00:06:16.670> for<00:06:16.880> the<00:06:17.000> worst<00:06:17.210> because<00:06:17.570> try<00:06:18.080> as

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.140 
preparing for the worst because try as

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.440 
preparing for the worst because try as
we<00:06:18.380> might<00:06:18.620> not<00:06:18.950> every<00:06:19.370> landing<00:06:19.790> is<00:06:19.940> a<00:06:19.970> perfect

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.450 
we might not every landing is a perfect

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:27.020 
we might not every landing is a perfect
landing<00:06:21.880> especially<00:06:22.880> for<00:06:23.120> me

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.880 

so<00:06:28.030> as<00:06:28.270> always<00:06:28.510> I<00:06:28.870> just<00:06:28.900> like<00:06:29.380> to<00:06:29.560> thank<00:06:29.710> you

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:29.890 
so as always I just like to thank you

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.190 
so as always I just like to thank you
all<00:06:30.010> very<00:06:30.040> much<00:06:30.310> for<00:06:30.460> watching<00:06:31.120> it<00:06:31.270> and<00:06:31.390> I'd

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:32.200 
all very much for watching it and I'd

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.930 
all very much for watching it and I'd
like<00:06:32.440> to<00:06:32.500> invite<00:06:32.860> you<00:06:32.920> back<00:06:33.190> for<00:06:33.520> when<00:06:33.700> we<00:06:33.820> do

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
like to invite you back for when we do

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.260 
like to invite you back for when we do
the<00:06:34.060> Maidan<00:06:34.390> and<00:06:34.570> I<00:06:35.290> I'm<00:06:36.190> just<00:06:36.700> really<00:06:36.970> hoping

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.270 
the Maidan and I I'm just really hoping

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.660 
the Maidan and I I'm just really hoping
it<00:06:37.420> goes<00:06:37.570> as<00:06:37.810> well<00:06:37.990> as<00:06:38.050> I<00:06:38.380> think<00:06:38.440> it<00:06:38.740> will<00:06:38.860> so

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:39.670 
it goes as well as I think it will so

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.850 
it goes as well as I think it will so
we'll<00:06:40.450> see<00:06:40.660> you<00:06:40.690> then<00:06:40.780> take<00:06:41.320> care<00:06:41.530> and<00:06:41.590> bye<00:06:41.830> bye

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
we'll see you then take care and bye bye

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.250 
we'll see you then take care and bye bye
