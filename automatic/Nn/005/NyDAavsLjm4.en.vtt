finally<00:01:52.840> optimized<00:01:53.259> and<00:01:53.380> this<00:01:53.500> is<00:01:53.590> a<00:01:53.619> terrible

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
finally optimized and this is a terrible

unfortunately<00:02:06.820> have<00:02:06.969> a<00:02:07.000> very<00:02:07.270> slow<00:02:07.479> computer

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
unfortunately have a very slow computer

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.950

so<00:02:08.170> I<00:02:08.200> can't<00:02:08.560> edit<00:02:08.710> as<00:02:09.070> much<00:02:09.539> because<00:02:10.539> you<00:02:10.840> know

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
so I can't edit as much because you know

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.780 
so I can't edit as much because you know
just<00:02:11.140> take<00:02:11.320> too<00:02:11.470> long<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.680> render<00:02:12.130> it<00:02:12.490> already

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
just take too long to render it already

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.280 
just take too long to render it already
fixed<00:02:13.000> like<00:02:13.090> hours<00:02:13.570> to<00:02:13.720> render<00:02:13.870> without

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
fixed like hours to render without

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.090 
fixed like hours to render without
without<00:02:14.620> editing<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:16.650> also<00:02:17.650> there<00:02:17.830> is<00:02:17.860> the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
without editing and also there is the

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.710 
without editing and also there is the
problem<00:02:18.520> of<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.970> mic<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.330> don't<00:02:19.450> really<00:02:19.600> have<00:02:19.690> a

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
problem of the mic I don't really have a

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.090 
problem of the mic I don't really have a
mic<00:02:19.960> I'm<00:02:20.170> just<00:02:20.320> using<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.620> computer<00:02:21.010> or

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
mic I'm just using the computer or

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.200 
mic I'm just using the computer or
whatever<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.400> computer<00:02:21.700> picks<00:02:21.880> up<00:02:22.030> with<00:02:22.150> you

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
whatever the computer picks up with you

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.050 
whatever the computer picks up with you
know<00:02:22.300> like<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.570> webcam<00:02:23.350> mic<00:02:23.710> thankee<00:02:24.310> so<00:02:24.610> the

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
know like the webcam mic thankee so the

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.490 
know like the webcam mic thankee so the
audio<00:02:25.390> quality<00:02:25.420> might<00:02:25.870> not<00:02:26.080> be<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.290> best<00:02:26.440> but

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
audio quality might not be the best but

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.920 
audio quality might not be the best but
look<00:02:27.010> here<00:02:27.250> we<00:02:27.370> found<00:02:27.580> a<00:02:27.640> swamp<00:02:27.970> that's<00:02:28.239> a<00:02:28.390> it's

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
it's like it's not going to sound the

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.500 
it's like it's not going to sound the
best<00:02:36.560> for<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:36.830> next<00:02:37.070> month<00:02:37.250> or<00:02:37.370> so<00:02:37.520> then<00:02:38.420> I'll

you know delicious delicious quality
audio<00:02:45.080> and<00:02:45.500> also<00:02:46.040> recording<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.430> display

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
audio and also recording to display

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.070 
audio and also recording to display
accordionist<00:02:47.150> of<00:02:47.210> hdmi<00:02:47.630> so<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.930> quality

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
accordionist of hdmi so the quality

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.930 
accordionist of hdmi so the quality
might<00:02:48.530> be<00:02:48.800> yeah<00:02:49.340> I<00:02:49.370> think<00:02:49.550> it's<00:02:49.730> going<00:02:49.820> to<00:02:49.880> be

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
might be yeah I think it's going to be

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.460 
might be yeah I think it's going to be
smoother<00:02:50.540> like<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:50.930> gameplay<00:02:51.170> might<00:02:51.350> be

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
smoother like the gameplay might be

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.390 
smoother like the gameplay might be
smoother<00:02:51.740> but<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:53.510> actual<00:02:54.140> you<00:02:54.290> know<00:02:54.400> bitrate

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
smoother but the actual you know bitrate

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.090 
smoother but the actual you know bitrate
quality<00:02:56.180> might<00:02:56.510> be<00:02:56.810> lower<00:02:57.020> so<00:02:57.170> that's<00:02:57.920> another

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
quality might be lower so that's another

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.590 
quality might be lower so that's another
thing<00:02:58.340> so<00:02:58.610> ray<00:02:58.730> uh<00:02:58.760> right<00:02:59.030> now<00:02:59.060> I'm<00:02:59.180> in<00:02:59.270> Poland

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
optimized for that stuff and and it's

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.700 
optimized for that stuff and and it's
beautiful<00:03:11.360> 1080p<00:03:11.750> it<00:03:12.200> looks<00:03:12.350> better<00:03:12.500> than

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
beautiful 1080p it looks better than

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.200 
beautiful 1080p it looks better than
mean<00:03:12.890> of<00:03:13.010> course<00:03:13.130> did<00:03:13.400> before<00:03:13.640> because<00:03:14.060> before

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
mean of course did before because before

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.610 
mean of course did before because before
it<00:03:14.540> was<00:03:14.600> a<00:03:14.660> little<00:03:14.750> bit<00:03:14.900> pixelated<00:03:15.290> you<00:03:15.500> can

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
it was a little bit pixelated you can

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.040 
it was a little bit pixelated you can
tell<00:03:15.830> because<00:03:15.950> it<00:03:16.130> was<00:03:16.220> using<00:03:16.400> like<00:03:16.550> that<00:03:17.050> like

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
tell because it was using like that like

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.780 
tell because it was using like that like
the<00:03:18.230> normal<00:03:18.890> iphone<00:03:19.130> this<00:03:19.400> but<00:03:19.490> i<00:03:19.550> think<00:03:19.700> was

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
the normal iphone this but i think was

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.270 
the normal iphone this but i think was
for<00:03:19.910> like<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.120> iphone<00:03:20.500> 5s<00:03:21.500> you<00:03:21.770> know<00:03:21.860> it<00:03:22.190> was

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
for like the iphone 5s you know it was

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.310 
for like the iphone 5s you know it was
that<00:03:22.370> was<00:03:22.640> that<00:03:22.670> was<00:03:23.000> that<00:03:23.120> quality<00:03:23.660> was<00:03:23.870> it

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
that was that was that quality was it

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.070 
that was that was that quality was it
was<00:03:24.470> not<00:03:24.680> 1080p<00:03:25.060> like<00:03:26.060> on<00:03:26.210> the<00:03:26.300> 6<00:03:26.510> plus<00:03:26.780> but

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
was not 1080p like on the 6 plus but
