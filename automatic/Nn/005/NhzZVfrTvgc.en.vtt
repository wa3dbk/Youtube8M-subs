gigabytes<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.780> space<00:01:04.309> which<00:01:05.309> it's<00:01:06.150> more<00:01:06.450> space

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
gigabytes of space which it's more space

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.910 
gigabytes of space which it's more space
than<00:01:07.350> what<00:01:07.710> my<00:01:08.360> internal<00:01:09.360> memory<00:01:09.720> has<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.650> here

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
than what my internal memory has so here

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.960 
than what my internal memory has so here

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
available 28 point 56 megabytes so

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.679 
available 28 point 56 megabytes so
what's<00:01:19.320> cool<00:01:19.439> about<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.799> app<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.450> will

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.520 
to 15 extra megabytes
yes<00:01:26.850> megabytes<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.509> memory<00:01:27.570> for<00:01:28.049> cleaning<00:01:28.500> my

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
yes megabytes of memory for cleaning my

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.440 
yes megabytes of memory for cleaning my
cactus<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.189> never<00:01:29.460> did<00:01:29.670> before<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.210> I've<00:01:30.329> had

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
cactus I never did before and I've had

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.690 
cactus I never did before and I've had
this<00:01:30.600> phone<00:01:30.810> for<00:01:30.990> quite<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.320> while<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:32.520> that's

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
this phone for quite a while so that's

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.429 
this phone for quite a while so that's
another<00:01:32.939> good<00:01:33.119> way<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.329> getting<00:01:33.810> more<00:01:34.140> space

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
another good way of getting more space

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.310 
another good way of getting more space
but<00:01:35.310> what<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.090> app<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.570> really<00:01:36.600> great<00:01:37.140> as

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
but what this app is really great as

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.490 
but what this app is really great as
great<00:01:38.130> at<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.520> basically<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.329> moves<00:01:39.630> it

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
great at is basically it moves it

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.249 
great at is basically it moves it
doesn't<00:01:40.619> move<00:01:40.890> all<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.610> or<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> might<00:01:42.570> and

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
doesn't move all of that or a might and

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.749 
doesn't move all of that or a might and
my<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.680> move<00:01:43.920> was<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.159> half<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.610> or

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
my it move was like half of it or

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.700 
my it move was like half of it or
something<00:01:44.909> like<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.570> your<00:01:45.869> SD<00:01:46.020> card<00:01:46.470> so

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
something like that to your SD card so

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.149 
something like that to your SD card so
it<00:01:46.920> can<00:01:47.159> share<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.670> space<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:49.159> basically

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
it can share the space and basically

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.600 
it can share the space and basically
take<00:01:50.759> some<00:01:51.350> memory<00:01:52.350> off<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.860> your<00:01:53.100> internal

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
take some memory off of your internal

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.460 
take some memory off of your internal
phone's<00:01:54.240> memory<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.840> can<00:01:55.020> download<00:01:55.200> more

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
phone's memory so you can download more

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.100 
phone's memory so you can download more
apps<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.890> do<00:01:56.009> more<00:01:56.159> things<00:01:56.299> so<00:01:57.299> here<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.689> go<00:01:57.869> I

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110

I<00:02:42.980> gained<00:02:43.640> over<00:02:44.049> town<00:02:45.049> 15<00:02:45.859> megabytes<00:02:46.640> now

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
I gained over town 15 megabytes now

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.440 
I gained over town 15 megabytes now
let's<00:02:47.659> do<00:02:47.810> all<00:02:47.870> of<00:02:48.019> them<00:02:48.260> let's<00:02:49.069> see<00:02:49.280> six<00:02:50.030> point

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
let's do all of them let's see six point

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.930 
let's do all of them let's see six point
three<00:02:50.659> eight<00:02:50.930> megabytes<00:02:51.560> for<00:02:51.829> this<00:02:52.010> one<00:02:52.220> boom

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
three eight megabytes for this one boom

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.089 
three eight megabytes for this one boom
three<00:02:53.359> point<00:02:53.720> seven<00:02:54.019> one<00:02:54.409> eight<00:02:54.590> bytes<00:02:54.889> that

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
three point seven one eight bytes that

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:00.280 
three point seven one eight bytes that
reduced<00:02:55.579> it<00:02:55.730> by<00:02:55.760> half<00:02:58.359> now<00:02:59.359> the<00:02:59.420> tap<00:02:59.930> cleaner

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
reduced it by half now the tap cleaner

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.199 
reduced it by half now the tap cleaner
that<00:03:00.620> I<00:03:00.680> showed<00:03:01.129> them<00:03:01.280> on<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.519> video<00:03:01.639> will<00:03:02.000> see

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
that I showed them on the video will see

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.199 
that I showed them on the video will see
it's<00:03:02.329> only<00:03:02.560> 824<00:03:03.560> kilobytes<00:03:04.129> but<00:03:04.459> you<00:03:05.060> never

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
it's only 824 kilobytes but you never

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.839 
it's only 824 kilobytes but you never
know<00:03:05.420> you<00:03:05.480> can<00:03:05.810> need<00:03:06.260> that<00:03:06.470> extra<00:03:06.739> you<00:03:07.639> see<00:03:07.790> how

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
know you can need that extra you see how

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.569 
know you can need that extra you see how
much<00:03:08.000> it<00:03:08.120> reduces<00:03:08.590> 484<00:03:09.590> so<00:03:09.889> these<00:03:10.220> ones

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
much it reduces 484 so these ones

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.410 
much it reduces 484 so these ones
reduced<00:03:11.090> by<00:03:11.299> half<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:12.730> like<00:03:13.730> I<00:03:13.849> said<00:03:13.909> it<00:03:14.269> does

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
reduced by half and like I said it does

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.470 
reduced by half and like I said it does
have<00:03:14.599> a<00:03:14.659> catch<00:03:14.900> cleaner<00:03:15.200> so<00:03:15.590> look<00:03:15.829> at<00:03:15.920> that

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
have a catch cleaner so look at that

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.689 
have a catch cleaner so look at that
let's<00:03:17.480> see<00:03:17.660> sorry<00:03:18.079> for<00:03:18.410> that<00:03:18.500> so<00:03:18.980> it<00:03:19.190> was<00:03:19.280> at<00:03:19.400> 20

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:19.699 
let's see sorry for that so it was at 20

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.670 
let's see sorry for that so it was at 20
something<00:03:20.060> right<00:03:20.269> now<00:03:20.449> it's<00:03:20.599> at<00:03:20.720> 42<00:03:21.349> point

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
something right now it's at 42 point

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.330 
something right now it's at 42 point
ninety<00:03:22.190> five<00:03:22.459> megabytes<00:03:23.359> that's<00:03:23.750> I<00:03:24.340> basically

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
ninety five megabytes that's I basically

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.000 
ninety five megabytes that's I basically
doubled<00:03:25.849> my<00:03:25.940> memory<00:03:26.239> by<00:03:26.419> doing<00:03:26.720> that<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:27.109> here

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
doubled my memory by doing that and here

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.770 
doubled my memory by doing that and here
