component<00:02:04.409> what<00:02:05.130> we<00:02:05.250> see<00:02:05.490> over<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.970> over

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
component what we see over and over

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.869 
component what we see over and over
again<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.510> that<00:02:06.720> estradiol<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.710> e2<00:02:08.129> drops

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
again is that estradiol the e2 drops

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.550 
again is that estradiol the e2 drops
below<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.269> hundred<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.840> thirty<00:02:10.079> they<00:02:10.229> may<00:02:10.499> be

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
below a hundred and thirty they may be

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.830 
below a hundred and thirty they may be
excessive<00:02:11.459> in<00:02:11.609> the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
excessive in the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.230 
excessive in the
they<00:02:13.650> may<00:02:13.830> be<00:02:13.890> out<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.160> balance<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.820> way<00:02:15.030> well

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
they may be out of balance that way well

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.040 
they may be out of balance that way well
what<00:02:15.390> they<00:02:15.540> have<00:02:15.840> is<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.830> dropping<00:02:17.400> e<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:18.630> level

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
what they have is a dropping e to level

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.920 
what they have is a dropping e to level
and<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.500> rising<00:02:19.770> II<00:02:20.250> one<00:02:20.700> estrogen<00:02:21.450> one<00:02:21.660> level

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
and a rising II one estrogen one level

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.440 
and a rising II one estrogen one level
so<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.380> imbalance<00:02:23.100> of<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.880> good<00:02:24.060> harmony

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
so the imbalance of the good harmony

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.640 
so the imbalance of the good harmony

allergies<00:02:36.710> however<00:02:37.710> what<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.250> found<00:02:38.610> over<00:02:38.790> time

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
allergies however what I found over time

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.360 
allergies however what I found over time
my<00:02:39.270> original<00:02:39.780> work<00:02:39.960> started<00:02:40.470> 25<00:02:40.890> years<00:02:40.950> ago

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
my original work started 25 years ago

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.010 
my original work started 25 years ago
with<00:02:41.610> that<00:02:41.760> whole<00:02:41.970> concept<00:02:42.240> that<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:42.840> ate

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
with that whole concept that you ate

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.170 
with that whole concept that you ate
certain<00:02:43.350> foods<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.710> it<00:02:43.860> responded<00:02:44.370> but<00:02:44.910> as<00:02:45.060> I

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
certain foods and it responded but as I

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.000 
certain foods and it responded but as I
got<00:02:45.330> more<00:02:45.390> into<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.930> biochemistry<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:46.920> I

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
got more into the biochemistry of it I

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.910 
got more into the biochemistry of it I
began<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.550> realize<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.710> certainly<00:02:49.710> there's

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
began to realize that certainly there's

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.520 
began to realize that certainly there's
biochemistry<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:50.850> everything<00:02:51.300> you<00:02:51.450> eat<00:02:51.530> but

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
biochemistry and everything you eat but

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.370 
biochemistry and everything you eat but
the<00:02:53.130> immune<00:02:53.430> system<00:02:53.880> won't<00:02:54.060> work<00:02:54.210> right<00:02:54.660> if<00:02:54.990> if

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
the immune system won't work right if if

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.090 
the immune system won't work right if if
we're<00:02:55.740> in<00:02:55.860> a<00:02:55.950> toxic<00:02:56.250> mode<00:02:57.260> when<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.410> came<00:02:58.680> here

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
we're in a toxic mode when you came here

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.640 
we're in a toxic mode when you came here
you<00:02:59.970> were<00:03:00.030> terribly<00:03:00.960> depressed<00:03:03.500> well<00:03:04.500> there

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
you were terribly depressed well there

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.220 
you were terribly depressed well there
was<00:03:04.740> no<00:03:04.920> reason<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.460> get<00:03:05.610> up<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:06.180> didn't<00:03:06.990> want<00:03:07.140> to

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
was no reason to get up I didn't want to

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.430 
was no reason to get up I didn't want to
face<00:03:07.500> Everett<00:03:07.980> every<00:03:08.400> day<00:03:08.670> any<00:03:09.420> day<00:03:09.720> because

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
face Everett every day any day because

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.370 
face Everett every day any day because
every<00:03:10.950> day<00:03:11.100> was<00:03:11.280> pain<00:03:11.640> not<00:03:12.240> feeling<00:03:12.660> good<00:03:12.840> and

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
every day was pain not feeling good and

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.740 
every day was pain not feeling good and
here<00:03:13.770> you<00:03:13.890> are<00:03:13.920> carrying<00:03:14.880> on<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.060> normal<00:03:15.420> life

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
here you are carrying on a normal life

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.320 
here you are carrying on a normal life
yeah<00:03:16.740> I<00:03:17.040> love<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.550> so<00:03:17.580> by<00:03:17.880> doing<00:03:17.940> the

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
yeah I love it so by doing the

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.290 
yeah I love it so by doing the
biofeedback<00:03:18.870> therapy<00:03:19.140> back<00:03:20.040> in<00:03:20.400> June<00:03:20.850> we<00:03:21.180> were

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
biofeedback therapy back in June we were

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.780 
biofeedback therapy back in June we were
able<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.709> reregulate<00:03:22.709> some<00:03:23.310> of<00:03:23.430> these<00:03:23.520> things

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
able to reregulate some of these things

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.370 
able to reregulate some of these things
and<00:03:24.060> get<00:03:24.209> rid<00:03:24.390> of<00:03:24.420> these<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.959> this<00:03:25.050> was<00:03:25.230> the

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
and get rid of these and this was the

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.260 
and get rid of these and this was the
first<00:03:25.530> slice<00:03:25.830> we<00:03:26.010> saw<00:03:26.190> on<00:03:26.490> the<00:03:26.670> original

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
first slice we saw on the original

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.660 
first slice we saw on the original
analysis<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:27.990> then<00:03:28.530> today<00:03:28.740> we<00:03:29.190> have<00:03:29.340> today's

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
analysis and then today we have today's

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.430 
analysis and then today we have today's
roll<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.240> can<00:03:30.390> see<00:03:30.540> it's<00:03:30.690> largely<00:03:31.080> all

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
roll and you can see it's largely all

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.790 
roll and you can see it's largely all
yellows<00:03:31.830> one<00:03:32.100> twos<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.580> threes<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:33.810> we<00:03:34.560> did

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
yellows one twos and threes so we did

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.240 
yellows one twos and threes so we did
several<00:03:35.160> sessions<00:03:35.600> took<00:03:36.600> maybe<00:03:37.170> 30<00:03:37.770> seconds

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
several sessions took maybe 30 seconds

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.370 
several sessions took maybe 30 seconds
to<00:03:38.459> do<00:03:38.640> that<00:03:38.820> to<00:03:39.090> reregulate<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:40.020> do<00:03:40.260> the

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
to do that to reregulate that do the

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.890 
to do that to reregulate that do the
biofeedback<00:03:41.100> on<00:03:41.550> that<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.090> now<00:03:42.630> her

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
biofeedback on that and now her

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.020 
biofeedback on that and now her
experience<00:03:43.530> is<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.800> she<00:03:44.040> is<00:03:44.220> feeling<00:03:44.489> much

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
experience is that she is feeling much

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.840 
experience is that she is feeling much
better

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
better

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.670 
better
depression<00:03:47.850> is<00:03:48.060> really<00:03:48.420> depletion<00:03:49.140> its<00:03:49.560> the

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
depression is really depletion its the

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.000 
depression is really depletion its the
depletion<00:03:50.070> of<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:51.830> neurotransmitters<00:03:52.830> that

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
depletion of the neurotransmitters that

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.680 
depletion of the neurotransmitters that
we<00:03:53.100> need<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.400> make<00:03:53.520> us<00:03:53.640> feel<00:03:53.850> good<00:03:54.060> it's

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
we need to make us feel good it's

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.810 
we need to make us feel good it's
usually<00:03:54.810> serotonin<00:03:55.590> and<00:03:55.709> dopamine<00:03:55.770> and<00:03:56.700> by

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
usually serotonin and dopamine and by

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.590 
usually serotonin and dopamine and by
the<00:03:56.880> way<00:03:57.030> there's<00:03:57.209> lots<00:03:57.450> of

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
the way there's lots of

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.330 
the way there's lots of
neurotransmitters<00:03:58.440> but<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.680> ones<00:03:58.830> we<00:03:58.980> focus

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
neurotransmitters but the ones we focus

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.770 
neurotransmitters but the ones we focus
on<00:03:59.489> are<00:03:59.640> these<00:03:59.790> ones<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.360> that<00:04:00.450> doesn't<00:04:00.720> mean

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
on are these ones and that doesn't mean

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.870 
on are these ones and that doesn't mean
they're<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.020> only<00:04:01.140> ones<00:04:01.470> but<00:04:01.770> what<00:04:02.580> I<00:04:02.610> have

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
they're the only ones but what I have

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.940 
they're the only ones but what I have
found<00:04:02.910> is<00:04:03.390> that<00:04:03.420> when<00:04:03.870> people<00:04:04.140> are<00:04:04.440> depressed

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
found is that when people are depressed

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.880 
found is that when people are depressed
it's<00:04:05.489> really<00:04:05.820> not<00:04:05.970> a<00:04:06.030> prozac<00:04:06.480> deficiency

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
it's really not a prozac deficiency

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.740 
it's really not a prozac deficiency
when<00:04:09.890> you<00:04:10.010> compare<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:10.580> efficacy<00:04:10.880> or<00:04:11.510> the

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
when you compare the efficacy or the

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.220 
when you compare the efficacy or the
lack<00:04:12.230> thereof<00:04:13.360> to<00:04:14.360> the<00:04:14.390> safety<00:04:14.870> risks<00:04:15.170> of

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
lack thereof to the safety risks of

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.699 
lack thereof to the safety risks of
suicide<00:04:15.710> and<00:04:15.830> violence<00:04:17.080> that<00:04:18.080> it<00:04:18.260> doesn't<00:04:18.590> MIT

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
suicide and violence that it doesn't MIT

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.620 
suicide and violence that it doesn't MIT
doesn't<00:04:19.280> weigh<00:04:19.760> out<00:04:19.970> in<00:04:20.209> favor<00:04:20.480> of
