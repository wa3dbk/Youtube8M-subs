00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.040
 snowflakes that way through the air 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.140

 hands for dinner wash caillou 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.190
 Why did Mom and Dad wonder 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.710
 such worries were made with the voices 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.450
 no one is full of the bands you already have 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.020
 the poison im shows through are heavy 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.020
 enough 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.689
 Kayo felt very dark 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.590
 and he decided that himself again 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:28.019
 to link 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.760
 he could not understand why 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.159
 suddenly all the lights at once 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.359
 had gone out 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.379
 when he could not do it 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:39.689
 to turn it on again 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:45.480
 karma big fear it's time to die 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:48.200
 only i can come the storm one 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.549
 have caused power failure 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.569
 That's what you say when you have no electricity 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.150
 and that does not matter 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.129
 He did not know that a storm was the whole thing 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.180
 could not make out so he had 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:01.549
 yes never heard 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.549
 Let's go down and flashlights 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:10.349
 That does not look like the candles 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:12.419
 we can not see I go 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:18.060
 my shotgun will bring you yours 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:20.159
 helping blow away brain help the 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.449
 says shotguns to look became 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.449
 thicker and it is pitch dark 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.250
 where is this shotgun always available 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.389
 if you need them you will find them 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.189
 not radically trying to be brave 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.979
 but he does not do it at all 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:42.959
 to sit dark 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:43.709
 It's all right my cat is 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.120
 went out 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.959
 I could have sworn that the 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.299
 flashlights turks here are none 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.310
 dreaded so old alone in the 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:57.139
 he could sit dark on the stairs 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.139
 not seeing his father at all 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.750
 i had the first hunted papis sudden 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.400
 appear a scare 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.380
 but then was very relieved when he 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.940
 saw that red flick found 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.580
 i 'm sorry caillou i wanted you 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:19.489
 do not scare us 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:21.440
 you can have one too i still remember 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:25.000
 always not where I bury your corpse 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.000
 should after the act give me a tip 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:44.760
 we would have been overjoyed that it 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.230
 was bright again and he thought that 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.230
 it would be on board now 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.500
 That's a good question 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:59.840
 boah i need to be able to get away more kalou here 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.840
 I do not like captain 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.940
 really the ju could ever 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.130
 Do not imagine how to live in the living room 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.930
 could cook in the fireplace but then makes 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.080
 It's fun to imagine 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.250
 the living room recognizes the place again 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.490
 i think you want to share mine 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.990
 mistaking papi yes that is fun but 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.580
 I hope that we will soon stream again 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.440
 the house will have cooled quite nicely 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.770
 fast 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.720
 Papi is supposed to be the one again you are too 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.130
 stupid in the head to understand that you 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.750
 shall keep your mouth 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.350
 but at the moment it did not bother him 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.889
 especially 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:37.169
 but now it's time for dessert 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:46.169

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:47.729

00:05:46.169 --> 00:06:01.530
 you have to blow because they are still very hot 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:06:05.039
 are they going to bed now? 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.900
 I do not yet see myself in bed 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:09.199
 I think you will not see it tomorrow 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.199
