00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
know if I'm pronouncing this right a

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.300 
know if I'm pronouncing this right a
rune<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.770> Aragon<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:54.740> this<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> scene<00:01:56.280> in

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
rune and Aragon and this is a scene in

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.510 
rune and Aragon and this is a scene in
this<00:01:56.729> scene<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:58.619> thought<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.130> was<00:01:59.280> cool<00:01:59.460> to

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
this scene so I thought it was cool to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.880 
this scene so I thought it was cool to
add<00:01:59.729> this<00:01:59.939> in

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.490 

and<00:02:05.890> then<00:02:06.130> over<00:02:06.399> here<00:02:06.810> Pippin<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:07.960> Merry<00:02:08.019> are

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
on a bridge and I don't think that was

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.559 
on a bridge and I don't think that was
from<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:12.010> movie<00:02:12.430> but<00:02:12.640> I<00:02:12.700> just<00:02:12.879> added<00:02:13.269> in<00:02:13.390> because

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
are the dwarves and stuff and I yeah I

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.020 
are the dwarves and stuff and I yeah I
incorporated<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:39.599> the<00:03:40.599> set<00:03:40.870> for<00:03:41.470> this<00:03:42.030> the

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
incorporated the the set for this the

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.780 
incorporated the the set for this the
Rivendell<00:03:43.510> set<00:03:43.870> I<00:03:44.109> don't<00:03:44.889> exactly<00:03:45.280> know<00:03:45.519> the

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790

Elrond<00:03:47.980> and<00:03:49.859> then<00:03:50.859> we<00:03:51.069> have<00:03:51.220> like<00:03:51.459> dwarves

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
the ring in the middle of the chair it's

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:02.099 
the ring in the middle of the chair it's
nice<00:04:00.329> another<00:04:01.329> one<00:04:01.510> of<00:04:01.630> those<00:04:01.750> buildings
