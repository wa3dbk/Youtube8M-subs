00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.920 
of it I also lube the chain well to keep
it<00:00:59.850> from<00:01:00.539> corroding<00:01:00.960> over<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.800> winter<00:01:02.070> and

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
it from corroding over the winter and

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.060 
it from corroding over the winter and
hopefully<00:01:03.930> when<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.080> start<00:01:04.409> off<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.769> spring

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
hopefully when I start off in the spring

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.030 
hopefully when I start off in the spring
things<00:01:05.369> will<00:01:05.760> be<00:01:06.540> real<00:01:06.780> smooth<00:01:07.080> one<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
things will be real smooth one of the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.980 
things will be real smooth one of the
things<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.340> did<00:01:08.580> not<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:09.030> was<00:01:09.330> deflate<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
things I did not do was deflate the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.200 
things I did not do was deflate the
tires<00:01:10.290> which<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:10.950> recommended<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.760> manual

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
tires which is recommended in the manual

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.600 
tires which is recommended in the manual
but<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:12.990> don't<00:01:13.229> have<00:01:13.439> an<00:01:13.530> air<00:01:13.680> compressor<00:01:13.860> to

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
but I don't have an air compressor to

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.929 
but I don't have an air compressor to
inflate<00:01:15.540> them<00:01:16.439> before<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:16.890> take<00:01:17.130> off<00:01:17.280> again<00:01:17.490> so

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
inflate them before I take off again so

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.600 
inflate them before I take off again so
I<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.479> left<00:01:18.659> them<00:01:18.900> fully<00:01:19.500> inflated<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.430> we'll

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
I just left them fully inflated so we'll

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.660 
I just left them fully inflated so we'll
see<00:01:20.790> what<00:01:20.909> happens<00:01:20.970> with<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.650> I<00:01:22.650> also<00:01:23.400> filled

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.469 
see what happens with that I also filled
up<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.820> gas<00:01:23.939> tank<00:01:24.119> with<00:01:25.049> gas<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:26.180> also<00:01:27.180> added

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
up the gas tank with gas and also added

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.569 
up the gas tank with gas and also added
a<00:01:27.750> fuel<00:01:28.110> stabilizer<00:01:28.439> now<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.520> is

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
a fuel stabilizer now this is

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.810 
a fuel stabilizer now this is
controversial<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.720> say<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.140> because<00:01:31.820> when

distinct smell to it and then lastly i
purchased<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:58.610> battery<00:01:59.610> charger<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.509> maintain

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
purchased a battery charger to maintain

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.920 
purchased a battery charger to maintain
the<00:02:01.560> battery<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.189> this<00:02:02.640> one<00:02:02.880> was<00:02:03.149> recommended

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
the battery and this one was recommended

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.570 
the battery and this one was recommended
by<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.079> manufacturer<00:02:04.649> and

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
by the manufacturer and

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.640 
by the manufacturer and
it<00:02:06.000> seems<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.390> be<00:02:06.540> from<00:02:06.990> everything<00:02:07.320> I've<00:02:07.470> read

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
it seems to be from everything I've read

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.300 
it seems to be from everything I've read
a<00:02:07.710> good<00:02:07.920> charter<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:09.090> has<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.050> float<00:02:10.470> mode<00:02:10.740> which

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
a good charter it has a float mode which

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.520 
a good charter it has a float mode which
only<00:02:11.670> adds<00:02:12.030> enough<00:02:12.420> charge<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.960> battery<00:02:13.320> as

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
only adds enough charge the battery as

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.640 
only adds enough charge the battery as
needed<00:02:13.980> so<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.340> will<00:02:14.520> not<00:02:14.700> overcharge<00:02:15.240> it<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:16.170> i

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
needed so it will not overcharge it so i

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.960 
needed so it will not overcharge it so i
hope<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.400> in<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.790> few<00:02:17.820> weeks<00:02:19.730> put<00:02:20.730> everything
