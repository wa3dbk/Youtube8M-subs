know I just that's some people's rant

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.600

you<00:01:11.460> know<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.939> that's<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.630> little<00:01:12.810> too<00:01:13.140> crazy

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
you know and that's a little too crazy

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.910 
you know and that's a little too crazy
I<00:01:14.780> think<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.869> resale<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.650> gonna<00:01:16.740> be

I think the resale in this is gonna be

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.800 
I think the resale in this is gonna be
stupid<00:01:17.670> because<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.880> means<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.240> buying<00:01:18.659> them

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.149 
stupid because it means you buying them
for<00:01:18.930> five<00:01:18.990> hundred<00:01:19.290> nobody's<00:01:19.799> gonna<00:01:19.890> want<00:01:20.100> to

for five hundred nobody's gonna want to
pay<00:01:20.330> six<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.479> seven<00:01:21.810> hundred<00:01:21.869> on<00:01:22.200> these<00:01:22.380> men<00:01:22.650> I
