00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.900
 what's up this bullet is how is the new 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.630
 video of some kids welcome to a 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.050
 more video in the all trick channel 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.029
 ssp and good kids my name is frank 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.210
 and I have a YouTube channel called 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.419
 of nine months h whose insurance that will put 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.900
 or porsche or pick up as it is called in the 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:36.149
 description of the video and good what 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.680
 I wanted to bring for this trick was like 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.149
 leave the google map the truth is 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.790
 that a map that is a bit forgotten 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.180
 because it's been a little bit excavated 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.840
 compared to other clubs with others 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.360
 maps as 12 from a2 does not originate 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.960
 he is also pretty handsome for this 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.420
 empty or very easy subject or I do not know enough 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.680
 good wash first of all you have 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.120
 seen that I took verb hundred was 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.090
 tool and now what we have to 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:08.230
 do is money to mount the steam 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:12.320
 stream 56 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:14.150
 17 dead so well let's see 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.780
 a few shots at the zombies 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.470
 as many are the ones who endure and are 6 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.930
 zombies so be careful not to kill the 6 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.790
 not to go round and build 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.920
 the steam coils one the trick I'm 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.770
 doing in life so that you see 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.130
 that still works today is day 25 of 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.939
 November 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.200
 and still have not patched I guess that 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.530
 they marched or at least I have the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.320
 hope that someone put cliché or 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.909
 whatever the patches are called but good if 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.240
 they do not want to patch it because people are 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.049
 will use to make sheep and all 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.049
 and all those shits 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.670
 and we continue riding a steamrolling 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.790
 to see here is the first part that the 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.229
 flag the second the button here the 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:07.190
 top part is the base and the bellows 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.210
 so let's continue 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.370
 here 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.810
 this is the closest table and as only 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.300
 you have to catch once we're not going to 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.490
 need for more times not 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.560
 I recommend that you do it there we go no 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:24.200
 I think someone is going to do it 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.200
 other species 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.560
 this is the last piece away too 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.459
 I'll have to go through the round to open 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.459
 a couple of doors 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:43.560
 Let's see 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.560
 unfinished is worth riding there is 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.480
 to this it is worth don zombis and as there 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.430
 that opening two doors is not going to give me 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.710
 but I'll show you all 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.170
 ways the doors bring brice there 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.390
 open this ship the living room and the sofa 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.910
 inside because the trick is to 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.470
 get us on a roof of up there 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.660
 well you will see it the truth is that it is 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.700
 Pretty cool like that not to hold 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.870
 rounds because there are better for example in 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.270
 my face you can find one that 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.180
 exposing there all two million 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:16.330
 in this window with the steam rolled 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.570
 another charge right away and very very fast 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.840
 go round good I 'm not going to catch you 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:25.180
 weapon or anything because what I want what 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.280
 I want to do is do it fast but if 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.959
 I would not have saved money from the bank 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.060
 they would have thrown away boxes but food from 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.350
 steamrolling more with ammunition 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.330
 because we will not be able to catch 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.880
 bonuses like ammunition or anything 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.950
 and those of scavengers exiled you want 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.470
 buy the advantage but well I do not see it 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.590
 I very 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.080
 perfect is a box will give us 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.360
 the bad points that will happen round 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.680
 but nothing happens we go to the lounge 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.390
 when we have already taken the steam 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.630
 around we open the first door and 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.950
 we open the second one is also the sofa and 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.080
 we go through the left part 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.890
 although there will be some wooden stairs 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:08.730
 these are the first time on the left 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.650
 Nomás then jump here just jump 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.069
 because there is a gap and very 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.069
 important 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.479
 keeps coming out 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:23.350
 here, you see, it's tabaré, we put the 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.610
 steamrolling steam 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.610
 themselves while giving zombie 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.259
 and when we work we crouched 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.720
 we see that two villa two hours when 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:36.490
 we are here we can not move 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.259
 we put the steam vapor sweeping 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.669
 We return to open have to wait 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.669
 give us a zombie austin 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.540
 because obviously here we can not 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.540
 go out 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.840
 Be careful not to kill him, my mother 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.840
 how come out of that 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.320
 OK 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.880
 OK 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.970
 I think it's a shame to lose my clear 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.910
 and well you have to stay anchored 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:16.060
 in the air so now we come to 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.390
 we wait a little here to go back to 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.390
 load 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.820
 now we are out 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:31.029
 do not stay the simple trick 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:33.699
 not if a partner does nothing more 

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:35.619
 then as you can see here the steam rolled 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:38.019
 and the other partners can follow 

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:39.609
 getting in and good power over here 

00:05:38.019 --> 00:05:41.019
 explore a bit the map the truth is 

00:05:39.609 --> 00:05:43.569
 that is pretty hollow not only for 

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:44.919
 hold rounds but to explore the 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:47.919
 map as achilles you can go through 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:50.649
 some walls and if you go around then you 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.299
 you die and the zombies as you choose 

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:54.969
 where you want it to go if it puts you 

00:05:52.299 --> 00:05:56.769
 here they will pile up here or if 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:59.019
 you put in here and they'll pile up there 

00:05:56.769 --> 00:06:00.849
 in a corner almost all the zombies are 

00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:02.079
 They always put in the same position like this 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:04.449
 what good kids 

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:06.759
 this is the last thing to subscribe to the channel to 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:09.939
 see if I die aetas subscribe to 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:12.309
