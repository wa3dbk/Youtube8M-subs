00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
and I don't know I guess it'd have to be

a<00:02:12.440> Lamborghini<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.099> some<00:02:13.340> sort<00:02:13.610> I've<00:02:13.730> always

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
a Lamborghini of some sort I've always

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:15.759 
a Lamborghini of some sort I've always
been<00:02:14.030> a<00:02:14.090> big<00:02:14.269> Lamborghini<00:02:14.780> lover<00:02:15.019> but<00:02:15.290> in

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
been a big Lamborghini lover but in

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.050 
been a big Lamborghini lover but in
North<00:02:16.010> Dakota<00:02:16.069> that's<00:02:16.459> not<00:02:16.640> very<00:02:16.760> practical

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
North Dakota that's not very practical

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.580 
North Dakota that's not very practical
so<00:02:17.629> it'd<00:02:17.690> have<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.870> be<00:02:17.989> something<00:02:18.080> that's<00:02:18.379> four

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
so it'd have to be something that's four

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.729 
so it'd have to be something that's four
