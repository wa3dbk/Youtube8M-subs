very hard to hit people so that's rather

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.800 
very hard to hit people so that's rather
annoying<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:03.149> first<00:02:03.329> thing<00:02:03.450> you're<00:02:03.540> gonna<00:02:03.600> do

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
annoying the first thing you're gonna do

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.139 
annoying the first thing you're gonna do

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.100 
here is just get down midnight that's
just<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.540> first<00:02:06.829> step<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.099> then<00:02:08.879> add<00:02:09.539> two<00:02:09.959> men

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
just the first step and then add two men

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.730 
just the first step and then add two men
will<00:02:10.259> get<00:02:10.470> on<00:02:10.619> top<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.069> him<00:02:11.190> and

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
will get on top of him and

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.500 
will get on top of him and
second<00:02:12.010> here<00:02:12.900> not<00:02:13.900> too<00:02:14.350> much<00:02:14.560> longer<00:02:15.510> and

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
second here not too much longer and

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.640 
second here not too much longer and
there<00:02:17.440> we<00:02:17.530> go<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:17.920> now<00:02:18.610> he<00:02:18.670> is<00:02:19.410> just<00:02:20.410> one

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
there we go and now he is just one

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.990 
there we go and now he is just one
person<00:02:21.070> and<00:02:21.280> you're<00:02:21.520> gonna<00:02:21.610> kill<00:02:21.880> them<00:02:24.000> this

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
person and you're gonna kill them this

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.480 
person and you're gonna kill them this
whole<00:02:25.210> run<00:02:25.420> really<00:02:25.690> doesn't<00:02:25.930> take<00:02:26.050> that<00:02:26.230> long

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
whole run really doesn't take that long

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.790 
whole run really doesn't take that long
so<00:02:27.490> it's<00:02:27.850> it's<00:02:28.120> easy<00:02:28.570> to<00:02:28.840> find<00:02:28.990> time<00:02:29.320> in<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:29.650> week

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
so it's it's easy to find time in a week

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.770 
so it's it's easy to find time in a week
and<00:02:30.040> there's<00:02:30.670> no<00:02:30.820> reason<00:02:31.030> really<00:02:31.180> not<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.660> do

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
and there's no reason really not to do

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.200 
and there's no reason really not to do
it<00:02:31.960> because<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:32.770> can<00:02:32.860> just<00:02:32.940> possibly<00:02:33.940> get<00:02:34.180> a

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
it because you can just possibly get a

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.880 
it because you can just possibly get a
really<00:02:34.450> cool<00:02:34.600> mount<00:02:34.810> you<00:02:35.350> make<00:02:35.470> a<00:02:35.500> little<00:02:35.770> bit

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
really cool mount you make a little bit

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.470 
really cool mount you make a little bit
of<00:02:35.950> gold<00:02:36.130> doing<00:02:36.520> it<00:02:36.640> too<00:02:36.850> especially<00:02:37.090> if<00:02:37.390> you

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
of gold doing it too especially if you

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.320 
of gold doing it too especially if you
loot<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.860> trash<00:02:39.160> but<00:02:39.610> alright<00:02:40.180> yeah

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
loot the the trash but alright yeah

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.360 
loot the the trash but alright yeah
here's<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.810> debuff<00:02:41.170> chance<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:42.010> hit<00:02:42.160> with

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
here's the debuff chance to hit with

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.240 
here's the debuff chance to hit with
spells<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:42.910> melee<00:02:43.300> reduced<00:02:43.630> by<00:02:44.250> fifty

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
spells and melee reduced by fifty

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.970 
spells and melee reduced by fifty
percent<00:02:45.400> so<00:02:46.270> that<00:02:46.450> can<00:02:46.720> that's<00:02:47.710> actually

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
percent so that can that's actually

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.130 
percent so that can that's actually
somewhat<00:02:48.640> annoying<00:02:48.880> sometimes<00:02:49.240> but<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:49.900> mean

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
somewhat annoying sometimes but I mean

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.680 
somewhat annoying sometimes but I mean

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
at eighty-five it's really not a big

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.500 
at eighty-five it's really not a big
deal<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.830> there's<00:02:57.370> occasional<00:02:57.760> knock<00:02:58.270> back

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510
