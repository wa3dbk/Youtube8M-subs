00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.780
 hello all hello I am marcela I hope 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.790
 that are fine today we are going to 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.940
 make a super cute hairstyle 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.510
 let's start first let's take a 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.460
 part of the hair this side of the head 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.619
 and we divide it into three sections 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.410
 let's make a regular braid 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:32.529
 crossing the divisions of the sides by 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.660
 above the one in the center and the 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.559
 We hold with an elastic band 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.559
 Meanwhile 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.860
 now let's pick up a division 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.100
 small hair from above 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.100
 we go with our hands to open the 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.400
 braid and for the first space of the 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.940
 braid we are going to pull this division towards 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.940
 the other side 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.770
 perfect again we pick up another 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:14.190
 small division we open the braid in the 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.210
 second space and with our fingers 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.220
 we pull this division to the other side 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.470
 and so we're going to continue doing what 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.610
 same until we have reached the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.610
 half of the head 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.760
 when we already have the braid we are going to 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.159
 hold it with a paper clip meanwhile and 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.440
 we do exactly the same to the other 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.220
 side of the head 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.380
 well here we already have the two braids 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.690
 then what we are going to do is join them 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.710
 and we hold them with a band 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.460
 elastic 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.460
 no no 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.400
 here we can remove the other bands 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.149
 with which we were holding the 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:11.000
 braids and if you want here you can 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.459
 stop and leave the hairstyle just like that 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.280
 It also looks very cute and it is very easy 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.550
 to do or the other option is to continue 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.760
 with the hairstyle taking a part of the 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.209
 hair on this side we divide it into three 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.239
 sections and we're going to start crossing 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:33.040
 the divisions of the sides above 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.040
 of the division that is in the center 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.180
 but that again above and here 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.590
 let's add hair to the braid 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.420
 picking up the divisions we had 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.420
 left out before 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.780
 now above and picks up a very 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.200
 little hair to add it to the 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.200
 braid 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:03:00.250
 again then crossed this division 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.920
 above 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.700
 and added the division that leaves out 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.700
 before 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:13.630
 and now on the other side 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:16.470
 I cross over and added a division 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.840
 very little braid 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.570
 and we will continue doing the same 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.030
 steps until we have added all 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.450
 the divisions of the first braid that 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.450
 we did 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.790
 here then let's knit some 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.460
 more steps of the braid we hold it with 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.590
 an elastic bandit meanwhile and 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.460
 we do exactly the same to the other 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.460
 side of the head 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.360
 when we already have the two braids we're going 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.440
 to join them and we hold them with a 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.440
 elastic band 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.590
 to finish the hairstyle then I go to 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.590
 remove the bands with which I was 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.350
 holding the braids and I will use 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:21.630
 a little piece of tape to make a 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.630
 tie and cover each bandite 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.790
 and here then we have the result with 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.310
 our final turn we can see that the 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.860
 hairstyle looks super cute to me 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.200
 loved I think the combination of 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.300
 these braids is perfect and it's a 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.300
 hairstyle that works for any day 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.500
 we hope you liked the video
