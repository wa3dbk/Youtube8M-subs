caffeine I'll do it too any stimulants
will<00:00:47.910> do<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.090> even<00:00:48.270> when<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.450> take<00:00:48.600> stuff

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
will do it even when you take stuff

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.119 
will do it even when you take stuff
before<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.110> train<00:00:49.350> like<00:00:49.379> nitrix<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.039> that

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
before you train like nitrix and that

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.490 
before you train like nitrix and that
type<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.280> stuff<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.809> I<00:00:51.809> had<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.079> checked<00:00:52.260> out<00:00:52.440> a

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
type of stuff so I had it checked out a

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.209 
type of stuff so I had it checked out a
year<00:00:52.739> ago

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
year ago

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.920 
year ago
and<00:00:53.399> he<00:00:53.489> put<00:00:53.699> me<00:00:53.820> on<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.030> medication<00:00:54.510> called

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
and he put me on a medication called

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.450 
and he put me on a medication called
lopressor<00:00:55.410> which<00:00:55.590> even<00:00:55.949> now<00:00:56.010> my<00:00:56.129> heartbeat

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
lopressor which even now my heartbeat

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.099 
lopressor which even now my heartbeat
actually<00:00:57.180> lowered<00:00:57.539> my<00:00:57.660> blood<00:00:57.840> pressure<00:00:58.020> a

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
actually lowered my blood pressure a

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.630 
actually lowered my blood pressure a
little<00:00:58.199> bit<00:00:58.320> too<00:00:58.500> because<00:00:58.649> also<00:00:59.100> training<00:00:59.520> can

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
little bit too because also training can

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.760 
little bit too because also training can
raise<00:00:59.760> your<00:00:59.910> blood<00:01:00.030> pressure<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:01.500> think<00:01:01.680> we

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
raise your blood pressure and I think we

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.270 
raise your blood pressure and I think we
all<00:01:01.859> know<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.690> now<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.750> downside<00:01:04.559> of

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
all know that now the downside of

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.730 
all know that now the downside of
training<00:01:05.760> as<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.360> went<00:01:06.540> back<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.840> today<00:01:07.140> and

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
training as I went back in today and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.520 
training as I went back in today and
everything<00:01:08.430> was<00:01:08.580> normal<00:01:08.610> except<00:01:09.600> he<00:01:10.260> said

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
everything was normal except he said

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.710 
everything was normal except he said
when<00:01:10.680> you're<00:01:10.799> over<00:01:11.040> 50<00:01:11.340> years<00:01:11.460> old<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.030> you

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
when you're over 50 years old and you

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.960 
when you're over 50 years old and you
train<00:01:13.020> like<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.350> do<00:01:13.409> or<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.979> do<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
train like I do or like you do that the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.280 
train like I do or like you do that the
way<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.270> thing<00:01:15.420> builds<00:01:15.689> your<00:01:15.810> heart<00:01:16.020> we<00:01:16.140> all

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
way that thing builds your heart we all

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.719 
way that thing builds your heart we all
know<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:16.740> get<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.100> large<00:01:17.369> heart

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
know this you can get in a large heart

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.120 
know this you can get in a large heart
it<00:01:17.880> becomes<00:01:18.150> big<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.960> becomes<00:01:19.259> strong<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.070> it

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
it becomes big it becomes strong and it

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.700 
it becomes big it becomes strong and it
becomes<00:01:20.400> stiff<00:01:20.790> now<00:01:21.659> that's<00:01:21.869> good<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.200> one<00:01:22.380> one

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
becomes stiff now that's good in one one

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.230 
becomes stiff now that's good in one one
respect<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.490> other<00:01:23.580> respect<00:01:24.030> when<00:01:24.150> it

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
respect but on the other respect when it

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.460 
respect but on the other respect when it
becomes<00:01:24.509> stiff<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.020> back<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.350> heart

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
becomes stiff the back of the heart

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.560 
becomes stiff the back of the heart
becomes<00:01:25.740> stiff<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.220> doesn't<00:01:26.970> beat<00:01:27.180> like<00:01:27.420> it

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
becomes stiff it doesn't beat like it

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.539 
becomes stiff it doesn't beat like it
should<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:28.020> not<00:01:28.170> as<00:01:28.320> pliable<00:01:28.799> as<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> heart

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
should it's not as pliable as a heart

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.640 
should it's not as pliable as a heart
would<00:01:29.820> be<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.570> isn't<00:01:30.840> as<00:01:30.930> big<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.350> isn't

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
would be that isn't as big and it isn't

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.710 
would be that isn't as big and it isn't
a<00:01:31.710> stiff<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.759> means<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.210> not<00:01:33.329> pumping

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
a stiff so that means it's not pumping

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.440 
a stiff so that means it's not pumping
the<00:01:34.200> blood<00:01:34.470> as<00:01:34.740> hard<00:01:35.250> as<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.430> should<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.759> now

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
the blood as hard as it should be now

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.990 
the blood as hard as it should be now
because<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.439> heart<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.770> strong<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.520> because

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
because the heart is strong and because

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.179 
because the heart is strong and because
we<00:01:39.180> trained<00:01:39.570> he<00:01:40.350> explained<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.860> me<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.040> you

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
we trained he explained to me that you

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.399 
we trained he explained to me that you
need<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.430> lot<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.670> blood<00:01:41.850> going<00:01:42.119> through<00:01:42.350> so<00:01:43.350> you

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
need a lot of blood going through so you

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.039 
need a lot of blood going through so you
have<00:01:43.680> three<00:01:44.009> arteries<00:01:44.369> going<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.700> there

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
have three arteries going in there

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.780 
have three arteries going in there
sometimes<00:01:46.049> they're<00:01:46.290> clogged<00:01:46.619> it's<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:47.579> he

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
sometimes they're clogged it's like he

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.490 
sometimes they're clogged it's like he
explained<00:01:48.240> pipes<00:01:48.689> under<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.049> house<00:01:49.229> when

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
explained pipes under the house when

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.630 
explained pipes under the house when
you've<00:01:49.590> been<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> house<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> long<00:01:50.280> time<00:01:50.490> like

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
you've been in a house a long time like

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.550 
you've been in a house a long time like
I<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.119> galvanized<00:01:51.509> pipes<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.380> get<00:01:52.530> a

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
I have in galvanized pipes you get a

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.960 
I have in galvanized pipes you get a
residue<00:01:52.890> build-up<00:01:53.189> which<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.490> cholesterol<00:01:53.880> in

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
residue build-up which is cholesterol in

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.090 
residue build-up which is cholesterol in
your<00:01:54.270> arteries<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.350> water<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.799> your<00:01:55.890> house

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
your arteries the water in your house

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.740 
your arteries the water in your house
doesn't<00:01:56.369> go<00:01:56.549> through<00:01:56.700> good<00:01:56.969> comes<00:01:57.509> out<00:01:57.600> your

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
doesn't go through good comes out your

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.120 
doesn't go through good comes out your
showers<00:01:58.049> slower<00:01:58.290> out<00:01:58.469> your<00:01:58.649> faucets<00:01:59.009> or

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
showers slower out your faucets or

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.219 
showers slower out your faucets or
because<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.490> pressure<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.930> side<00:02:01.200> that

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
because the pressure and the side that

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.600 
because the pressure and the side that
pipes<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.829> keeping<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.130> water<00:02:02.280> from<00:02:02.430> flowing

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
pipes is keeping the water from flowing

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.709 
pipes is keeping the water from flowing
it's<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.939> same<00:02:03.119> thing<00:02:03.270> with<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.450> blood<00:02:03.630> in

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
it's the same thing with the blood in

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.770 
it's the same thing with the blood in
your<00:02:03.840> heart<00:02:04.159> so<00:02:05.159> what<00:02:05.820> he<00:02:05.939> suggested<00:02:06.540> was<00:02:06.689> to

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
your heart so what he suggested was to

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.630 
your heart so what he suggested was to
come<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.079> for<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> test<00:02:07.590> not<00:02:07.950> just<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.250> treadmill

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
come in for a test not just a treadmill

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.150 
come in for a test not just a treadmill
now<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.819> didn't<00:02:09.179> know<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.450> either<00:02:10.009> but<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
now I didn't know this either but the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.820 
now I didn't know this either but the
treadmill<00:02:11.610> can<00:02:11.849> have<00:02:12.120> be<00:02:12.810> 30%<00:02:13.200> off

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
treadmill can have be 30% off

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.190 
treadmill can have be 30% off
a<00:02:13.890> false<00:02:14.730> positive<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.780> could<00:02:15.870> be<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.960> false

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
a false positive and it could be a false

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.140 
a false positive and it could be a false
negative<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.860> false<00:02:17.640> negative<00:02:17.820> which<00:02:18.090> means

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
negative a false negative which means

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.760 
negative a false negative which means
that<00:02:18.540> if<00:02:18.960> they<00:02:19.110> tell<00:02:19.320> you<00:02:19.380> it's<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.560> false

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
that if they tell you it's a false

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.870 
that if they tell you it's a false
positive<00:02:19.890> or<00:02:20.280> negative<00:02:20.550> you<00:02:20.610> don't<00:02:20.730> know<00:02:20.790> if

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
positive or negative you don't know if

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.280 
positive or negative you don't know if
it's<00:02:21.000> true<00:02:21.090> or<00:02:21.150> not<00:02:21.270> so<00:02:21.570> why<00:02:21.870> even<00:02:21.930> take<00:02:22.200> the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
it's true or not so why even take the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.800 
it's true or not so why even take the
test<00:02:22.460> but<00:02:23.460> he<00:02:23.550> has<00:02:23.670> another<00:02:23.940> test<00:02:24.240> that<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.690> do

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
test but he has another test that you do

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.210 
test but he has another test that you do
on<00:02:24.990> a<00:02:25.020> treadmill<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.650> then<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.920> have<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.100> have

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
on a treadmill and then you have to have

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.280 
on a treadmill and then you have to have
your<00:02:26.340> heart<00:02:26.580> scan<00:02:27.390> for<00:02:27.600> 20<00:02:27.870> minutes<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.200> then

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
your heart scan for 20 minutes and then

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.710 
your heart scan for 20 minutes and then
treadmill<00:02:28.650> again<00:02:28.710> they<00:02:28.980> put<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.160> little<00:02:29.720> some

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
treadmill again they put a little some

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.970 
treadmill again they put a little some
sort<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.020> substance<00:02:31.410> in<00:02:31.530> your<00:02:31.590> blood<00:02:31.950> that

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
sort of a substance in your blood that

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.410 
sort of a substance in your blood that
goes<00:02:32.310> into<00:02:32.460> your<00:02:32.550> heart<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:32.970> triggers<00:02:33.300> your

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
goes into your heart and triggers your

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.510 
goes into your heart and triggers your
heart<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.660> do<00:02:33.780> certain<00:02:33.990> things<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:35.250> tells

heart to do certain things and it tells

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.520 
heart to do certain things and it tells
them<00:02:35.790> whether<00:02:36.090> or<00:02:36.270> not<00:02:36.420> all<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:37.080> these<00:02:37.200> parts

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
them whether or not all of these parts

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.320 
them whether or not all of these parts
of<00:02:37.620> your<00:02:37.710> heart<00:02:37.920> are<00:02:38.610> working<00:02:39.060> if<00:02:39.210> those

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
arteries are working or not now if

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.810 
arteries are working or not now if
they're<00:02:40.860> not<00:02:40.890> then<00:02:41.250> you've<00:02:41.370> got<00:02:41.490> a<00:02:41.520> problem

they're not then you've got a problem

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.250 
they're not then you've got a problem
then<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.150> have<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.420> have<00:02:42.570> maybe<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.840> bypass

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
then you have to have maybe a bypass

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.020 
then you have to have maybe a bypass
surgery<00:02:43.650> or<00:02:43.770> you<00:02:44.130> have<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.430> have<00:02:44.460> it<00:02:44.640> opened<00:02:44.910> up

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.960 
it's like a car going on the freeway at
100<00:03:04.890> miles<00:03:05.010> an<00:03:05.160> hour<00:03:05.310> when<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.580> speed<00:03:05.760> limit

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
100 miles an hour when the speed limit

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.699 
100 miles an hour when the speed limit
at<00:03:06.060> 60<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.510> you're<00:03:06.959> really<00:03:07.170> pushing<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:07.620> and

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
at 60 and you're really pushing it and

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:08.870 
at 60 and you're really pushing it and
pushing<00:03:07.770> it<00:03:08.100> now<00:03:08.280> if<00:03:08.370> you're<00:03:08.490> a<00:03:08.520> good<00:03:08.670> driver

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
pushing it now if you're a good driver

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.300 
pushing it now if you're a good driver
you<00:03:09.060> can<00:03:09.150> handle<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:10.070> but<00:03:11.070> if<00:03:11.190> you're

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
you can handle that but if you're

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.590 
you can handle that but if you're
unhealthy<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:11.940> you're<00:03:12.030> racing<00:03:12.300> like<00:03:12.420> that

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
unhealthy and you're racing like that

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.410 
unhealthy and you're racing like that
it's<00:03:13.020> not<00:03:13.230> very<00:03:13.440> good<00:03:13.709> so<00:03:14.430> he<00:03:14.670> says<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.060> idea

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
it's not very good so he says the idea

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.420 
it's not very good so he says the idea
is<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.690> have<00:03:15.810> this<00:03:16.050> test<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:16.530> find<00:03:16.740> out<00:03:16.980> if<00:03:17.220> your

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
is to have this test to find out if your

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.830 
is to have this test to find out if your
arteries<00:03:17.910> can<00:03:18.090> handle<00:03:18.450> that<00:03:18.600> type<00:03:18.810> of

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
arteries can handle that type of

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.780 
arteries can handle that type of
pressure<00:03:19.170> or<00:03:19.380> that<00:03:19.530> lifestyle<00:03:20.040> when<00:03:20.670> you're

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
pressure or that lifestyle when you're

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.180 
pressure or that lifestyle when you're
over<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.090> certain<00:03:21.330> age<00:03:21.570> it<00:03:22.470> makes<00:03:22.680> sense<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:23.070> me

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
over a certain age it makes sense to me

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.710 
over a certain age it makes sense to me
because<00:03:23.550> you<00:03:24.060> want<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.269> prevent<00:03:24.540> heart

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
because you want to prevent heart

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.330 
because you want to prevent heart
attacks<00:03:24.989> and<00:03:25.170> as<00:03:25.290> he<00:03:25.440> said<00:03:25.680> 70<00:03:26.040> percent<00:03:26.280> of

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
attacks and as he said 70 percent of

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.949 
attacks and as he said 70 percent of
people<00:03:26.459> have<00:03:27.209> heart<00:03:27.480> attacks<00:03:27.720> they<00:03:27.840> don't

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
people have heart attacks they don't

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.120 
people have heart attacks they don't
even<00:03:28.019> not<00:03:28.350> even<00:03:28.380> prepare<00:03:28.769> they're<00:03:28.950> playing

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
even not even prepare they're playing

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.350 
even not even prepare they're playing
golf<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.489> day<00:03:29.580> before<00:03:29.880> next<00:03:30.030> day<00:03:30.150> they<00:03:30.209> have<00:03:30.300> a

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
golf the day before next day they have a

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.580 
golf the day before next day they have a
heart<00:03:30.480> attack<00:03:30.510> like<00:03:30.810> that<00:03:30.840> because<00:03:31.350> they<00:03:31.470> have

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
heart attack like that because they have

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.199 
heart attack like that because they have
clogged<00:03:31.830> arteries<00:03:32.190> they<00:03:32.580> don't<00:03:32.790> realize<00:03:33.060> what

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
it even you guys thirty thirty-five

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.270 
it even you guys thirty thirty-five
years<00:04:00.660> old<00:04:00.750> who<00:04:00.930> are<00:04:00.959> doing<00:04:01.320> lots<00:04:01.920> of<00:04:02.010> drugs

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
years old who are doing lots of drugs

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.400 
years old who are doing lots of drugs
and<00:04:02.550> training<00:04:03.239> really<00:04:03.360> hard<00:04:03.570> check<00:04:04.170> it<00:04:04.260> out

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
and training really hard check it out

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.650 
and training really hard check it out
because<00:04:05.130> even<00:04:05.519> testosterone<00:04:06.090> alone<00:04:06.300> you<00:04:06.480> take

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
because even testosterone alone you take

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.780 
because even testosterone alone you take
it<00:04:06.780> raises<00:04:07.170> your<00:04:07.260> red<00:04:07.440> blood<00:04:07.709> cells<00:04:07.980> and<00:04:08.459> it

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
it raises your red blood cells and it

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.160 
it raises your red blood cells and it
can<00:04:08.910> raise<00:04:09.090> it<00:04:09.239> high<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:09.630> if<00:04:09.780> it<00:04:09.870> gets<00:04:10.019> too

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
can raise it high and if it gets too

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.990 
can raise it high and if it gets too
high<00:04:10.380> the<00:04:10.650> blood<00:04:10.860> thickens<00:04:11.130> when<00:04:11.730> it<00:04:11.850> gets

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
high the blood thickens when it gets

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.270 
high the blood thickens when it gets
thick<00:04:12.410> it<00:04:13.410> doesn't<00:04:13.470> go<00:04:13.739> through<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:13.980> arteries

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
thick it doesn't go through the arteries

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.400 
thick it doesn't go through the arteries
it<00:04:14.430> causes<00:04:14.700> a<00:04:14.730> stroke<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:15.239> many<00:04:16.019> people<00:04:16.290> have

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
it causes a stroke and many people have

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.659 
it causes a stroke and many people have
to<00:04:16.500> go<00:04:16.590> and<00:04:16.709> once<00:04:16.830> a<00:04:16.890> month<00:04:16.919> and<00:04:17.160> get<00:04:17.220> a<00:04:17.280> pint<00:04:17.549> or

to go and once a month and get a pint or

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.340 
to go and once a month and get a pint or
two<00:04:17.729> removed<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:18.630> drained<00:04:18.900> out<00:04:19.080> of<00:04:19.200> them<00:04:19.320> so

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
two removed and drained out of them so

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.770 
two removed and drained out of them so
that<00:04:19.590> their<00:04:19.799> blood<00:04:19.950> stays<00:04:20.190> thin<00:04:20.570> these<00:04:21.570> are

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780
