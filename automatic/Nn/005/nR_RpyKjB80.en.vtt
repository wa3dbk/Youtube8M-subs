if they have small feet Oh

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.639 
if they have small feet Oh
because<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:51.030> one<00:01:51.329> size<00:01:51.630> fits<00:01:52.049> most<00:01:52.200> for

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
because it is one size fits most for

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.340 
because it is one size fits most for
women<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.579> would<00:01:53.790> be<00:01:53.939> like<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.390> size<00:01:54.689> 5<00:01:55.079> up

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350

women and that would be like a size 5 up
to<00:01:55.380> even<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.040> ladies<00:01:56.310> 12<00:01:56.610> my<00:01:56.759> girlfriend<00:01:57.149> wears

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
a 12 and they fit comfortably so I guess

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.639 
a 12 and they fit comfortably so I guess
if<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.909> have<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.149> man<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.659> wears<00:02:00.810> 9<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.409> below

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.679 
if you have a man that wears 9 and below
they<00:02:01.979> could<00:02:02.159> probably<00:02:02.369> fit<00:02:02.939> into<00:02:03.090> these<00:02:03.329> too

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689
