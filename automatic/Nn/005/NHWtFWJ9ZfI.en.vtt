00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.079
 just the beginning 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.120
 a few more weeks and then it is 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.530
 carnival but not for everyone 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.480
 the research that the Limburg newspapers 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.090
 had the number shown 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.420
 Carnival atmosphere has fallen sharply 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:26.240
 compared to 10 years ago when it went 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.880
 three quarters of the limburgers still out 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.210
 that is not a little less than half 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.580
 Carnival has changed a little about that 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.989
 change and arrived fall is we the 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:42.430
 partying on a larger scale is there 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:46.309
 then often TV alone or peer Limburg 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.110
 is broadcast on TV on things 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.000
 names channels above which people then 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.680
 coming up with youth 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.699
 there it is to do there I have to 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.590
 to be 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:58.129
 and what you see is that in particular 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.070
 the soft music during carnival throughout 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.840
 is changing a lot 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.540
 very often carnival numbers are too 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.320
 numbers that become a summer party 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.550
 played 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.550
 you see 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.800
 groups like two three or big benny or la 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.560
 bamba and the just to name a few 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.170
 they perform on summers and marquees and 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.930
 there is just a solid beat 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.220
 often were even older carnival lovers 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.220
 lights on no longer completely at home 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.750
 we put the conclusions one more job one 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.970
 row last week we brought another outside 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.180
 that just a little less than half the 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.000
 Limburg Carnival celebrates 10 years 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.780
 that was considerably more ago 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.930
 then 75% of the Limburg population went 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.920
 women are going out these days 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.500
 during carnival 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.150
 get out there than men and the elderly 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.270
 live more often at home than young people 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.740
 the decrease in the number 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.470
 carnival lovers 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.050
 yes we still need the explanation 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.440
 search that you will soon on the basis of 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.490
 the responses to this research 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.820
 likely to see trick in the stories 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.310
 That 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.260
 that we will make about it ourselves 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.150
 we figured out that path in particular too 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.250
 has to do with the wall paint festival 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.810
 isee ring of the carnival 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.030
 and what that festival is exactly 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.430
 You read next Saturday 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.850
 in the limburger and limburgs newspapers 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.850
 newspaper
