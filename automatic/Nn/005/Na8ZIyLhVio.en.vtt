00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:05.629 
else I like about this gun is that the

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:07.899 
else I like about this gun is that the
versatility<00:06:06.169> of<00:06:06.409> it<00:06:06.649> means<00:06:07.039> that<00:06:07.339> on<00:06:07.490> most

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:07.909 
versatility of it means that on most

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.749 
versatility of it means that on most
levels<00:06:08.209> you<00:06:08.839> sort<00:06:09.199> of<00:06:09.319> you<00:06:10.009> can<00:06:10.189> play<00:06:10.429> in<00:06:10.490> when

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759 
levels you sort of you can play in when

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:12.489 
levels you sort of you can play in when
I<00:06:10.789> scales<00:06:11.240> which<00:06:11.629> means<00:06:11.869> you<00:06:11.990> can<00:06:12.110> do<00:06:12.259> a<00:06:12.289> bit<00:06:12.469> of

00:06:12.489 --> 00:06:12.499 
I scales which means you can do a bit of

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:14.889 
I scales which means you can do a bit of
Russia<00:06:12.740> we<00:06:13.459> can<00:06:13.789> sit<00:06:13.999> back<00:06:14.029> and<00:06:14.509> do<00:06:14.659> a<00:06:14.689> bit<00:06:14.869> of

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:14.899 
Russia we can sit back and do a bit of

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:17.919 
Russia we can sit back and do a bit of
snapping<00:06:15.529> with<00:06:15.649> it<00:06:15.769> that's<00:06:16.429> because<00:06:16.789> with<00:06:17.779> the

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:17.929 
snapping with it that's because with the

00:06:17.929 --> 00:06:19.809 
snapping with it that's because with the
recoil<00:06:18.409> energy<00:06:18.800> back<00:06:19.129> and<00:06:19.309> forth<00:06:19.550> you<00:06:19.789> can

recoil energy back and forth you can

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:21.999 
recoil energy back and forth you can
still<00:06:20.179> burst<00:06:20.659> fire<00:06:20.959> and<00:06:21.319> place<00:06:21.529> shots<00:06:21.800> very
