00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:15.580
 well let's go with the oil change 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:18.439
 for the in 93 20 you know an engine m 47 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:22.010
 Here I leave you in the description of the video 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.660
 the necessary tools and tools that 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.690
 buy castro oil but you can well 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.160
 use of oil although without it being 51 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.920
 of 30 we started opening 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.630
 the plug 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:41.000
 so that it comes out a little faster 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:46.790
 oil it is recommended that the car be 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.280
 a little warm so it will be easier in 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.410
 The moat 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.160
 as a proposal of with something riches and 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.829
 newbies we develop the cover of 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.980
 plastic 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.109
 and we end plug enter 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.960
 some of 17 yo for not staining the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:09.500
 bones to guide me a bit with the fixed 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:12.230
 but I will not leave the screw and have a 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.760
 life below 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:20.380
 to collect the oil and then throw it 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.380
 to a clean point and do not forget 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.659
 i 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.270
 well let the oil go now 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.540
 coming out and we get with the filter 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.240
 to remove it we finished this glass of 36 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.770
 millimeters I found it in the car 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.740
 relatively cheap over the eight 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.810
 euros 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.620
 and perfectly matches the load that is 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.180
 of half an inch 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.790
 the moss unscrews it from the sense 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.850
 counter-clockwise and have a prepared 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:04.260
 piece of paper to try with the drip 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.260
 stain as little as possible 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.560
 yes 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.789
 and 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.230
 and never 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.379
 well now to remove the filter from 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:38.049
 accommodation comes out but there is a 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.049
 little hard hit 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:49.830
 we cleaned it a little bit and changed the 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.819
 the O-ring that comes along with the 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.819
 site that we have bought 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.040
 and for the good where the clean tonic goes 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.040
 and you put the normal 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.820
 ah 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.820
 all right 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.450
 okay 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.930
 we introduce it into the filter simply 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.350
 we press hard to the end 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.350
 and ready 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:36.099
 inside of that said ready 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.680
 avn 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.280
 5 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.780
 Y 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.390
 when taking 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.470
 you send an email and told me 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:19.160
 I understand your doubt says state 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:20.989
 asking now we change the board of 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.800
 copper crankcase plug that also 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.389
 comes with the filter 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.990
 i 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.990
 here 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.120
 also we started looking for the cap 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.120
 hand 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:42.590
 and we continue with the metric dynamo 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.590
 also up to 25 liters per meter 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.090
 the dynamics is clear that it is not 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.140
 obligatory but of course yes 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.140
 highly recommended 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.570
 and why 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.380
 Y 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:14.190
 we put back the plastic lid of 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:14.190
 the basses and we rotate the tab that takes 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.529
 now we can proceed to take the 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.759
 oil 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:20.759
 but all my boy 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.210
 2 looking at one by the mobile 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.500
 ah 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.970

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.970

00:05:52.910 --> 00:06:00.050
 Hello

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.360
 liters and with the liter bottle 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:07.830
 we complete to the level that's all
