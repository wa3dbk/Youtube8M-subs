00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
made out of a matte plastic which is

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.869 
made out of a matte plastic which is
alright<00:01:01.260> you'll<00:01:01.980> notice<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:02.579> pretty

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
alright you'll notice that it's pretty

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.509 
alright you'll notice that it's pretty
flush<00:01:03.390> with<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.989> glass<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.680> was<00:01:04.830> at<00:01:04.949> first

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
flush with the glass and I was at first

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.980 
flush with the glass and I was at first
really<00:01:05.850> concerned<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.630> wouldn't<00:01:06.840> offer

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
really concerned that it wouldn't offer

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.690 
really concerned that it wouldn't offer
enough<00:01:07.320> protection<00:01:07.920> for<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.220> front<00:01:08.369> glass

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
enough protection for the front glass

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.510 
enough protection for the front glass
but<00:01:09.450> because<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.049> raised<00:01:10.409> edge<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
but because of the raised edge of the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.340 
but because of the raised edge of the
keyboard<00:01:12.030> when<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.630> play<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.840> piss<00:01:13.170> and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
keyboard when you play it piss and

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.710 
keyboard when you play it piss and
flower<00:01:13.590> vase<00:01:14.070> down<00:01:14.360> you<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.479> nothing<00:01:15.689> to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
flower vase down you have nothing to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.240 
flower vase down you have nothing to
worry<00:01:15.869> about<00:01:15.990> because<00:01:16.500> you've<00:01:16.650> got<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.950> gap

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
worry about because you've got that gap

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.800 
worry about because you've got that gap
and<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.610> never<00:01:17.790> will<00:01:17.909> touch<00:01:18.119> your<00:01:18.299> glass<00:01:18.570> which

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
and it never will touch your glass which

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.380 
and it never will touch your glass which
is<00:01:18.840> nice<00:01:19.140> I'm<00:01:19.860> not<00:01:20.220> sure<00:01:20.520> how<00:01:20.700> robust<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
is nice I'm not sure how robust the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.690 
is nice I'm not sure how robust the
cases<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.049> because<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.530> keys<00:01:22.770> go<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.369> close

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
cases and because the keys go so close

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.330 
cases and because the keys go so close
to<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> edges<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.630> think<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.470> big<00:01:25.770> drop<00:01:26.100> onto

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
to the edges I think a big drop onto

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.730 
to the edges I think a big drop onto
concrete<00:01:26.909> or<00:01:27.030> tile<00:01:27.630> might<00:01:28.140> be<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.470> end<00:01:28.590> of

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
concrete or tile might be the end of

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.999 
concrete or tile might be the end of
this<00:01:28.799> case<00:01:29.610> but<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.720> being<00:01:30.930> said<00:01:31.229> I'm<00:01:31.530> really

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
this case but that being said I'm really

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.039 
this case but that being said I'm really
excited<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.400> try<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.670> out<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.030> see<00:01:33.689> if<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.900> can

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
excited to try it out and see if I can

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.530 
excited to try it out and see if I can
type<00:01:34.290> faster<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.009> more<00:01:35.100> accurately<00:01:35.579> some<00:01:36.450> of

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
type faster and more accurately some of

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.120 
type faster and more accurately some of
the<00:01:36.600> claims<00:01:36.930> actually<00:01:37.680> really<00:01:38.009> nice

that the keyboard is exposed in the

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.800 
that the keyboard is exposed in the
packaging<00:01:41.939> here<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.299> can<00:01:42.390> actually<00:01:42.600> feel

that gives you some feedback unlike the

that gives you some feedback unlike the
virtual<00:01:48.780> keyboard<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.649> some<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.430> claims

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
virtual keyboard so some of the claims

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.450 
virtual keyboard so some of the claims
they<00:01:50.909> make<00:01:51.090> here<00:01:51.560> type<00:01:52.560> faster<00:01:53.070> with<00:01:53.220> fewer

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
they make here type faster with fewer

they make here type faster with fewer
typos<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.210> guess<00:01:54.630> we'll<00:01:54.869> see<00:01:55.020> about<00:01:55.079> that

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
typos I guess we'll see about that

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.459

like the autocorrect of the iPhone but I

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.369 
like the autocorrect of the iPhone but I
kind<00:02:37.879> of<00:02:37.939> find<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.269> necessary<00:02:38.480> when<00:02:39.079> I'm<00:02:39.170> doing

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
kind of find it necessary when I'm doing

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:40.720 
kind of find it necessary when I'm doing
the<00:02:39.470> virtual<00:02:39.620> because<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.069> hit<00:02:40.250> so<00:02:40.400> many<00:02:40.549> wrong

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
the virtual because I hit so many wrong

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.970 
the virtual because I hit so many wrong
keys<00:02:40.939> all<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.329> time<00:02:41.540> so<00:02:42.200> we'll<00:02:42.530> see<00:02:42.680> what<00:02:42.829> this

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
keys all the time so we'll see what this

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
actual keyboard I've been trying to type

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.440 
actual keyboard I've been trying to type
as<00:02:57.530> much<00:02:57.680> as<00:02:57.829> possible<00:02:58.069> just<00:02:58.549> to<00:02:59.120> see<00:02:59.269> if<00:02:59.359> I

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
as much as possible just to see if I

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.569 
as much as possible just to see if I
like<00:02:59.629> it<00:02:59.840> it<00:03:00.409> is<00:03:00.590> a<00:03:00.620> little<00:03:00.769> bit<00:03:00.980> cramped<00:03:01.340> even

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
like it it is a little bit cramped even

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.729 
like it it is a little bit cramped even
for<00:03:01.760> small<00:03:02.120> fingers<00:03:02.420> like<00:03:02.569> myself<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:03.109> if<00:03:03.650> you

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
for small fingers like myself and if you

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.800 
for small fingers like myself and if you
take<00:03:03.829> a<00:03:03.889> look<00:03:04.099> they<00:03:04.579> make<00:03:04.909> all<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.540> ports

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
take a look they make all the ports

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.720 
take a look they make all the ports
pass-through<00:03:06.409> so<00:03:06.739> when<00:03:06.859> you<00:03:06.920> have<00:03:07.159> the<00:03:07.340> iPhone

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
pass-through so when you have the iPhone

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.089 
pass-through so when you have the iPhone
and<00:03:08.060> connected<00:03:08.540> you<00:03:09.109> can<00:03:09.139> still<00:03:09.560> access<00:03:09.829> your
