aren't<00:01:52.740> really<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.189> bendable<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.909> really<00:01:54.240> like

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
aren't really is bendable I really like

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.170 
aren't really is bendable I really like
the<00:01:55.649> addy<00:01:55.829> cables<00:01:56.490> on<00:01:56.729> regular<00:01:57.240> at

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
the addy cables on regular at

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.350 
the addy cables on regular at
knitting<00:01:58.450> needles<00:01:59.220> because<00:02:00.220> they<00:02:00.940> are<00:02:01.330> very

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
knitting needles because they are very

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.600 
knitting needles because they are very
flexible<00:02:01.900> they<00:02:02.590> don't<00:02:02.770> think<00:02:03.040> up<00:02:03.220> they<00:02:03.430> don't

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
flexible they don't think up they don't

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.080 
flexible they don't think up they don't
twist<00:02:03.970> but<00:02:04.270> they're<00:02:04.450> not<00:02:04.570> so<00:02:04.870> thick<00:02:05.170> that<00:02:05.230> they

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
twist but they're not so thick that they

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.490 
twist but they're not so thick that they
don't<00:02:07.090> work<00:02:07.270> really<00:02:07.480> well<00:02:07.570> that<00:02:07.900> a<00:02:07.930> nice<00:02:08.170> ones

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
don't work really well that a nice ones

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.230 
don't work really well that a nice ones
are<00:02:08.679> much<00:02:08.890> more<00:02:09.160> like<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:09.610> older<00:02:09.970> style

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
are much more like the older style

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.380 
are much more like the older style
circular<00:02:10.869> knitting<00:02:11.050> needles<00:02:12.240> so<00:02:13.240> I<00:02:13.270> think

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
circular knitting needles so I think

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.850 
circular knitting needles so I think
that<00:02:13.660> they're<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.810> little<00:02:13.990> bit<00:02:14.230> harder<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.590> work

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
that they're a little bit harder to work

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.770 
that they're a little bit harder to work
with<00:02:14.920> especially<00:02:15.340> if<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.850> like<00:02:16.090> doing<00:02:16.480> magic

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
with especially if you like doing magic

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.870 
with especially if you like doing magic
loop<00:02:17.350> or<00:02:17.620> you're<00:02:17.890> trying<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.310> knit<00:02:18.430> at<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.700> very

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
loop or you're trying to knit at a very

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.800 
loop or you're trying to knit at a very
small<00:02:19.180> diameter<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:21.190> being<00:02:21.430> said<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:22.000> keep<00:02:22.660> a

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
small diameter that being said I keep a

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.750 
small diameter that being said I keep a
pair<00:02:23.050> of<00:02:23.170> Denise<00:02:23.590> interchangeable<00:02:24.370> around

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
pair of Denise interchangeable around

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.330 
pair of Denise interchangeable around
because<00:02:25.150> I<00:02:25.480> don't<00:02:25.990> like<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.650> have<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:27.130> lot<00:02:27.310> of

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
because I don't like to have a lot of

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.220 
because I don't like to have a lot of
different<00:02:27.490> lengths<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:28.660> knitting<00:02:28.959> needles

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
different lengths of knitting needles

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.979 
different lengths of knitting needles
for<00:02:29.860> really<00:02:30.280> large<00:02:30.550> science<00:02:31.270> knitting

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
for really large science knitting

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.220 
for really large science knitting
needles<00:02:32.290> I<00:02:32.670> mostly<00:02:33.670> used<00:02:34.090> size<00:02:34.450> 5<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:34.840> under<00:02:35.110> I

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
needles I mostly used size 5 and under I

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.979 
needles I mostly used size 5 and under I
mostly<00:02:35.650> really<00:02:36.010> actually<00:02:36.190> just<00:02:36.610> used<00:02:36.820> size<00:02:37.060> 11

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
mostly really actually just used size 11

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.150 
mostly really actually just used size 11
and<00:02:38.020> 2<00:02:38.370> knitting<00:02:39.370> needles<00:02:39.670> even<00:02:40.120> in<00:02:40.239> circulars

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
and 2 knitting needles even in circulars

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.640 
and 2 knitting needles even in circulars
so<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.190> need<00:02:42.550> those<00:02:42.670> larger<00:02:43.120> sizes<00:02:43.390> I<00:02:44.200> don't

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
so I need those larger sizes I don't

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.570 
so I need those larger sizes I don't
have<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.100> have<00:02:45.510> 10<00:02:46.510> pairs<00:02:46.900> of<00:02:47.320> size<00:02:47.920> 11<00:02:48.400> through

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
have to have 10 pairs of size 11 through

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.490 
have to have 10 pairs of size 11 through
15<00:02:48.700> knitting<00:02:49.270> needles<00:02:49.540> because<00:02:50.110> I'm<00:02:50.320> only

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
15 knitting needles because I'm only

15 knitting needles because I'm only
going<00:02:50.709> to<00:02:50.770> really<00:02:50.980> use<00:02:51.190> them<00:02:51.510> maybe<00:02:52.510> once<00:02:52.840> or

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
going to really use them maybe once or

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.290 
going to really use them maybe once or
twice<00:02:53.020> a<00:02:53.440> year<00:02:53.770> otherwise<00:02:54.760> I'm<00:02:54.940> just<00:02:55.120> going<00:02:55.270> to

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
twice a year otherwise I'm just going to

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.330 
twice a year otherwise I'm just going to
be<00:02:55.390> using<00:02:55.600> double<00:02:56.560> pointed<00:02:56.590> needles<00:02:57.130> for

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
be using double pointed needles for

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.729 
be using double pointed needles for
something<00:02:57.640> like<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.820> hat<00:02:58.120> and<00:02:58.390> bulky<00:02:58.750> yarn<00:02:58.780> so<00:02:59.709> I

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
something like a hat and bulky yarn so I

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.350 
something like a hat and bulky yarn so I
really<00:03:00.070> like<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.400> Denise<00:03:00.700> knitting<00:03:01.090> needles

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
really like the Denise knitting needles

they do occasionally come clicked which

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.960 
they do occasionally come clicked which
is<00:03:12.040> annoying<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:13.590> like<00:03:14.590> most<00:03:14.950> other<00:03:15.340> knitting

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
is annoying and like most other knitting

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.590 
is annoying and like most other knitting
needles<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:17.560> problem<00:03:18.190> I<00:03:18.519> have<00:03:18.850> with<00:03:19.150> most

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
needles the problem I have with most

really large circular knitting needles

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.810 
really large circular knitting needles
as<00:03:21.370> I<00:03:21.720> don't<00:03:22.720> like<00:03:22.989> how<00:03:23.380> they<00:03:23.890> that<00:03:24.190> they<00:03:24.610> go

from the knitting needle down to the
cord<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.250> there's<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:27.880> big<00:03:28.150> dip<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.810> how<00:03:29.470> the

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
Knitting in a knitting needle so because

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.970 
Knitting in a knitting needle so because
you<00:03:31.750> do<00:03:31.870> then<00:03:31.989> constantly<00:03:32.290> having<00:03:32.560> to<00:03:32.620> try<00:03:32.860> and

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
you do then constantly having to try and

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.070 
you do then constantly having to try and

slide in stitches over that dip and it
gets<00:03:35.200> caught<00:03:35.470> and<00:03:35.709> I<00:03:36.040> do<00:03:36.130> have<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.459> little<00:03:36.489> bit

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
gets caught and I do have a little bit

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.630 
gets caught and I do have a little bit
of<00:03:36.790> a<00:03:36.940> problem<00:03:37.150> with<00:03:37.360> that<00:03:37.390> with<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.750> Denise

so I'd have a pair if it weren't for the

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.960 
so I'd have a pair if it weren't for the
fact<00:06:10.470> that<00:06:10.740> the<00:06:10.919> lace<00:06:11.040> ones<00:06:11.280> weren't<00:06:11.520> out<00:06:11.700> yet

metal<00:06:29.220> instead<00:06:29.550> of<00:06:29.700> plastic<00:06:30.470> plastic<00:06:31.470> needles

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.640 
metal instead of plastic plastic needles
are<00:06:32.190> fine<00:06:32.520> though<00:06:33.000> if<00:06:33.510> you<00:06:33.930> knit<00:06:34.110> really<00:06:34.380> tight

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
are fine though if you knit really tight

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.129 
are fine though if you knit really tight
I<00:06:34.950> think<00:06:35.430> that<00:06:35.610> they<00:06:35.730> tend<00:06:35.880> to<00:06:36.060> stick<00:06:36.300> more<00:06:36.630> so

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 
I think that they tend to stick more so

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:38.510 
I think that they tend to stick more so
unless<00:06:37.500> you're<00:06:37.650> knitting<00:06:37.860> with<00:06:38.040> a<00:06:38.100> really
