so<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.670> might<00:00:35.820> not<00:00:36.030> make<00:00:36.210> sense<00:00:36.270> immediately

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
so it might not make sense immediately

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.990 
so it might not make sense immediately
but<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.920> spiritual<00:00:38.489> successor<00:00:38.969> to

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
but this is the spiritual successor to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.869 
but this is the spiritual successor to
my<00:00:39.390> green<00:00:39.719> flashing<00:00:40.399> ping-pong<00:00:41.399> paddle<00:00:41.760> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
my green flashing ping-pong paddle the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.459 
my green flashing ping-pong paddle the
first<00:00:42.090> thing<00:00:42.239> anybody<00:00:42.629> did<00:00:43.020> when<00:00:43.170> they<00:00:43.260> picked

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
first thing anybody did when they picked

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.869 
first thing anybody did when they picked
it<00:00:43.559> up<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.860> use<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.070> would<00:00:44.370> start<00:00:44.579> making

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
it up and use it would start making

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.610 
it up and use it would start making
lightsaber<00:00:45.270> sounds<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.870> figured<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.440> might

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
lightsaber sounds so I figured I might

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.209 
lightsaber sounds so I figured I might
as<00:00:46.950> well<00:00:47.039> make<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.250> official<00:00:48.289> and<00:00:49.289> really<00:00:50.070> make

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
as well make it official and really make

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.400 
as well make it official and really make
it<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.550> lightsaber<00:00:51.030> ping-pong<00:00:51.600> paddle<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.230> so

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
it a lightsaber ping-pong paddle and so

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.470 
it a lightsaber ping-pong paddle and so
what<00:00:52.559> I've<00:00:52.680> done<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.860> I've<00:00:53.100> taken<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.879> stick<00:00:54.360> an

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
what I've done is I've taken a stick an

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.660 
what I've done is I've taken a stick an
indoor/outdoor<00:00:55.050> ping-pong<00:00:55.469> paddle<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.070> I've

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
indoor/outdoor ping-pong paddle and I've

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.639 
indoor/outdoor ping-pong paddle and I've
transplanted<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.750> Hasbro<00:00:58.050> lightsaber

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
transplanted in a Hasbro lightsaber

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.200 
transplanted in a Hasbro lightsaber
sound<00:00:58.980> board<00:00:59.280> from<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> kind<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.820> children's

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
sound board from the kind of children's

sound board from the kind of children's
versions<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:00.840> pick<00:01:00.989> up<00:01:01.020> at<00:01:01.260> Walmart<00:01:01.530> and

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
versions you can pick up at Walmart and

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.789 
versions you can pick up at Walmart and
I<00:01:03.059> embedded<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.719> here<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.140> handle<00:01:04.320> after<00:01:04.769> I

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
I embedded it here in the handle after I

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.890 
I embedded it here in the handle after I
opened<00:01:05.129> up<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> hole<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.760> bottom<00:01:06.150> drilled

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
opened up the hole in the bottom drilled

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.359 
opened up the hole in the bottom drilled
some<00:01:07.080> holes<00:01:07.110> through<00:01:07.530> here<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:07.979> then<00:01:08.100> ran<00:01:08.340> a

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
some holes through here and then ran a

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.480 
some holes through here and then ran a
series<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:09.110> LEDs<00:01:10.110> all<00:01:10.439> around<00:01:10.979> these<00:01:11.159> edges

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
series of LEDs all around these edges

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.710 
series of LEDs all around these edges
and<00:01:11.610> there's<00:01:11.760> not<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> whole<00:01:12.119> lot<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.390> room<00:01:12.540> here

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
and there's not a whole lot of room here

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.000 
and there's not a whole lot of room here
in<00:01:12.780> these<00:01:12.900> edges<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.350> can<00:01:13.500> barely<00:01:13.680> squeeze

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
in these edges so I can barely squeeze

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.590 
in these edges so I can barely squeeze
in<00:01:14.220> what<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.400> managed<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.790> squeeze<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.330> wire

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
in what I managed to squeeze in wire

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.330 
in what I managed to squeeze in wire
wise<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.229> other<00:01:16.380> changes<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.920> made<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.310> that

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
wise the other changes I made is that

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.950 
wise the other changes I made is that
the<00:01:17.520> class<00:01:17.729> sensor<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.180> now<00:01:18.299> located<00:01:18.689> up<00:01:18.930> here

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
the class sensor is now located up here

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.920 
the class sensor is now located up here
in<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.619> chip<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.610> way<00:01:20.790> relatively<00:01:21.720> light

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
in the chip that way relatively light

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.719 
in the chip that way relatively light
forces<00:01:22.290> will<00:01:22.619> still<00:01:22.830> activate<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.580> a

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
forces will still activate it like a

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.390 
forces will still activate it like a
ping-pong<00:01:24.000> ball<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.750> then<00:01:25.530> one<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.189> other

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
ping-pong ball and then one of the other

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.310 
ping-pong ball and then one of the other
changes<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.909> made<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.840> Hasbro

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
changes I made is that the Hasbro

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.200 
changes I made is that the Hasbro
children's<00:01:28.890> version<00:01:29.009> uses<00:01:29.520> very<00:01:29.729> simple

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
children's version uses very simple

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.850 
children's version uses very simple
swing<00:01:30.540> sensor<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.049> basically<00:01:31.380> just<00:01:31.650> two

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
swing sensor it's basically just two

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.499 
swing sensor it's basically just two
switches<00:01:32.310> with<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.490> metal<00:01:32.759> ball<00:01:33.030> stuck<00:01:33.390> in

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
switches with a metal ball stuck in

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.039 
switches with a metal ball stuck in
between<00:01:33.600> them

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
between them

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.289 
between them
I<00:01:34.079> actually<00:01:34.579> deactivated<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> bottom<00:01:36.060> size

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
I actually deactivated the bottom size

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.999 
I actually deactivated the bottom size
of<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.540> switch<00:01:37.049> because<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:37.650> way<00:01:37.950> too

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
of that switch because it's way too

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.580 
of that switch because it's way too
sensitive<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.119> now<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:40.049> get<00:01:40.170> swings

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
sensitive and so now you get swings

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.340 
sensitive and so now you get swings
basically<00:01:41.250> by<00:01:41.369> swinging<00:01:41.670> up<00:01:41.939> or<00:01:42.479> from<00:01:42.899> up<00:01:43.079> to

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
basically by swinging up or from up to

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.260 
basically by swinging up or from up to
down<00:01:43.380> really<00:01:44.159> hard<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.790> way<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.090> doesn't

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
down really hard that way it doesn't

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.120 
down really hard that way it doesn't
keep<00:01:45.509> swing<00:01:46.020> activating<00:01:46.710> when<00:01:46.829> it's<00:01:46.979> just

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
keep swing activating when it's just

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.620 
keep swing activating when it's just
sitting<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.579> default<00:01:47.939> position<00:01:48.180> due<00:01:48.600> to

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
sitting in a default position due to

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.690 
sitting in a default position due to
slight<00:01:48.960> vibrations<00:01:49.619> which<00:01:50.040> was<00:01:50.220> really

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
slight vibrations which was really

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.850 
slight vibrations which was really
annoying<00:01:51.259> and<00:01:52.259> then<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.470> other<00:01:52.590> thing<00:01:52.770> I

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
annoying and then the other thing I

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.380 
annoying and then the other thing I
added<00:01:53.040> obviously<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.640> moved<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.970> switch<00:01:54.180> down

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
added obviously I moved the switch down

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.240 
added obviously I moved the switch down
here<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:55.020> then<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.200> put<00:01:55.439> this<00:01:55.530> big<00:01:55.710> tube<00:01:56.009> down

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
here and then I put this big tube down

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.310 
here and then I put this big tube down
here<00:01:56.640> which<00:01:57.180> actually<00:01:57.360> just<00:01:57.570> holds<00:01:58.140> the

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
here which actually just holds the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.020 
here which actually just holds the
speaker<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.009> this<00:01:59.100> acts<00:01:59.310> as<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.490> resonance

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
speaker and this acts as a resonance

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.130 
speaker and this acts as a resonance
chamber<00:02:00.390> because<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:00.719> Hollow

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
chamber because it's Hollow

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.740 
chamber because it's Hollow
and<00:02:01.469> then<00:02:01.770> there's<00:02:01.920> two<00:02:02.100> cr2032<00:02:02.790> s<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.570> sit

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
and then there's two cr2032 s that sit

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.289 
and then there's two cr2032 s that sit
down<00:02:03.960> here<00:02:04.170> in<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.350> bottom<00:02:04.560> now<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.520> 32<00:02:06.240> s

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
down here in the bottom now this 32 s

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.180 
down here in the bottom now this 32 s
