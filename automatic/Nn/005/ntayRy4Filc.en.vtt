00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
else in the country is working it's what

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.510 
else in the country is working it's what
are<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.380> going<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.560> do<00:01:52.710> extra<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.340> those

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
are you going to do extra that those

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.319

starting<00:01:57.329> with<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.600> mentality<00:01:57.840> will<00:01:58.619> get

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
starting with that mentality will get

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.380 
starting with that mentality will get
will<00:01:58.979> get<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.219> guys<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.610> right<00:01:59.820> place<00:02:00.090> and

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
will get the guys in the right place and
