00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
this one can you see how much smaller

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.830 
this one can you see how much smaller
those<00:01:13.500> powder<00:01:13.920> follicles<00:01:14.670> are<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.240> imagine

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
those powder follicles are I imagine

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.999 
those powder follicles are I imagine
that<00:01:15.960> those<00:01:16.080> follicles<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.680> be<00:01:16.770> pretty

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
that those follicles have to be pretty

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.469 
that those follicles have to be pretty
small<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.400> give<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.640> any<00:01:17.790> type<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.030> coverage

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
small to give you any type of coverage

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.530 
small to give you any type of coverage
and<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:19.140> interlock<00:01:19.890> any<00:01:20.220> sort<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.610> way<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.090> to

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
and to interlock any sort of way so to

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.539 
and to interlock any sort of way so to
me<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.409> bit<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.680> fail<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.460> other

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
me that is a bit of a fail the other

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.280 
me that is a bit of a fail the other
fail<00:01:23.790> was<00:01:24.030> actually<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> price<00:01:24.720> point<00:01:25.049> what

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
fail was actually the price point what

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.260 
fail was actually the price point what
the<00:01:25.320> heck<00:01:25.619> health<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.460> reason<00:01:26.820> why<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:26.970> shop

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the heck health the reason why I shop

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.580 
the heck health the reason why I shop
there<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.479> because<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.020> significantly

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
there is because it is significantly

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.090 
there is because it is significantly
cheaper

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
cheaper

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.640 
cheaper
I<00:01:29.250> believe<00:01:29.759> these<00:01:30.030> hit<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.630> price<00:01:30.840> quick<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.350> 6

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
I believe these hit the price quick of 6

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.080 
I believe these hit the price quick of 6
dollars<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.280> States<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.700> eight<00:01:32.909> dollars

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
dollars in the States and eight dollars

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.620 
dollars in the States and eight dollars
in<00:01:33.509> Canada<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.829> me<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.759> more

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
in Canada so to me that is more

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.590 
in Canada so to me that is more
expensive<00:01:36.780> than<00:01:37.079> Rimmel<00:01:37.770> which<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.159> prefer<00:01:38.600> as

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
expensive than Rimmel which I prefer as

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.499 
expensive than Rimmel which I prefer as
a<00:01:39.659> finishing<00:01:40.110> powder<00:01:40.409> or<00:01:40.939> covergirl<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.270> my

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
a finishing powder or covergirl in my

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
packaging also stated that I could be

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.490

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
why it's also a fail so I'm gonna take

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.819 
why it's also a fail so I'm gonna take
my<00:01:53.790> darker<00:01:54.390> one<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:54.960> see<00:01:55.200> better<00:01:55.500> and

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
my darker one so you can see better and

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.010 
my darker one so you can see better and
I'm<00:01:56.040> gonna<00:01:56.130> take<00:01:56.340> my<00:01:56.460> elf<00:01:56.640> makeup<00:01:57.030> mist<00:01:57.240> with

I'm gonna take my elf makeup mist with
my<00:01:59.630> with<00:02:00.630> my<00:02:00.780> ELF<00:02:01.020> powder<00:02:01.259> brush

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.460 

so<00:02:06.270> although<00:02:06.540> it's<00:02:06.810> kind<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.110> cool<00:02:07.260> that<00:02:07.380> you

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
so although it's kind of cool that you

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.870 
so although it's kind of cool that you
can<00:02:07.619> do<00:02:07.710> this<00:02:07.860> with<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.039> product<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.550> problem

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
can do this with a product the problem

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.370 
can do this with a product the problem
is<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.539> color<00:02:09.780> changes<00:02:10.259> so

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
is that the color changes so

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.380 
is that the color changes so
significantly<00:02:11.009> when<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.520> wet<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.270> it

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
significantly when it is wet that it

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.210 
significantly when it is wet that it
doesn't<00:02:12.690> translate<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.440> color<00:02:13.860> that<00:02:14.130> you

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
doesn't translate to the color that you

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.730 
doesn't translate to the color that you
purchased

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.330 

so<00:02:22.700> this<00:02:22.970> is<00:02:23.210> what<00:02:23.750> goes<00:02:23.930> on<00:02:24.200> there<00:02:24.470> I<00:02:24.710> have<00:02:25.220> no

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
so this is what goes on there I have no

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.810 
so this is what goes on there I have no
idea<00:02:25.580> how<00:02:25.730> you<00:02:25.790> were<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:25.970> color<00:02:26.210> match<00:02:27.820> that

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
idea how you were a color match that

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.550 
idea how you were a color match that
being<00:02:29.060> said<00:02:29.360> I<00:02:29.570> am<00:02:29.840> using<00:02:30.080> them<00:02:30.350> as<00:02:30.530> a

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
being said I am using them as a

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.920 
being said I am using them as a
finishing<00:02:30.950> powder<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.460> this<00:02:32.180> dark<00:02:32.540> one<00:02:32.720> as<00:02:32.900> a

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
finishing powder and this dark one as a

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.440 
finishing powder and this dark one as a
contouring<00:02:33.470> powder<00:02:33.620> I<00:02:33.920> did<00:02:34.400> try<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:34.970> get<00:02:35.240> both

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
contouring powder I did try and get both

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.000 
contouring powder I did try and get both
of<00:02:35.510> these<00:02:35.750> so<00:02:35.900> I<00:02:35.960> could<00:02:36.140> check<00:02:36.320> the<00:02:36.500> hues<00:02:36.800> and

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
of these so I could check the hues and

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.780 
of these so I could check the hues and
color<00:02:37.310> of<00:02:37.490> pasty<00:02:37.940> of<00:02:38.060> both<00:02:39.370> so<00:02:40.370> far<00:02:40.610> it's<00:02:40.730> been

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
color of pasty of both so far it's been

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.560 
color of pasty of both so far it's been
going<00:02:41.270> on<00:02:41.390> okay<00:02:42.100> but<00:02:43.100> it<00:02:43.220> goes<00:02:43.570> especially

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
going on okay but it goes especially

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.180 
going on okay but it goes especially
with<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.750> dark<00:02:44.990> that<00:02:45.140> I<00:02:45.200> noticed<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.770> goes<00:02:45.950> on

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
with the dark that I noticed it goes on

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.340 
with the dark that I noticed it goes on
splotchy<00:02:46.670> and<00:02:46.910> kind<00:02:47.420> of<00:02:47.450> pulls<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:47.930> I<00:02:48.020> have<00:02:48.200> to
