00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
temple that's because I was using a

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.759 
temple that's because I was using a
newer<00:04:14.740> TV<00:04:15.540> rather<00:04:16.540> than<00:04:16.810> a<00:04:16.930> TV<00:04:17.170> that<00:04:17.560> was

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
newer TV rather than a TV that was

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.280 
newer TV rather than a TV that was
around<00:04:18.070> in<00:04:18.510> 1998<00:04:19.510> when<00:04:19.750> this<00:04:19.930> game<00:04:20.080> was

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
around in 1998 when this game was

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.370 
around in 1998 when this game was
released<00:04:20.470> and<00:04:21.510> it<00:04:22.510> looked<00:04:22.810> really<00:04:23.020> bad<00:04:23.320> I

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
released and it looked really bad I

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.770 
released and it looked really bad I
couldn't<00:04:23.830> see<00:04:24.130> anything<00:04:24.370> at<00:04:24.670> all<00:04:24.820> because<00:04:25.120> you

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
couldn't see anything at all because you

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.080 
couldn't see anything at all because you
know<00:04:25.810> it<00:04:26.080> was<00:04:26.170> a<00:04:26.200> newer<00:04:26.410> TV<00:04:26.680> but<00:04:27.160> now<00:04:27.790> you<00:04:27.850> can

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
know it was a newer TV but now you can

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.670 
know it was a newer TV but now you can
actually<00:04:28.240> see<00:04:28.600> stuff<00:04:28.870> because<00:04:29.230> I'm<00:04:29.410> playing

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680

actually see stuff because I'm playing
on<00:04:29.860> an<00:04:29.980> old<00:04:30.160> TV<00:04:30.750> so<00:04:31.750> I'm<00:04:31.870> playing<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.230> game<00:04:32.260> on

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
on an old TV so I'm playing the game on

on an old TV so I'm playing the game on
a<00:04:32.590> TV<00:04:32.920> it<00:04:33.280> was<00:04:33.460> designed<00:04:33.910> for<00:04:34.270> so<00:04:35.200> now<00:04:35.770> it<00:04:35.920> looks

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
a TV it was designed for so now it looks

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.220 
a TV it was designed for so now it looks
ideal<00:04:36.490> so<00:04:36.820> you<00:04:37.180> can<00:04:37.330> actually<00:04:37.510> see<00:04:37.960> things

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
ideal so you can actually see things

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.770 
ideal so you can actually see things
like<00:04:38.440> this<00:04:38.860> torch<00:04:39.250> over<00:04:39.700> there<00:04:39.880> that<00:04:40.630> you're

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
like this torch over there that you're

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:47.430 
like this torch over there that you're

trying to light light the torch to get

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.890 
trying to light light the torch to get
halfway<00:04:48.160> across<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:48.880> room<00:04:49.030> this<00:04:49.360> is<00:04:49.510> half<00:04:49.690> way

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
halfway across the room this is half way

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.900 
halfway across the room this is half way
I<00:04:50.170> go<00:04:50.470> 3/4<00:04:51.160> of<00:04:51.310> the<00:04:51.430> way<00:04:51.550> across<00:04:51.880> the<00:04:52.090> room

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
I go 3/4 of the way across the room

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:00.440 
I go 3/4 of the way across the room
and<00:04:54.910> we<00:04:55.060> have<00:04:55.240> two<00:04:55.570> switches<00:04:55.900> here<00:04:56.410> one<00:04:57.400> two

you want to walk to this one using the

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:10.530 
you want to walk to this one using the
lens<00:05:03.820> of<00:05:04.060> truth<00:05:04.090> you<00:05:09.180> know<00:05:10.180> it's<00:05:10.300> kind<00:05:10.480> of

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
lens of truth you know it's kind of

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.020 
lens of truth you know it's kind of
interesting<00:05:10.780> I<00:05:11.500> never<00:05:12.040> thought<00:05:12.400> about<00:05:12.460> it<00:05:12.820> but

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
interesting I never thought about it but

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.930 
interesting I never thought about it but
you<00:05:13.810> never<00:05:13.930> see<00:05:14.260> link<00:05:14.500> actually<00:05:14.770> use<00:05:15.370> the<00:05:15.730> lens

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
you never see link actually use the lens

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.110 
you never see link actually use the lens
of<00:05:16.120> true<00:05:16.390> I<00:05:17.190> mean<00:05:18.190> right<00:05:18.400> here<00:05:18.640> when<00:05:18.820> he<00:05:18.850> uses

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
of true I mean right here when he uses

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.440 
of true I mean right here when he uses
two<00:05:19.450> Megaton<00:05:19.930> hammer<00:05:21.060> he's<00:05:22.060> going<00:05:22.330> to

two Megaton hammer he's going to

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.500 
two Megaton hammer he's going to
actually<00:05:22.600> take<00:05:23.169> out<00:05:23.410> the<00:05:23.710> Megaton<00:05:24.190> hammer<00:05:24.510> you

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
actually take out the Megaton hammer you

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.360 
actually take out the Megaton hammer you
can<00:05:25.540> see<00:05:25.840> him<00:05:26.050> use<00:05:26.230> it<00:05:26.260> but<00:05:26.560> you<00:05:26.620> don't<00:05:26.890> see<00:05:27.130> him

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
can see him use it but you don't see him

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.880 
can see him use it but you don't see him
walk<00:05:28.030> around<00:05:28.419> with<00:05:28.660> the<00:05:28.750> lens<00:05:28.960> of<00:05:29.140> truth<00:05:29.169> up<00:05:29.740> to

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
walk around with the lens of truth up to

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.740 
walk around with the lens of truth up to
his<00:05:30.010> eye<00:05:30.160> like<00:05:30.430> a<00:05:30.460> magnifying<00:05:31.150> glass<00:05:31.300> of

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
his eye like a magnifying glass of

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.350 
his eye like a magnifying glass of
something<00:05:31.900> like<00:05:32.230> that

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
something like that

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.650 
something like that
great<00:05:34.360> I<00:05:34.900> wonder<00:05:35.350> why

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.620 

I<00:05:37.800> guess<00:05:38.800> it<00:05:38.950> probably<00:05:39.700> because<00:05:40.300> it<00:05:40.480> would

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
I guess it probably because it would

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.210 
I guess it probably because it would
look<00:05:40.780> ridiculous<00:05:41.170> if<00:05:41.470> link<00:05:41.680> was<00:05:41.860> walking

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
look ridiculous if link was walking

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.000 
look ridiculous if link was walking
around<00:05:42.340> with<00:05:42.670> the<00:05:42.790> purple<00:05:43.030> magnifying<00:05:43.690> glass

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
around with the purple magnifying glass

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.340 
around with the purple magnifying glass
but<00:05:45.010> you<00:05:45.160> can<00:05:45.340> light<00:05:45.490> that<00:05:45.700> switch<00:05:46.060> or<00:05:46.660> not<00:05:46.720> off

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
but you can light that switch or not off

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.290 
but you can light that switch or not off
like<00:05:47.560> the<00:05:47.680> switch<00:05:47.920> light<00:05:48.460> that<00:05:48.730> torch<00:05:49.000> with<00:05:49.270> a

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
like the switch light that torch with a

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.480 
like the switch light that torch with a
fire<00:05:49.570> arrow<00:05:49.900> to<00:05:50.260> make<00:05:50.440> platforms<00:05:51.070> over<00:05:51.220> there

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
fire arrow to make platforms over there

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:59.839 
fire arrow to make platforms over there
appear

00:05:59.839 --> 00:05:59.849 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:02.939 

it<00:06:00.849> looks<00:06:01.359> like<00:06:01.479> I'm<00:06:01.659> going<00:06:01.809> to<00:06:01.929> have<00:06:02.049> to<00:06:02.259> light

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:02.949 
it looks like I'm going to have to light

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:11.399 
it looks like I'm going to have to light
the<00:06:03.129> torch<00:06:03.309> again<00:06:09.179> okay<00:06:10.179> so<00:06:10.239> just<00:06:10.719> walk<00:06:11.079> down

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:11.409 
the torch again okay so just walk down

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:14.549 
the torch again okay so just walk down
the<00:06:11.559> platforms<00:06:12.219> they're<00:06:12.579> like<00:06:12.759> stairs<00:06:13.559> walk

00:06:14.549 --> 00:06:14.559 
the platforms they're like stairs walk
