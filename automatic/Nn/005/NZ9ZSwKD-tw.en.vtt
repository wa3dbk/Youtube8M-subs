 that's true natural disasters but 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.410
 we can prevent a new 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.290
 hostel located in the school 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.200

 this area means that all 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.419
 the state federal agencies and 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.550

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.639
 moment to follow up and that 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:47.790
 all work together in a single 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:50.639
 purpose and support people who by 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.710

 understand that we are doing everything 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.800
 possible that there are coordinated efforts 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:25.000
 between governments for this to work 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.950
