 Hello, I'm making candy for candy. 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:13.139
 I saw on the internet youtube how to do 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:16.070
 powder with with vacuum cleaners engines and saw 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.220
 from the Bulgarian here, too, decided to do here 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:25.859
 found ordinary galvanized sheet cut 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:31.910
 ordinary knives slightly torn to 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:35.450
 I threw out the usual Dita found such 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:40.160
 sudochek small so it was not a pity 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:46.920
 drilled a hole in his basement bottom 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:51.480
 put cut felt to powder not 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:55.620
 fell on the gearbox and everything like that 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.520
 takes exceptionally possible to work with 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.020
 knives principle 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.460
 shreds pretty quickly and pretty 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.670
 fine small crystals remain 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.210
 Well, in principle, everything is irrelevant 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:16.860
 everything is sifted and pretty pretty 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.490
 not bad so I recommend chopping 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.350
 also 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.390
 he also has a dead bee 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:31.369
 interrupts for settings too 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:35.549
 convenient so look recommend 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:37.579
 literally 10 minutes about five kilograms 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.579
 powder 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:48.649
 interrupts exclusively here a little less 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.649
 than a liter a little bit more than half a kilo 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.930
 cap 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.930
 just uncomfortable to hold the cap 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:31.430
 that's literally a couple of seconds and perfect 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:34.019
 it is necessary about it through a sieve of his pre network 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.840
 there remains a small small fraction well 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:42.739
 principle 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.739
 cool decision like this all bye
