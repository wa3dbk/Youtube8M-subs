 pretty simple on how to make a 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.350
 litter is worth and good now we put on 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.840
 back to the beds and we put the 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.450
 door and from here 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.460
 same back to the bed one of 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.780
 wood if you want you can put them 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.630
 iron since they can not be opened and 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.399
 close as I just do in good video 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.549
 well, it's a pretty easy tutorial 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:37.159
 how to make a is a litter worth but 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:41.370
 that you liked it and well there 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:44.280
 we see dragons flower Draxler 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.590
 my flower mom she would have to put the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.040
 little flower and everything 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.190
 not for 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.630
 mini 6 of ya relax you will not go out 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.450
 more in the videos is 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.950
 well here for example I would put the 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.049
 wardrobe that we teach in the previous 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.119
 Decoration episode worth 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:09.229
 or for example as you just put here 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:12.319
 drugs or emilio some pots with flowers 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:16.720
 so it's one of the many ideas 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:20.050
 what can this section give 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.290
 of decoration and I can not go up 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.360
 nothing else because we are going to 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.880
 have an adjustment because I walk a little 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.010
 bad as you know the institute of the 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.140
 duties and all that and I could not 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.530
 make the video that I wanted to have made 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.380
 it was a pixel art tutorial 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.569
 or visiting one's world and well here 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.490
 they wanted war drugs and dragons 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.270
 and emilio and well I think I was going to leave 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.270
 losing av 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.799
