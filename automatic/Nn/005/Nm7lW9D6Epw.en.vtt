00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:27.039
 the electromedicine has been confirmed today as a useful tool 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.289
 in the treatment of systems within dermatology 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:35.739
 concretely the hyperthermia constitute these moments the most advanced technique 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.739
 and one of the ones that offer the best results 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.800
 eczema is a skin disease that is characterized by the appearance of 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.020
 inflamed patches of red skin and his camera on the face of the scalp

 in front of the elbows and in other parts of the body 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.490
 can suffer especially people with excess histamine 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.720
 that is, those that present some type of allergy 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.690
 It also occurs in people with poor circulation or factors 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.180
 environmental factors such as ex-tecos, excessive sun and stress 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.659
 the hyperthermia allows to generate an energy through the skin this 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.410
 center helps to hydrate the scheme and normalize the regenerative process of 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.870
 our body 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.580
 This process is achieved through the supply and that they have been located 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.380
 oxygen 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.229
 and nutrients to the skin cells that together with a controlled increase in 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.310
 Their temperature 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.820
 they renew more quickly the diseased tissue the hyperthermia also affects

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.420
