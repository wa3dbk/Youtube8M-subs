00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.990
 hello friends the craft we're going to 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.020
 do this time are these pretty roses 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.820
 that are made with cleaning pipes and good 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.220
 we can use them for decorating 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.020
 some craft or we can do it 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.410
 as a ring 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.180
 that also looks pretty and good 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.890
 let's start 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.650
 to make our rose we are going to 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.360
 need 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.850
 2 clean pipes green color and 6 color 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.460
 that we are going to make our rose in this 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.500
 case I chose again the red though 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.500
 it's a little more red than this 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.090
 the color and well let's start as 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.129
 I mentioned them in the previous ones 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.960
 videos that I've done jobs with clean 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.089
 pipes the first thing we have to do 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.059
 is to bend the tip of our clean 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:56.480
 pipes so that we do not chop the alambrito 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.480
 what has 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.920
 well previously I already did this with 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.300
 the others clean red pipes and good what 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.930
 what are we going to do now is let's 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.930
 match the 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.950
 and we're going to fold it in half if it's 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:19.299
 we want to do it type ring we're going to 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.380
 measure our finger where we go to 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.380
 want the ring 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.870
 let it be half 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.610
 I'm rigging there 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.590
 then it's going to be about like that and 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.590
 here we turn 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.500
 Now what we are going to do is so that 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.500
 do not let us loose so let's turn 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.900
 we're just going to spin the piece that 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.720
 we just measured from our finger and 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.800
 again we put it back to see 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.740
 if we look good 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.300
 of the size there is now simply what 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.300
 what we are going to do is we are going to turn 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.390
 without squeezing it so that it does not close 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.390
 the circle and fit us well to the finger 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.209
 and well look at her, it's just right 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.680
 size that has to be and good once 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.590
 that we have it like that 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.580
 what we are going to do is the following 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.920
 we go 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.920
 to put our clean pipes separate 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.050
 and we will stay like this now what we are going to 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.040
 to do is let's start rolling 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.040
 each one of them 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.400
 since we have it rolled up let's 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.400
 put it like this up 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.280
 to 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.280
 do not 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.950
 good and once we have it so 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.430
 What we have now to do is give 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.980
 shape the petals and accommodating them 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.170
 this way so that it is way of 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.570
 our rose then what are we going to 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.640
 make some petals we are going to put 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.819
 flip 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.290
 well and others we will leave them in the 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.500
 original shape that we put them towards 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.500
 above 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.820
 and well, look like that, it's getting better 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.910
 Well look and that's how we got it 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.380
 from the middle part our rose and 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.690
 Now what we have to do is with 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.770
 he cleans green pipes we do the same 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.770
 we bend the little tips 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.209
 and we are going to form what are the leaves of 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.209
 our rose 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.370
 since it is like this we are going to divide it to the 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.370
 half 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.310
 and we are going to put it here in the middle 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.100
 and we are going to turn it 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.960
 so that it stays together 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.730
 and again we are going to do the same 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.030
 let's roll our four clean 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.030
 pipes 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:36.639
 ah 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:50.449
 and whether they want to leave them like this or 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.270
 we can give the curved shape that has 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.960
 this and for that simply what we're going 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.710
 to do 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.710
 we go 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:05.400
 to press the tip 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.400
 nothing more and take that form look 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.910
 we do that with the four petals 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.480
 and well the leaves and you 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.030
 also accommodate your taste 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:32.790
 if they want two on each side or want 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:34.639
 that stay together like this or 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.550
 I do not know or 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:38.620
 one on this side and another little bit more 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.350
 here 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:44.190
 there will already be at your pleasure as 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.190
 want to put it 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.390
 I like more to put them as and good 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.000
 look like this, we have been formed 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.460
 our rose 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.580
 and in any color that we do 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.110
 I think it will look pretty and good 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.260
 because this was the simple manual 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.510
 today I hope you liked it and that 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.280
 decorate your crafts very beautifully or 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.680
 good to make your children very happy 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.330
 or to the people that this good outcome 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.870
 Well, see you in the next tutorial 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.870
 see you later 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:19.110
