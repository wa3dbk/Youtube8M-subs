00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.960
 How about friends? I am clam bringing a 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.609
 new section on books in this 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.980
 first video I'm going to talk about the 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.690
 crazy story a book made by a 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.240
 writer who has taken advantage of his 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.279
 I work as a journalist documentation 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.000
 known in large part thanks to his 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:22.970
 utility called the psychoanalyst me 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.180
 I mean John Katzenbach today I'm going to 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.040
 tell them about the crazy story 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.020
 the narrative of cats and back usually 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.090
 have an absorbing impact on the 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.470
 readers and the crazy story what 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.390
 indeed shows 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.940
 the book carries a message at the beginning 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.670
 before the story starts where 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.600
 cat semak addresses readers 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.180
 telling them that this book has a 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.320
 certain difference between others 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.750
 mentions that half of the book is 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.400
 there is a strange idea that you 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.620
 talks about the purpose of the 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.030
 authors to distinguish that all 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.670
 seek to do it differently 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.220
 Katzenberg tells you he expects his 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.290
 history the crazy story turns out 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.960
 a reading as absorbing as for him 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.420
 or was writing it the book starts with a 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.580
 narrative in the first person someone us 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.070
 says that he no longer heard voices for the title 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.350
 of the book you can easily deduce that 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.110
 it is a schizophrenic or someone 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.090
 that was once effectively 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.520
 is about francis the main character 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.440
 of the story in the accounts about the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.600
 confusion and the uncertainty of their 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.310
 thoughts in an interesting way 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.710
 tells us about some people who 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.869
 he died he receives an invitation to 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.300
 psychiatric hospital where he was held by 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.790
 his family due to a fight in which 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.410
 francis discusses with his father and what 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.350
 threat to kill him and after 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.450
 commit suicide 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.850
 he begins to remember and writes in his 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.729
 fourth on the walls because I did not have 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.520
 role what once lived suggestion of 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.399
 a friend of his nicknamed Napoleon we 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.320
 account that as he arrives at the hospital and 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.810
 triggers a series of events 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.360
 that help you relate to the 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.280
 hospital people accuse him of being the 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.259
 antichrist 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.299
 some treat it badly they turn to him from 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.399
 and more destructive form among their 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.860
 somber memories is doubt whether what 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.930
 happened was a fact and perhaps part of their 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.269
 delirious situations and memories that 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.239
