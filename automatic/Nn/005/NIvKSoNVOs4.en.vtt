00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.540
 boys how are you I know this week 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.290
 I have been more disappeared than the 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.599
 chapo 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.040
 but I did not escape, do not worry alone 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.080
 been with some important changes 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.520
 that soon I will show you from 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.180
 August the mystic will start a new 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.039
 stage that will be fine your wikis but of 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.109
 what we have come to talk about today is 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.939
 the continuation of the previous video the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.640
 main error of the bronzes of the 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.529
 silvers and the golds if you did not see it 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.030
 go see it right now and staying in 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.309
 the image that is appearing in the 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.079
 screen everything was clear in that video the 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.489
 phase of ln making a major blow 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.500
 in the attitude of the players and more 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.540
 Beyond that, the game started 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.030
 come back ambiguous in the middle game since 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.829
 the invoker is they did not know what to do without 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.510
 But many of you or me dijieron 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.309
 that knock down more feel they saw that no 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.160
 we must give up or sing 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.739
 victory after the lines phase 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.960
 torrico but what we do specifically 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.129
 after the phase of lines that lasts 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.719
 do 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.820
 well, my dear comrades with 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.229
 you intensely delicious after the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.790
 phase lines must do what 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.690
 next the first and most fundamental 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.820
 is 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.040
 so you completely recognize your role and the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.410
 your champion's performance this is very 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.550
 important I'll give you an example 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.590
 imagine that you go with your top and 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.540
 finished the phase of lines which is what 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.010
 you have to do then you could go and 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.110
 help your colleagues from our 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.210
 lanes but that really suits you 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.830
 we all know that in blue he is a champion 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.840
 that evolves incredibly in the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.870
 line even after phase lines 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.550
 shoot and accumulating power then what 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.260
 The best you can do is tell your 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.420
 team that you will remain fernando and 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.130
 you'll be careful with teleport for some 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.170
 emergency that is a decision 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.330
 smart that fits the performance 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.430
 of your champion is as if you were with ari 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.560
 and after your line phase you will stay 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.840
 only fernando without looking for murders in 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.000
 other lanes you see it's simple to 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.010
 understand once you recognize this guy 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.560
 of champion and roles you commit the following 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.870
 step is to analyze two things the first one is 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.430
 analyze what kind of equipment do you have this 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.170
 surely you have already done it from the 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.030
 selection of champions and believe me that 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.460
 although it seems that you have best in 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.530
 tangamandapio all compositions 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.810
 they have their advantages you just have to know 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.250
 take advantage of them you may have a team 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.110
 excellent to start battles of 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.480
 in front of a powerful team 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.830
 maybe you have a team of assassins and 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.720
 you must hunt enemies badly 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.610
 positioned or a tank team 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.890
 throwing mass control like bills 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.720
 to sepp blatter the key is that what 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.220
 recognize once you do it 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.260
 next step is to begin to notice 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.480
 objectives and manage team battles 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.100
 If they catch someone, they did not try to save him 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.200
 it is always better that one dies than 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.510
 die all the equipment the disengagement is 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.790
 a sensible tool and finally the 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.400
 second aspect to analyze is if you go 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.440
 losing or gaining any disadvantage or 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.970
 advantage has over the enemy if you go 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.160
 losing the most important thing are the 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.930
 wards you need to defend your space to 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.880
 prevent the enemy from advancing on his 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.860
 advantage all your jungle must be 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.140
 revealed to be able to get ahead of the 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.940
 movements if you are winning avoid going 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.860
 just regroup follow do not bring 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.600
 objectives make beige and split then 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.489
 depending on which suits them the 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.560
 guards are also important but 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.390
 the most important are the red trinkets 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.940
 that will help them to bury their 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.590
 enemies once and for all have the 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.810
 game in their hands but an error can 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.330
 throw it all overboard so have 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.790
 be careful with this, everything should be more 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.500
 easy now if you have it clearer if 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.239
 you have problems to communicate with your 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.250
 equipment that is the usual I recommend you 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.070
 give simple and short orders like 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.260
 come on let's go give me let's go according to the area 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.690
 speak box percent of that style 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.459
 The less you talk, the better is not 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.290
 It will always be easy but it will help 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.820
 surely you have also 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.650

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.480
