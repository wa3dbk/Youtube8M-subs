00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello friends of youtube good then here 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.059
 we have 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.680
 the two cut parts that are going to 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.630
 put on the side of the uis box 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.780
 and that's it 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:23.070
 we started making the pattern that is going to 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:25.340
 take the uis box I wanted to do this guy 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.010
 of patterns 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.530
 for the water to run and stop 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.689
 the nuggets and when cleaning it 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.390
 let's just do the operation 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.120
 inverse with water and everyone can 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.040
 very clean so it 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.220
 very simple 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.590
 we also cut the two rungs that 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.020
 they will go in the form of ladder in the 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.620
 same 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:55.370
 we were thinking about putting them like that but 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:58.280
 the current was going to stop a lot 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.860
 of water so what we did was 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.940
 cut it in half with it gouge 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.940
 and this came out 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.710
 a procedure to cut it is very 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.430
 this very simple we complicate 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.970
 a little bit doing it like that but you 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.350
 at home you can buy it you have already manufactured 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.810
 however, we are going to teach you 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.890
 how can you do this 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.890
 I simply agree 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.740
 it's very simple finally highlighted in 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.740
 the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.120
 and they separate only 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.120
 do not 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.659
 you have to give only you have to give 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:57.289
 a few tweaks and so it remains 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:00.649
 and good to give it the form 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:04.069
 I'm using this gouge that 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:07.149
 it's about 1 centimeter wide what 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:10.450
 only thing we do is putting this part 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.450
 down 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:20.180
 we beat him in a closed way he gets up 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.590
 a little 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.950
 a marcilla mos on the top 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.950
 again down 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.660
 we lacked one more layer of wood that 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.660
 hammer 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.610
 and ready like this 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.340
 well in the next video and all the 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:57.959
 plants should already be this 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.890
 these start going to start putting 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.080
 these 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:07.060
 and so good friends this is the the 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:09.400
 detailed of it this is the most 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.849
 longer because you have to make them one 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.180
 by one all with the chisel and for the 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:18.430
 next video all this is already good 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:22.720
 well detailed and let's start now the 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.819
 armed with the steps I hope you have 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.209
 liked the video friends and we're 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.360
 seeing in the next ones so up 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.360
 then
