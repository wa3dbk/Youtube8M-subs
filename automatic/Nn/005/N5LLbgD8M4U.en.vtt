after game after game Tony Gonzalez had
a<00:01:49.200> phenomenal<00:01:49.409> game<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.100> know<00:01:50.159> he's<00:01:50.399> coming

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
a phenomenal game I know he's coming

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.490 
a phenomenal game I know he's coming
home<00:01:50.759> for<00:01:51.000> what's<00:01:51.180> his<00:01:51.390> last<00:01:51.570> game<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.289> I<00:01:52.439> know

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
home for what's his last game and I know

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.109 
home for what's his last game and I know
that's<00:01:52.799> gonna<00:01:52.979> lift<00:01:53.280> him<00:01:53.460> up<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.670> little<00:01:53.820> bit

that's gonna lift him up a little bit

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.120 
that's gonna lift him up a little bit
but<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:54.810> think<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.079> olanta<00:01:55.649> team<00:01:55.829> just

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
but I just think this olanta team just

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.859 
but I just think this olanta team just
depleted<00:01:56.490> they<00:01:56.789> got<00:01:56.969> banged<00:01:57.210> up<00:01:57.390> once<00:01:57.719> again

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869
