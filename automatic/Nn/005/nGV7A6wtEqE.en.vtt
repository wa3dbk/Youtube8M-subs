texture<00:02:09.970> on<00:02:10.090> this<00:02:10.210> thing<00:02:10.420> it<00:02:10.539> is<00:02:10.569> smooth<00:02:10.990> but

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
texture on this thing it is smooth but

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.710 
texture on this thing it is smooth but
it<00:02:11.860> is<00:02:11.980> a<00:02:12.010> little<00:02:12.250> bit<00:02:12.460> slippery<00:02:12.850> but<00:02:13.390> no

it is a little bit slippery but no

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.180 
it is a little bit slippery but no
nothing<00:02:14.080> like<00:02:14.260> that<00:02:14.410> it's<00:02:14.500> gonna<00:02:14.680> slip<00:02:14.920> out<00:02:15.069> of

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
nothing like that it's gonna slip out of

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.340 
nothing like that it's gonna slip out of
your<00:02:15.220> hand<00:02:15.550> or<00:02:15.670> anything<00:02:15.850> and<00:02:16.270> it<00:02:17.080> doesn't

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
your hand or anything and it doesn't

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.660 
your hand or anything and it doesn't
have<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:17.530> much<00:02:17.860> bulk<00:02:18.160> to<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.400> at<00:02:18.520> all<00:02:18.610> just

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
have that much bulk to it at all just

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.449 
have that much bulk to it at all just
square<00:02:19.240> off<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.930> Nexus<00:02:20.500> 5<00:02:20.740> a<00:02:20.770> little<00:02:21.130> bit<00:02:21.280> it

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
square off the Nexus 5 a little bit it

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.340 
square off the Nexus 5 a little bit it
does<00:02:21.610> make<00:02:21.819> it<00:02:21.850> a<00:02:22.000> little<00:02:22.120> bit<00:02:22.330> bulkier<00:02:22.810> but<00:02:23.319> I

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
does make it a little bit bulkier but I

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.960 
does make it a little bit bulkier but I
think<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.680> biggest<00:02:23.950> problem<00:02:24.220> with<00:02:24.550> this<00:02:24.700> case

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
think the biggest problem with this case

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.570 
think the biggest problem with this case
really<00:02:25.360> is<00:02:25.510> just<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.140> button<00:02:26.470> design<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.520> just

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
really is just the button design it just

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.000 
really is just the button design it just
doesn't<00:02:28.150> give<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.570> that<00:02:28.810> tactility<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:29.950> I'm

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
doesn't give you that tactility and I'm

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.310 
doesn't give you that tactility and I'm
just<00:02:30.340> that's<00:02:30.940> what<00:02:31.209> made<00:02:31.450> me<00:02:31.600> stop<00:02:31.840> using<00:02:32.050> this

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
just that's what made me stop using this

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.230 
just that's what made me stop using this
case<00:02:32.590> because<00:02:33.010> it<00:02:33.160> really<00:02:33.400> wasn't<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.820> actual

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
case because it really wasn't the actual

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.750 
case because it really wasn't the actual
color<00:02:34.480> or<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.260> fit<00:02:35.530> itself<00:02:35.890> is<00:02:36.190> just<00:02:36.459> that<00:02:36.610> the

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
color or the fit itself is just that the

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.160 
color or the fit itself is just that the
buttons<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:37.300> have<00:02:37.390> to<00:02:37.510> really<00:02:37.780> push<00:02:37.989> them

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
buttons you have to really push them

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.080 
buttons you have to really push them
pretty<00:02:38.440> hard<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:39.250> get<00:02:39.370> them<00:02:39.550> to<00:02:39.580> work<00:02:39.850> and

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
pretty hard to get them to work and

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.640 
pretty hard to get them to work and
maybe<00:02:40.209> they'll<00:02:40.420> soften<00:02:40.840> out<00:02:40.959> over<00:02:41.170> time<00:02:41.350> let

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
maybe they'll soften out over time let

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.140 
maybe they'll soften out over time let
me<00:02:41.680> know<00:02:41.890> if<00:02:41.980> you're<00:02:42.100> having<00:02:42.310> this<00:02:42.459> problem<00:02:42.760> I

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
me know if you're having this problem I

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.330 
me know if you're having this problem I
just<00:02:43.480> really<00:02:44.080> couldn't<00:02:44.230> use<00:02:44.470> this<00:02:44.680> case<00:02:44.920> for

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
just really couldn't use this case for

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.460 
just really couldn't use this case for
more<00:02:45.640> than<00:02:45.820> a<00:02:45.850> couple<00:02:45.970> days<00:02:46.270> I<00:02:46.510> don't<00:02:47.170> think

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
more than a couple days I don't think

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.820 
more than a couple days I don't think
this<00:02:47.650> case<00:02:47.950> is<00:02:48.190> a<00:02:48.250> bad<00:02:48.640> choice<00:02:48.780> but<00:02:49.780> for<00:02:50.080> $34.99

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
this case is a bad choice but for $34.99

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.790 
this case is a bad choice but for $34.99
and<00:02:51.670> some<00:02:52.120> shipping<00:02:52.440> even<00:02:53.440> though<00:02:53.530> it's<00:02:53.680> gonna

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
and some shipping even though it's gonna

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.560 
and some shipping even though it's gonna
give<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.160> some<00:02:54.370> decent<00:02:54.850> protection<00:02:55.030> here

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
give you some decent protection here

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.600 
give you some decent protection here
corner<00:02:56.019> drops<00:02:56.350> and<00:02:56.830> it's<00:02:57.040> gonna<00:02:57.190> give<00:02:57.459> you

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
corner drops and it's gonna give you

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.090 
corner drops and it's gonna give you
good<00:02:57.820> lay<00:02:58.269> on<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.510> table<00:02:58.690> design<00:02:58.959> and<00:02:59.560> good

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
good lay on the table design and good

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.040 
good lay on the table design and good
back<00:03:00.340> protection<00:03:00.850> with<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.090> camera<00:03:01.540> there

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
back protection with the camera there

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.570 
back protection with the camera there
are<00:03:02.170> just<00:03:02.350> so<00:03:02.590> many<00:03:02.650> different<00:03:03.010> things<00:03:03.430> out

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
are just so many different things out

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.729 
are just so many different things out
there<00:03:03.640> that<00:03:04.180> cost<00:03:04.540> less<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.140> are<00:03:05.380> probably

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
there that cost less and are probably

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.380 
there that cost less and are probably
gonna<00:03:05.890> be<00:03:06.100> even<00:03:06.400> better<00:03:06.610> than<00:03:07.000> this<00:03:07.150> case

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
gonna be even better than this case

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.020 
gonna be even better than this case
itself<00:03:07.900> like<00:03:08.500> this<00:03:08.650> vegan<00:03:08.950> neo<00:03:09.340> hybrid<00:03:09.790> case

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
itself like this vegan neo hybrid case

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.910 
itself like this vegan neo hybrid case
right<00:03:10.660> now<00:03:10.840> that's<00:03:11.110> probably<00:03:11.320> my<00:03:11.560> favorite

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
right now that's probably my favorite

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.890 
right now that's probably my favorite
case<00:03:12.100> out<00:03:12.400> there<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:12.820> look<00:03:12.970> for<00:03:13.000> my<00:03:13.269> review<00:03:13.660> on

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
case out there and look for my review on

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.120 
case out there and look for my review on
that<00:03:14.170> and<00:03:14.410> I<00:03:14.470> think<00:03:14.500> it's<00:03:14.769> just<00:03:14.950> more

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
that and I think it's just more

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.280 
that and I think it's just more
attractive<00:03:15.670> it's<00:03:15.910> cheaper<00:03:16.390> and<00:03:16.600> I<00:03:17.079> think

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
attractive it's cheaper and I think

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.199 
attractive it's cheaper and I think
that's<00:03:17.470> just<00:03:17.620> a<00:03:17.799> better<00:03:18.010> way<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:18.280> go<00:03:18.549> so<00:03:19.060> what

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
that's just a better way to go so what

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.430 
that's just a better way to go so what
do<00:03:19.269> you<00:03:19.329> guys<00:03:19.420> think<00:03:19.660> about<00:03:19.720> this<00:03:20.049> case<00:03:20.290> I

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
do you guys think about this case I

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.900 
do you guys think about this case I
think<00:03:20.500> it's<00:03:20.709> a<00:03:20.769> little<00:03:20.890> too<00:03:21.010> expensive<00:03:21.340> for

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
think it's a little too expensive for

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.759 
think it's a little too expensive for
what<00:03:22.060> it<00:03:22.090> is<00:03:22.209> I<00:03:22.540> think<00:03:22.959> if<00:03:23.049> you're<00:03:23.200> just<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.500> huge

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
what it is I think if you're just a huge

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.410 
what it is I think if you're just a huge
fan<00:03:24.010> of<00:03:24.040> Google<00:03:24.549> products<00:03:24.790> then<00:03:25.120> maybe<00:03:25.269> you

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
fan of Google products then maybe you

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.000 
fan of Google products then maybe you
might<00:03:25.450> get<00:03:25.810> this<00:03:26.019> but<00:03:26.290> I<00:03:26.440> don't<00:03:26.650> see<00:03:26.829> any

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
might get this but I don't see any

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.190 
might get this but I don't see any
reason<00:03:27.340> why<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:27.549> wouldn't<00:03:27.970> buy<00:03:28.209> just<00:03:29.079> a

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
reason why you wouldn't buy just a

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.380 
reason why you wouldn't buy just a
third-party<00:03:29.709> case<00:03:30.100> and<00:03:30.430> go<00:03:30.910> ahead<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:31.150> skip

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
third-party case and go ahead and skip

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.819 
third-party case and go ahead and skip
this<00:03:31.630> case<00:03:31.930> because<00:03:32.200> I<00:03:32.290> don't<00:03:32.440> think<00:03:32.500> this<00:03:32.769> is

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
this case because I don't think this is

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.460 
this case because I don't think this is
the<00:03:33.160> best<00:03:33.400> buy<00:03:33.579> for<00:03:34.090> your<00:03:34.239> money<00:03:34.420> do<00:03:35.170> you<00:03:35.260> have

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
the best buy for your money do you have

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.140 
the best buy for your money do you have
this<00:03:35.680> case<00:03:35.920> already<00:03:36.250> let<00:03:36.670> me<00:03:36.760> know<00:03:36.880> what<00:03:37.060> you

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
this case already let me know what you

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.789 
this case already let me know what you
