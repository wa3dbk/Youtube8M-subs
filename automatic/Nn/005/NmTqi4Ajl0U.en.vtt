00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.309
 the lawsuit would have a thousand miners in the end the new weapon he has 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.409
 started in 2006 at the same time 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:22.389
 as for the current mandate the company des alpes bought the walibi park 

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:24.089
 four walibi parks 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.160
 we say very quickly with physical serge do not know what to say 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.759
 she is interesting 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.990
 according to the author of moby dick marty 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.940
 a real brand 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.840
 the crux of any project is whether we were able with the help of the 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.940
 screenwriter of art people 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.360
 to create a story of more 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.650
 people 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.730
 strong enough for 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.360
 of this story flow all the rest we had a conviction is also 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.990
 strong that he was curious it would be really nice to do something 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.990
 around music 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.320
 music obviously 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.550
 and point 2 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.390
 convergence of points of view 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.490
 two meetings of the whole family 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.710
 ban describes a strong country 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.020
 I think in June 2007 poor 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.090
 lead a competition 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.970
 to find it is a beautiful story and that's when we did 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.259
 a very decisive meeting 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.359
 with the cubic studio team 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:35.889
 and percent and is a young author to whom and who knew the same hat 

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:39.809
 rate that happened with usd dozens of characters that was 

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:41.550
 really ruffling 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.100
 and then little by little the project take us 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.550
 it has probably been much further 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.660
 that we originally thought we worked no less than 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.130
 of two years I think of the development of this practical guide edited to do 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.610
 which has led to the establishment of an extremely attractive ministry 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.860
 scene 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.030
 completely redesigned orange called where they live here and very 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.690
 quickly it actually appeared to us employees who were part of a 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.690
 group in the feet of leader because he is the star 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:28.359
 especially that the vine parks walibi of genes the parks of the music 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.349
 music is really a central element and then 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.230
 all this beautiful world evolve in a fascinating universe that is 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.869
 repeat this Wednesday in quetta 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:43.139
 fantastic mysterious a little secret and from December 2008 we have a 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:44.769
 goal which is 2 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.909
 to make the world exist 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.620
 somewhere from a filter and this new universe saw well that it was 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.300
 developed by Quebec teams 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.070
 inside the four political parties for opening a home 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.569
 day by day 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.599
 we have reconstructed a 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.259
 a project team 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:00.519
 team 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:01.589
 trans-European 

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:03.110
 this cash 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.110
 we have representatives from every country where he is present 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:09.149
 and for those of others of course 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:11.869
 Yes 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:13.329
 to design it 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:14.859
 reinvent walid 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:18.049
 we must succeed in making this universe invented by Toulon 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.179
 does the brand 

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:24.599
 and how the character mark ump can live outside the park how 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.259
 keep this link 24 hours a day 7 days a week they do not have just when 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:31.880
 the park is open we were not expecting to start at first 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.800
 we had immediately in ten years is inadmissible by the state that's what he 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.349
 must do 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.050
 try to go beyond parties to make our characters live obviously 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.349
 in our parks but also outdoors by making them live 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.159
 I was going to say by creating a connection to the party with them the vegetables the 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.700
 children from 8 to 12 years old 365 days a year and not only during the stage 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.139
 opening of our parks benefits the world says fact that for the most 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:55.799
 away from the most just 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.329
 a break-in mark 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.329
 but that it becomes a mark of loss of life a lot of 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.439
 world worked on this project they put the world tenors that last year 

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:07.029
 and that's more 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:08.249
 fantastic 

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:09.380
 because m 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.599
 of course it's a project company from the Alps 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.979
 but we used the best in terms of expertise 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:19.379
 outside on the party with regard to masks for mascots it's 

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:22.490
 so it's a completely unique job had never been done 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.749
 we combine various talents we made people work for the usa 

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:31.869
 in germany at the international level the manga is drawn by 

00:04:31.869 --> 00:04:35.439
 belgium returns to france with watches in germany 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:38.539
 we are constantly waiting for these exchanges is completely 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:42.119
 international and this is one of the great riches of the project it is 

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:43.529
 always possible 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:46.529
 is that two years after today we see the 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.129
 the first productions 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:52.689
 excerpts from the cartoon one has derivatives and so on 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:54.620
 and all that is very coherent 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.910
 it means that the founding story and the imagination and creativity 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.439
 sharing 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:02.800
 and that's what will give up his faith 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.749
 the key word of the brand the idea of ​​this project 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:07.400
 it's daring in fact 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.339
 yet with this project it is a bold project 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:12.330
 m 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.110
 art 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.040
 Portuphy 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.569
 wrongly because all this 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:18.990
 it's really just the beginning 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.110
 but we think that laval and again 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.110
 far far away with their deployment 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:28.099
 she was using a little bit delayed ap 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:30.639
 there it's done 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.400
 we need to be active this meeting in five years 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.909
 our credibility redone 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:38.330
 all the universes of the new
