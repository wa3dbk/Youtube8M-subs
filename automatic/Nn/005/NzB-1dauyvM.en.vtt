00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.890 
what actual value will get is just bring
it<00:03:30.900> closer<00:03:31.430> there's<00:03:32.430> a<00:03:32.579> label<00:03:32.879> there<00:03:33.060> right

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
it closer there's a label there right

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.800 
it closer there's a label there right
there<00:03:34.109> so<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.069> value<00:03:35.400> is<00:03:35.519> 1<00:03:35.700> point<00:03:35.909> 4<00:03:36.269> 2<00:03:36.480> meters

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
there so the value is 1 point 4 2 meters

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.399 
there so the value is 1 point 4 2 meters
which<00:03:37.290> is<00:03:37.319> this<00:03:37.829> much<00:03:38.069> short<00:03:39.079> often<00:03:40.079> actual

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
which is this much short often actual

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:47.899 
which is this much short often actual
advertised<00:03:41.010> head<00:03:41.659> here<00:03:46.310> so<00:03:47.310> it's<00:03:47.430> nearly<00:03:47.699> half

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
advertised head here so it's nearly half

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.390 
advertised head here so it's nearly half
a<00:03:48.030> meter<00:03:48.209> short<00:03:48.599> of<00:03:49.379> the<00:03:49.560> advertised<00:03:50.069> here<00:03:50.280> in

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
a meter short of the advertised here in

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.179 
a meter short of the advertised here in
value<00:03:51.019> so<00:03:52.019> here<00:03:52.169> we<00:03:52.290> go<00:03:52.439> this<00:03:52.709> is<00:03:52.739> pump<00:03:53.069> number

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:53.189 
value so here we go this is pump number

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.500 
value so here we go this is pump number
2<00:03:53.579> exact<00:03:54.150> brand<00:03:54.689> new<00:03:54.870> pump<00:03:55.169> ac30<00:03:55.919> a<00:03:56.510> exactly

the<00:03:57.659> same<00:03:57.840> setup<00:03:58.139> is<00:03:58.409> being<00:03:58.680> trained<00:03:59.040> and

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
the same setup is being trained and

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.780 
the same setup is being trained and
let's<00:04:01.349> just<00:04:01.530> see<00:04:01.739> exactly<00:04:02.099> how<00:04:02.250> this<00:04:02.400> one<00:04:02.579> goes

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
let's just see exactly how this one goes

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:17.089 
let's just see exactly how this one goes
so<00:04:03.269> join<00:04:06.290> consider<00:04:07.290> level<00:04:07.590> moving<00:04:07.919> up<00:04:08.129> here<00:04:16.099> so

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
so join consider level moving up here so

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:19.490 
so join consider level moving up here so
it's<00:04:17.250> better<00:04:17.519> exactly<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.239> same<00:04:18.500> slightly

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
it's better exactly the same slightly

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.620 
it's better exactly the same slightly
more<00:04:19.680> but<00:04:20.400> not<00:04:20.549> very<00:04:20.639> much<00:04:20.849> supposed<00:04:21.329> to<00:04:21.449> be<00:04:21.570> at

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
more but not very much supposed to be at

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.370 
more but not very much supposed to be at
one<00:04:21.750> point<00:04:21.959> for<00:04:22.940> two<00:04:23.940> and<00:04:24.090> a<00:04:24.120> half<00:04:24.889> meters<00:04:26.270> so

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
one point for two and a half meters so

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.290 
one point for two and a half meters so
it<00:04:28.380> would<00:04:28.500> appear<00:04:28.800> that<00:04:29.130> having<00:04:29.699> sold<00:04:29.970> short

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
it would appear that having sold short

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:38.410 
it would appear that having sold short
