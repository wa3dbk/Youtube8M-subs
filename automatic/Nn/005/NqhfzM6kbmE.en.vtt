00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.430
 before 

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.430
 i 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.630
 let's elaborate 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:17.539
 the paper that we are going to use in 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:20.080
 those used newspapers 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.160
 in the flour-based group 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.180
 and that white 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.020
 sea ​​moved 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.740
 for dinner 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.379
 how he saw it here 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:39.870
 a brush 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:42.130
 It moves data blenders and 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.900
 containers 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.490
 once having all the materials 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:51.120
 we proceed to make pieces of paper 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.760
 in waters once done all once 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.030
 made all the pieces bits we 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.930
 we see to place in a container with 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:06.260
 water for about two hours or less 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:09.520
 already having this we do not know the agreement 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.450
 in which we got to get this 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.450
 we serve 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.990
 once sifted we get what would be 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.990
 the raw material 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:27.190
 we proceed to place in a container the 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.340
 raw material we put some plaster 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.340
 White 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.290
 a little marmolina 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:43.400
 and mix for that for this 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:47.330
 mass becomes more consistent 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.170
 we proceed to place what is 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.170
 the paste 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.930
 a little rubber 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.600
 and we proceed to mix 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.810
 once mixed all this 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.530
 we get to get what is a plus like that 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.410
 in which we have to mix it well 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.960
 so that this mass is consistent for 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.640
 can be applied in the mold and once 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.330
 that has a mass 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:31.490
 like that we will take the 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:33.050
 mold we put some paraffin to 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.500
 that the mold so that the dough does not 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.500
 stick 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.569
 we put it in very well well so that it does not 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:47.109
 one of the parts sticks 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:49.220
 once placed all the paraffin we 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:53.040
 will 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:57.420
 to put to put the dough 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.239
 well then it's in all states for 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.960
 that this dough and mold go well and the 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.690
 design 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.690
 already once all the whole dough 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:19.250
 once we put all the dough we arrived at 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.250
 get a design like this 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:26.060
 what would this guy be 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.739
 we have what is the mold we have 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.110
 let it dry if you want about three to 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.110
 four days so this one stops so that 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.700
 this mass is hard but this is not 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.620
 it would look good once I had this 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.310
 we get what are cariocas to 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:45.010
 paint and proceed to paint it to taste 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.700
 of us in which we already have the 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.700
 finished product 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.640
 have something like this 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.780
 and several and different molds that 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.550
 we have got to get more designs 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.550
 of the person's taste 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.200
