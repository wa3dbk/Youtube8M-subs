the other thing too going through your
electro<00:01:33.409> harmonix<00:01:33.950> clone<00:01:34.219> theory<00:01:34.579> for<00:01:34.789> the

electro harmonix clone theory for the
chorus<00:01:35.530> slow<00:01:36.530> motion<00:01:37.209> ain't<00:01:38.209> got<00:01:38.329> your<00:01:38.420> memory

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
chorus slow motion ain't got your memory

chorus slow motion ain't got your memory
man<00:01:38.869> here<00:01:39.110> small<00:01:39.560> tone<00:01:41.619> this<00:01:42.619> is<00:01:42.679> something

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
man here small tone this is something

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.309 
man here small tone this is something
you<00:01:43.340> can<00:01:43.520> use<00:01:43.700> for<00:01:43.729> a<00:01:44.060> machine<00:01:44.420> gun<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:44.989> whammy

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
you can use for a machine gun the whammy

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:48.219 
you can use for a machine gun the whammy
the<00:01:45.439> small<00:01:45.679> tone<00:01:45.979> and<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.579> slow<00:01:46.880> slow<00:01:47.810> motion

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
the small tone and the slow slow motion

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.850 
the small tone and the slow slow motion
give<00:01:48.619> you<00:01:48.709> effect<00:01:49.099> sort<00:01:49.369> of<00:01:49.459> like<00:01:50.649> like<00:01:51.649> this

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
give you effect sort of like like this

00:01:51.860 --> 00:02:28.320 
give you effect sort of like like this
see<00:01:52.640> it<00:01:52.759> machine<00:01:53.030> gun<00:01:53.270> here

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.120 

so<00:02:28.960> there<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:29.140> have<00:02:29.230> machine-gun<00:02:30.010> and

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
so there you have machine-gun and

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.950 
so there you have machine-gun and
something<00:02:30.400> like<00:02:30.460> that<00:02:30.550> now<00:02:31.000> as<00:02:31.120> far<00:02:31.330> as<00:02:31.390> alison

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
something like that now as far as alison

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.240 
something like that now as far as alison
goes<00:02:32.140> I<00:02:32.230> wanted<00:02:32.380> to<00:02:32.470> show<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.800> courts<00:02:33.130> or

goes I wanted to show you the courts or

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.930 
goes I wanted to show you the courts or
a<00:02:33.280> quick<00:02:33.550> on<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.850> change<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:36.310> from<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.670> course

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
a quick on the change it from the course

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:44.300 
a quick on the change it from the course
obviously<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:37.960> can<00:02:38.110> see

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.670 

on<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.209> course<00:02:45.480> I'm<00:02:46.080> going<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.319> play<00:02:46.470> my<00:02:46.500> II

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
on the course I'm going to play my II

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.320 
on the course I'm going to play my II
like<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.040> I've<00:02:47.280> been<00:02:47.370> focusing<00:02:47.910> on<00:02:48.060> here

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
like that I've been focusing on here

00:02:48.330 --> 00:03:22.670 
like that I've been focusing on here
come<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.319> little<00:02:49.380> closer<00:02:49.650> with<00:02:50.540> John<00:02:51.540> go

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:44.070 

d<00:03:23.680> /<00:03:24.040> left<00:03:24.790> sharp

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.230 

that<00:03:45.490> is<00:03:46.490> d<00:03:47.300> /<00:03:47.930> f<00:03:48.440> sharpening<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.880> then<00:03:50.150> we're

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
that is d / f sharpening and then we're

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:58.090 
that is d / f sharpening and then we're
doing<00:03:50.390> a<00:03:50.660> /<00:03:50.990> G<00:03:51.320> sharp<00:03:54.190> to<00:03:55.190> be<00:03:55.540> over<00:03:56.540> D<00:03:56.930> sharp<00:03:57.470> and

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
doing a / G sharp to be over D sharp and

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.420 
doing a / G sharp to be over D sharp and
then<00:03:58.670> a<00:03:59.000> over<00:03:59.240> C<00:03:59.390> here<00:03:59.630> and<00:03:59.960> then<00:04:00.950> we're

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
then a over C here and then we're

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.860 
then a over C here and then we're
evolving<00:04:01.730> on<00:04:02.090> the<00:04:02.180> opening<00:04:04.360> like<00:04:05.360> that<00:04:05.570> so

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
evolving on the opening like that so

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:06.700 
evolving on the opening like that so
quick

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:06.710
