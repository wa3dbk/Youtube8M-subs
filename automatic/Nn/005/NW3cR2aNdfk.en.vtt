00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.610
 they have installed it we are going to when 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.500
 open the application appear something like this 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.780
 there is another color because I have a 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.900
 project but this will not appear 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.850
 same window like this 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.790
 good to start we're going to have to 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.610
 put to with says open ing 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.890
 we click and it goes you do not have to go 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.460
 to the directory until his gta san andreas 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:05.150
 in control I only have on local disk it 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:07.780
 filed the rock star game gta program 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.190
 san andreas good once here in 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.320
 they will enter the folder that says 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.540
 models 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.409
 good the folder inside the folder 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.750
 models are going to appear these four 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:24.430
 archives ing you are going to that are going to 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:28.530
 see what gta says 3 point and mg 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.530
 well they give a click and they give to open 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.820
 here you will see all the 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.010
 things the gta san andreas for example if 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.970
 they want to avoid I do not know to see here the 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.040
 walls I do not know 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.130
 it's going to facilitate the walls all that 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.340
 because very big the gta san andreas 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.870
 more or less people are here 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.640
 like in the cost of this pretty much by 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.600
 why here in around here are the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.800
 people and they end up looking like the names 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.970
 and consumed 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.970
 let's edit 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:08.800
 one that is from the pro street band 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.890
 for example these and for example this 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.230
 I've already edited it 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.080
 it seems normal to you like this 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.630
 example these two already the station this 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.270
 this is normal but you for 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.610
 example here in this they tighten it and it goes 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.930
 until normal and for example they are going to give 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.130
 to export 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.990
 and they will give him to PNG 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.750
 and there they will choose a place where 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.640
 want to save in the nothing save 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.530
 in my case here on the desk that I 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.740
 I had it saved 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.870
 again they keep it 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.270
 and for example I do not know how they want 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.270
 edit it for example with bread 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.010
 what can they have can happen with the 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.410
 photoshop or photoshop but not much 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.020
 they got it 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.080
 good for example the cable can 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.720
 that can be changing up to the face 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.160
 after closing I told him that 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.720
 visit the real madrid 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.540
 to mine 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.850
 and the shoes good a creation 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.860
 saved they will give here to the iconic 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:19.710
 this or save as and save it 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.760
 they close once they have it 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.010
 prepared they will enter again to the tx of 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.549
 workshop 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.540
 and in the same place where the character is 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.530
 that you will need they will give to 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.140
 import now 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.220
 and in they were going to see they are going to look for where 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.100
 they have saved after 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.260
 after they've edited it and they're going 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.209
 to give a click and they'll open 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.280
 good for example you have to change something 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:49.900
 the appearing this 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.870
