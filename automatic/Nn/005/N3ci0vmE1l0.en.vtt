00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.320
 well yes welcome inside this one 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.719
 video apple has now released almost a 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.490
 oretta ios and 8 beta 5 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.260
 now I have just started 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.779
 the update has just started 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.189
 right now the download and it takes me already 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.510
 so much because here the connection is not 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.429
 excellent then they are still the second 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.669
 the sky router down so I don't have 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:26.380
 this video still has adequate power 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:30.279
 however, I fear I will have to finish 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.410
 tomorrow because I will have to go out then not 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.510
 I can really see together with 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.829
 you on the fly the news then then tomorrow 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.320
 maybe for a while we take a look 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.460
 to see if they have updated 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.260
 bug fix etc. or if 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.940
 they also put something back in 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.309
 user interface content level 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.769
 so I give you an appointment tomorrow too 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:51.190
 if you see it you will be around 32 a fan 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.000
 second way, the second one is young 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.980
 part of the video 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.539
 I should have gone by the following morning 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.370
 but essentially two have passed 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:00.460
 days goes well I'm vacation too 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.449
 finally, even ice creams have not 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.210
 he lived very calmly because 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.830
 essentially there is no news from 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.439
 dizziness 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.060
 what in fact I saw also thanks 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:13.329
 as usual to talented kids 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.430
 mac files that are always faster and the 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:18.549
 fact that they have made new ones 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.590
 icons here therefore variations 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.509
 really really minimal what instead 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.320
 I am interested in telling you essentially the 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.720
 done and I took as usual the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.070
 classic apple changelog is this 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.119
 account trinket if I had already said 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.920
 lose previous beta but is divided into 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.659
 let's say part of it there is a first 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.610
 part where the service is explained o 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.969
 the application in question of which one 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.640
 will concentrate the paragraph then there is one 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:48.680
 part called precisely fixed that is 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.750
 parts that have been repaired with respect 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.110
 to the previous beta to the pre beta huts 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.170
 precedents then there is also that 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.960
 relating to the notes, ie for example that 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.570
 so safari there is a bit of beta 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.190
 of the fact that they have disabled pops 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.720
 up advertisements that they can directly 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.000
 the publisher then goes on to write them 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.810
 in the form of notes and then there is the part 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.910
 ie the problems are not known then 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.150
 for the first time I find myself in front of 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.590
 a beta that has very few grandparents 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.590
 shore that is in practice they just have 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.269
 packaged a firmware that presents 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.800
 few known problems this is a good one 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.019
 sign means that we are already enough 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.630
 ahead we are in fact faced with 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.860
 a firmware that is with notes from 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.650
 release that make it seem really 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.940
 an almost definitive film indeed not 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.410
 there are errors for example 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.790
 during the setup ie during the first 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.230
 lighting after installation of the film 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.090
 for example there are still some 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.400
 difficulty in recovering packs with 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.250
 as 71 of the boat for example that I read now 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.989
 is the fact that maybe during the 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.090
 restore a backup of ios seven 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.950
 may tend not to take up all the 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.870
 photo in the camera roll 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.670
 there are various small errors but nothing 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.660
 that really preclude so many 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.250
 we are working there 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.070
 getting closer to enough releases 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.560
 apart from this there is to say ad 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.750
 example that all the problems related to 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.549
 facetime antique spotlight keyboard 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.860
 it was very slow now you see a lot 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.900
 instant everything all really pub 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.070
 really cared for is yes we are there 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.620
 approaching the end maybe then 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.880
 will be surprises in the gm that 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.260
 correspond for example to the 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.850
 presentation of the new iphone yes 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.230
 the very first of September is rumored 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.940
 new iphone and then maybe the 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.250
 firmware will come up with features 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.420
 exclusive for that iphone though for that 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.260
 that concerns what they have done to us 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.600
 see so far 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.870
 we are already in front of one by one 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.840
 quite successful firmware 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.870
 there are still some problems with icloud drive o 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.040
 better 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.959
 but naturally active with cloud drives 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.790
 on these devices that is that sort 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.440
 of dropbox made from apple as I have it 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.549
 tried to explain quickly either 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.409
 in one of the very first videos there is some 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.510
 problem related to the fact that the data 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:56.489
 they are already reported as being eliminable 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.590
 it says that if you rely on the cloud 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.019
 drive there could be from here to 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.340
 release of the next beta a wipe of the 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.140
 data there is a data deletion 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.970
 so in short we are still really into 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.620
 a test phase regarding 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.239
 these online services but apart from these 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.829
 online services all in all we find ourselves 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.319
 opposite as I have already said to a 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.549
 firmware that works really well others 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.400
 problems for example were on the 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:19.229
 localization understood as languages 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.810
 the phone is also set to 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.419
 Italian gave different strings in 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.340
 english still not located in the menu 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.539
 in various phone languages 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.490
 now they have been put in place 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:32.190
 these things have been everything 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.930
 when much more cured too 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.320
 then there are some sections where 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.590
 no more references to como said before the 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:43.080
 section of the and is not therefore also is 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.900
 of the notes therefore all in all it returns to 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.510
 Repeat phone that starts to be 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.010
 usable as I told you ie in 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.970
 this period as you see no timse 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.280
 reports the iPhone I am not using 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.530
 great because the iPhone or three 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.700
 one side and juan from another someone has 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.260
 asked who they kept brought in 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:03.180
 holiday these two is accordingly 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.979
 the iphone i 'm using it a little also because 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.750
 when to install the first beta of 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.979
 he also had the second one today 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.080
 stability really was really 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.120
 compromised the ipad instead I use it 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.910
 still with garlic s8 and apart from some 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.620
 little problem has become usable 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.150
 this too and there is some problem in 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.120
 more than anything of app compatibility 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.190
 they are apps that in certain 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.930
 circumstances crash other than their own 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.250
 don't open for example I'm started 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.070
 play a little that entrance china that 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.840
 are on vacation entry opens and ne 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.830
 grows immediately after that is the applications 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.419
 which still haven't been right 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.130
 optimize car privacy but of course 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.780
 one cannot expect and above all not 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.750
 you can leave legendary negative 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.910
 to developers when still 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.130
 they made it compatible with 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.260
 various apps other apps such as le 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.060
 indispensable of isle s for example 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.860
 I quote tweetbot those were put to 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.030
 place both on ipad and on iphone because 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.950
 no crashes do not occur 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.950
 they already check the problems more 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.540
 had in beta 1 this this iphone e 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.430
 so everything was put right 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.560
 silently or not in any case they have 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.360
 put in place also for users of 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.820
 beta that we now say are really 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.740
 so I just have to say goodbye to you 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.540
 for this video it's all video shot 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.740
 in the space of three days it may not be 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.840
 a similar thing happened 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.880
 gives me an appointment at beta 6 for 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.440
 as for these these videos I have 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.380
 also saw me semitic 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.570
 I semiti some graphic tweak 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.220
 adjustment here and there begins to 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.419
 be slightly more stable but still 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.550
 I can't use it very well 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:27.770
 in fact lately I'm using more pro 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.240
 that the air just for this reason to 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.950
 I can only greet you for this reason 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.610
 and thank you as usual for having 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.110
 watched the videos 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:37.780
 remember to write obviously me 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.780
 like to share if you like hi guys
