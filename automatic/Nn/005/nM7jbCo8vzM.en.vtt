who<00:04:44.960> is<00:04:45.169> probably<00:04:45.740> one<00:04:46.729> of<00:04:46.760> if<00:04:47.120> not<00:04:47.150> the

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
who is probably one of if not the

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.240 
who is probably one of if not the
strongest<00:04:47.780> power<00:04:48.139> lifter<00:04:48.590> in<00:04:48.740> a<00:04:48.830> sport<00:04:49.099> right

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
strongest power lifter in a sport right

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.770 
strongest power lifter in a sport right
now<00:04:50.080> he's<00:04:51.080> till<00:04:51.349> he<00:04:51.470> squatted<00:04:51.800> 992<00:04:52.610> with<00:04:53.449> ease

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
now he's till he squatted 992 with ease

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.140 
now he's till he squatted 992 with ease
and<00:04:54.050> I<00:04:54.260> foresee<00:04:55.190> him<00:04:55.310> breaking<00:04:55.580> a<00:04:55.789> thousand

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
and I foresee him breaking a thousand

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.370 
and I foresee him breaking a thousand
pounds<00:04:56.479> setting<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:56.810> whole<00:04:56.900> time<00:04:57.050> heavy<00:04:57.320> a

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
pounds setting the whole time heavy a

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.140 
pounds setting the whole time heavy a
squat<00:04:57.740> record<00:04:58.490> this<00:04:58.610> weekend<00:04:59.260> at<00:05:00.260> the<00:05:00.320> capo

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
squat record this weekend at the capo

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.310 
squat record this weekend at the capo
I'm<00:05:02.150> looking<00:05:02.300> for<00:05:02.570> Eric<00:05:02.780> to<00:05:02.810> break<00:05:03.050> a<00:05:03.080> big

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
I'm looking for Eric to break a big

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.750 
I'm looking for Eric to break a big
squad<00:05:03.590> number<00:05:03.949> I<00:05:04.099> think<00:05:04.430> he'll<00:05:04.550> probably

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
squad number I think he'll probably

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.760 
squad number I think he'll probably
break<00:05:05.060> on<00:05:05.240> the<00:05:05.360> 900-pound<00:05:05.930> squad<00:05:06.260> list<00:05:06.470> I

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
break on the 900-pound squad list I

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.550 
break on the 900-pound squad list I
think<00:05:07.580> there's<00:05:07.729> only<00:05:07.820> been<00:05:08.060> 15<00:05:08.330> maybe<00:05:08.840> 16<00:05:09.110> guys

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
think there's only been 15 maybe 16 guys

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.930 
think there's only been 15 maybe 16 guys
to<00:05:09.770> do<00:05:09.889> that<00:05:10.070> so<00:05:10.460> far<00:05:10.669> and<00:05:11.000> if<00:05:11.210> Eric<00:05:11.510> doesn't<00:05:12.940> it

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
to do that so far and if Eric doesn't it

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.210 
to do that so far and if Eric doesn't it
does<00:05:14.150> meet<00:05:14.360> he<00:05:14.630> will<00:05:14.750> be<00:05:14.780> the<00:05:14.960> lightest<00:05:15.289> unless

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
does meet he will be the lightest unless

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.620 
does meet he will be the lightest unless
I<00:05:16.370> also<00:05:16.550> do<00:05:16.820> it<00:05:16.909> and<00:05:17.000> then<00:05:17.090> I'll<00:05:17.210> be<00:05:17.360> the<00:05:17.479> last

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
I also do it and then I'll be the last

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.740 
I also do it and then I'll be the last
but<00:05:18.380> we'll<00:05:18.680> see<00:05:18.800> how<00:05:18.830> that<00:05:18.979> goes<00:05:19.099> and<00:05:19.820> this

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
but we'll see how that goes and this

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.839 
but we'll see how that goes and this
