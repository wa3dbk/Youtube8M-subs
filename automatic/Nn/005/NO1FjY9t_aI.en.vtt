that people use GH a lot of times when
they<00:01:36.030> talk<00:01:36.210> about<00:01:36.450> steroids<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.409> they<00:01:37.500> are

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
they talk about steroids and they are

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.020 
they talk about steroids and they are
thinking<00:01:37.860> muscle<00:01:38.579> gains

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
thinking muscle gains

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.399 
thinking muscle gains
so<00:01:39.390> oak<00:01:40.259> velvet<00:01:41.040> antler<00:01:41.520> equals<00:01:42.090> IGF<00:01:42.689> 1<00:01:42.899> equals

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
so oak velvet antler equals IGF 1 equals

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.780 
so oak velvet antler equals IGF 1 equals
muscle<00:01:43.829> gain<00:01:44.040> equals<00:01:44.880> success<00:01:46.070> know<00:01:47.070> there's

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
muscle gain equals success know there's

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.160 
muscle gain equals success know there's
tons<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.329> research<00:01:48.600> out<00:01:48.810> there<00:01:48.990> I'm<00:01:49.079> gonna

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
tons of research out there I'm gonna

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.600 
tons of research out there I'm gonna

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
one or two that's all you need there's

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.200 
one or two that's all you need there's
plenty<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.100> evidence<00:01:53.280> out<00:01:53.640> there<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.970> shows

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
plenty of evidence out there that shows

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.179 
plenty of evidence out there that shows
they've<00:01:54.450> done<00:01:54.600> specific<00:01:55.110> testing<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.979> see

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
they've done specific testing to see

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.520 
they've done specific testing to see
exactly<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.119> has<00:01:57.270> any<00:01:57.509> benefits<00:01:58.049> so

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
exactly if it has any benefits so

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.109 
exactly if it has any benefits so
oftentimes<00:01:59.130> with<00:01:59.310> testing<00:01:59.700> we<00:01:59.790> say<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.000> know

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
oftentimes with testing we say you know

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.730 
oftentimes with testing we say you know
it's<00:02:00.240> not<00:02:00.329> really<00:02:00.509> valid<00:02:00.719> they<00:02:01.170> don't<00:02:01.320> use<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
it's not really valid they don't use the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.410 
it's not really valid they don't use the

athletes for performance things like

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.370

that<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.700> test<00:02:06.090> was<00:02:06.210> done<00:02:06.509> on<00:02:06.689> athletes<00:02:07.200> for

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
that this test was done on athletes for

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.660 
that this test was done on athletes for
performance<00:02:07.950> there's<00:02:08.129> plenty<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.520> them<00:02:08.610> out

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
performance there's plenty of them out

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.910 
performance there's plenty of them out
there<00:02:08.940> it's<00:02:09.479> still<00:02:09.810> been<00:02:10.020> shown<00:02:10.319> not<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.770> do

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
there it's still been shown not to do

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.910 
there it's still been shown not to do
jack<00:02:11.220> squat<00:02:11.580> so<00:02:12.239> I<00:02:12.270> know

jack squat so I know

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.920 
jack squat so I know
you're<00:02:13.099> probably<00:02:13.280> thinking<00:02:13.640> if<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.660> hasn't<00:02:14.870> in

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
you're probably thinking if it hasn't in

you're probably thinking if it hasn't in
turn<00:02:15.050> to<00:02:15.140> do<00:02:15.230> anything<00:02:15.410> why<00:02:15.770> would<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.040> NFL

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
turn to do anything why would the NFL

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:17.170 
turn to do anything why would the NFL
ban<00:02:16.849> it

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
ban it

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.110 
ban it
well<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.690> NFL<00:02:18.050> bans<00:02:18.290> lots<00:02:18.620> of<00:02:18.770> crap<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.910> it's

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
well the NFL bans lots of crap and it's

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.850 
well the NFL bans lots of crap and it's
not<00:02:20.300> always<00:02:20.599> because<00:02:21.260> they<00:02:21.560> know<00:02:21.709> what

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
not always because they know what

they're<00:02:21.980> talking<00:02:22.310> about<00:02:22.370> I<00:02:22.760> think<00:02:23.360> mark<00:02:23.599> Loeb

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
they're talking about I think mark Loeb

that<00:02:31.700> they<00:02:31.850> have<00:02:32.000> is<00:02:32.330> fucked<00:02:32.660> up<00:02:32.810> that's<00:02:33.080> why

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
that they have is fucked up that's why

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.960 
that they have is fucked up that's why
so<00:02:33.440> many<00:02:33.560> people<00:02:33.770> can<00:02:34.100> use<00:02:34.280> these<00:02:34.459> drugs<00:02:34.790> and

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
so many people can use these drugs and

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.150 
so many people can use these drugs and
not<00:02:35.150> get<00:02:35.360> caught<00:02:35.569> in<00:02:35.600> most<00:02:35.989> cases<00:02:36.260> usually

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
not get caught in most cases usually

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.559 
not get caught in most cases usually
when<00:02:37.280> they<00:02:37.370> finally<00:02:37.580> do<00:02:37.819> get<00:02:37.970> testing<00:02:38.420> it's

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
when they finally do get testing it's

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:39.820 
when they finally do get testing it's
too<00:02:38.780> late<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.080> people<00:02:39.230> have<00:02:39.410> been<00:02:39.500> using<00:02:39.560> for

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
too late and people have been using for

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.290 
too late and people have been using for
years<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:40.340> they've<00:02:40.459> moved<00:02:40.610> on<00:02:40.819> to<00:02:40.880> better

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
years and they've moved on to better

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.870 
years and they've moved on to better
drugs<00:02:41.660> that<00:02:42.230> are<00:02:42.380> no<00:02:42.560> longer<00:02:43.010> detectable<00:02:43.489> and

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
drugs that are no longer detectable and

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
drugs that are no longer detectable and
cream<00:02:44.269> in<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.569> clear<00:02:44.780> anybody<00:02:46.150> so<00:02:47.150> I<00:02:47.569> wouldn't

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
cream in the clear anybody so I wouldn't

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.540 
cream in the clear anybody so I wouldn't
really<00:02:47.989> base<00:02:48.290> it<00:02:48.530> off<00:02:48.650> of<00:02:48.860> that<00:02:49.010> just<00:02:49.220> because

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
really base it off of that just because

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.759 
really base it off of that just because
it's<00:02:49.700> banned<00:02:50.060> by<00:02:50.360> a<00:02:50.390> certain<00:02:50.930> sport<00:02:51.200> doesn't

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
it's banned by a certain sport doesn't

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.830 
it's banned by a certain sport doesn't
mean<00:02:51.950> that<00:02:52.160> it's<00:02:52.340> necessarily<00:02:52.630> anabolic<00:02:53.630> for

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
mean that it's necessarily anabolic for

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.660 
mean that it's necessarily anabolic for
you<00:02:53.959> in<00:02:54.170> fact<00:02:54.590> a<00:02:54.739> lot<00:02:54.890> of<00:02:55.010> times<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.459> stuff

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
you in fact a lot of times the stuff

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.490 
you in fact a lot of times the stuff
that<00:02:55.790> they<00:02:55.940> ban<00:02:56.209> actually<00:02:56.690> has<00:02:56.840> no<00:02:57.080> anabolic

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
that they ban actually has no anabolic

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.860 
that they ban actually has no anabolic
properties<00:02:58.040> whatsoever<00:02:58.519> but<00:02:59.269> they're<00:02:59.540> used

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
properties whatsoever but they're used

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.170 
properties whatsoever but they're used
to<00:03:00.170> mask<00:03:00.410> other<00:03:00.830> things<00:03:01.190> that<00:03:01.489> do<00:03:01.730> have<00:03:01.940> that

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
to mask other things that do have that

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.449 
to mask other things that do have that
so<00:03:02.540> it<00:03:03.080> can<00:03:03.290> kind<00:03:03.500> of<00:03:03.560> get<00:03:03.709> convoluted<00:03:04.310> if

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
so it can kind of get convoluted if

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.430 
so it can kind of get convoluted if
you're<00:03:04.640> not<00:03:04.850> careful<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.540> bottom<00:03:05.810> line<00:03:06.019> is<00:03:06.230> is

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
you're not careful the bottom line is is

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.620 
you're not careful the bottom line is is
just<00:03:06.590> think<00:03:06.890> about<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.280> basics<00:03:07.700> of<00:03:07.819> it<00:03:07.970> I<00:03:08.150> mean

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
just think about the basics of it I mean

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.300
