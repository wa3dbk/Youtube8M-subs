00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
was my finger that trellis frame that

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.840 
was my finger that trellis frame that
very<00:00:31.320> complicated<00:00:31.619> looking<00:00:32.070> pivot<00:00:32.430> plate<00:00:32.579> but

very complicated looking pivot plate but
the<00:00:32.940> whole<00:00:33.150> bikes<00:00:33.390> it's<00:00:33.630> actually<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> lot

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
the whole bikes it's actually a lot

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.260 
the whole bikes it's actually a lot
higher<00:00:34.380> it's<00:00:34.890> sitting<00:00:35.160> on<00:00:35.190> solid<00:00:35.670> suspension

higher it's sitting on solid suspension

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.370 
higher it's sitting on solid suspension
and<00:00:36.420> that's<00:00:36.540> supposed<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.870> give<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> idea

of that ventured further and we will

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.090 
of that ventured further and we will
talk<00:00:39.840> about<00:00:39.960> whether<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.440> works<00:00:40.680> or<00:00:40.830> not<00:00:40.920> but

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
talk about whether that works or not but

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.890 
talk about whether that works or not but
let<00:00:41.190> me<00:00:41.280> give<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.580> a<00:00:41.610> detail<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.660> bits

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
let me give you a detail on the bits

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.750 
let me give you a detail on the bits

like that a lot

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.140 
like that a lot
front<00:00:49.740> suspension<00:00:49.860> fully<00:00:50.370> adjustable<00:00:50.850> so

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
front suspension fully adjustable so

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.750 
front suspension fully adjustable so
that's<00:00:51.540> the<00:00:51.810> rebound<00:00:52.200> adjuster<00:00:52.710> down<00:00:53.400> here

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
that's the rebound adjuster down here

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.340 
that's the rebound adjuster down here
that<00:00:54.150> red<00:00:54.390> school<00:00:54.630> that<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.840> can<00:00:54.990> see<00:00:55.170> that's

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
that red school that you can see that's

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.830 
that red school that you can see that's
the<00:00:55.470> compression<00:00:55.860> adjuster<00:00:56.310> it<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.330> supposed

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
the compression adjuster it is supposed

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.600 
the compression adjuster it is supposed
to<00:00:57.990> be<00:00:58.170> an<00:00:58.290> off-road<00:00:58.650> capable<00:00:59.010> motorcycle

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
to be an off-road capable motorcycle

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.640 
to be an off-road capable motorcycle
therefore<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.540> have<00:01:00.690> 19-inch<00:01:01.170> front<00:01:01.290> tires

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
therefore you have 19-inch front tires

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.650 
therefore you have 19-inch front tires
wearing<00:01:02.340> metzeler<00:01:02.700> Torrance's<00:01:03.210> which<00:01:03.420> are

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
wearing metzeler Torrance's which are

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.929 
wearing metzeler Torrance's which are
wide<00:01:04.290> block<00:01:04.619> pattern<00:01:04.890> tires<00:01:05.309> they<00:01:05.820> work

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
wide block pattern tires they work

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.460 
wide block pattern tires they work
pretty<00:01:06.090> well<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.630> street<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.290> they

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
pretty well on the street and they

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.709 
pretty well on the street and they
should<00:01:07.830> be<00:01:08.040> reasonably<00:01:08.490> okay<00:01:08.850> on<00:01:09.030> off<00:01:09.570> the

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:09.719 
should be reasonably okay on off the

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:12.080 
should be reasonably okay on off the
road<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:10.259> tried<00:01:10.469> a<00:01:10.499> little<00:01:10.679> bit<00:01:10.950> today<00:01:11.219> but<00:01:11.520> we

00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:34.499 
quite a bit so today it's not running in

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:37.520 
quite a bit so today it's not running in
its<00:01:34.619> finest<00:01:35.009> fettle<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:35.969> from<00:01:36.719> 4,000<00:01:37.289> there<00:01:37.439> is

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
its finest fettle so from 4,000 there is

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.080 
its finest fettle so from 4,000 there is
a<00:01:37.560> surge<00:01:37.889> it<00:01:38.069> does<00:01:38.219> make<00:01:38.399> some<00:01:38.609> power<00:01:38.819> but

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
a surge it does make some power but

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.179 
a surge it does make some power but
after<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.929> can't<00:01:40.439> seem<00:01:40.649> to<00:01:40.679> able<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.009> get

again<00:02:38.790> what<00:02:39.239> you<00:02:39.360> have<00:02:39.540> here<00:02:39.750> that's<00:02:40.019> a

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
again what you have here that's a

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.199 
again what you have here that's a
preload<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.709> adjuster<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:41.430> it's<00:02:41.700> nice<00:02:41.879> to<00:02:42.120> be

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
preload the adjuster and it's nice to be

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.880 
preload the adjuster and it's nice to be
able<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.450> just<00:02:42.629> do<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.870> at<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.440> bottom<00:02:43.739> there

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
able to just do that at the bottom there

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.140 
able to just do that at the bottom there
is<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:44.010> rebound<00:02:44.220> collar<00:02:44.580> which<00:02:44.760> would<00:02:44.879> be<00:02:44.970> very

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
is a rebound collar which would be very

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.059 
is a rebound collar which would be very
hard<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.480> get<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.810> but<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:46.080> is<00:02:46.110> there<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.739> of

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
hard to get to but it is there and of

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.050 
hard to get to but it is there and of
course<00:02:47.099> you're<00:02:47.340> not<00:02:47.400> going<00:02:47.549> to<00:02:47.640> be<00:02:47.700> adjusting
