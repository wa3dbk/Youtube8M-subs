00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:20.730
 the exercise is called press day it is one 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.660
 very good exercise for breathing the motor 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.519
 to optimize the brass 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:31.170
 The first step in the exercise is that 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:34.440
 you can inhale while exercising 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.790
 to put your hand over your stomach when 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.309
 one with the twelve with the zwerchfell 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.290
 inhale to pay attention that the belly 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.640
 expand as far as possible and the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.640
 stomach is also as relaxed as possible 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.800
 except the build muscle itself 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:58.780
 still the trunk muscles from the second 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.219
 Step is that you exhale 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.780
 trying to make active by the 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:09.380
 tenses abdominal muscles and thereby the 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.020
 the forelimbs push up and the air 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.600
 the necessary energy is available at the 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.440
 trumpet powerful and enduring 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.080
 to be able to play 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.320
 Here I put to the control here too 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.060
 again my hand in the side 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.479
 push in and if I can 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.429
 exhale and the abdominal muscles 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.470
 hook right, I've got a 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:31.369
 small reflex I hand 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.860
 can determine 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.140
 It is important that as soon as here 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.050
 down the abdominal muscles tense the 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:49.220
 Air with the necessary energy to the 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:50.929
 Life arrives the third step is 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.509
 that you put the whole thing on the instrument 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:56.349
 transfers it is important that 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.479
 The lips are closed and the sound 

00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:00.890
 not triggered but only by the 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.479
 air is blown on 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.479
 the whole thing sounds like that 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.340
 Of course it is important that 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.860
 the first two steps we take 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.180
 have practiced without instrument directly with 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.230
 the instrument again 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.330
 that means that you are correct 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.060
 unit and that you exhale the 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.590
 I tense my abdominal muscles for myself 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.550
 personally start with this exercise 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.569
 at t2 and go up chromatically 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.000
 it is important that you too 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.590
 install appropriate breaks as it is yes 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.410
 For the lips a very exhausting 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.170
 Exercise is as soon as you realize that the lib 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.900
 by the power of love, or by the love 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.320
 acidifies that you immediately no break 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.660
 installs and after a short break there 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.250
 where you left off does that continue 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.090
 you can go all the way up so far 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.620
 nobody wants to and can continue 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.360
 a short example, I 'll do it now 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.709
 not in chromatic order but 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.709
 just a few different sounds 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.530
 because the exercises are very exhausting 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.760
 they should be possible, not in front of a 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.480
 make a concert and not 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.970
 exaggerate 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.700
 that means you have to enter yourself, of course 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.459
 get feeling for his body and 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.440
 Remember when it's actually enough 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.090
 you stop it otherwise you let yourself 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.520
 flat and maybe for several 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.440
 days are not really able to his 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.360
 to play normal daily exercises 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.299
 I hope that with this video I am 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.310
 one or the other workshop participants of the 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.260
 So already at a workshop was 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.390
 could give a little tip or 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.900
 Others do not do this exercise yet 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.480
 knew 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.510
 have shown a small possibility 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.290
 how to grow steadily on the trumpet 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.290
 can expand
