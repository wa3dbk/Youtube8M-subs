we<00:00:05.580> created<00:00:05.819> I<00:00:06.210> wire<00:00:06.480> so<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:07.010> anyone

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
we created I wire so that anyone

we created I wire so that anyone
anywhere<00:00:08.760> in<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.300> world<00:00:09.590> can<00:00:10.910> participate<00:00:11.910> in

anywhere in the world can participate in

anywhere in the world can participate in
neuroscience<00:00:13.049> research<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.790> think<00:00:14.790> that's

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
neuroscience research I think that's

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.570 
neuroscience research I think that's
kind<00:00:15.089> of<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.240> revolutionary<00:00:15.870> concept<00:00:16.400> much<00:00:17.400> of

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
kind of a revolutionary concept much of

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.730 
kind of a revolutionary concept much of
our<00:00:18.020> difficulty<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.109> understanding<00:00:19.199> the

our difficulty in understanding the
brain<00:00:19.949> has<00:00:20.369> come<00:00:20.789> because<00:00:21.199> we're<00:00:22.199> unable<00:00:22.380> to

including seeing things so we need help
there's<00:00:47.969> no<00:00:48.180> way<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.570> my<00:00:48.750> lab<00:00:49.140> or<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> few

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
there's no way that my lab or a few

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.920 
there's no way that my lab or a few
scientists<00:00:50.100> could<00:00:50.250> do<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.460> all<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.930> that's

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
scientists could do it all and that's

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.340 
scientists could do it all and that's
where<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.559> public<00:00:52.920> comes<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:54.320> have<00:00:55.320> a

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
where the public comes in I have a

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.279 
where the public comes in I have a
question<00:00:56.300> where's<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.510> eggs<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.109> this

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
question where's the eggs on in this

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.490 
question where's the eggs on in this
cell<00:00:58.850> it<00:00:59.850> currently<00:01:00.030> takes<00:01:00.210> us<00:01:00.600> about<00:01:00.930> 50

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
cell it currently takes us about 50

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.369 
cell it currently takes us about 50
hours<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.129> map<00:01:02.309> one<00:01:02.850> cell<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.359> that's<00:01:03.719> one

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
hours to map one cell and that's one

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.950 
hours to map one cell and that's one
neuron<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.920> there<00:01:05.400> are<00:01:05.489> 85<00:01:05.820> billion<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.510> one

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
neuron and there are 85 billion in one

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.800 
neuron and there are 85 billion in one
human<00:01:07.229> brain<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.490> we<00:01:08.970> built<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.240> game<00:01:09.479> out<00:01:09.720> of

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
human brain so we built a game out of

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.520 
human brain so we built a game out of
the<00:01:09.960> task<00:01:10.320> it's<00:01:11.010> like<00:01:11.159> coloring<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:11.970> 3d<00:01:12.530> you're

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the task it's like coloring in 3d you're

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.380 
the task it's like coloring in 3d you're
starting<00:01:13.770> with<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.220> little<00:01:14.460> segment<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.180> little

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
starting with a little segment a little

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.390 
starting with a little segment a little
branch<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.810> one<00:01:15.960> neuron<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.560> your<00:01:16.710> task<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.340> to

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
branch of one neuron and your task is to

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.719 
branch of one neuron and your task is to
find<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.540> other<00:01:18.570> half<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.610> exit<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
find the other half of it to exit the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.760 
find the other half of it to exit the
rest<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.210> cube<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.900> extend<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.530> branch

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
rest of the cube to extend the branch

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.760 
rest of the cube to extend the branch
and<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.340> discover<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.479> overall<00:01:24.930> 3d<00:01:25.350> shape<00:01:25.560> of

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
and to discover the overall 3d shape of

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.819 
and to discover the overall 3d shape of
that<00:01:25.890> cell<00:01:26.159> which<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.150> kind<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:28.110> fun<00:01:28.350> task<00:01:28.590> if

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
that cell which is kind of a fun task if

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.940 
that cell which is kind of a fun task if
you<00:01:28.920> do<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.130> with<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> group<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.579> people<00:01:30.950> it's

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
you do it with a group of people it's

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.440 
you do it with a group of people it's
becoming<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.369> brain<00:01:32.579> scientist<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.270> think

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
becoming a brain scientist I think

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.230 
becoming a brain scientist I think
that's<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.659> bit<00:01:33.810> above<00:01:34.020> my<00:01:34.079> league<00:01:34.590> but<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.280> feel

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
that's a bit above my league but I feel

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.580 
that's a bit above my league but I feel
like<00:01:36.420> I'm<00:01:36.600> actually<00:01:36.810> doing<00:01:37.170> something

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
like I'm actually doing something

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.800 
like I'm actually doing something
positive<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.520> know<00:01:38.610> not<00:01:38.820> just<00:01:39.000> wasting<00:01:39.630> time

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
positive you know not just wasting time

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.230 
positive you know not just wasting time
playing<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.320> game<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.770> know<00:01:41.729> we're<00:01:41.880> all<00:01:41.909> here

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
playing a game you know we're all here

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.940 
playing a game you know we're all here
for<00:01:42.270> pretty<00:01:42.869> much<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.020> same<00:01:43.259> purpose<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.799> to

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
for pretty much the same purpose is to

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.819 
for pretty much the same purpose is to
contribute<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.610> science<00:01:45.350> so<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.680> mean<00:01:46.799> that's

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
contribute to science so I mean that's

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.039 
contribute to science so I mean that's
why<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.189> continue<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.759> play<00:01:47.970> because<00:01:48.210> every

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
why I continue to play because every

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.760 
why I continue to play because every
time<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.470> trace<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.579> cube<00:01:50.880> as<00:01:51.149> its<00:01:51.689> called<00:01:51.899> you

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
time I trace a cube as its called you

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.819 
time I trace a cube as its called you
know<00:01:52.860> its<00:01:53.329> physical<00:01:54.329> actual<00:01:55.110> data<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.680> they

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
know its physical actual data that they

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.300 
know its physical actual data that they
use<00:01:56.570> it's<00:01:57.570> not<00:01:57.780> really<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.020> competition<00:01:58.560> it's

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
use it's not really a competition it's

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.709 
use it's not really a competition it's
probably<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.969> friendliest<00:02:00.390> online

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
probably the friendliest online

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.450 
probably the friendliest online
community<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.829> seen

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.620 

doing<00:02:05.460> things<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.760> labs<00:02:06.030> don't<00:02:06.270> typically

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
doing things that labs don't typically

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.359 
doing things that labs don't typically
do<00:02:06.930> can<00:02:07.290> be<00:02:07.320> extremely<00:02:07.710> rewarding<00:02:07.920> when

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
do can be extremely rewarding when
