00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.349
 dotcom and today we are going to talk about the 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.349
 combination of inspired colors 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.599
 yes 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.579
 I have this combination of values ​​for 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.350
 make a contrast a little more fun 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.839
 and stronger in as much as leaving a little 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.199
 the common can dare you for a dress 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:54.719
 red in full color one more stamped or 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.790
 less flashy not but the midfield 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.530
 inflated and that for time with the 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.710
 colors like for example that has a 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.600
 little white a little pink and you 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.430
 you can add even more color with a 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.619
 big necklace as is one side of the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.409
 stephens mixtures that are the necklaces 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.420
 very large and striking in this case 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.580
 I put on a yellow one to get a 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.289
 little more light and color per year and 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.119
 good is in this case of people with 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.340
 large are yellow also to give 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.890
 more color but has already are a little more 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.560
 pale for her does not appear either a 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.560
 clown and walk around the streets 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.930
 the proposal that you see in the movies 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.120
 in fashion is the color blue like in this 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.000
 case I can translate to our 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.390
 our clothes on the jean shirt 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.400
 shirt 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.200
 that you can combine them with clothes and 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.180
 is neon is another trend 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.460
 comes for next season and there is a 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.510
 little those contrasting the flashy 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.060
 that you can have a neon garment with the 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.290
 classic tone that has a blue garment and 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.290
 as in this case at Christmas 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.200
 i 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.630
 can be put together like these that already have 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.490
 in her closet a flowered blouse like 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.840
 is here with a white town but 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.250
 which also has a pattern of 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.650
 colors a little to make a little more 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.300
 playful with the look and a short like 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.920
 this here half green that has 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.080
 also the same purpose is that the 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.420
 blouse and this can wear it too 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.250
 so much for the day with some black parts 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.770
 and some booties like for the night when 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.100
 the changes like some tacos and another 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.200
 suggestion that you can also have in 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.420
 your closet is a dress like this 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.270
 Asymmetric that is also very fashionable 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.620
 this not only for this this season 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.330
 but you can also use it for 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.770
 summer with a coat a little more 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.120
 colorful and also flowered that is another 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.280
 trend that will continue with 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.709
 us for more seasons more and as 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.440
 we see there is a set of colors that can 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.940
 combine and arm for a very very look 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.820
 nice and different 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.060
 another suggestion if you want to dare 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.490
 To use much more of color is to combine 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.560
 This type of striped sweater with many 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.630
 colors in this case three shades and 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.090
 start with pants of the same tone 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.820
 of the chomba so that it is at the same time a 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.250
 uniform but with a little more color and 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.800
 a little more flashy and fun and to 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.410
 to lower the tone a bit and not 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.180
 be so colorful we can put a 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.640
 white pole as in this case of this 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.819
 side is a basic in all the closets and 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.329
 You can also put it with 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.549
 the shoes of this same tone the same 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.739
 tone of the job and ready has very look 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.659
 that could be useful for some 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.180
 exhibition at the university or also 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:10.799
 could be fused at work a council 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.409
 that I give them so that they expected a little 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:16.410
 more there is a life of colors in this is 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:19.229
 put together a dress that can be a hang 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.239
 whole as I am here we can use it 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.009
 on special occasions now longer 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:27.919
 forward of cute delegates more 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:27.919
 as in the color had a spill 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.670
 whenever he wants 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.220
