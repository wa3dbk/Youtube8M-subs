00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.430
 good to see how much 

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:09.479
 with maximum 

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:12.479
 that's huge in the tourbillon 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.169
 it stays that way 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:29.249
 betting 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.440
 Wolfsburg plays 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.410
 LÃ¶tzsch wanted to give Frank a try 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.780
 Soya now I have here in the branches Mike Wolff aka 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.040
 Percent the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.270
 So two test models that were made available to the forum of the brand 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.260
 celebrate Germany 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.149
 percent 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.889
 Youth chamber for comparison 

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:52.050
 Rotenburg 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.120
 so here 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.280
 Percent like 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.860
 because of insufficient catapult 4 1 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.710
 weekly ration 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.900
 Riemsloh just like that and now as a comparison 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.600
 I activate the Schweighofer 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.240
 the exact differences and youth 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.520
 5 percent 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.520
 looking positively to the right for good 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.640
 yes I would say the club is now well lit. 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.880
 we want to keep 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.300
 Birthday is 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.990
 this is the broad-brimmed Budde ltr further celebration 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.990
 For 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.480
 Prince Albert of Monaco 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.850
 century 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.020
 Jades that's right so I'll switch the percent 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.569
 Brighton spotlights off 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.569
 that's her now 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.329
 Variant the est version while drivers a very 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:19.310
 concentrated 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.869
 like mott 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:23.699
 and Dieter already exactly where the journey goes, what will we have to say then 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.699
 us end 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:38.069
 Percent expected 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.129
 on the left is the brand celebrating now and on the right 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.269
 is already ready 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.269
 to say that we are coming further 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.500
 but that is now the helm with the slightly more concentrated Vienna 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:04.149
 Eva Leuer 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:05.690
 yes be a little chubby 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.690
 on the other hand, the brand celebrates happily 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:17.679
 the professional handball players 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:29.969
 above sec after fallout tourists lighter yellow percent allowed the better 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:33.260
 Recognition following reveals of course objects 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:39.099
 Sulpice to the national team but sometimes Waldemar Kurr closing time 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.429
 uncertain 

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:44.559
 without on the right the brand celebration with the wider beam and 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.599
 on the left by well overlooked 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:48.999
 incalculable 

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:51.999
 is on the left side of the 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:54.999
 the mask their properties fall down 

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:13.709
 meter 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.189
 I'm still missing 

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:18.789
 that's so 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.789
 and so it is Christ 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.270
 but if we are here now briefly in the Nahbereich you see that both 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.030
 so at close range percent at the different different 

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:37.779
 Brightness but both lights close range also good 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:43.449
 positive impulses celebrated spotlight is not only lawyer spotlight but rar 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:44.259
 does too 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:47.740
 ahead where you can see that not covered 2 candlesticks quite cool 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.360
 illuminated 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.330
 So he is probably as united universally with great emphasis then also 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.979
 times 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:01.259
 said so but personally I like the Pride House percent 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.879
 Radiation here clearly better 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:07.089
 expand 

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:08.620
 like unified 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.979
 that's true but overall we did not think so well here because of the customer 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.569
 again lit at any time 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:17.520
 Walter 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.620
 freshers who had already had a party at Krupp 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.770
 easier to believe that Tabasco celebration that means so far so clearly 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:28.259
 Time again the two 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:32.819
 Brighton percent micro outdoor pools have long been the micro celebration with the others 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:34.800
 concentrated bees and right 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.970
 the game a little bit percent 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.849
 I think so too is for Obama 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:41.930
 is wide 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.650
 once the 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.220
 wide Mike Magrum at decay with the broad beam in the bustle around 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.020
 the ones with the concentrated rays 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.020
 So in total in the bar area 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:58.520
 the teachers animal rights Micro Celebration the nose in front I think and think that 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.419
 become 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.430
 Flashlight for the 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.550
 friends 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.550
 of adventure in ruins and boulders 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:09.479
 it is 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:17.569
 we donate where Abbottabad killed help women Â»said Ederer as usual 

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:21.569
 the pressure is increasing 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:24.569
 As always, Breuer is right Manuel does not have to be 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:29.089
 but I say at this point 

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:32.039
 Can we use the Worms test scenario 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:35.389
 Ludger Elsen grabbed sausages eaten Viennese sausages 

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:38.320
 enabled by the jailbreak and the 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.369
 the most different flashlights tested 

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:42.419
 and percent 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:45.330
 I think this is the end of the tournament 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.979
 Make me come out Maya enjoy the view, too 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:50.159
 and 

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:53.449
 later in the forum more 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:55.680
 then inside it is cloudy
