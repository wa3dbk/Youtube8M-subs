00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:11.490
 yes I have a little something now 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.870
 on the tree because I was on the ball and because 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.199
 I still asked a few people 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.810
 had on private message in order to this 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.699
 us shine like I'm doing the wired 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.449
 I will add an extra video and 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.539
 then check it on foot made 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:29.849
 at the left side and that have 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.510
 i here now the brown cable easy 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:37.710
 a cable question does not matter 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.340
 only need to know where to connect 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.870
 caught 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.420
 yes sounds quite normal to this 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.850
 existing lights cabling the colors 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.510
 are exactly the same as the handlebar 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.600
 mountings 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.010
 You can not go wrong 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.199
 also still make it come on 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.020
 the cable thickness the city not that one 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.780
 as a blind yes how did I do that 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.949
 I do not have everything here now 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.189
 connect book 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.060
 this brown cable goes here now 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:12.659
 once the original wiring harness along 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.360
 here are the constance other cables 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.869
 from these blinkers high that's exactly 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.509
 the same colors as on the other 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.509
 blinker then it is hardly too together 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.270
 filmed and for the animals 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.640
 fuse box the sandbox we the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.820
 on it makes sense here zenit.org 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:39.479
 Screw best to use a must 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:41.939
 and here this joint on the battery screwdriver 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.700
 taken faster was that yes there 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.049
 in the back comes in the corner and the 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.490
 to open a screw and a 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.950
 you need extension I have that 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.350
 I made it that way now 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.250
 now here in the original bay clean 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.439
 not ratios stupid'm down here 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.290
 in this original bay rhine where i am 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.830
 me the cables come out in the interior 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:12.120
 have the careful with a wood or 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:15.030
 A brush pierced here so 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.550
 because I would not play it 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.900
 recommend because then you can if you 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.739
 control your cable and then 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.020
 anyway, carrefour sa the lot already 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.200
 forgive the hole because the cable through 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.920
 stuck through and through the mother through 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.370
 and I came out in the interior 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:38.220
 yes then the stand did not have one still 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.970
 So what colors does it have ? 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.130
 page here 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.470
 and this side you have to know 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.680
 what colors does that have i got that 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:54.030
 now found here this is this 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:58.130
 Cable color is gray yellow gray yellow 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:02.370
 feelings and then could the 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:15.690
 planet is here to join the fight 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:19.079
 relations fixed now the original pins 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:22.170
 from a battle harness where i got off 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.329
 compact the original color pinned out 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.100
 and here's a win because that's another one 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.100
 only slot free 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:34.890
 the two cables on it are also with the 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.630
 the pure in the room so here and in the 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.750
 interior I have that now completely 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:43.560
 just done 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:47.400
 because then come out here down there 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.090
 you have to do yourself covered so formula 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.420
 work then I'm up here on this 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.400
 switch already before the rows of seats 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.670
 Of course you have to remember these colors 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.730
 which color yes on which side 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.169
 logs in and then with these colors then 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.000
 I hold join me now have a 4 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:11.320
 worried about the pin 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.130
 she had too attached to that so here is 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.690
 he was right and got the brown one 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:21.459
 cable where the right turn signal comes 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:24.220
 Soldered on one side and the right side 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:30.340
 left with the blue cable coming from 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:32.410
 Signed in on the left side when 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.870
 I do that now is again 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.230
 in his one now make standlight 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.810
 would like to make the us easy with the me 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.450
 sound was now enough for everyone 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.169
 Standlicht and ios running out 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.400
 I turn on us again 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.740
 it can be easily and make their 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.700
 just go from the number one standlight 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.520
 front of 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.560
 So I seen again I 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.090
 These adorn the elaborate variation 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.370
 made because I do not want to have 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.160
 could now also the 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:07.630
 cable tap from mr. front and then 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:10.900
 if necessary, if you have the lettuce 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.910
 I did not want to go here then 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.000
 Can you also without battery box in 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.650
 that needs a bit more cable though 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.430
 I have that solved now if here 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:25.410
 the same in the fighting 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:27.669
 everything not put in it and 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:32.140
 some of them also work 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:35.590
 tidy can be so short 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:37.900
 demonstrate as already said to another 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.570
 video presented what it looks like so 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.530
 that we stand again now 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:50.430
 standlight rings with numbers us light 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:50.430
 is bad 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.500
 So I just make the switch 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:56.500
 out 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:09.419
 one can see the light from lighter 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:11.849
 understandable yes that was now is one 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:18.709
 video on how I installed it now 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:21.439
 I have to ask otherwise now 

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:26.580
 just let me know 

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:30.559
 and then I wish you a nice day 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.559
 and goodbye service
