00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:06.390
 Today I check the sho-me radar detector 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.880
 g800 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.530
 This radar detector is equipped 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.230
 With the gps module, I set a function in it 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.170
 muting speed well I'm fast fumes 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.910
 speeds of 60 kilometers per hour and puja 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.930
 the radar detector detects plays 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.230
 my speed 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.359
 if I'm traveling at a speed lower than 60 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.460
 kilometers per hour 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:33.300
 radar detector detects signals 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.579
 radar but the voice does not scream introduces 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.739
 radar information only on display as 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.239
 only I invite the threshold of 60 kilometers to 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.840
 an hour he starts to serve about seven 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.070
 far ahead of me there on viaducts 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.690
 there is a radar complex which 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.210
 called the arrow 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.640
 Now I will go to him and watch 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:01:02.430
 how work 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:04.860
 radar detectors are not just that 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.070
 the radar detector display has a signal 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.740
 camera 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:14.920
 as I travel at low speed 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.479
 there is no sound in the room yes the camera was 300 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.820
 meters that is 300 meters 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.080
 radar detector sho-me g800 discovered 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.180
 radar complex arrow 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.100
 I continue to keep it just a yacht 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.619
 Gagarin to watch 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.619
 darta sector for false positives 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.990
 the radar detector swore that I was going with 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.990
 speeds above 60 kilometers per hour 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.360
 spurious signal detected 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.180
 basically x range 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.000
 function is a disconnectable signal in this 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.750
 range in this kind of waiting sector 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.750
 can be disabled 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:21.700
 another false alarm in the range 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:21.700
 from lower speed below 60 gone 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.590
 it can already be concluded that the function 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.959
 mute and sound alerts 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.180
 certain threshold speed function 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.280
 very helpful 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.280
 another drawdown in the false range 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.400
 another false positive 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.620
 ir range 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.030
 for all of this range disable it 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:52.410
 Once the speed threshold is set, it does not give 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.410
 sound alerts are two 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.790
 another false trigger is worth 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.299
 notice that last time I shot a video 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:07.870
 test hydrogen detector sho-me 535 series 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:10.180
 pp exactly in this place it is exactly the same 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.830
 In general, it worked incomprehensible that he was yelling 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.630
 dalgren 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.989
 Apparently there is some kind of radiation in 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.690
 whether this place since show me all 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.970
 it turns out react to the unknown 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.890
 a source 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.260
 again picked up speed a little over 60 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.060
 kilometers per hour 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.459
 send alert attention reduce 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.950
 speed, in principle, I can say that it is 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.950
 already starting to bother 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.980
 i'm at the crossroads of the avenue 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.040
 Lenin and Komsomol highway 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.750
 check the radar detector sho-me g800 on 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.019
 detectable radar 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:05.290
 Chris complex far ahead 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:07.290
 there there is a road junction with me 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:12.430
 Now I ’m coming here almost invisible 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:15.280
 chris system is located before this system 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.760
 to this camera about five hundred meters 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.620
 six hundred 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.680
 I will move in parallel 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.680
 Komsomol highway 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.790
 radar detected 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.210
 detection distance of meters 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.850
 there is 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.530
 the display is displayed to 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.970
 Unfortunately not screaming voice chamber 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:46.490
 because I connected this function for 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.979
 objectivity of the system test 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:53.230
 grateful chris system I'll go over 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:05:17.410
 Komsomol 6 again under this camera 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:05:22.240
 the camera is detected this time with 100 already 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:23.410
 much better result is 600 meters in 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.530
 detecting chris 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:30.130
 city ​​conditions normal good 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:33.310
 result for radar detector on the basis of 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.380
 of today's departure with walked know how g800 i 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.050
 I can conclude that this radar 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.350
 the detector catches the camera very well 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.850
 radar gai 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.770
 standard conventional camera and camera 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.200
 arrow and at the same time false signals 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.630
 filters very well bye 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.300
 cook a little with the manual to read 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.860
 instruction to withstand all settings as 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.970
 should and prices 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.970
 this unit will not
