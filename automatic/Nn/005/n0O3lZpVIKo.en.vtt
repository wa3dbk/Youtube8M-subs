00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
futuristic car obviously it calls DW

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.060 
futuristic car obviously it calls DW
because<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.809> Dan<00:00:36.960> Wheldon<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.500> late<00:00:37.860> then

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
because of Dan Wheldon the late then

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.490 
because of Dan Wheldon the late then
well<00:00:38.250> then<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.520> good<00:00:38.700> friend<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.000> mine<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.210> he

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
well then a good friend of mine and he

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.959 
well then a good friend of mine and he
develop<00:00:40.500> developed<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> car<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.820> car

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
develop developed the car and the car

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.959 
develop developed the car and the car
has<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.350> this<00:00:43.350> new<00:00:43.710> aerodynamic<00:00:44.070> which<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
has a this new aerodynamic which is the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.119 
has a this new aerodynamic which is the
ground<00:00:45.210> effect<00:00:45.629> it's<00:00:45.870> extremely<00:00:46.590> efficient

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
ground effect it's extremely efficient

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.819 
ground effect it's extremely efficient
so<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.850> has<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> lot<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.390> downforce<00:00:48.829> hopefully

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
so it has a lot of downforce hopefully

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.410 
so it has a lot of downforce hopefully
you<00:00:49.920> guys<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.309> will<00:00:50.399> play<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.789> game<00:00:51.000> will<00:00:51.180> feel

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
you guys it will play the game will feel

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.939 
you guys it will play the game will feel
the<00:00:51.449> same<00:00:51.780> way<00:00:51.960> with<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.500> race<00:00:52.649> track

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
the same way with you in the race track

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.279 
the same way with you in the race track
and<00:00:52.980> it's<00:00:53.760> one<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.329> most<00:00:54.480> safest<00:00:54.960> cars

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
and it's one of the most safest cars

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.130 
and it's one of the most safest cars
they<00:00:56.160> build<00:00:56.460> for<00:00:57.000> over<00:00:57.270> racing<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.870> all

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
they build for over racing so I all

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.810 
they build for over racing so I all
become<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.129> grand<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.430> fact<00:00:59.579> thing<00:00:59.699> is

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
become so that grand in fact thing is

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.310 
become so that grand in fact thing is
almost<00:01:00.059> inspired<00:01:00.480> by<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.660> kind<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.960> golden

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
almost inspired by the kind of golden

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.680 
almost inspired by the kind of golden
era<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.530> f1<00:01:01.949> right<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> 80s<00:01:02.609> exactly<00:01:03.570> i<00:01:03.600> mean

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
era of f1 right the 80s exactly i mean

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.140 
era of f1 right the 80s exactly i mean
obviously<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.470> try<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.040> get<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.519> regulations

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
obviously we try to get the regulations

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.120 
obviously we try to get the regulations
and<00:01:06.450> limit<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.140> regulations<00:01:07.740> because<00:01:07.890> of

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
and limit the regulations because of

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.520 
and limit the regulations because of
course<00:01:08.430> but<00:01:08.729> that's<00:01:08.939> like<00:01:09.659> back<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.200> 80s

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
course but that's like back in the 80s

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.280 
course but that's like back in the 80s
and<00:01:10.680> 90s<00:01:10.710> informal<00:01:11.549> one<00:01:11.729> when<00:01:11.909> they<00:01:12.689> couldn't

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
and 90s informal one when they couldn't

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.810 
and 90s informal one when they couldn't
do<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> lot<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.070> suspension<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.729> they

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
do a lot of the suspension and they

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.940 
do a lot of the suspension and they
started<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.840> build<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.140> ground<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.439> fat<00:01:16.650> cars

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
started to build a ground of fat cars

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.850 
started to build a ground of fat cars
and<00:01:17.220> ours<00:01:17.880> are<00:01:17.909> exactly<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.689> same<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
and ours are exactly the same and the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.710 
and ours are exactly the same and the
car<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.159> amazing<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:21.060> do<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.210> play<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> lot<00:01:21.600> of

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.200 
do and actually the team actually owns a
couple<00:01:27.720> simulators<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.619> we<00:01:28.770> do<00:01:28.890> not<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.490> you

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
couple simulators so we do not just you

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.760 
couple simulators so we do not just you
know<00:01:30.240> driving<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.960> learn<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.320> race<00:01:31.470> tracks

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
know driving to learn the race tracks

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.370 
know driving to learn the race tracks
but<00:01:31.950> also<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.759> drive<00:01:33.030> with<00:01:33.450> our<00:01:33.659> engineers<00:01:34.229> on

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
but also we drive with our engineers on

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.710 
but also we drive with our engineers on
the<00:01:34.500> side<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.100> we'll<00:01:35.970> make<00:01:36.090> changes<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.630> we

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the side and we'll make changes and we

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.469 
the side and we'll make changes and we
take<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.290> racetrack<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.979> right<00:01:38.220> now

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
take that to the racetrack so right now

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.530 
take that to the racetrack so right now
simulation<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.740> almost<00:01:41.119> taking<00:01:42.119> fifty

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
simulation is almost taking fifty

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.539 
simulation is almost taking fifty
percent<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.110> testing<00:01:43.560> away<00:01:43.799> from<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
percent of the testing away from the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.980 
percent of the testing away from the
track<00:01:44.790> because<00:01:45.119> it's<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> stupas<00:01:45.780> way<00:01:45.930> you

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
track because it's the stupas way you

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.569 
track because it's the stupas way you
can<00:01:46.229> crash<00:01:46.439> as<00:01:46.590> much<00:01:46.770> as<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.040> want<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.310> can

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
can crash as much as you want you can

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.639 
can crash as much as you want you can
test<00:01:48.240> as<00:01:48.479> much<00:01:48.659> as<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.899> want<00:01:49.079> much<00:01:49.380> quicker

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
test as much as you want much quicker

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.920 
test as much as you want much quicker
making<00:01:50.130> changes<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:51.420> know<00:01:51.509> it's<00:01:51.689> been<00:01:51.899> a

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
making changes and you know it's been a

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.840 
making changes and you know it's been a
I<00:01:52.320> think<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.159> going<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.640> future

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
I think this is going to be the future

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.959 
I think this is going to be the future
of<00:01:54.140> open<00:01:55.140> wheel<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.500> not<00:01:55.680> just<00:01:55.950> an<00:01:56.369> IndyCar

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
of open wheel and not just an IndyCar

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.420 
of open wheel and not just an IndyCar
