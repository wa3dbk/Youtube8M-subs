00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.610
 well up here we talk about our 

00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:06.400
 champion our young world champion 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:09.160
 chess world youth champion 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.990
 alan pichot we know a little more 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.610
 I have arrived in Argentina after having 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.390
 obtained that youth world championship 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.689
 in Durban in South Africa with less than 15 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.900
 I was an international teacher here 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:25.539
 we are talking about a promise I already 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.369
 I would say with 16 years is a reality 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.960
 We have the theme that you lost, you saw what 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.880
 that is what life is, we know more 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.570
 it seems good to share them over 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.570
 alan pichot 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.630
 the championship 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.490
 what came out the best is to be able to leave 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.390
 very happy to visit 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:47.200
 because you were the sixth prize 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.520
 It was no longer easy to waste eleven game 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.890
 classes before playing the sixth 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.360
 classified the tournament and that's why it was already 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.579
 very difficult to finish the first 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.899
 but good posts came out of the best 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.000
 way and very happy by result 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.100
 they say that you have a lot of temperance for 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.350
 that won because you lost the game the 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.479
 penultimate game and yet you re 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.159
 you were glad you russo that centuries 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.990
 then I lost the penultimate round that 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.490
 it was a tremendous round for me it was 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.560
 very angry because I wanted to win the 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.909
 heading to be in the best shape but 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.440
 good person can replenish me and 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.340
 end up winning less that was amazing 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.619
 in these 10 years 11 years as as you 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.759
 you were forming good the truth to measure 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.830
 what was happening time let's say 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.420
 studying enough with capacity the 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.460
 true that I was able to get ahead of the 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.960
 better way and good can this come 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.030
 result that is a unique thing in the 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.929
 history not studying who who was 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:39.080
 his navadorf capablanca master in 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.820
 argentina wifi remained as some 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.410
 let's say chess, but 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.630
 my teachers helped me a lot 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.220
 throughout my goal so that they are not 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.200

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.030
 they helped at all times to 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.520
 to finish well the tournament knew that 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.649
 22 years that there was not a world champion 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.479

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.530
