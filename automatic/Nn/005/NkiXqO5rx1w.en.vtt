00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.910
 recipe for where we do not go missing at 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.710
 lemon this is actually having a 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.090
 grated apple gave it a unique taste to 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.029
 this apple pie you will see 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.679
 try it off so we started 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.660
 peel apples from everything 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:27.699
 just a few 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.779
 do not believe in home we will skid we did not 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:29.800
 no need to remove seeds warning 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.460
 has turned around the apple must 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:38.800
 stop at the heart level we added 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:41.380
 two years organic lemon if possible against 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.660
 summer after harvest this is going to give 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.750
 the coolness to the tarts tac tac tac 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:51.870
 here we will add the juice will leave it 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.870
 go fast and it blacks okay that's it 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.720
 we're going to mix that it 's poor con 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:06.909
 lemon then the device and have you 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:08.890
 the simple traits of sugar you can 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:14.590
 not sugar brown sugar too so we 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:17.729
 whiten we add the melted butter 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.090
 so I pour the device on the apples 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.960
 it's greedy 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.479
 yes basis tunis mix well impregnated 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.649
 All the school I love for me 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.600
 I will also put a little bit of 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:33.310
 brown sugar over the threatened 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.149
 wood stove do that we'll put it to 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.229
 pie background 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:41.039
 we will sprinkle lightly with sugar 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.579
 brown sugar so that it caramelizes the 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.560
 that's what I like 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.049
 we appreciate heat oven to 180 Â° 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.310
 and we'll cook it for 45 to 50 minutes or 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.950
 really qatar be well well 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.049
 candied and very crispy to 2 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.060
 spread before for us only 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.950
 made a map that changes a bit of 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.590
 traditional apple pies a loss 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.029
 with grated apple and especially especially that 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.350
 really a very very different from going 

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:04.350
 see the second is really unique
