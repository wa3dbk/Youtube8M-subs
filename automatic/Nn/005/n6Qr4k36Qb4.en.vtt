we're gonna review the Moshi I glaze xt
this<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:08.910> one<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.090> our<00:00:09.300> favorite<00:00:09.780> clear<00:00:10.110> cases

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
this is one of our favorite clear cases

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.249 
this is one of our favorite clear cases
for<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.130> iPhone<00:00:11.160> 6<00:00:11.940> thing<00:00:12.630> we<00:00:12.780> really<00:00:13.080> like

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
for the iPhone 6 thing we really like

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.709 
for the iPhone 6 thing we really like
about<00:00:13.290> this<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:14.009> with<00:00:14.549> clear<00:00:15.059> cases<00:00:15.330> they're

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
about this is with clear cases they're

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.359 
about this is with clear cases they're
very<00:00:15.900> prone<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.350> get<00:00:16.500> scratches<00:00:17.070> with<00:00:17.250> the

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
very prone to get scratches with the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.429 
very prone to get scratches with the
glossy<00:00:17.760> plastic<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.510> lots<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.840> brands<00:00:19.199> use

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
glossy plastic that lots of brands use

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.519 
glossy plastic that lots of brands use
it<00:00:19.949> scratches<00:00:20.580> very<00:00:20.609> easily<00:00:21.140> but<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.350> is

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
it scratches very easily but this is

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.410 
it scratches very easily but this is
made<00:00:22.740> with<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.070> scratch<00:00:23.400> resistant<00:00:24.150> plastic

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
made with the scratch resistant plastic

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.980 
made with the scratch resistant plastic
I<00:00:24.900> don't<00:00:25.289> know<00:00:25.380> how<00:00:25.710> exactly<00:00:25.920> they<00:00:26.490> do<00:00:26.550> that

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
I don't know how exactly they do that

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.269 
I don't know how exactly they do that
but<00:00:27.990> we've<00:00:28.140> tried<00:00:28.470> all<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.830> different<00:00:28.859> clear

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
but we've tried all the different clear

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.980 
but we've tried all the different clear
cases<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:29.970> has<00:00:30.179> definitely<00:00:30.630> held<00:00:30.810> up

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
cases and this has definitely held up

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.060 
cases and this has definitely held up
the<00:00:31.199> best<00:00:31.380> as<00:00:31.710> far<00:00:31.740> as<00:00:32.270> scratch<00:00:33.270> resistance

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
the best as far as scratch resistance

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.860 
the best as far as scratch resistance
Moshi<00:00:35.070> also<00:00:35.520> makes<00:00:35.730> hard<00:00:36.000> shell<00:00:36.210> cases<00:00:36.450> for

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
Moshi also makes hard shell cases for

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.709 
Moshi also makes hard shell cases for
MacBooks<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:37.710> they<00:00:37.829> put<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> lot<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.940> lot

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
MacBooks and so they put a lot of a lot

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.350 
MacBooks and so they put a lot of a lot
of<00:00:39.870> research<00:00:40.440> into<00:00:40.879> plastic<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.090> much

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
of research into plastic that is much

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.840 
of research into plastic that is much
more<00:00:42.570> scratch<00:00:42.930> resistant<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.800> as<00:00:44.430> we've<00:00:44.640> seen

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
more scratch resistant and as we've seen

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.910 
more scratch resistant and as we've seen
with<00:00:45.030> their<00:00:45.149> MacBook<00:00:45.390> cases<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.320> definitely

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
with their MacBook cases this definitely

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.889 
with their MacBook cases this definitely
fits<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.579> test<00:00:47.820> as<00:00:48.000> well<00:00:48.210> as<00:00:48.390> far<00:00:48.600> as<00:00:48.690> being

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
fits the test as well as far as being

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.600 
fits the test as well as far as being
scratch<00:00:49.260> resistant<00:00:49.860> we've<00:00:49.980> got<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> guy<00:00:50.370> here

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
scratch resistant we've got a guy here

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.819 
scratch resistant we've got a guy here
using<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.120> has<00:00:51.840> used<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.230> case<00:00:52.469> since<00:00:52.739> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
using it has used this case since the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.439 
using it has used this case since the
iPhone<00:00:52.949> 6<00:00:53.399> came<00:00:53.640> out<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.059> really<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.420> looks

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
iPhone 6 came out and really it looks

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.930 
iPhone 6 came out and really it looks
brand<00:00:54.930> new<00:00:55.079> which<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:55.920> very<00:00:56.190> rare<00:00:56.399> for<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.640> clear

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
brand new which is very rare for a clear

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.670 
brand new which is very rare for a clear
case<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.480> just<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.750> clear<00:00:57.960> snap-on<00:00:58.440> case

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
case so it's just a clear snap-on case

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.920 
case so it's just a clear snap-on case
like<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.039> saw<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.250> just<00:00:59.550> snap<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.750> also

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
like you saw I just snap that on it also

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.750 
like you saw I just snap that on it also
has<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.379> raised<00:01:01.590> bezel<00:01:01.890> it's<00:01:02.250> just<00:01:02.460> slight

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
has the raised bezel it's just slight

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.579 
has the raised bezel it's just slight
but<00:01:03.300> just<00:01:03.570> enough<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:03.899> it's<00:01:04.199> going<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.439> keep

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
but just enough that it's going to keep

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.980 
but just enough that it's going to keep
the<00:01:04.769> screen<00:01:05.129> off<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:06.060> table<00:01:06.479> if<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.689> lay<00:01:06.840> it

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the screen off the table if you lay it

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.620 
the screen off the table if you lay it
face<00:01:07.229> down<00:01:07.290> or<00:01:07.740> even<00:01:07.770> if<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.189> drops<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.390> lands

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
face down or even if it drops and lands

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.240 
face down or even if it drops and lands
facedown<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.380> gonna<00:01:10.530> provide<00:01:10.830> some<00:01:11.040> good

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
facedown it's gonna provide some good

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.880 
facedown it's gonna provide some good
protection<00:01:11.670> comes<00:01:12.659> up<00:01:12.900> around<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.439> corners

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
protection comes up around the corners

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.429 
protection comes up around the corners
so<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.159> will<00:01:14.310> protect<00:01:14.729> as<00:01:14.939> far<00:01:15.150> as<00:01:15.240> drops<00:01:15.509> go<00:01:15.810> it

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
so it will protect as far as drops go it

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.230 
so it will protect as far as drops go it
has<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.979> full<00:01:17.159> camera<00:01:17.580> cutout<00:01:17.820> you're<00:01:18.119> not

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
has the full camera cutout you're not

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.179 
has the full camera cutout you're not
gonna<00:01:18.360> have<00:01:18.509> any<00:01:18.630> flash<00:01:18.960> problems<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.799> it

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
gonna have any flash problems and it

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.070 
gonna have any flash problems and it
does<00:01:20.340> come<00:01:20.580> up<00:01:20.610> enough<00:01:21.360> around<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:21.840> edge

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
does come up enough around this edge

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.080 
does come up enough around this edge
that<00:01:22.320> if<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.530> lands<00:01:22.860> down<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:23.670> still<00:01:23.850> not

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
that if it lands down it's still not

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.520 
that if it lands down it's still not
going<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.450> hit<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.750> edge<00:01:24.930> even<00:01:25.170> though<00:01:25.409> that

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
going to hit that edge even though that

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.469 
going to hit that edge even though that
is<00:01:25.680> exposed<00:01:26.159> which<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:26.820> kind<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.150> like<00:01:27.299> that

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
is exposed which we kind of like that

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.880 
is exposed which we kind of like that
it's<00:01:27.630> exposed<00:01:28.020> because<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.350> allows<00:01:28.560> for

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
it's exposed because it allows for

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.280 
it's exposed because it allows for
easier<00:01:29.610> access<00:01:29.759> for<00:01:30.030> docking<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:31.259> a

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
easier access for docking and for a

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.200 
easier access for docking and for a
headphone<00:01:31.710> jack<00:01:31.770> as<00:01:32.490> far<00:01:32.729> as<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.939> buttons

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
headphone jack as far as the buttons

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.810 
headphone jack as far as the buttons
here<00:01:33.360> go<00:01:33.570> they're<00:01:33.810> fully<00:01:34.049> accessible<00:01:34.700> your<00:01:35.700> on

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
here go they're fully accessible your on

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.730 
here go they're fully accessible your on
and<00:01:36.000> off<00:01:36.119> as<00:01:36.390> well<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.320> good<00:01:37.470> clear
