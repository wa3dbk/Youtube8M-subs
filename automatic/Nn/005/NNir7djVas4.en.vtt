00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.620
 so all the rules 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.160
 and you about it so I already know they can become 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.830
 on topic 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:07.720
 and nothing to do 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:08.930
 it is an orchid, and in general we fly to and yet 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.460
 want 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:18.310
 chaos and the idea gave only out not to consider 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:23.690
 the end of the world will in the world to 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:26.210
 nights and still think what you would like 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.350
 make your last day and you all 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.710
 nothing is equal to it 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.580
 all sorts of madness all that, but I would 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.910
 robbed the store and the birth of a boy 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.820
 operetta 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.310
 Well, I always wanted to 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.209

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:50.160
 desire and pressed 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.680
 that all my desire is so insane I 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.430

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.530

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.470

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.810
 strange metaphor for not doing well 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.810

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.980

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.840
