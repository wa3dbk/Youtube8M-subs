00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.130
This is a simplified guide to the meaning
and use of Expect values as provided by BLAST,

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.960
the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool at NCBI.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.980
I’ll start with about the simplest possible
description 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.919
of what an Expect, or E-value, is.

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:22.919
The number of BLAST hits you expect to see
by chance.

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:28.809
To be more correct I’ll add, with the observed
score or higher. And a hit, here, is simply

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:30.099
an alignment.

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.109
Let’s say you have BLAST alignments with
E-values around 1.

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:40.210
Our definition tells is that some of these
alignments could easily be due to chance.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.710
This BLAST search also produced an alignment
with an E-value of 2e-61. You expect to see

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.710
that alignment 2x10-61 times by chance; in
other words, it’s not random. A common interpretation

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.289
is that if the alignment is not due to chance,
then it may be due to a biologically meaningful

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.319
relationship between the two sequences.

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:08.750
Does a low E-value like this prove that the
two sequences are homologous? No. BLAST does

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.860
not measure homology, but you might infer
homology from good alignments like this.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.340
Another common question is, how low an E-value
do I need to say that two sequences are related

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:28.340
biologically? There is no single answer, because
E-values depend on query and database lengths.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:35.390
At NCBI we use a cutoff of 1x10-6 for some
internal processes using blastp against the

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:41.079
BLAST nr database, but that may be too restrictive
for your purposes.

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:46.909
So, the primary use for E-values is to help
answer the question, “Is this alignment

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.439
meaningful?” Another use is to limit your
BLAST output by setting an E-value threshold.

00:01:53.439 --> 00:02:00.439
If you only want to see results with E-values
better than, say, 1x10-6, then enter 1e-6

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.020
in the threshold text box.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:11.020
Finally, since my example is in blastp, I
have to mention compositional adjustments.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.630
These statistical calculations are applied
by default to provide more accurate E-values

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.910
based on the amino-acid composition of the
two sequences being compared. Use the help

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.810
In the separate video - Expect values, part
2 - I’ll answer some common questions about

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.050
E-values that we get at NCBI.
