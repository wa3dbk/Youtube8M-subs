00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello you love today again 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.080
 a small video room in the pc favorites 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.080
 in the month of july 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.620
 yes I have a few this time again 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.770
 things I find great find 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.230
 actually, only five resp 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.850
 6 things and I want you now 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.279
 like to imagine going back to the 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.449
 Products that means decorative cosmetics 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.980
 and care products 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.449
 I'm still a bit hot but me 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.189
 I am sick but I want the video 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.929
 Nevertheless, now I am starting for you 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.540
 with a shower gel that is from 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.430
 origins source that vanilla in prestbury 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.380
 Duschgel I do not have those before 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.300
 I saw with Carina in Duisburg 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.320
 food was from the canal carina weigh world 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.120
 Do you know maybe I have that 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.649
 discovered because she said that rich totally 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.590
 good and you already are him then too 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.120
 from nike the vegan symbol on it and you 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.520
 also say that they only to themselves 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.809
 test it and I also have internet 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.969
 read the really good 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.640
 reviews and stuff and it smells 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.859
 really the right raspberry vanilla 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.750
 ice cream so that's what I want 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.550
 eating if you could eat that too 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.070
 a lot for really delicious for the people 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.540
 very sweet scents do not like or 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.890
 artificial it probably is 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.750
 nothing because it is already very much 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.880
 crass though they say that even 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.110
 they shag the natural things 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.270
 also the ingredients relatively natural 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.100
 I can not say much about that 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.330
 I'm just not an analyst for that matter 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.890
 but I have that very much 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.290
 I like to use super 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.640
 The dish is just so delicious 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.740
 many more should now 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.680
 at the dm it does not tear down the two 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.900
 euro 25 yes in any case very 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.090
 also recommended your recommendations 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.030
 I bought an eyeliner with it 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.530
 had this beauty insider eyeliner 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.119
 I think that's called p2 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.259
 Tried you have told me that 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.970
 is not so good by should still be with 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.220
 try out that is the cut 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.890
 Riesling dressed 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.480
 in color 10 dating show black and the 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.640
 is really good that is not 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.010
 waterproof but can be applied to so 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.660
 Wear and it happens to me too 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:58.130
 the stroked her totally pack and the 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.210
 Everything is definitely good and 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.950
 I can hardly do that for him 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.620
 So that's really very thin 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.200
 so I think that is 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.660
 Foam yes and put for very 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.250
 just apply if you lubricate 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.150
 it also leaves relatively well again 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.710
 brush 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.960
 He is definitely very good there 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.670
 also the color is off and waterproof 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.200
 but still not as important 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.970
 that the phone is simple because of this 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.070
 Other of the beauty insider is the one 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.900
 Gray at all because you take the halt 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.550
 it has water tight but one 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.860
 remains has at all eyelashes so hang 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.510
 and then give it to manni mascara 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.790
 everything is already glued and 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.860
 the totally terrible so it up 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.330
 in any case , the cost of the recommended 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.190
 I believe around three or four euros 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.390
 I think 375 euros I have for it 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.900
 I do not quite remember 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.580
 exactly the next product is also from 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.290
 patrice is the beauty rib smuda 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.930
 I do not know if he is now in the 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.670
 thumb assortment is or is in the middle 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.110
 In any case, these are two varieties 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.760
 I did not buy that anymore 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.510
 the last lights have seized away 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.830
 that's once the 20 apricot cream the 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.640
 I also just on the lips and 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.530
 that's the 30 cake pops in pink tone 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.769
 and I find both of the providers on 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.360
 the lips yes street and so far 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.370
 Spread like pleasant on the lips 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.690
 is practically as a donor with the 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.880
 foam thing so pretty much 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.080
 like the one from claras I have 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.269
 but never tried because of here 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.790
 try and so I think as shit 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.799
 that's why it gets pretty satisfied 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.450
 i like the feeling first okay 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.830
 and then I feel like that 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.690
 lips tied a little bit every so me 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.280
 that definitely makes you happy and 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.950
 is also much cheaper I think 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.160
 the cost nomi 23 euro so the next 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.989
 Product from the field of decorative 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.000
 Cosmetic is she eating solitude 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.560
 eyeshadow palette and of that I have 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.700
 also just that make up at the moment 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.910
 when I put on my makeup I eyeshadow 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.560
 me with that because I am 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.540
 and just sick and I'm almost too 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.610
 At home, why should I please myself 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.840
 makeup 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.940
 which is very very nice in any case 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.410
 because she has really great colors especially 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.220
 I think that color is really nice here 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.930
 i would say that roberto and 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.190
 I like to shut my eyes 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.140
 Make up and I think that's really nice 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.730
 and then I became that too 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.140
 Eventual kick that to buy what 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.670
 Can the one who said that very much 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.170
 happy with the pigmentation and such 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.030
 But there was already on the channel of 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.519
 Katie Kate saw that she was so great 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.989
 finds and ingredients it is 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.670
 also vegan that is definitely 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.040
 no fireplace in it you like bees 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.900
 something kempa animal is the same 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.220
 Incidentally, this also applies to the cat products 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.660
 they do not say that things 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.670
 but started because you can stop the 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.200
 ingredients look tvs are free 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.850
 the things yes there is in any case also 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.300
 a few movies have not been that way 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.700
 expensive 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.200
 as well as 23 euros I think it costs 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.190
 In any case very beautiful colors too 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.240
 very well frequented 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.950
 Now I have a something 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.420
 unusual favorites for you you 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.000
 you probably wonder what the hell 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.830
 is that the swimmer was fit 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.290
 many have heard that is a kind 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.750
 the cock away him with the wax but 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.310
 is just much friendlier and friendlier 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.050
 very natural because you fit these 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.290
 can make sugar yourself 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.910
 lemon juice and some water and so on 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.350
 I just did my experiments 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.700
 something is not so good on the leg 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.770
 I have blown blue spots of 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.930
 But most of all, you get the axles 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.910
 I achieved and am successful with it 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.460
 Now have rest for two weeks now 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.250
 had shaved and so slowly now 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.480
 Growing grows that was just after 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.870
 and there you have to wait 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.430
 some longer than that can look away 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.680
 but also the application for me totally 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.150
 easy recipe there is an age there 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.290
 Thousands on youtube I have there too 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.460
 first I tried it but that was 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.500
 then the third portions then 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.450
 really worked the way it can 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.090
 one uses with this mending technique 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:36.240
 So practically against the against the 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:39.750
 Write a hair and then a hair 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.370
 train so under white or with fleece 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.840
 towels but the dinner on and strokes 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.090
 that for example was warm and that 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.860
 grow these shillings fit 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.009
 becomes more fluid then 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.520
 i do that well live with reese 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:52.620
 cloths 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.389
 I 'll do it to a combination like that 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.819
 Look so long until the masses are so soft 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:59.430
 is that I can not look at her anymore 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:01.229
 and then I use a lot of books and 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.969
 that was very good in any case 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:04.560
 Good experience with me because I have too 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:07.500
 ever waxed under the arms but 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.500
 and how did the mega hurt with 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.000
 Running around like that for days and that 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.229
 somehow not so sense of the thing and 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.909
 that is essential in any case 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:16.710
 more comfortable because of the with the 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:17.969
 growth direction are pulled out so 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.169
 I happened to grow up against them 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:22.349
 mine prefers the growth direction 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:23.879
 out and that is definitely great and 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:26.129
 so nothing costs a bit 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:28.139
 Sugar and lemon juice is not really 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:30.060
 To make it so expensive is fast too 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:31.979
 It is necessary to practice a bit 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.569
 But that was the favorite for this one 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:35.009
 month, besides, I do not have you 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:37.430
 shown that I brush this 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:39.990
 bought that is from just this 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.340
 kabuki brush I think in any case 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.169
 Great for everything together yet 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.699
 bit to blind I use yes 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:46.379
 currently no make up and me 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:51.089
 actually do not use powder only 

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:52.379
 the things keep the blush and contour 

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:54.330
 powder so that fund is this 

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:56.009
 palette and everything around it all 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.930
 I think that's good 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:59.789

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.589
 satisfied 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.930
