actually printing new books and sending
them<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.410> me<00:02:55.560> as<00:02:55.710> opposed<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.340> saving<00:02:57.150> up<00:02:57.300> the

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
them to me as opposed to saving up the

them to me as opposed to saving up the
returns<00:02:57.840> over<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.230> course<00:02:58.530> of<00:02:58.680> three<00:02:58.920> months

or<00:02:59.400> whatever<00:02:59.520> and<00:02:59.910> then<00:03:00.060> sending<00:03:00.420> them<00:03:00.480> back

and<00:03:01.080> that<00:03:01.710> makes<00:03:01.980> sense<00:03:02.070> with<00:03:02.460> the<00:03:02.490> business

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
and that makes sense with the business
