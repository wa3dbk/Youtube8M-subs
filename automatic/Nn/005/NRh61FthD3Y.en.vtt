the second class of year and which is
which<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.680> small<00:01:01.920> consolation<00:01:02.460> now<00:01:03.330> when<00:01:03.510> we

and you know the newest make 21 which we

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.760 
and you know the newest make 21 which we
have<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.560> they're<00:01:28.770> close<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.220> 30<00:01:29.460> years<00:01:30.770> old

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
have and they're close to 30 years old

now turning all the machinery turning

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.250 
now turning all the machinery turning
oil<00:01:38.190> is<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.610> reason<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.970> such<00:01:39.750> crushes

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
oil is that the reason that such crushes

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.180 
oil is that the reason that such crushes
are<00:01:40.380> happening<00:01:40.680> though<00:01:40.800> it's<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.100> the

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
are happening though it's just the

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
are happening though it's just the
