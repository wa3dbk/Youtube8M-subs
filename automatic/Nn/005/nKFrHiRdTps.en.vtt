00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.100 

so<00:01:26.890> from<00:01:27.160> sidon<00:01:27.430> you<00:01:27.940> can<00:01:28.090> see<00:01:28.330> that<00:01:28.570> side<00:01:28.930> on

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.840 

with<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.600> chop<00:02:17.230> stroke<00:02:17.680> you'll<00:02:18.340> notice<00:02:18.670> that

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
with the chop stroke you'll notice that

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.390 
with the chop stroke you'll notice that
when<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.510> ball<00:02:19.660> comes<00:02:19.840> faster<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.560> Jeff<00:02:20.800> his

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
when the ball comes faster to Jeff his

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.760 
when the ball comes faster to Jeff his
stroke<00:02:21.730> will<00:02:21.940> be<00:02:22.090> more<00:02:22.630> vertical<00:02:23.170> because<00:02:23.590> he

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
stroke will be more vertical because he

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.710 
stroke will be more vertical because he
doesn't<00:02:24.040> need<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.670> forward<00:02:25.060> momentum<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.600> get

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
doesn't need the forward momentum to get

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.500 
doesn't need the forward momentum to get
the<00:02:25.810> ball<00:02:25.959> over<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.260> net<00:02:27.030> when<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.180> ball<00:02:28.330> is

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
the ball over the net when the ball is

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.479 
the ball over the net when the ball is
coming<00:02:29.200> a<00:02:29.470> little<00:02:29.770> bit<00:02:29.890> slower

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
coming a little bit slower

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.090 
coming a little bit slower
Jeff's<00:02:30.850> stroke<00:02:31.209> will<00:02:31.390> come<00:02:31.600> out<00:02:31.780> forward<00:02:32.500> to

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
Jeff's stroke will come out forward to

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.690 
Jeff's stroke will come out forward to
push<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.520> ball<00:02:33.640> over<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.120> net<00:02:34.239> more<00:02:35.550> so<00:02:36.550> this

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
push the ball over the net more so this

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.460 
push the ball over the net more so this
is<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:37.000> vertical<00:02:37.270> stroke<00:02:37.720> off<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.050> fastball

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
is the vertical stroke off the fastball

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.270 
is the vertical stroke off the fastball
and<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:40.810> forward<00:02:41.290> stroke<00:02:41.560> off<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:42.040> slower

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
and the forward stroke off the slower

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.580 
and the forward stroke off the slower
ball
