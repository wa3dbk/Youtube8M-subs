00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.790

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.840
 ah 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.239
 scarlett can you explain what is this 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.100
 this already only because we are not going to the kitchen 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:49.230
 so that you explain frank and you 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.230
 would bother not clear what I want 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.340
 we do not take long 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.570
 what the hell of scarlett comes frank and 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.700
 says that it is your best friend who is 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.410
 happening here is fine do not get mad 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.600
 with me listen 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:12.250
 well you know that she had a 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:15.240
 accident I do not know and good when falling 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.119
 from the roof for an unexpected surprise 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.190
 she suffered more blow to the head 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.040
 where he made me forget everything he knows 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.619
 of you from me and just remember your friends 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:31.060
 and all this is to us and second is 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:32.920
 called the doctor herself 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.399
 according to if we force her to remind us 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.259
 then his brain would become fried if 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.280
 is what he believes and that's why we could 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.720
 talk to her not what happens is that 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.149
 force her to remind us but if you can 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.850
 get back to know and to be are your friend 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.580
 but you can not tell us we knew each other 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.800
 before that if he would hurt but you have not 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.560
 it hurts if you get to know 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.940
 then you have already been friends since 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.060
 then and not 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.370
 said so long that I was sad for 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.370
 there can not be purchase here and you while 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:09.369
 he was walking with her do not get mad at me 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.170
 is that I thought that if that 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.160
 then you could meet her again and 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.350
 leave me 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.710
 you know I already have a choice because 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.710
 these 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.120
 that's why I'm no longer afraid to tell you 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.340
 ay is carles 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.849
 but at least I can meet again 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.849

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.880

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.040

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.240

 nobody should know at zero my friends are 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:26.060
 they said about my story if they said that 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.849
 according to I quoted against it would be good 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.839
 to bring you back 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:35.539
 to listen is not what you think you saw 

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:37.819

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.440
 ska's principle killed him because he 's 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:41.110

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:44.980

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:49.470
 you're in love with her and of course not 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:53.970
 I do this good at the beginning 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.970
 We thought that if I did not stay with her 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:06.660
 and well I must stay for that 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.910
 but it is already 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.260
 hate who returned at least 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:16.040

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:18.020
 I'll try esquel and well let's 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.500

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.300
 the back to show that because of 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.360

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.610

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.290

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.290
 they come thanks to this 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.180

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:03.210
 and if jackson does not seem to care 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:09.139

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:12.020
