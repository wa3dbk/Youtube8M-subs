00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
would just come in here and try it out

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.510 
would just come in here and try it out
on<00:00:28.369> camera<00:00:28.910> and<00:00:29.060> show<00:00:29.570> you<00:00:29.630> a<00:00:29.660> lot<00:00:30.130> okay<00:00:31.130> first

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
extra buttons here so if this triggers

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.330 
extra buttons here so if this triggers

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.260 
beneath the trigger and a reload put
another<00:01:14.959> base<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:15.619> you<00:01:15.770> can<00:01:15.950> quite<00:01:16.130> easily

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:24.529 
and lucky enough to have some early code

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:28.029 
and lucky enough to have some early code
from<00:01:24.679> gorilla<00:01:25.039> so<00:01:25.999> let's<00:01:26.810> start<00:01:27.380> here<00:01:27.619> we're

from gorilla so let's start here we're

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:30.279 
from gorilla so let's start here we're
at<00:01:28.069> the<00:01:28.340> isolate<00:01:29.060> that<00:01:29.329> were<00:01:29.840> first<00:01:30.079> shown<00:01:30.170> at

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
at the isolate that were first shown at

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:33.309 
at the isolate that were first shown at
e3<00:01:31.299> really<00:01:32.299> intuitive<00:01:32.539> really<00:01:32.959> nice<00:01:33.109> way<00:01:33.289> of

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
e3 really intuitive really nice way of

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:34.450 
e3 really intuitive really nice way of
playing

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
playing

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.039 
playing
particular<00:01:35.030> i'm<00:01:35.330> not<00:01:35.540> using<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:35.930> navigation

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
particular i'm not using the navigation

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.890 
particular i'm not using the navigation
controller<00:01:36.710> for<00:01:36.950> just<00:01:37.159> a<00:01:37.220> trigger<00:01:37.540> just<00:01:38.540> my

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
controller for just a trigger just my

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.130 
controller for just a trigger just my
own<00:01:39.020> aim<00:01:40.510> and<00:01:41.510> taking<00:01:41.960> out<00:01:42.110> this<00:01:43.690> is<00:01:44.690> looking

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
own aim and taking out this is looking

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.850 
own aim and taking out this is looking
oil<00:01:45.860> platform<00:01:47.050> do<00:01:48.050> they<00:01:48.170> have<00:01:48.259> oil<00:01:48.530> and<00:01:48.770> how

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
oil platform do they have oil and how

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.490 
oil platform do they have oil and how
them

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.719 

so<00:01:54.500> now<00:01:54.650> we've<00:01:54.770> moved<00:01:54.799> on<00:01:55.070> to<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:55.280> next<00:01:55.460> level

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
so now we've moved on to the next level

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.850 
so now we've moved on to the next level
and<00:01:55.880> this<00:01:56.270> is<00:01:56.390> a<00:01:56.420> more<00:01:56.630> traditional<00:01:56.750> FPS<00:01:57.560> level

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
and this is a more traditional FPS level

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.850 
and this is a more traditional FPS level
so<00:01:58.070> I'm<00:01:58.520> using<00:01:58.790> my<00:01:58.970> left<00:01:59.299> thumb<00:01:59.540> to<00:02:00.440> control<00:02:00.740> my

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
so I'm using my left thumb to control my

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.200 
so I'm using my left thumb to control my
straight<00:02:01.130> and<00:02:01.340> movements<00:02:01.700> in<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:01.820> navigation

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
straight and movements in the navigation

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.590 
straight and movements in the navigation
controller<00:02:02.720> and<00:02:03.880> kind<00:02:04.880> of<00:02:04.909> the<00:02:05.000> purpose<00:02:05.570> that

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
controller and kind of the purpose that

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.760 
controller and kind of the purpose that
you<00:02:05.780> do<00:02:05.930> you<00:02:06.049> do<00:02:06.170> with<00:02:06.259> the<00:02:06.380> rights<00:02:06.560> they've

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
you do you do with the rights they've

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.699 
you do you do with the rights they've
got<00:02:06.890> a<00:02:06.920> regular<00:02:07.100> controller<00:02:07.520> I'm<00:02:08.410> undo<00:02:09.410> using
