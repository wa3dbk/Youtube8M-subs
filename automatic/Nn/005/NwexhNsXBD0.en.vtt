we're priori before we go to sound check
we<00:00:14.100> have<00:00:14.190> these<00:00:14.279> big<00:00:14.610> kind<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.629> rolling<00:00:15.959> pedal

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
we have these big kind of rolling pedal

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.290 
we have these big kind of rolling pedal
boards<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:17.039> we<00:00:17.160> take<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.400> tops<00:00:17.609> off<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:18.000> and

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
boards that we take the tops off of and

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.150 
boards that we take the tops off of and
check<00:00:18.990> all<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.470> settings<00:00:19.710> because<00:00:19.949> we

check all of the settings because we

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.950 
check all of the settings because we
have<00:00:20.250> much<00:00:20.460> out<00:00:20.669> analog<00:00:21.210> pedals<00:00:21.599> so<00:00:21.750> we<00:00:21.869> have

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
have much out analog pedals so we have

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.450 
have much out analog pedals so we have
it<00:00:22.080> taped<00:00:22.259> down<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.769> we<00:00:22.830> make<00:00:23.039> sure<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.220> all

your little settings on there there's a
lot<00:00:31.409> of<00:00:31.560> times<00:00:31.859> like<00:00:32.160> I'll<00:00:32.610> just<00:00:32.669> plug<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.329> and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
lot of times like I'll just plug in and

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.630 
lot of times like I'll just plug in and
everything<00:00:33.900> sounds<00:00:34.290> terrible<00:00:34.680> have<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.460> go<00:00:35.579> to

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
everything sounds terrible have to go to

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.830 
everything sounds terrible have to go to
the<00:00:35.760> back<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.090> make<00:00:36.210> sure<00:00:36.240> every<00:00:36.540> settings

right and then make sure that all the
cords<00:00:39.090> are<00:00:39.210> connected<00:00:39.690> because<00:00:39.870> there<00:00:40.110> we

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
cords are connected because there we

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.540 
cords are connected because there we
have<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.560> many<00:00:40.680> things<00:00:41.010> running<00:00:41.280> through

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
have so many things running through

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.460 
have so many things running through
these<00:00:41.640> MIDI<00:00:41.970> switchers<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.660> just<00:00:43.170> make<00:00:43.320> sure

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
these MIDI switchers I just make sure

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.740 
these MIDI switchers I just make sure
that's<00:00:43.620> all<00:00:43.800> connected<00:00:44.310> and<00:00:44.460> then<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.480> runs

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
that's all connected and then that runs

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.750 
that's all connected and then that runs
out<00:00:45.990> you<00:00:46.020> know<00:00:46.530> 40-foot<00:00:47.040> midi<00:00:47.220> cable<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
out you know 40-foot midi cable to the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.200 
out you know 40-foot midi cable to the
stage<00:00:48.030> we<00:00:48.300> have<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> big<00:00:49.220> also<00:00:50.220> RJM<00:00:50.850> midi

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
stage we have a big also RJM midi

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.230 
stage we have a big also RJM midi
controller<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.320> we<00:00:52.740> use<00:00:52.890> our<00:00:53.040> computers<00:00:53.670> we

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.240 
controller so we use our computers we

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.420 
controller so we use our computers we
program<00:00:54.810> all<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.410> analog<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.190> MIDI

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
program all of the analog and MIDI

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.520 
program all of the analog and MIDI
switching<00:00:56.850> for<00:00:56.970> all<00:00:57.060> of<00:00:57.180> our<00:00:57.270> petals<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.930> then

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
switching for all of our petals and then

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.820 
switching for all of our petals and then
you<00:00:58.620> get<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:58.830> stage<00:00:59.130> and<00:00:59.400> we<00:00:59.490> plug<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.880> in<00:01:00.830> if

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
you get on stage and we plug it in if

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.280 
you get on stage and we plug it in if
you<00:01:01.980> want<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.220> change<00:01:02.460> six<00:01:02.790> petals<00:01:03.150> and<00:01:03.390> one

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
you want to change six petals and one

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.170 
you want to change six petals and one
push<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.650> button<00:01:04.680> we<00:01:04.979> can<00:01:05.009> especially<00:01:05.909> when

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180

chorus is coming in like hit five petals

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.149 
chorus is coming in like hit five petals
and<00:01:15.409> halfway<00:01:16.409> through<00:01:16.679> the<00:01:16.740> chorus<00:01:17.039> they

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
and halfway through the chorus they

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.050 
and halfway through the chorus they
finally<00:01:17.460> get<00:01:17.579> all<00:01:17.640> pedals<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:19.700> we've<00:01:20.700> created

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
finally get all pedals on we've created

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.899 
finally get all pedals on we've created
a<00:01:21.479> system<00:01:22.409> which<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.340> borderline

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
a system which is borderline

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.450 
a system which is borderline
plug-and-play<00:01:24.539> and<00:01:25.200> we<00:01:25.649> did<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.920> very

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
plug-and-play and we did it very

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.880 
plug-and-play and we did it very
intentionally<00:01:27.179> so<00:01:27.479> we<00:01:27.630> have<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:27.990> our<00:01:28.259> inner

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
intentionally so we have like our inner

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.340 
intentionally so we have like our inner
rig<00:01:29.219> which<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.670> gain<00:01:30.060> stage<00:01:30.390> every<00:01:30.869> night<00:01:30.899> so

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
rig which is gain stage every night so

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.989 
rig which is gain stage every night so
it's<00:01:31.499> completely<00:01:31.679> consistent<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.670> we<00:01:32.789> plug

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:32.999 
it's completely consistent so we plug

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:35.059 
it's completely consistent so we plug
into<00:01:33.179> a<00:01:33.270> snake<00:01:33.479> on<00:01:33.719> stage<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.289> we're<00:01:34.829> hearing

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:35.069 
into a snake on stage and we're hearing

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:36.230 
into a snake on stage and we're hearing
the<00:01:35.159> same<00:01:35.340> thing<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.579> our<00:01:35.670> head<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.119> do

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the same thing in our head that we do

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.059 
the same thing in our head that we do
every<00:01:36.509> single<00:01:36.630> night<00:01:36.929> so<00:01:37.109> no<00:01:37.289> monitors<00:01:37.710> no

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069 
every single night so no monitors no

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:40.309 
every single night so no monitors no
monitor<00:01:38.369> engineers<00:01:38.909> needed<00:01:39.149> no<00:01:39.749> wedges<00:01:39.960> and

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
monitor engineers needed no wedges and

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:42.859 
monitor engineers needed no wedges and
so<00:01:40.770> we<00:01:41.069> pull<00:01:41.670> everything<00:01:41.909> out<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.299> as<00:01:42.509> long<00:01:42.689> as

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
so we pull everything out and as long as

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.419 
so we pull everything out and as long as
stuff<00:01:43.049> didn't<00:01:43.289> get<00:01:43.409> unplugged<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:44.039> the<00:01:44.249> road

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
stuff didn't get unplugged on the road

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.010 
stuff didn't get unplugged on the road
we're<00:01:44.729> gonna<00:01:44.819> have<00:01:44.999> the<00:01:45.090> exact<00:01:45.450> same<00:01:45.479> sound

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
we're gonna have the exact same sound
