00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 Hi, I'm Kaiser Iodine and we're going to work 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.820
 with photographic films or acetates that 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.860
 is this sheet 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.139
 that was quite like in the pre 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.380
 powerpoint since it was useful to mark 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.299
 map do the tc diagram for what 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.200
 it serves as photographic data or films 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.390
 look for example the drawing this is how 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.120
 thanks to the films the 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.890
 animations to make the characters 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.480
 no longer so much because now it 's all for 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.840
 computer but at the time it was 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.360
 quite common to draw them manually and 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.450
 then pass them through the computer as 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.980
 they saw themselves painted on the back 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.690
 it's a pretty interesting effect and 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.670
 you can make them buy in 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.160
 any bookstore since they see them in a 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.570
 pretty cheap price the filminas 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.370
 although he opens that I guess he's by 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.890
 above the dollar more or less is not so 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.489
 cheap let's work with this drawing 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.280
 to pass them to the coloring in films and 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.589
 see how the process is and step by step 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.980
 to serve to work with this the 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:05.379
 nib and the Chinese ink that can be 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.320
 any good brand does not matter by myself 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.870
 pelican but anyone is very good and 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.940
 the acrylics now let's see how it is 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.590
 the procedure to start drawing 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.590
 in acetate 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:24.000
 well we have our drawing and on top of 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.000
 same we are going to put the film 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.230
 usually markers serve no 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.530
 of a lot because he films it as not 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.690
 absorbs them enough so if you 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.490
 It is convenient to work with Chinese ink and 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.190
 step will serve us to practice and 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.950
 get used to driving since at 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.740
 draw in filmin you have to be pretty 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.390
 careful because it is a material not 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.030
 as absorbing as a paper would be 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.120
 then at the minimum friction we are going to 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.060
 make a mistake 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.369
 so be very careful 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.700
 we are drawing the edges of our 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.700
 drawing 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.420
 here in Argentina it is known as 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.420
 filminates but another name that you have are 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.519
 photographic acetates look it up like that 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.260
 I tried to explain him as a kind of 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:15.989
 transparent sheet ideal 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.269
 before they were pretty cheap but now 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.750
 As they are products generally 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.909
 imported can be for the value of 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.140
 one dollar two dollars or in Argentina 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:28.670
 It would be like four pesos 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.620
 the good thing they have is that if 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.050
 wrong they can wash the one that obviously 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.180
 will be left with a kind of blotch 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.870
 so it's convenient to do it with 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.870
 very careful 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.300
 you have to be very careful to 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.790
 work with ink as I said 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:49.040
 because it is not absorbent with the paper the 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.930
 filmina very it is very easy that the filmina 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.630
 absorb what we are drawing going to 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.920
 stay pretty cool so always 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.920
 we must leave him a time of rest 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.830
 in the process it will help us to get used to 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.640
 work with the Chinese ink because 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.770
 depending on how much we squeeze the tip 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.319
 will come more or less ink 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.240
 so work with a lot of care 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.630
 especially in details as fine as 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.630
 the eyes 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.660
 and another thing that has bad ink 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.489
 Chinese to work is that you have to 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.489
 be constantly recharging the 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.660
 and always be careful not to overload the 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.700
 simple a little nothing more 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.370
 for example here I saw I'm learning 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.750
 a lot and it came out fortunately is a 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.230
 part that went black so I'm not going to 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.330
 ruin the drawing a lot 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.200
 we continue to finish this work by 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.200
 all the lines 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.780
 you have to be very careful to 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.340
 work with the Chinese ink because 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.709
 stain as I want to clarify do not do it 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.069
 on cloth surfaces do not try 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.680
 try doing this in your bed or in some 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.010
 table with 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.480
 something covered because it does not come out easily 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.340
 the Chinese ink 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.130
 must be very careful 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.470
 work with her to work over 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:26.330
 of a cloth or on a table that 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.400
 know they can wash or clean 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.560
 and also obviously very much care 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.450
 with clothes 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.960
 well let's go assign the details of 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.470
 our drawing 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.340
 all right 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.680
 we would have then what would be 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.880
 our drawing 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.289
 list filmina with good china ink 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.100
 I just finished some details that 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.100
 can not do it 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.090
 no you are not seeing three of those and 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.250
 unfortunately because now yes no 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.860
 I am doing in detail what 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.580
 it would be the girls just finish 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.580
 some other detail 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.890
 and as I said the Chinese ink has to 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.540
 leave time to dry drawing 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.700
 Do not try to do it instantly because 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.080
 they are going to stain well we have our 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.840
 drawing 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.000
 almost finished we added details 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.540
 and as I said we're going to let it rest 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.870
 this drawing not much time if they want 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.050
 10 to 15 minutes depending on how much 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.720
 black have painted with ink 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:37.540
 now that we have our drawing 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.690
 in the acetate to the film we are going to 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.410
 start painting but we will not paint 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.250
 from that side 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.250
 from the back 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:52.190
 very good now let's go ahead a bit 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.190
 because this is going to take your time 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:13.940
 very well we have then our 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:16.940
 Inked drawing with Chinese ink and 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.770
 painted with acrylic finish we're going to 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.180
 give the final details and ready 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.010
 we have our said obviously I did 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.380
 pretty fast is to show how 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.850
 tutorial I am educated and I recommend it 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.840
 what practice is going to be useful for them 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.840
 hires greetings
