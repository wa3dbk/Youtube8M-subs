00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 of another value we have to have in 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.990
 always count the sun of the cornea on 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.400
 thickness of the cornea which is what it measures 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.990
 the cornea say if we do not go to our 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.330
 vision apply it and the applications 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.880
 would be this is the cornea because this would be 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.830
 what we are going to measure what is what it measures 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.230
 the thickness of the cornea what importance 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.090
 have this as we are seeing with 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.279
 an apparatus that what it does is flatten 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.710
 about that balloon that these explained very 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.689
 well depends how that cornea of 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.849
 thicker or thinner we will have a value 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.250
 higher or lower but it is the thickness of 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.630
 the cornea is changing throughout 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.070
 our life what happens is that if you 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.510
 you are or you do not have a very thick crown 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.910
 you imagine what you want to push a 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.340
 wall that looks a meter thick you 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.410
 costs more than if on a wall that has 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.170
 20 centimeters then what you have to 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.840
 see is how fat the cornea is and in 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.760
 function to that the voltage values ​​you 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.289
 you make an idea of ​​rectification is the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.910
 we measure how reds are measured see 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.250
 correctly well here we have a 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.660
 device called a meter of 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.110
 agreement and then what we do is 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.750
 have a have a terminal 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.449
 we go here to do the measurement and with 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.100
 this is done with ultrasound we use 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.220
 the same anesthetic boots as before 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.450
 I looked different applied a little bit down 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.960
 there we are 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.119
 we have already made the measurement he has 567 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.219
 microns thick and is one that translates 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.259
 or that so we can understand it for 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:24.000
 not to give them we're going to do it also in 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.479
 the other eye because someone tells me have 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.840
 500 thick cornea let's see this 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.549
 and has 566 in the other eye this that 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.799
 means let's see it's not a value 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.920
 let's say rather for us that is to say 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.640
 the big value for normal 554 microns 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.469
 that's the average in terms of thickness 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.030
 corneal then a patient who has 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.590
 the thickest commune can have a 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.840
 problem that starts not working 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.360
 well and it can be with transplants of 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.039
 cornea if they are very high values if it is 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.360
 a very fine value we have to have 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.670
 careful because the tension that we have 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.979
 eye can be lower than 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.780
 it really is then we make a 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.340
 sort of correlation and it comes to us very 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.950
 good especially for myopia surgeries 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.750
 with excimer laser that not in your case 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.009
 now it is also fundamental because 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.750
 is what many people say I have the 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.230
 thin cornea and I have not been able to operate 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.090
 myopia then with this test is worth it 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.560
 it's worth to many things and it's a 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.940
 increasingly useful test and that 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.940
 we use that count us
