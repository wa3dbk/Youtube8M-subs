I<00:00:08.350> remember<00:00:09.350> when<00:00:09.559> I<00:00:09.680> was<00:00:09.799> invited<00:00:10.100> I<00:00:10.490> had

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.230 
I remember when I was invited I had

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.330 
I remember when I was invited I had
that<00:00:11.769> I<00:00:12.179> would<00:00:13.179> prefer<00:00:13.450> stay

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
that I would prefer stay

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.820 
that I would prefer stay
Hotel<00:00:14.850> because<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.840> thought<00:00:16.200> would<00:00:16.410> be<00:00:16.560> really

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
Hotel because I thought would be really

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.510 
Hotel because I thought would be really
spooky<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.580> have<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.720> stay<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.950> know<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.310> the

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
spooky to have to stay you know in the

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.109 
spooky to have to stay you know in the
space<00:00:21.000> itself<00:00:21.450> at<00:00:21.690> night<00:00:21.720> what<00:00:22.710> really<00:00:23.279> struck

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
space itself at night what really struck

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.630 
space itself at night what really struck
me<00:00:24.360> the<00:00:24.540> most<00:00:24.570> was<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.439> intimacy<00:00:26.400> that

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
me the most was the intimacy that

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.060 
me the most was the intimacy that
somebody<00:00:27.510> actually<00:00:27.689> lived<00:00:28.290> and<00:00:28.590> was<00:00:28.830> not

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
somebody actually lived and was not

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.010 
somebody actually lived and was not
necessarily<00:00:29.550> an<00:00:29.849> experience<00:00:30.360> of<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.570> museum

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
necessarily an experience of a museum

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.360 
necessarily an experience of a museum
and<00:00:31.460> also<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:33.350> accessibility<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.379> all<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
and also the accessibility of all the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.780 
and also the accessibility of all the
precious<00:00:35.910> objects<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.350> think

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
precious objects and I think

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.070 
precious objects and I think
understanding<00:00:38.790> all<00:00:39.150> the<00:00:39.510> collections

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
understanding all the collections

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.990 
understanding all the collections
through<00:00:40.949> Doris<00:00:41.910> Dukes<00:00:42.300> eyes<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:43.610> was<00:00:44.610> looking

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
through Doris Dukes eyes I was looking

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.260 
through Doris Dukes eyes I was looking
for<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> way<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:46.070> explore<00:00:47.070> transformation<00:00:48.030> and

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
for a way to explore transformation and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.710 
for a way to explore transformation and
the<00:00:48.989> projections<00:00:49.770> allowed<00:00:50.399> me<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.640> play<00:00:51.480> with

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
the projections allowed me to play with

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.020 
the projections allowed me to play with
that<00:00:51.989> especially<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.370> know<00:00:53.489> working<00:00:53.760> at

night and trying to sort of expose
elements<00:00:57.750> which<00:00:57.930> would<00:00:58.290> be<00:00:58.440> hidden<00:00:58.649> during

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
elements which would be hidden during

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.860 
elements which would be hidden during
the<00:00:59.250> day<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:01.620> landscape<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.540> dense<00:01:03.540> and

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the day the landscape is so dense and

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.260 
the day the landscape is so dense and
manicured<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:05.600> it<00:01:06.600> was<00:01:06.899> a<00:01:06.930> perfect<00:01:08.030> surface<00:01:09.030> on

manicured so it was a perfect surface on
which<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.840> project<00:01:10.380> images<00:01:11.190> and<00:01:11.910> make<00:01:12.509> things

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
which to project images and make things

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.999 
which to project images and make things
very<00:01:13.080> theatrical<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.399> the<00:01:15.390> medium<00:01:16.009> you

very theatrical and and the medium you
know<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> drawings<00:01:17.610> transformed<00:01:18.300> into<00:01:18.450> more

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
know the drawings transformed into more

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.320 
know the drawings transformed into more

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
is an image that has been used in my

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.910 
is an image that has been used in my
work<00:01:26.459> maybe<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.539> know<00:01:27.810> ten<00:01:28.200> years<00:01:28.470> ago<00:01:28.649> or

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
work maybe you know ten years ago or

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.480 
work maybe you know ten years ago or
more<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.399> at<00:01:29.819> the<00:01:29.970> same<00:01:30.149> time<00:01:30.539> it's<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.679> it<00:01:32.099> sort

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
more and at the same time it's a it sort

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.169 
more and at the same time it's a it sort
of<00:01:32.580> was<00:01:33.420> sort<00:01:33.899> of<00:01:33.959> a<00:01:34.170> homemade<00:01:34.800> to<00:01:35.220> tourists

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
of was sort of a homemade to tourists

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.010 
of was sort of a homemade to tourists
ook<00:01:36.360> herself<00:01:36.840> because<00:01:37.349> it's<00:01:37.800> her<00:01:38.039> mythic<00:01:38.580> and

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
ook herself because it's her mythic and

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.100 
ook herself because it's her mythic and
monumental<00:01:40.459> image<00:01:41.459> and<00:01:41.789> then<00:01:42.209> projected

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
monumental image and then projected

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.370 
monumental image and then projected
large<00:01:43.399> that<00:01:44.399> image<00:01:44.759> was<00:01:44.910> almost<00:01:45.300> 80<00:01:45.599> feet<00:01:45.990> and

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
large that image was almost 80 feet and

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.370 
large that image was almost 80 feet and
I<00:01:46.950> think<00:01:47.280> what<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.940> found<00:01:48.420> interesting<00:01:48.810> was

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
I think what I found interesting was

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.029 
I think what I found interesting was
that<00:01:50.840> everything<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:51.990> framed<00:01:52.500> really

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
that everything is framed really

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:55.760 
that everything is framed really
perfectly<00:01:53.550> it's<00:01:54.149> very<00:01:54.899> clear<00:01:55.289> you're<00:01:55.530> very

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
perfectly it's very clear you're very

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.139 
perfectly it's very clear you're very
aware<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.099> it<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:57.599> was<00:01:58.259> also<00:01:59.030> interested<00:02:00.030> in

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
aware of it and I was also interested in

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.960 
aware of it and I was also interested in
this<00:02:00.330> idea<00:02:00.720> of<00:02:00.780> framing<00:02:01.289> so<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.950> works<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.940> I

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
this idea of framing so the works that I

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.930 
this idea of framing so the works that I
chose<00:02:03.360> created<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.319> frame<00:02:04.729> through<00:02:05.729> which

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
chose created a frame through which

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.210 
chose created a frame through which
things<00:02:06.690> could<00:02:06.989> be<00:02:07.170> seen<00:02:07.500> but<00:02:07.770> at<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.039> same

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
things could be seen but at the same

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.249 
things could be seen but at the same
time<00:02:08.459> since<00:02:08.759> they<00:02:08.910> were<00:02:08.940> projections<00:02:09.690> nothing

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
time since they were projections nothing

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.710 
time since they were projections nothing
was<00:02:10.440> stable<00:02:11.099> or<00:02:11.250> stationary<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:12.150> was<00:02:12.540> always

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
was stable or stationary I was always

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.470 
was stable or stationary I was always
moving<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.349> shifting<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.910> thought<00:02:15.209> that

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
moving and shifting and I thought that

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.559 
moving and shifting and I thought that
was<00:02:15.690> very<00:02:16.250> much<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.670> nature<00:02:18.239> of<00:02:18.270> my

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
was very much the nature of my

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.809 
was very much the nature of my
experiencing<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.620> space<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.220> was<00:02:20.370> just<00:02:20.700> a

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
experiencing the space it was just a

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.580 
experiencing the space it was just a
fleeting<00:02:21.090> moment<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.930> something<00:02:22.170> very

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
fleeting moment of something very

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.069 
fleeting moment of something very
fantastical<00:02:23.459> your<00:02:23.819> senses<00:02:24.480> were<00:02:24.629> embellished

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
fantastical your senses were embellished

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.510 
fantastical your senses were embellished
all<00:02:25.379> the<00:02:25.650> time

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
all the time

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.100 
all the time
and<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:27.270> found<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.410> really<00:02:30.110> compelling

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
and I found that really compelling

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.270 
and I found that really compelling
because<00:02:32.570> with<00:02:33.570> all<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:34.050> that<00:02:34.260> there<00:02:34.920> was<00:02:35.040> still

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
because with all of that there was still

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.960 
because with all of that there was still
a<00:02:35.340> very<00:02:35.550> peaceful<00:02:35.960> experience
