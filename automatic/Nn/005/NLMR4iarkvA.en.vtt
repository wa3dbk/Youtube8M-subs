all<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.349> numbering<00:02:20.769> worked<00:02:20.980> out<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:22.870> takes

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
all the numbering worked out that takes

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.720 
all the numbering worked out that takes
maybe<00:02:23.379> sixty<00:02:23.830> Seconds<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.370> do

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
maybe sixty Seconds to do

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.460 
maybe sixty Seconds to do
second<00:02:25.300> thing<00:02:25.420> is<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:25.569> got<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:25.870> print<00:02:26.230> it<00:02:26.319> out

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
second thing is you got to print it out

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.559 
second thing is you got to print it out
now<00:02:27.220> most<00:02:27.550> of<00:02:27.730> us<00:02:27.849> aren't<00:02:28.030> cool<00:02:28.239> enough<00:02:28.540> to

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
now most of us aren't cool enough to

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.140 
now most of us aren't cool enough to
have<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:28.870> laser<00:02:29.290> printer<00:02:29.830> that<00:02:30.340> prints<00:02:31.030> on

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
have a laser printer that prints on

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.600 
have a laser printer that prints on
double-sided<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:33.099> want<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.459> have

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
double-sided and you want to have

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.369 
double-sided and you want to have
double-sided<00:02:34.239> printing<00:02:34.629> so<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:34.989> booklet

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
double-sided printing so the booklet

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.039 
double-sided printing so the booklet
looks<00:02:35.590> right<00:02:35.830> it's<00:02:36.640> pretty<00:02:37.239> easy<00:02:37.540> when<00:02:37.930> you

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
looks right it's pretty easy when you

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:43.110 
looks right it's pretty easy when you
open<00:02:38.290> your<00:02:38.410> PDF<00:02:38.849> two<00:02:39.849> steps<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.590> print<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:42.610> odd

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
open your PDF two steps a print the odd

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.259 
open your PDF two steps a print the odd
pages<00:02:43.660> and<00:02:44.170> so<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.069> prints<00:02:45.340> all<00:02:45.579> the<00:02:45.760> odd<00:02:45.910> pages

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
pages and so it prints all the odd pages

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.390 
pages and so it prints all the odd pages
and<00:02:46.630> then<00:02:46.959> you<00:02:47.019> take<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.380> paper<00:02:47.590> out<00:02:47.769> and<00:02:48.220> put

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
and then you take the paper out and put

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.130 
and then you take the paper out and put
it<00:02:48.519> back<00:02:48.730> into<00:02:48.970> your<00:02:49.090> printer<00:02:49.360> upside<00:02:49.870> down

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
it back into your printer upside down

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.910 
it back into your printer upside down
and<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:51.069> print<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.549> even<00:02:52.000> pages<00:02:52.410> in<00:02:53.410> reverse

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
and you print the even pages in reverse

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.039 
and you print the even pages in reverse
order<00:02:54.190> don't<00:02:54.910> forget<00:02:55.239> that<00:02:55.390> step<00:02:55.720> or<00:02:55.900> it's

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
order don't forget that step or it's

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.319 
order don't forget that step or it's
going<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.230> not<00:02:56.410> it's<00:02:56.590> gonna<00:02:56.709> look<00:02:57.180> screwed<00:02:58.180> up

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
going to not it's gonna look screwed up

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.690 
going to not it's gonna look screwed up
that's<00:02:58.840> maybe<00:02:59.079> five<00:02:59.950> minutes<00:03:00.370> to<00:03:00.549> do<00:03:00.670> that

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
that's maybe five minutes to do that

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.539 
that's maybe five minutes to do that
then<00:03:01.120> you've<00:03:01.269> got<00:03:01.480> a<00:03:01.510> stack<00:03:01.900> of<00:03:02.140> paper

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
then you've got a stack of paper

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.890 
then you've got a stack of paper
double-sided<00:03:03.549> in<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.120> right<00:03:04.329> order

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
double-sided in the right order
