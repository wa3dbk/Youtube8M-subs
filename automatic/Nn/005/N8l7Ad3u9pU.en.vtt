00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.040
 since their appearance in paradise the snakes are the seductions of 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.069
 Group the power of evil 

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:15.109
 but it has also been the epitome of the urge to research since antiquity 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:17.019
 Search for knowledge 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:20.150
 so much does the leading one do wisdom 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.730
 took advantage of the evil world traveled as tools beside let man 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.310
 Judge lead to violation of the laws 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.329
 to distinguish between good and evil 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.630
 as the serpent tackle Wolmirstedt 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.720
 and today 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.940
 where the way 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.770
 with us the snakes are in the retreat they were always search flight 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.770
 to avoid the people too close back 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.160
 The Colts have been through their lives so far 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.060
 can 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.809
 even more dangerous than the hotels in the 4 to 4 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.160
 Best already from the deal 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.290
 the new opposites should face the snakes in front of the media they feel him 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.590
 to bring up not limited changes of the slender line 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.119
 he succumbs to the 1 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.260
 binds workstation arrived 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.500
 but he does not look very good after an otters what do you mean 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.240
 200 meters to the right 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.240
 just who looks much better when I look then 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.730
 German users and those under the title of occupation 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.970
 Snakes researchers from Passion on the way in the Black Forest 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.670
 Clemens Fritz also queues researcher Notz's by phone to one 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.070
 slim place 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.420
 Steiner as a sucker sun warmed these so lovable is the adder and 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.420
 why do they love to improve? 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.090
 in the southern Black Forest, five men offer the intensive 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.090
 Research in the field of snake 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.860
 Kurt Sabathil us-coast biologist sociologist and nature lover operates the 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.910
 biological station Hotzenwald also as a meeting place for those interested in the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.910
 Want to get closer to nature 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:22.209
 Clemens Fritz Cluster by profession also he belongs to the initiators of this 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.079
 Circle of conservationists who does not like to bring the whole family 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.549
 Meeting place was critical 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.139
 Breitbart 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.540
 but the not entirely harmless excursions 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.119
 on land among the players 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:38.420
 his main interest 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.630
 for the location capture it in Germany Mon Dieu as is here as in the 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.630
 black forest 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.599
 even in Spessart, snakes are researchers at work their main interest applies 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.519
 the otters 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.519
 The blood samples from Rotterdam will need genetic testing 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.059
 which are among other things required if one wants to determine 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:04.379
 whether speculation 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.590
 different from each other "We would also like to know the individual 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.009
 Spessart populations genetically they are now 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:14.189
 and 4 want to know if there will be in the future 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:18.269
 such base data are also very valuable today for nature conservation
