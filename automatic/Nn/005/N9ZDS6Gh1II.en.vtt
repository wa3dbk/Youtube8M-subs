hi<00:00:09.750> guys<00:00:09.930> my<00:00:10.200> name<00:00:10.350> is<00:00:10.440> Mike<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:10.950> in<00:00:11.070> this

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
hi guys my name is Mike and in this

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.950 
hi guys my name is Mike and in this
video<00:00:11.460> I'm<00:00:11.520> gonna<00:00:11.670> show<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.510> two<00:00:12.719> best

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
video I'm gonna show you the two best

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.220 
video I'm gonna show you the two best
tactics<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.590> using<00:00:13.980> slam<00:00:14.280> mines<00:00:14.549> now<00:00:15.230> slaw

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
tactics and using slam mines now slaw

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.560 
tactics and using slam mines now slaw
mines<00:00:16.500> are<00:00:16.770> different<00:00:17.550> in<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.970> normal<00:00:18.360> mines

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
mines are different in the normal mines

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.910 
mines are different in the normal mines
and<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:18.869> they<00:00:18.960> don't<00:00:19.170> explode<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:19.800> impact

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
and that they don't explode on impact

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.400 
and that they don't explode on impact
they<00:00:20.700> explode<00:00:21.030> when<00:00:21.180> something<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.720> right

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
they explode when something is right

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.950 
they explode when something is right
next<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.980> them<00:00:23.160> or<00:00:23.310> over<00:00:23.580> them<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:24.330> one<00:00:24.780> of<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
next to them or over them so one of the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.050 
next to them or over them so one of the
best<00:00:25.170> ways<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.560> use<00:00:25.860> them<00:00:26.040> is<00:00:26.190> place<00:00:26.670> them<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:26.970> a

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
best ways to use them is place them in a

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.020 
best ways to use them is place them in a
crater<00:00:27.530> caused<00:00:28.530> by<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.770> previous<00:00:29.250> explosion<00:00:29.820> so

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.030 
crater caused by a previous explosion so

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.580 
crater caused by a previous explosion so
you<00:00:30.540> saw<00:00:30.750> them<00:00:30.840> here<00:00:31.020> in<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.140> beginning<00:00:31.260> of

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
you saw them here in the beginning of

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.560 
you saw them here in the beginning of
the<00:00:31.740> video<00:00:31.950> just<00:00:32.099> putting<00:00:32.820> them<00:00:32.910> down<00:00:33.120> inside

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
the video just putting them down inside

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.200 
the video just putting them down inside
a<00:00:33.600> hole<00:00:34.040> and<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.129> means<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.550> one<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.789> Tanks

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
a hole and that means that one of Tanks

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.480 
a hole and that means that one of Tanks
want<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.780> tank<00:00:36.989> runs<00:00:37.170> over<00:00:37.590> them<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:38.280> going

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:38.490 
want to tank runs over them it's going

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.690 
want to tank runs over them it's going
to<00:00:38.579> explode<00:00:38.940> 99%<00:00:39.900> of<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.050> time<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.500> place<00:00:41.010> three

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
to explode 99% of the time I place three

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.110 
to explode 99% of the time I place three
mines<00:00:42.030> down<00:00:42.360> four<00:00:42.840> for<00:00:43.380> safety<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.010> don't<00:00:45.000> want

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
mines down four for safety I don't want

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.540 
mines down four for safety I don't want
to<00:00:45.180> get<00:00:45.300> into<00:00:45.750> numbers<00:00:46.079> but<00:00:46.500> they're<00:00:47.040> weaker

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
to get into numbers but they're weaker

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.600 
to get into numbers but they're weaker
than<00:00:47.730> normal<00:00:47.790> mines<00:00:48.329> but<00:00:49.040> three<00:00:50.040> does<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> job

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
than normal mines but three does a job

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.960 
than normal mines but three does a job
so<00:00:50.850> if<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.030> place<00:00:51.210> them<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.930> hole<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:53.040> vehicle

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
so if you place them in a hole a vehicle

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.130 
so if you place them in a hole a vehicle
running<00:00:54.060> over<00:00:54.450> them<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.690> guaranteed<00:00:55.110> to

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
running over them is guaranteed to

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.290 
running over them is guaranteed to
explode<00:00:55.560> now<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:56.399> chip<00:00:56.610> here<00:00:56.940> would<00:00:57.120> have

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
explode now this chip here would have

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.229 
explode now this chip here would have
normally<00:00:57.540> jumped<00:00:58.110> over<00:00:58.520> if<00:00:59.520> there<00:01:00.149> were

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
normally jumped over if there were

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.090 
normally jumped over if there were
normal<00:01:00.600> mines<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:01.140> with<00:01:01.350> Slams

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
normal mines but with Slams

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.469 
normal mines but with Slams
it's<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:03.559> impossible<00:01:04.559> not<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.549> get<00:01:06.329> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
it's just impossible not to I get the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.709 
it's just impossible not to I get the
kill<00:01:06.719> and<00:01:06.960> Zabul<00:01:07.829> is<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> perfect<00:01:08.430> example<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.969> a

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:09.719 
kill and Zabul is a perfect example of a

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:12.020 
kill and Zabul is a perfect example of a
map<00:01:10.110> that's<00:01:10.440> perfect<00:01:11.430> for<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.670> kind<00:01:11.940> of

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
map that's perfect for this kind of

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.030 
map that's perfect for this kind of
trick<00:01:12.270> because<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:13.229> roads<00:01:13.440> are<00:01:13.620> made<00:01:13.770> out<00:01:13.920> of

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
trick because the roads are made out of

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.430 
trick because the roads are made out of
mud<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:15.030> every<00:01:15.330> explosion<00:01:15.690> makes<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.229> crater

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
mud so every explosion makes a crater

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.410 
mud so every explosion makes a crater
and<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.460> crater<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:18.030> just<00:01:18.210> place

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
and in the crater you can just place

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.690 
and in the crater you can just place
three<00:01:18.840> slabs<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.409> get<00:01:19.530> get<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.159> jumps<00:01:20.490> I

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
three slabs and get get the jumps I

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.020 
three slabs and get get the jumps I
joked<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.049> now<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:23.340> other<00:01:23.490> thing<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.729> want<00:01:23.909> to

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
joked that now the other thing I want to

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.399 
joked that now the other thing I want to
share<00:01:24.180> with<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.510> the<00:01:24.630> other<00:01:24.720> tactic<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.290> was

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
share with you the other tactic I was

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.020 
share with you the other tactic I was
talking<00:01:25.680> about<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:26.100> placing<00:01:26.580> them<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.850> water

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
talking about is placing them in water

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.630 
talking about is placing them in water
now<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.260> you've<00:01:28.409> been<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.619> longtime<00:01:28.920> subscriber

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
now if you've been a longtime subscriber

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.030 
now if you've been a longtime subscriber
of<00:01:29.790> mine<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.600> probably<00:01:31.409> remember<00:01:31.650> from

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
of mine you probably remember from

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.800 
of mine you probably remember from
battlefield<00:01:32.490> 3<00:01:32.520> how<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:32.880> can<00:01:33.090> place<00:01:33.299> mines<00:01:33.600> in

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
battlefield 3 how you can place mines in

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.859 
battlefield 3 how you can place mines in
water<00:01:33.990> but<00:01:34.619> for<00:01:35.010> normal<00:01:35.850> mines<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.630> need<00:01:36.780> to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
water but for normal mines you need to

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.780 
water but for normal mines you need to
be<00:01:36.960> standing<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.680> need<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.979> be<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.580> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
be standing so you need to be in the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.429 
be standing so you need to be in the
water<00:01:39.000> up<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.210> your<00:01:39.330> waist<00:01:39.600> standing<00:01:40.290> and

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
water up to your waist standing and

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.380 
water up to your waist standing and
placing<00:01:40.740> down<00:01:40.979> but<00:01:41.250> with<00:01:41.700> slabs<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.240> can

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
placing down but with slabs you can

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.750 
placing down but with slabs you can
actually<00:01:42.780> swim<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.830> place<00:01:44.400> them<00:01:44.580> in<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
actually swim and place them in the

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.640 
actually swim and place them in the
middle<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.780> river<00:01:45.990> or<00:01:46.200> lay<00:01:46.350> on<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
middle of the of the river or lay on the

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.810 
middle of the of the river or lay on the
canal<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:48.049> and<00:01:49.049> get<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.439> job<00:01:49.650> done

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
canal and and get the job done

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.260 
canal and and get the job done
it's<00:01:51.920> normally<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:52.950> see<00:01:53.159> people<00:01:53.520> making

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
it's normally I see people making

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.999 
it's normally I see people making
mistakes<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.900> they're<00:01:55.200> placing<00:01:55.530> them<00:01:55.680> far

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
mistakes that they're placing them far

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200

apart what you want to do is just swim

people most vehicles drive through the

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.020 
people most vehicles drive through the
middle<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.150> pathways<00:02:03.900> and<00:02:04.500> place<00:02:04.770> three<00:02:05.100> on

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
middle of pathways and place three on

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.550 
middle of pathways and place three on
top<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.360> each<00:02:06.479> other<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:06.990> don't<00:02:07.350> want<00:02:07.470> to

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
top of each other so you don't want to

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.619 
top of each other so you don't want to
spread<00:02:07.799> them<00:02:07.979> because<00:02:08.849> if<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.149> if<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.509> do

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
spread them because if you if you do

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.029 
spread them because if you if you do
spread<00:02:09.899> them<00:02:10.019> you<00:02:10.140> get<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.289> higher<00:02:10.560> chance<00:02:10.829> of

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
spread them you get a higher chance of

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.610 
spread them you get a higher chance of
hitting<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:12.360> vehicle<00:02:12.870> but<00:02:13.049> on<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.500> other

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
hitting the the vehicle but on the other

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.979 
hitting the the vehicle but on the other
side<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.239> minimize<00:02:15.239> your<00:02:15.300> chance<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.930> getting

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
side you minimize your chance of getting

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.800 
side you minimize your chance of getting
a<00:02:16.349> kill<00:02:16.590> so<00:02:16.860> what<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.849> want<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.239> place<00:02:18.540> one

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
a kill so what you want is to place one

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.309 
a kill so what you want is to place one
on<00:02:18.840> top<00:02:19.050> of

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
on top of

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.809 
on top of
the<00:02:19.379> other<00:02:19.499> place<00:02:19.950> them<00:02:20.129> down<00:02:20.249> the<00:02:20.430> middle<00:02:20.519> so

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
the other place them down the middle so

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.110 
the other place them down the middle so
if<00:02:20.939> a<00:02:21.390> vehicle<00:02:21.689> runs<00:02:22.079> down<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:23.700> middle<00:02:23.879> of<00:02:23.999> the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
if a vehicle runs down the middle of the

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.489 
if a vehicle runs down the middle of the
pathway<00:02:24.540> then<00:02:24.749> there<00:02:25.109> you've<00:02:25.319> got<00:02:25.469> a

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:25.499 
pathway then there you've got a

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:28.369 
pathway then there you've got a
guaranteed<00:02:26.069> kill<00:02:26.310> just<00:02:27.150> like<00:02:27.299> here<00:02:27.599> on<00:02:27.780> flood

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
guaranteed kill just like here on flood

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:29.839 
guaranteed kill just like here on flood

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.140 
using this tactic olivia is driving
through<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:33.180> middle<00:02:33.450> it's<00:02:34.409> just<00:02:34.769> a

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
through the middle it's just a

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.599 
through the middle it's just a
guaranteed<00:02:36.150> kill<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:37.250> finally<00:02:38.250> Hainan

guaranteed kill and finally Hainan
resort<00:02:39.200> obviously<00:02:40.200> these<00:02:40.439> little<00:02:40.739> pathways

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:41.219 
resort obviously these little pathways

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.759 
resort obviously these little pathways
here<00:02:41.489> you<00:02:42.060> can<00:02:42.269> just<00:02:42.450> place<00:02:42.689> again<00:02:43.469> three

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
here you can just place again three

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.589 
here you can just place again three
slams<00:02:44.099> that<00:02:44.939> are<00:02:45.060> straight<00:02:45.269> down<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.569> middle

slams that are straight down the middle

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.830 
slams that are straight down the middle
and<00:02:46.250> I've<00:02:47.250> gotten<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.090> many<00:02:48.239> kills<00:02:48.569> I<00:02:48.659> think

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
and I've gotten so many kills I think

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.809 
and I've gotten so many kills I think
I'm<00:02:48.959> right<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.530> don't<00:02:49.829> know<00:02:49.889> number<00:02:50.189> nine<00:02:50.489> or

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
I'm right I don't know number nine or

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.640 
I'm right I don't know number nine or
eight<00:02:51.150> or<00:02:51.659> something<00:02:51.959> like<00:02:52.079> that<00:02:52.139> in<00:02:52.530> the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
eight or something like that in the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.949 
eight or something like that in the
world<00:02:52.859> and<00:02:53.159> mine<00:02:53.939> kills<00:02:54.209> on<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:54.419> Xbox<00:02:54.719> one

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
world and mine kills on the Xbox one

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.979 
world and mine kills on the Xbox one
so<00:02:55.739> I've<00:02:56.549> trust<00:02:56.939> me<00:02:57.090> when<00:02:57.239> I<00:02:57.269> say<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:57.569> it's<00:02:57.719> a

if you spot them you can obviously spot

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.280 
if you spot them you can obviously spot
the<00:03:06.299> mines<00:03:06.510> but<00:03:06.750> nobody<00:03:07.109> spots<00:03:07.680> on<00:03:08.069> if<00:03:08.519> they're

when they're driving with a tank but
what<00:03:16.680> I<00:03:16.709> haven't<00:03:17.069> tried<00:03:17.250> is<00:03:17.489> shoot<00:03:17.819> making

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
what I haven't tried is shoot making

what I haven't tried is shoot making
them<00:03:18.719> explode<00:03:19.079> I<00:03:19.230> don't<00:03:19.379> know<00:03:19.469> if<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:19.680> can

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
them explode I don't know if you can

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.550 
them explode I don't know if you can

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
spot them and shoot them you probably

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.439

slammed mine in water myself but I

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.960 
slammed mine in water myself but I
assume<00:03:28.739> that's<00:03:28.949> the<00:03:29.009> way<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.280> go<00:03:29.549> you<00:03:29.729> know<00:03:29.909> you

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
assume that's the way to go you know you

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.089 
assume that's the way to go you know you
just<00:03:30.299> spot<00:03:30.569> them<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:30.900> blow<00:03:31.290> them<00:03:31.500> up<00:03:31.590> before

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
just spot them and blow them up before

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.249 
just spot them and blow them up before
you<00:03:32.189> go<00:03:32.340> past<00:03:32.609> them<00:03:32.790> but<00:03:33.030> just<00:03:33.569> people<00:03:33.989> are<00:03:34.079> too
