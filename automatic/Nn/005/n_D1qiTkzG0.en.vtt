rain here but you're going to see the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.420 
rain here but you're going to see the
streak<00:02:09.690> across<00:02:09.840> kansas<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.009> in

a<00:02:11.569> Missouri<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:12.719> Arkansas<00:02:12.959> there's<00:02:13.349> another

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
a Missouri and Arkansas there's another

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.559 
a Missouri and Arkansas there's another
short<00:02:14.310> way<00:02:14.489> of<00:02:14.609> another<00:02:14.790> disturbance<00:02:15.390> which

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
short way of another disturbance which

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.740 
short way of another disturbance which
is<00:02:15.719> coming<00:02:15.900> through<00:02:16.489> Mexico<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:17.819> moving<00:02:18.540> into

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
is coming through Mexico and moving into

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.449 
is coming through Mexico and moving into
the<00:02:18.840> South<00:02:19.049> if<00:02:19.260> these<00:02:19.739> two<00:02:19.980> were<00:02:20.129> to<00:02:20.250> combine

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
the South if these two were to combine

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.000 
the South if these two were to combine
phase<00:02:21.090> come<00:02:21.780> together<00:02:21.930> our<00:02:22.319> snow<00:02:22.560> chances

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
phase come together our snow chances

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.490 
phase come together our snow chances
would<00:02:23.189> be<00:02:23.450> much<00:02:24.450> much<00:02:24.689> better<00:02:24.900> but<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.200> really

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
would be much much better but I really

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.830 
would be much much better but I really
think<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:25.859> one's<00:02:26.099> going<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.280> jump<00:02:26.549> out<00:02:26.640> ahead

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
think this one's going to jump out ahead

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.479 
think this one's going to jump out ahead
and<00:02:27.840> then<00:02:28.019> this<00:02:28.139> one<00:02:28.200> digs<00:02:28.530> in<00:02:28.739> after<00:02:29.099> it<00:02:29.129> so

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
and then this one digs in after it so

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.550 
and then this one digs in after it so
the<00:02:29.700> timing<00:02:29.969> of<00:02:30.180> this<00:02:30.299> isn't<00:02:30.629> right<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.109> it's

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
the timing of this isn't right so it's

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.259 
the timing of this isn't right so it's
just<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.889> northern<00:02:32.400> stream<00:02:32.700> energy<00:02:32.849> for<00:02:33.209> the

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
just the northern stream energy for the

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.699 
just the northern stream energy for the
most<00:02:33.480> part<00:02:33.659> that's<00:02:33.900> what's<00:02:34.079> bringing<00:02:34.290> us<00:02:34.560> the

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
most part that's what's bringing us the

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.500 
most part that's what's bringing us the
chance<00:02:34.950> for<00:02:35.129> any<00:02:35.250> snow<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:35.790> again<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.180> can't

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
chance for any snow and again I can't

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.270 
chance for any snow and again I can't
stress<00:02:36.659> this<00:02:36.930> enough<00:02:36.989> it's<00:02:37.739> not<00:02:37.859> all<00:02:38.129> that

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
stress this enough it's not all that

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.559 
stress this enough it's not all that
good<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.579> see<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.849> northern<00:02:39.209> stream<00:02:39.420> energy

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
good you see that northern stream energy

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:40.879 
good you see that northern stream energy
there<00:02:40.019> and<00:02:40.170> then<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.349> southern<00:02:40.650> stream

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:40.889 
there and then the southern stream

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.589 
there and then the southern stream
energy<00:02:41.069> over<00:02:41.489> there<00:02:41.700> look<00:02:42.689> at<00:02:42.900> this<00:02:43.159> whoops

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
energy over there look at this whoops

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.110 
energy over there look at this whoops
what<00:02:45.599> have<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:45.780> done<00:02:45.919> look<00:02:46.919> at<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.189> rainfall

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
what have I done look at the rainfall

will warm up this weekend so this is yet
another<00:03:14.849> cold<00:03:15.359> snap<00:03:15.510> now<00:03:15.840> this<00:03:15.989> is<00:03:16.049> high

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
another cold snap now this is high

another cold snap now this is high
resolution<00:03:17.010> Futurecast<00:03:17.639> and<00:03:17.940> this<00:03:18.060> isn't<00:03:18.359> one

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
resolution Futurecast and this isn't one

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.270

of<00:03:18.540> those<00:03:18.629> new<00:03:19.169> products<00:03:19.620> that<00:03:19.739> we<00:03:19.829> have<00:03:20.040> and

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
of those new products that we have and

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.860 
of those new products that we have and
you<00:03:20.729> can<00:03:20.879> really<00:03:21.060> see<00:03:21.299> when<00:03:21.419> i<00:03:21.479> was<00:03:21.599> talking

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
you can really see when i was talking

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.449 
you can really see when i was talking
about<00:03:22.049> that<00:03:22.169> short<00:03:22.470> wave<00:03:22.620> energy<00:03:22.859> coming<00:03:23.280> out

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
about that short wave energy coming out

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.580 
about that short wave energy coming out
of<00:03:23.669> the<00:03:24.090> south<00:03:24.329> and<00:03:24.629> then<00:03:24.810> this<00:03:24.989> one<00:03:25.139> coming<00:03:25.379> in

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
of the south and then this one coming in

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.899 
of the south and then this one coming in
from<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:25.949> north<00:03:26.129> this<00:03:26.280> one's<00:03:26.459> going<00:03:26.639> to<00:03:26.669> stay

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909 
from the north this one's going to stay

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.939 
from the north this one's going to stay
ahead<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.479> go<00:03:27.599> out<00:03:27.780> towards<00:03:28.139> say<00:03:28.439> south<00:03:28.709> and

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:28.949 
ahead and go out towards say south and

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:30.559 
ahead and go out towards say south and
go<00:03:29.040> east<00:03:29.310> this<00:03:29.760> one's<00:03:29.970> going<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.150> dig<00:03:30.389> in

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
go east this one's going to dig in

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.719 
go east this one's going to dig in
behind<00:03:30.989> it<00:03:31.169> if<00:03:31.319> again<00:03:32.010> if<00:03:32.069> these<00:03:32.340> two<00:03:32.519> were<00:03:32.609> to

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:32.729 
behind it if again if these two were to

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:34.909 
behind it if again if these two were to
come<00:03:32.879> together<00:03:33.079> we<00:03:34.079> be<00:03:34.290> talking<00:03:34.620> about<00:03:34.680> better

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
come together we be talking about better

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:36.649 
come together we be talking about better
precipitation<00:03:35.729> chances<00:03:35.879> but<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.329> see<00:03:36.479> that

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
precipitation chances but you see that

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:37.849 
precipitation chances but you see that
jumps<00:03:36.959> out<00:03:37.049> ahead<00:03:37.199> and<00:03:37.530> then<00:03:37.620> there's<00:03:37.799> that

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
jumps out ahead and then there's that

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.740 
jumps out ahead and then there's that
band<00:03:38.189> of<00:03:38.340> snow<00:03:38.459> this<00:03:38.760> is<00:03:38.939> Wednesday<00:03:39.299> night<00:03:39.510> at

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
band of snow this is Wednesday night at

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.719 
band of snow this is Wednesday night at
eleven<00:03:40.409> o'clock<00:03:40.470> you<00:03:40.859> see<00:03:41.009> the<00:03:41.129> snows<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.639> the

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:41.729 
eleven o'clock you see the snows and the

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:43.280 
eleven o'clock you see the snows and the
purples<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:42.479> the<00:03:42.599> whites<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.049> maybe<00:03:43.199> a

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
purples and the whites and maybe a

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.539 
purples and the whites and maybe a
little<00:03:43.439> bit<00:03:43.620> of<00:03:43.739> rain<00:03:43.919> and<00:03:44.129> Central<00:03:44.370> Arkansas

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
little bit of rain and Central Arkansas

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.670 
little bit of rain and Central Arkansas
transitioning<00:03:45.419> to<00:03:45.509> a<00:03:45.540> few<00:03:45.780> snow<00:03:46.109> flurries<00:03:46.349> and

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
transitioning to a few snow flurries and

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.409 
transitioning to a few snow flurries and
then<00:03:47.250> we're<00:03:47.370> back<00:03:47.519> to<00:03:47.579> some<00:03:47.909> drier<00:03:48.150> weather

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
then we're back to some drier weather

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:51.379 
then we're back to some drier weather
after<00:03:48.900> that<00:03:49.079> so<00:03:49.620> again<00:03:50.400> we<00:03:50.519> have<00:03:50.639> access<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.150> so

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
after that so again we have access to so

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.179 
after that so again we have access to so
many<00:03:51.540> different<00:03:51.689> computer<00:03:52.349> models<00:03:52.680> now<00:03:52.889> and

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:53.189 
many different computer models now and

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:54.619 
many different computer models now and
Futurecast<00:03:53.819> this<00:03:54.030> is<00:03:54.150> not<00:03:54.299> the<00:03:54.479> high

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
Futurecast this is not the high

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.039 
Futurecast this is not the high
resolution<00:03:54.919> Futurecast<00:03:56.509> this<00:03:57.509> is<00:03:57.689> high<00:03:57.840> res

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
resolution Futurecast this is high res

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.080 
resolution Futurecast this is high res
data<00:03:58.319> but<00:03:58.530> we<00:03:58.889> have<00:03:59.040> even<00:03:59.280> higher<00:03:59.430> resolution

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
data but we have even higher resolution

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.610 
data but we have even higher resolution
stuff<00:04:00.299> and<00:04:00.479> I<00:04:00.540> think<00:04:00.780> this<00:04:00.870> is<00:04:00.930> a<00:04:01.079> little<00:04:01.169> bit

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
stuff and I think this is a little bit

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.879 
stuff and I think this is a little bit
ambitious<00:04:02.129> uh<00:04:02.720> you<00:04:03.720> know<00:04:03.810> two<00:04:04.470> tenths<00:04:04.709> of<00:04:04.799> an

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
ambitious uh you know two tenths of an

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:06.439 
ambitious uh you know two tenths of an
inch<00:04:04.979> and<00:04:05.159> that's<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.370> thing<00:04:05.579> when<00:04:05.759> we<00:04:06.120> when<00:04:06.419> I

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449 
inch and that's the thing when we when I

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.539 
inch and that's the thing when we when I
show<00:04:06.720> you<00:04:06.780> these<00:04:06.959> maps<00:04:07.259> on<00:04:07.439> the<00:04:07.470> blog<00:04:07.739> don't

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
show you these maps on the blog don't

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.159 
show you these maps on the blog don't
think<00:04:08.790> oh<00:04:08.909> my<00:04:09.060> gosh<00:04:09.090> baseball<00:04:09.840> we're<00:04:09.989> going<00:04:10.109> to

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
think oh my gosh baseball we're going to

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.399 
think oh my gosh baseball we're going to
get<00:04:10.259> seven<00:04:10.620> tenths<00:04:10.859> of<00:04:11.009> an<00:04:11.129> inch<00:04:11.220> of<00:04:11.430> snow<00:04:11.489> no

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:12.409 
get seven tenths of an inch of snow no

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:14.719 
get seven tenths of an inch of snow no
none<00:04:13.409> of<00:04:13.560> this<00:04:13.650> is<00:04:13.799> going<00:04:13.949> to<00:04:14.009> be<00:04:14.159> right<00:04:14.370> that's

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:14.729 
none of this is going to be right that's

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:16.930 
none of this is going to be right that's
why<00:04:14.939> i<00:04:14.970> would<00:04:15.299> say<00:04:15.479> in<00:04:15.629> this<00:04:15.750> area<00:04:16.139> especially

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
why i would say in this area especially

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
you're going to see a dusting to maybe

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.899 
you're going to see a dusting to maybe
an<00:04:19.349> inch<00:04:19.560> just<00:04:19.650> right<00:04:20.310> in<00:04:20.459> this<00:04:20.579> area<00:04:20.729> so

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909 
an inch just right in this area so

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:23.089 
an inch just right in this area so
jonesboro<00:04:21.570> may<00:04:21.719> come<00:04:21.900> in<00:04:22.019> with<00:04:22.169> only<00:04:22.349> a<00:04:22.650> tenth

jonesboro may come in with only a tenth

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:25.129 
jonesboro may come in with only a tenth
of<00:04:23.219> an<00:04:23.340> inch<00:04:23.570> baseball<00:04:24.570> may<00:04:24.690> only<00:04:24.840> come<00:04:24.990> in

with

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.000 
with
an<00:04:25.570> inch<00:04:25.750> and<00:04:25.960> Harrison<00:04:26.260> only<00:04:26.440> one<00:04:26.590> inch<00:04:26.800> so

an inch and Harrison only one inch so
this<00:04:27.730> just<00:04:27.850> gives<00:04:27.940> you<00:04:28.180> a<00:04:28.210> good<00:04:28.420> general<00:04:28.780> idea

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
this just gives you a good general idea

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.330 
this just gives you a good general idea
where<00:04:29.230> I<00:04:29.290> think<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:29.590> best<00:04:29.800> chance<00:04:30.040> and<00:04:30.220> this

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
where I think the best chance and this

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.770 
where I think the best chance and this
model<00:04:30.550> is<00:04:30.760> aggressive<00:04:31.240> with<00:04:31.360> bringing<00:04:31.600> it

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
model is aggressive with bringing it

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.930 
model is aggressive with bringing it
further<00:04:31.990> south<00:04:32.290> but<00:04:32.320> I<00:04:32.500> just<00:04:32.770> it<00:04:33.310> can't<00:04:33.670> buy<00:04:33.910> it

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
further south but I just it can't buy it

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.200 
further south but I just it can't buy it
at<00:04:34.210> all<00:04:34.890> anyway<00:04:35.890> here's<00:04:36.190> another<00:04:36.700> computer

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
at all anyway here's another computer

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.880 
at all anyway here's another computer
model<00:04:37.540> here<00:04:37.840> and<00:04:37.990> this<00:04:38.350> shows<00:04:38.530> you<00:04:38.710> where<00:04:38.860> the

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
model here and this shows you where the

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.140 
model here and this shows you where the
rain<00:04:39.130> is<00:04:39.160> going<00:04:39.340> to<00:04:39.430> be<00:04:39.520> where<00:04:39.670> the<00:04:39.790> snow<00:04:39.970> it's

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
rain is going to be where the snow it's

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.460 
rain is going to be where the snow it's
more<00:04:40.330> aggressive<00:04:40.720> with<00:04:40.870> it<00:04:40.900> on<00:04:41.170> thursday

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
more aggressive with it on thursday

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.470 
more aggressive with it on thursday
morning<00:04:41.890> at<00:04:41.920> three<00:04:42.130> o'clock<00:04:42.220> you<00:04:43.120> see<00:04:43.300> the

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
morning at three o'clock you see the

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.570 
morning at three o'clock you see the
snow<00:04:43.930> flying<00:04:44.170> in<00:04:44.350> the<00:04:44.470> white<00:04:44.650> and<00:04:44.890> again<00:04:45.460> this

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
snow flying in the white and again this

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.400 
snow flying in the white and again this
is<00:04:45.760> aggressive<00:04:46.270> with<00:04:46.450> bringing<00:04:46.690> snow<00:04:47.170> fall

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
is aggressive with bringing snow fall

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.530 
is aggressive with bringing snow fall
too<00:04:47.590> much<00:04:47.770> of<00:04:47.950> the<00:04:48.010> state<00:04:48.250> and<00:04:48.580> I'm<00:04:49.180> not<00:04:49.360> quite

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
too much of the state and I'm not quite

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.420 
too much of the state and I'm not quite
sure<00:04:49.570> why<00:04:49.870> it's<00:04:50.020> printing<00:04:50.500> out<00:04:50.590> some<00:04:50.830> precip

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
sure why it's printing out some precip

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.730 
sure why it's printing out some precip
amounts<00:04:51.790> of<00:04:51.910> snow<00:04:52.200> southern<00:04:53.200> Arkansas<00:04:53.590> and

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
amounts of snow southern Arkansas and

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.560 
amounts of snow southern Arkansas and
that<00:04:53.860> should<00:04:54.040> be<00:04:54.070> just<00:04:54.130> rained<00:04:54.580> but<00:04:54.850> all

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
that should be just rained but all

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.930 
that should be just rained but all
mounts<00:04:56.050> here<00:04:56.170> under<00:04:56.500> one<00:04:56.680> inch<00:04:56.950> but<00:04:57.430> I<00:04:57.460> really

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
mounts here under one inch but I really

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.820 
mounts here under one inch but I really
think<00:04:58.150> and<00:04:58.390> this<00:04:58.480> is<00:04:58.690> the<00:04:58.840> model<00:04:59.320> that<00:04:59.350> I<00:04:59.530> think

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
think and this is the model that I think

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.080 
think and this is the model that I think
is<00:04:59.920> going<00:05:00.070> to<00:05:00.130> have<00:05:00.250> the<00:05:00.280> better<00:05:00.520> handle<00:05:01.000> on

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
is going to have the better handle on

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.370 
is going to have the better handle on
this<00:05:01.300> right<00:05:01.540> here<00:05:01.720> very<00:05:01.930> high-resolution

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
this right here very high-resolution

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.290 
this right here very high-resolution
stuff<00:05:02.950> and<00:05:03.160> you<00:05:03.220> see<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.490> scale<00:05:03.700> here<00:05:04.000> trace

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
stuff and you see the scale here trace

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.900 
stuff and you see the scale here trace
to<00:05:04.450> one<00:05:04.600> inch<00:05:04.890> over<00:05:05.890> northern<00:05:06.220> Arkansas<00:05:06.670> I

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
to one inch over northern Arkansas I

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.820 
to one inch over northern Arkansas I
think<00:05:07.360> that's<00:05:07.540> the<00:05:07.690> best<00:05:07.840> forecast<00:05:08.170> in<00:05:08.560> this

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
think that's the best forecast in this

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.170 
think that's the best forecast in this
area<00:05:09.160> of<00:05:09.220> the<00:05:09.280> state<00:05:09.430> maybe<00:05:09.670> just<00:05:09.910> a<00:05:10.000> little

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
area of the state maybe just a little

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.970 
area of the state maybe just a little
bit<00:05:10.360> further<00:05:10.630> south<00:05:10.870> i<00:05:11.050> would<00:05:11.200> say<00:05:11.410> from

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
bit further south i would say from

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.310 
bit further south i would say from
Washington<00:05:12.640> County<00:05:13.030> back<00:05:13.630> in<00:05:13.840> the<00:05:13.930> northern

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
Washington County back in the northern

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.560 
Washington County back in the northern
Faulkner<00:05:14.680> County<00:05:14.760> White<00:05:15.760> County<00:05:15.970> maybe<00:05:16.330> near

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
Faulkner County White County maybe near

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.210 
Faulkner County White County maybe near
Cersei<00:05:17.020> into<00:05:17.200> West<00:05:17.350> Memphis<00:05:17.530> this<00:05:17.800> can<00:05:17.950> always

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
Cersei into West Memphis this can always

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.520 
Cersei into West Memphis this can always
change<00:05:18.430> but<00:05:18.700> it's<00:05:18.820> in<00:05:18.970> this<00:05:19.120> area<00:05:19.510> a<00:05:19.690> dusting

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
change but it's in this area a dusting

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.310 
change but it's in this area a dusting
to<00:05:20.560> one<00:05:20.830> inch<00:05:21.040> I<00:05:21.310> wish<00:05:22.210> there<00:05:22.450> no<00:05:22.930> I<00:05:22.960> could<00:05:23.200> do

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320

back up for the weekend i showed you
that<00:05:59.440> pacific<00:05:59.890> jet<00:06:00.130> really<00:06:00.400> bringing<00:06:00.610> that

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
that pacific jet really bringing that

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.190 
that pacific jet really bringing that
moisture<00:06:01.180> into<00:06:01.390> the<00:06:01.480> west<00:06:01.630> coast<00:06:01.840> whenever

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
moisture into the west coast whenever

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.380 
moisture into the west coast whenever
you<00:06:02.290> see<00:06:02.440> that<00:06:02.620> usually<00:06:03.280> the<00:06:03.310> western<00:06:04.210> and

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:04.390 
you see that usually the western and

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.730 
you see that usually the western and
central<00:06:04.480> united<00:06:04.870> states<00:06:05.050> can<00:06:05.290> really<00:06:05.620> get

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
central united states can really get

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.530 
central united states can really get
flooded<00:06:06.010> with<00:06:06.220> some<00:06:06.460> mild<00:06:06.940> air<00:06:07.180> and<00:06:07.300> i<00:06:07.330> think

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:07.540 
flooded with some mild air and i think

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.570
