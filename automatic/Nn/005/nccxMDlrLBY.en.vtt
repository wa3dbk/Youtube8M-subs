into hardcore and pretty much got to the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.430 
into hardcore and pretty much got to the
point<00:00:57.210> where<00:00:57.390> all<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.600> really<00:00:57.870> play<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.289> hard

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
point where all I really play as hard

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.750 
point where all I really play as hard
for<00:00:58.739> unless<00:00:58.949> I'm<00:00:59.070> playing<00:00:59.250> with<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.460> majority

for unless I'm playing with the majority
of<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.149> players<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.629> party<00:01:01.020> don't<00:01:01.620> enjoy

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
of the players in the party don't enjoy

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.680 
of the players in the party don't enjoy
hardcore<00:01:02.399> then<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.609> will<00:01:02.850> play<00:01:03.059> poor<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.570> can

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
hardcore then I will play poor and I can

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.870 
hardcore then I will play poor and I can
still<00:01:03.870> drop<00:01:03.989> Kem's<00:01:04.260> on<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:05.220> hardcore<00:01:05.700> for

still drop Kem's on it the hardcore for
me<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.090> think<00:01:06.330> it's<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.780> bit<00:01:06.960> more

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
me I think it's just a bit more

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.870 
me I think it's just a bit more
fast-paced<00:01:07.950> because<00:01:08.130> at<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> time<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.670> kill

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
fast-paced because at the time to kill

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.960 
fast-paced because at the time to kill
and<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.840> fact<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:11.070> players<00:01:11.369> they<00:01:11.670> rush

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
and the fact that the players they rush

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.670 
and the fact that the players they rush
more<00:01:12.240> unless<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.780> get<00:01:12.869> every<00:01:13.409> now<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.650> again
