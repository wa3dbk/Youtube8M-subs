 as for the cruelty with which

 punished enemies and traitors in addition 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.899
 it was the historical character in which he 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.579

 they work in the aforementioned temple they gave 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.569
 notice that the tombstone in question 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.030
 It was full of symbols of

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.860
 permission of the authorities to open the 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.950

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.420
 these scholars greet them figaredo 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.420
 until next time
