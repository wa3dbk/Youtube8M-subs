00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.060
 first letter to the Corinthians chapter 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:09.430
 13 treaty of charity 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:13.000
 although I speak the language of men 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:16.150
 and of the angels if I do not have love I am 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.510
 like bronze that sounds and you inba what 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.789
 retreat and even if it has a gift of prophecy and 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.519
 know all the mysteries and all the 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.910
 science and have all the faith in a way that 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:29.039
 move mountains if I do not have love anything 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.250
 I am 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.010
 and if to divide my farm all and if 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.610
 give my body to be burned more 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.820
 I do not have charity, nothing takes advantage of me 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.239
 love is patient love is benign without 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.250
 envy love do not extract anxious do not know 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.280
 conceited does nothing other than 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.729
 convenient does not seek his own not 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.760
 irritates does not think bad does not rejoice in 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:01:00.210
 injustice before you rejoice with the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.049
 truth everything copes everything believes 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.290
 everything waits for everything love supports 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.259
 the prophecies never end 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.170
 will finish the languages will cease the 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.829
 science will end because only in 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.140
 part we know and in part we prophesy 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:21.300
 more when the perfect arrives then 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.730
 the partial will end 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.550
 when I was a child I spoke like a child 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.620
 I thought like a child 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.930
 I reasoned like another child when I arrived 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.230
 to be a man I got rid of the things of 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.990
 child because now we look at an enigma to 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.930
 through a mirror more then we will see 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.450
 face to face now I know in part 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.570
 then I will fully know the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.670
 way that I was also known to 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.960
 present remains in faith hope 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:55.190
 and charity you are three plus the greatest of 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.190
 they are charity
