00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700
 They say they are already doing marketing and have to come out in a few months 

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.920
 Beta version was a disaster 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.560
 He wasn't done 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.160
 We took eights and added a few bullshit 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.340
 But Bill came and says, "We have to release a complete system in half a year" 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.080
 Show me what you created 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.420
 The eights were stone 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.340
 There is no time 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.780
 And my gaze was like 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.320
 It doesn't mean it 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.260
 To be sold, we would have to start from the ground up because we cannot build on the eights. 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.673
 And then I thought ... 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.071
 We will finish development and give them free 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.420
 Unfinished 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.620
 FREE 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.020
 Because the estimated profit from the sale would not even partially cover other development costs 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.580
 Betu 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.140
 And you know what Bill? 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.920
 We will secretly download personal data from each user with a dozen 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.700
 And we combine all the personal data into a database that we sell to ads around the world. 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.180
 And we'll earn even more than selling the tens 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.080
 Just agree to the installation 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.160
 Nobody's reading it anyway 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.360
 Just turn on the site and within a few moments we have a photo on the server 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.540
 Every 30 minutes we know who typed in the keyboard 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.220
 And it's all legal 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.360
 And you know what? 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.640
 We've got "Feedback" 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.700
 And those idiots think somebody is reading it 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.980
 Thanks for the next data package, we're sending to the database 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.900
 All about your device and your personal information 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.180
 I know 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.480
 Another annoying uselessness 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.120
 But what do you want 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.240
 Microsoft 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.780
 Well, wait, wait 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.540
 Cortana 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.300
 I saw the movie "Her" and their idea was amazing 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.700
 The operating system that talks to you 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.420
 So you can say anything 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.340
 Everything is uploaded on our server 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.960
 Every word 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.472
 Cognition 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.540
 We said Cortana was learning about the device 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.440
 And they can turn it off 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.780
 So hi 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.500
 You can 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.940
 You can 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.760
 You can play stone scissors paper 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.480
 But such bullshit is not sent to us because we don't have such server capacity. 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.460
 We already have to expand servers because everyone installs it 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.800
 And whoever has not downloaded it will have a notification on the desktop that cannot be turned off. 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.160
 Until he withdraws it 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.640
 Just like you say 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.020
 We know how to piss people 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.740
 Just a good idea 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.660
 Even in Google, we envy our huge database 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.020
 Well 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.360
 And how big are you currently having a database? 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.640
 Several tens of millions of users, at least so far 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.260
 Because others are waiting to fix the mistakes 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.760
 So we estimate about one billion 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.900
 Some will not be able to look in the mirror 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.880
 Everything is sold 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.760
 Isn't it a century robbery? 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.600
 It's good that I said it all here, we already have full data
