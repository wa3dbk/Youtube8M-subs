calories<00:01:46.200> do<00:01:46.470> count<00:01:46.890> but<00:01:47.520> saying<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.060> it's

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
calories do count but saying that it's

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.330

simply calories in versus calories out

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.380 
simply calories in versus calories out
is<00:01:50.790> not<00:01:51.360> true<00:01:51.750> that's<00:01:52.110> an<00:01:52.229> oversimplification

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
is not true that's an oversimplification

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.620 
is not true that's an oversimplification
for<00:01:54.390> example<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.110> could<00:01:55.649> say<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:55.979> well<00:01:56.820> to

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
for example you could say that well to

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.840 
for example you could say that well to
be<00:01:58.229> able<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.469> save<00:01:58.799> more<00:01:58.829> money<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.490> just<00:01:59.549> have

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
be able to save more money you just have

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.399 
be able to save more money you just have
to<00:01:59.969> make<00:02:00.149> more<00:02:00.420> money<00:02:00.600> then<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:00.930> can<00:02:01.200> save

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
to make more money then you can save

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.090 
to make more money then you can save
more<00:02:01.619> money<00:02:02.180> well<00:02:03.180> that's<00:02:03.810> not<00:02:04.500> necessarily

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
more money well that's not necessarily

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.190 
more money well that's not necessarily
the<00:02:05.250> case<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.759> depends<00:02:06.270> on<00:02:06.420> how<00:02:06.810> much<00:02:06.990> you

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
the case it depends on how much you

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.889 
the case it depends on how much you
spend<00:02:07.350> what<00:02:07.829> your<00:02:08.009> budget<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.550> what<00:02:09.000> well<00:02:09.660> your

spend what your budget is what well your
house<00:02:10.110> payment<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.830> or<00:02:11.069> your<00:02:11.220> rent<00:02:11.489> or<00:02:11.760> your

car
and<00:02:13.120> so<00:02:13.269> on<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:14.469> you<00:02:14.530> see<00:02:14.769> just<00:02:15.340> as<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:15.819> blanket

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420

and so on so you see just as a blanket
statement<00:02:16.450> saying<00:02:17.079> people<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:17.620> make<00:02:17.859> more

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
statement saying people that make more

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.119 
statement saying people that make more
have<00:02:18.430> more<00:02:18.730> in<00:02:18.819> savings<00:02:19.090> that's<00:02:19.900> wrong<00:02:20.170> so

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
have more in savings that's wrong so

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.699 
have more in savings that's wrong so
it's<00:02:21.549> the<00:02:21.700> same<00:02:21.819> with<00:02:22.329> calories<00:02:22.870> all<00:02:23.109> calories

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
it's the same with calories all calories

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.280

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
on something you know how calories are

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.330 
on something you know how calories are
measured<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:29.170> how<00:02:29.319> scientists<00:02:30.310> determine

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
how many calories are in a food they

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.550 
how many calories are in a food they

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
light the food on fire basically they

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.009 
light the food on fire basically they
burn<00:02:35.859> it<00:02:36.069> in<00:02:36.609> a<00:02:36.819> laboratory<00:02:37.090> setting<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.959> they

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
burn it in a laboratory setting and they

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.110 
burn it in a laboratory setting and they
measure<00:02:38.319> how<00:02:38.680> much<00:02:38.829> heat<00:02:39.159> is<00:02:39.280> given<00:02:39.579> off<00:02:39.819> and

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
measure how much heat is given off and

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.170 
measure how much heat is given off and
that's<00:02:40.720> how<00:02:40.870> many<00:02:41.049> calories<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.650> has<00:02:41.849> well<00:02:42.849> I'm

that's how many calories it has well I'm

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.940 
that's how many calories it has well I'm

and differently than that and alcohol so

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.520

nonetheless when your body eats protein

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.539 
nonetheless when your body eats protein
that<00:03:06.790> is<00:03:06.970> primarily<00:03:07.359> used<00:03:08.019> to<00:03:08.799> build<00:03:09.220> things

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
that is primarily used to build things

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.479 
that is primarily used to build things
with<00:03:09.989> whereas<00:03:10.989> carbohydrates<00:03:11.799> are<00:03:11.980> primarily

with whereas carbohydrates are primarily
used<00:03:12.819> for<00:03:12.939> energy<00:03:13.260> so<00:03:14.260> your<00:03:14.470> body<00:03:14.590> doesn't

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:14.919 
used for energy so your body doesn't

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:19.349 
used for energy so your body doesn't
treat<00:03:15.639> those<00:03:16.030> two<00:03:16.379> equally<00:03:17.379> so<00:03:18.129> just<00:03:19.030> to<00:03:19.150> say

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
treat those two equally so just to say

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.390 
treat those two equally so just to say
that<00:03:19.599> it's<00:03:19.750> simply<00:03:20.109> calories<00:03:20.739> is<00:03:21.010> silly

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
that it's simply calories is silly

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.409 
that it's simply calories is silly
another<00:03:22.269> example<00:03:22.510> is<00:03:23.079> how<00:03:23.709> often<00:03:24.430> you<00:03:24.549> eat<00:03:24.819> for

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:25.419 
another example is how often you eat for

or<00:04:21.130> experience<00:04:21.639> under<00:04:21.880> my<00:04:21.940> belt<00:04:22.029> not<00:04:22.690> only

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
or experience under my belt not only

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.520 
or experience under my belt not only
doing<00:04:23.169> it<00:04:23.289> myself<00:04:23.440> but<00:04:23.830> helping<00:04:24.130> others

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
doing it myself but helping others

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.810 
doing it myself but helping others
doing<00:04:24.680> this<00:04:24.770> so<00:04:24.980> it's<00:04:25.100> not<00:04:25.250> just<00:04:25.610> a

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
doing this so it's not just a

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.700 
doing this so it's not just a
off-the-cuff<00:04:26.780> guest<00:04:27.139> but<00:04:28.040> in<00:04:28.250> my<00:04:28.510> the<00:04:29.510> 17<00:04:30.290> 18

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
off-the-cuff guest but in my the 17 18

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.360 
off-the-cuff guest but in my the 17 18
going<00:04:31.100> on<00:04:31.220> 19<00:04:31.370> years<00:04:31.940> of<00:04:32.120> experience<00:04:32.690> now<00:04:32.930> I

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
going on 19 years of experience now I

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.750 
going on 19 years of experience now I
would<00:04:34.370> say<00:04:34.639> that<00:04:34.970> it<00:04:35.120> matters<00:04:35.600> even<00:04:36.230> more

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
would say that it matters even more

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.030 
would say that it matters even more
actually<00:04:37.930> what<00:04:38.930> type<00:04:39.260> of<00:04:39.290> calories<00:04:39.889> you

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
actually what type of calories you

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.340 
actually what type of calories you
consume<00:04:40.220> and<00:04:40.760> exactly<00:04:41.540> when<00:04:41.840> you<00:04:41.990> consume

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
consume and exactly when you consume

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.070 
consume and exactly when you consume
them<00:04:42.820> so<00:04:43.820> I<00:04:44.180> hope<00:04:45.139> that<00:04:45.200> makes<00:04:45.770> sense<00:04:45.919> and<00:04:46.340> that

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
them so I hope that makes sense and that

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.990 
them so I hope that makes sense and that
clarifies<00:04:48.080> and<00:04:48.440> dispels<00:04:48.919> once<00:04:49.580> and<00:04:49.790> for<00:04:49.940> all
