00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.790 
it's got a big knob here that you turnin
you<00:02:43.790> you<00:02:44.090> can<00:02:44.270> assign<00:02:44.570> various<00:02:45.380> things<00:02:45.590> to

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
you you can assign various things to

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.110 
you you can assign various things to
this<00:02:45.950> I<00:02:45.980> think<00:02:46.130> through<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.700> software

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
this I think through the software

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.350 
this I think through the software
interface<00:02:51.459> I'll<00:02:52.459> open<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:52.790> first<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.330> then

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
interface I'll open it first and then

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.750 
interface I'll open it first and then
show<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.170> inputs<00:02:54.860> on<00:02:55.010> it<00:02:55.130> to<00:02:55.580> get<00:02:55.700> a

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
show you the inputs on it to get a

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.199 
show you the inputs on it to get a

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:26.559 

go<00:03:20.329> into<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:20.959> box<00:03:21.290> there<00:03:22.129> we<00:03:22.219> go<00:03:25.450> all<00:03:26.450> right

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
go into the box there we go all right

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.009 
go into the box there we go all right
it's<00:03:27.019> smaller<00:03:27.349> than<00:03:27.500> I<00:03:27.680> imagined<00:03:28.129> actually<00:03:29.019> so

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
it's smaller than I imagined actually so

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.729 
it's smaller than I imagined actually so
it's<00:03:30.349> definitely<00:03:30.799> pocket-sized<00:03:31.700> there<00:03:32.180> we<00:03:32.269> go

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
it's definitely pocket-sized there we go

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.339 
it's definitely pocket-sized there we go
let's<00:03:33.739> peel<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.159> plastic<00:03:34.280> off<00:03:34.639> the<00:03:34.700> front<00:03:35.349> it

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
let's peel the plastic off the front it

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.050 
let's peel the plastic off the front it
looks<00:03:36.409> very<00:03:36.620> nice<00:03:37.010> you<00:03:37.250> can<00:03:37.370> see<00:03:37.879> it's

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
looks very nice you can see it's

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.640 
looks very nice you can see it's
definitely<00:03:38.480> designed<00:03:38.870> for<00:03:39.170> use<00:03:39.709> of<00:03:40.269> max<00:03:41.269> I

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
definitely designed for use of max I

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.550 
definitely designed for use of max I
still<00:03:42.650> don't<00:03:42.799> understand<00:03:43.220> why<00:03:44.379> they<00:03:45.379> don't

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
still don't understand why they don't

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.500 
still don't understand why they don't
make<00:03:45.799> it<00:03:46.040> work<00:03:46.760> for<00:03:46.790> windows<00:03:47.329> as<00:03:47.480> well

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
make it work for windows as well

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.020 
make it work for windows as well
personally<00:03:48.379> if<00:03:48.590> this<00:03:48.799> worked<00:03:49.159> on<00:03:49.400> Windows<00:03:49.790> and

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
personally if this worked on Windows and

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.349 
personally if this worked on Windows and
OS<00:03:50.269> 10<00:03:50.930> i'd<00:03:51.109> be<00:03:51.319> more<00:03:52.069> I<00:03:52.400> know<00:03:52.879> it<00:03:53.000> bought<00:03:53.209> it

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
OS 10 i'd be more I know it bought it

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.629 
OS 10 i'd be more I know it bought it
anyway<00:03:53.450> but<00:03:53.750> I'd<00:03:54.590> be<00:03:54.769> more<00:03:54.950> tempted<00:03:55.159> to<00:03:55.430> buy<00:03:55.579> it

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
anyway but I'd be more tempted to buy it

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:59.610 
anyway but I'd be more tempted to buy it
if<00:03:56.209> it<00:03:56.840> was<00:03:56.989> cross<00:03:57.439> platform<00:03:57.950> but<00:03:58.430> never<00:03:58.579> mind

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
if it was cross platform but never mind

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.020 
if it was cross platform but never mind
so<00:04:00.620> on<00:04:00.709> the<00:04:00.799> bottom<00:04:00.980> we've<00:04:01.430> got<00:04:01.900> an<00:04:03.819> outpost<00:04:04.819> I

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
so on the bottom we've got an outpost I

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.009 
so on the bottom we've got an outpost I
think<00:04:05.269> for<00:04:05.480> headphones<00:04:05.930> it's<00:04:06.200> just<00:04:06.409> an<00:04:06.909> 8-inch

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
think for headphones it's just an 8-inch

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.009 
think for headphones it's just an 8-inch
jack<00:04:09.250> I've<00:04:10.250> got<00:04:10.370> that<00:04:10.519> size<00:04:10.790> right<00:04:11.060> on<00:04:11.329> the

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
jack I've got that size right on the

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.649 
jack I've got that size right on the
back<00:04:12.260> we've<00:04:12.530> got<00:04:12.769> two<00:04:13.220> ports<00:04:13.609> USB<00:04:13.790> port<00:04:14.389> to

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:14.659 
back we've got two ports USB port to

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:16.390 
back we've got two ports USB port to
obviously<00:04:15.349> connected<00:04:15.620> to<00:04:15.859> the<00:04:15.919> computer<00:04:16.099> and

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
obviously connected to the computer and

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.729 
obviously connected to the computer and
provide<00:04:16.789> power<00:04:17.180> and<00:04:17.479> data<00:04:17.959> transfer<00:04:18.590> and

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
provide power and data transfer and

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.909 
provide power and data transfer and
we've<00:04:19.699> got<00:04:19.880> another<00:04:20.120> port<00:04:20.479> which<00:04:20.930> is<00:04:21.260> for<00:04:21.799> the

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
we've got another port which is for the

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.070 
we've got another port which is for the
breakout<00:04:22.430> cable<00:04:22.729> which<00:04:23.360> I<00:04:23.510> hope<00:04:23.690> is<00:04:23.840> under

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
breakout cable which I hope is under

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:31.740 
breakout cable which I hope is under
here<00:04:24.260> yes<00:04:28.210> so<00:04:29.210> this<00:04:29.360> is<00:04:29.389> the<00:04:29.539> breakout<00:04:29.960> cable

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
here yes so this is the breakout cable

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.240 
here yes so this is the breakout cable
essentially<00:04:32.750> plug<00:04:33.080> this<00:04:33.289> into<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:34.039> back<00:04:34.220> of

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
essentially plug this into the back of

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.510 
essentially plug this into the back of
here<00:04:34.699> and<00:04:34.880> then<00:04:35.510> on<00:04:35.630> the<00:04:35.780> other<00:04:35.810> end<00:04:36.139> you<00:04:36.520> have

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
here and then on the other end you have

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.469 
here and then on the other end you have
an<00:04:37.699> XLR<00:04:38.330> and<00:04:38.650> quarter<00:04:39.650> inch<00:04:39.800> jack<00:04:39.919> port<00:04:40.820> for

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
an XLR and quarter inch jack port for

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.159 
an XLR and quarter inch jack port for
either<00:04:42.909> like<00:04:43.909> an<00:04:44.060> XLR<00:04:44.419> microphone<00:04:44.750> for

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
either like an XLR microphone for

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.140 
either like an XLR microphone for
example<00:04:45.620> or<00:04:45.949> an<00:04:46.159> electric<00:04:46.490> guitar<00:04:46.580> for

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
example or an electric guitar for

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.060 
example or an electric guitar for
example<00:04:47.570> you're<00:04:48.139> not<00:04:48.229> limited<00:04:48.409> to<00:04:48.740> those<00:04:48.830> two

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
example you're not limited to those two

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.460 
example you're not limited to those two
things<00:04:49.280> but<00:04:49.550> the<00:04:50.479> probably<00:04:50.810> most<00:04:50.900> commonly

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
things but the probably most commonly

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:57.010 
things but the probably most commonly

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
used items with this interface so you

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.110 
used items with this interface so you
can't<00:04:57.229> use<00:04:57.440> two<00:04:57.680> at<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:57.860> same<00:04:58.070> time<00:04:58.310> it's<00:04:58.610> one

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
can't use two at the same time it's one

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.620 
can't use two at the same time it's one
or<00:04:59.360> the<00:04:59.419> other<00:04:59.630> as<00:05:00.500> far<00:05:00.800> as<00:05:00.830> I'm<00:05:01.010> aware<00:05:01.539> some<00:05:02.539> of

the microphone on the front if you can

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.240 
the microphone on the front if you can
see<00:05:07.370> it's<00:05:07.520> a<00:05:07.669> tiny<00:05:08.000> little<00:05:08.210> circle<00:05:08.750> there<00:05:09.250> it's

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
see it's a tiny little circle there it's

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.360 
see it's a tiny little circle there it's
the<00:05:10.849> so<00:05:11.210> to<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.590> the<00:05:12.590> market<00:05:12.919> the<00:05:13.039> built-in
