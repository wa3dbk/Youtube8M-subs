proton supreme is now proton has been

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.749 
proton supreme is now proton has been
around<00:00:31.019> for<00:00:31.199> about<00:00:31.320> twenty<00:00:31.769> years<00:00:31.800> more<00:00:32.520> than

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
around for about twenty years more than

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.400 
around for about twenty years more than
twenty<00:00:33.059> years<00:00:33.090> actually<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:34.020> personally

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
twenty years actually and I personally

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.170 
twenty years actually and I personally
have<00:00:34.590> owned<00:00:34.770> about<00:00:34.920> seven<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.640> them<00:00:35.790> all<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
have owned about seven of them all the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.450 
have owned about seven of them all the
way<00:00:36.300> from<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> Saga<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.829> padana<00:00:38.160> and

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
way from the Saga to the padana and

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.970 
way from the Saga to the padana and
while<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.480> personally<00:00:39.960> think<00:00:40.140> my<00:00:40.620> favorite

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
while I personally think my favorite

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.560 
while I personally think my favorite
proton<00:00:41.280> has<00:00:41.399> always<00:00:41.579> been<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.940> saturated<00:00:42.300> ETI

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
proton has always been the saturated ETI

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.590 
proton has always been the saturated ETI
which<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.899> had<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.170> 1998<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.360> car

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
which I had in 1998 this is the car

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.930 
which I had in 1998 this is the car
that's<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.140> game<00:00:46.410> changer<00:00:46.829> for<00:00:46.860> proton<00:00:47.309> and

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
that's a game changer for proton and

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.029 
that's a game changer for proton and
I'll<00:00:48.210> tell<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.480> why<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.829> first

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
I'll tell you why this is the first

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.049 
I'll tell you why this is the first
proton<00:00:50.489> that's<00:00:50.760> actually<00:00:51.480> at<00:00:51.719> par<00:00:52.530> or<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.850> they

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
proton that's actually at par or so they

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.420 
proton that's actually at par or so they
would<00:00:54.210> like<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.449> think<00:00:54.690> with<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> V<00:00:55.649> Oz<00:00:55.770> with

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
would like to think with the V Oz with

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.569 
would like to think with the V Oz with
the<00:00:56.460> city<00:00:56.879> possibly<00:00:57.629> even<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.140> Civic<00:00:58.469> but<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.340> it

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
the city possibly even a Civic but is it

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.689 
the city possibly even a Civic but is it
that's<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.329> thing<00:01:00.539> now<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> car<00:01:02.670> that

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
that's the thing now this is a car that

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.700 
that's the thing now this is a car that
has<00:01:02.940> been<00:01:03.149> done<00:01:03.300> by<00:01:03.449> proton<00:01:03.840> from<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> ground

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
has been done by proton from the ground

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.060 
has been done by proton from the ground
up

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
up

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.399 
up
it's<00:01:05.489> got<00:01:05.670> Lotus<00:01:06.090> right<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.450> handling<00:01:06.780> it's

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
it's got Lotus right and handling it's

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.020 
it's got Lotus right and handling it's
got<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> pretty<00:01:07.890> decent<00:01:07.979> engine<00:01:08.400> route<00:01:08.760> which

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
got a pretty decent engine route which

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.640 
got a pretty decent engine route which
we'll<00:01:09.210> get<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.720> little<00:01:09.780> while<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.530> got

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
we'll get to in a little while it's got

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.820 
we'll get to in a little while it's got
a<00:01:10.680> CVT<00:01:11.130> gearbox<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:12.090> very<00:01:12.479> quiet<00:01:12.840> it's<00:01:13.530> very

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
a CVT gearbox it's very quiet it's very

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.820 
a CVT gearbox it's very quiet it's very
nice<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.070> drive<00:01:14.659> but<00:01:15.659> there's<00:01:16.409> something

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
nice to drive but there's something

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.170 
nice to drive but there's something
lacking<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.729> something<00:01:18.150> that

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
lacking and that this is something that

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.320 
lacking and that this is something that
has<00:01:18.420> always<00:01:18.630> been<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.200> problem<00:01:19.409> with<00:01:19.560> proton

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
has always been a problem with proton

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.660 
has always been a problem with proton
the<00:01:21.330> plastics<00:01:21.810> they're<00:01:22.710> all<00:01:22.860> over<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.189> place

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
the plastics they're all over the place

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.179 
the plastics they're all over the place
the<00:01:24.150> plastics<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:24.780> car<00:01:25.020> are<00:01:25.590> ridiculous

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
the plastics in this car are ridiculous

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.760 
the plastics in this car are ridiculous
you<00:01:26.939> know<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.990> cannot<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.680> cannot

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
begin to mention how much plastic there

begin to mention how much plastic there
is<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.259> car<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:32.280> not<00:01:32.340> even<00:01:32.700> nice

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
is in this car and it's not even nice

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.969 
is in this car and it's not even nice
plastic<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:34.079> could<00:01:34.320> be<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> little<00:01:34.590> bit<00:01:34.770> better

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
plastic it could be a little bit better

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.560 
plastic it could be a little bit better
plastic<00:01:35.579> because<00:01:35.939> let's<00:01:36.119> let's<00:01:36.390> face<00:01:36.540> it

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
plastic because let's let's face it

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.880 
plastic because let's let's face it
there's<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.900> lot<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.170> plastic<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.560> cars<00:01:37.740> these

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
there's a lot of plastic in cars these

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.429 
there's a lot of plastic in cars these
days<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.250> they<00:01:38.640> recycle<00:01:39.210> cars<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.930> know<00:01:40.020> 70%

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
days it they recycle cars you know 70%

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.800 
days it they recycle cars you know 70%
up<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.040> some<00:01:41.189> sometimes<00:01:41.570> cars<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.720> be

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
up to some sometimes cars can be

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.380 
up to some sometimes cars can be
recycled<00:01:43.110> because<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.680> plastics<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:44.850> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
recycled because of the plastics but the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.450 
recycled because of the plastics but the
ones<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:45.869> car<00:01:46.110> just<00:01:46.470> don't<00:01:46.890> feel<00:01:47.250> right

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
ones in this car just don't feel right

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.270

I<00:02:23.400> mentioned<00:02:23.730> earlier<00:02:23.849> the<00:02:24.510> vos

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
I mentioned earlier the vos

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.199 
I mentioned earlier the vos
the<00:02:25.260> city<00:02:25.530> because<00:02:26.220> it's<00:02:26.370> priced<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.910> way

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
the city because it's priced that way

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.120 
the city because it's priced that way
it's<00:02:27.630> actually<00:02:27.810> priced<00:02:28.349> in<00:02:28.620> that<00:02:28.860> bracket

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
it's actually priced in that bracket

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.070 
it's actually priced in that bracket
which<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.549> a<00:02:29.580> pretty<00:02:30.000> gutsy<00:02:30.209> move<00:02:30.540> for<00:02:30.750> proton

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
which is a pretty gutsy move for proton

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.600 
which is a pretty gutsy move for proton
which<00:02:31.650> has<00:02:31.799> pretty<00:02:32.010> much<00:02:32.099> always<00:02:32.310> been

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
which has pretty much always been

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.180 
which has pretty much always been
producing<00:02:33.000> rather<00:02:33.330> cheap<00:02:33.629> cars<00:02:33.980> so<00:02:34.980> one<00:02:35.160> of

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
producing rather cheap cars so one of

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.670 
producing rather cheap cars so one of
the<00:02:35.340> things<00:02:35.519> about<00:02:35.640> proton<00:02:36.090> is<00:02:36.269> that<00:02:36.959> people

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
the things about proton is that people

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.350 
the things about proton is that people
have<00:02:37.769> always<00:02:37.950> said<00:02:38.069> it's<00:02:38.370> cheap<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:38.880> maybe

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
have always said it's cheap and maybe

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.150 
have always said it's cheap and maybe
that's<00:02:39.660> why<00:02:39.870> people<00:02:40.049> buy<00:02:40.349> a<00:02:40.380> proton<00:02:40.829> because

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
that's why people buy a proton because

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.350 
that's why people buy a proton because
it's<00:02:41.310> cheap<00:02:41.549> and<00:02:41.670> let's<00:02:41.819> face<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.000> yes

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
it's cheap and let's face it yes

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.479 
it's cheap and let's face it yes
comparatively<00:02:43.200> they<00:02:43.680> are<00:02:43.799> pretty<00:02:44.040> cheap<00:02:44.250> but

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
comparatively they are pretty cheap but

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.250 
comparatively they are pretty cheap but
that's<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.209> difference<00:02:45.510> between<00:02:45.569> other

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
that's the difference between other

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.009 
that's the difference between other
protons<00:02:46.799> and<00:02:47.010> this<00:02:47.489> one<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:48.450> Suprema<00:02:48.870> s

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
protons and this one the Suprema s

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.199 
protons and this one the Suprema s
doesn't<00:02:49.440> feel<00:02:49.799> cheap<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.670> actually<00:02:51.000> feels

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
doesn't feel cheap it actually feels

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.420 
doesn't feel cheap it actually feels
pretty<00:02:51.450> good<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:52.500> cabin<00:02:52.860> insulation<00:02:53.310> is

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
pretty good the cabin insulation is

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.990 
pretty good the cabin insulation is
amazing

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
amazing

things one of the biggest complaints
that<00:02:58.829> people<00:02:58.890> have<00:02:59.190> with<00:02:59.310> protons<00:02:59.670> was<00:03:00.120> of

it folks the proton supreme is it's a

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.189 
it folks the proton supreme is it's a
really<00:05:25.699> good<00:05:25.819> effort<00:05:25.940> from<00:05:26.210> proton<00:05:26.599> this

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 
really good effort from proton this

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:28.570 
really good effort from proton this
level<00:05:27.560> ways<00:05:27.680> to<00:05:27.860> go<00:05:28.009> there<00:05:28.190> were<00:05:28.279> some<00:05:28.430> things

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
level ways to go there were some things

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.070 
level ways to go there were some things
we<00:05:28.729> didn't<00:05:28.909> like<00:05:29.000> about<00:05:29.029> the<00:05:29.330> car<00:05:29.539> but<00:05:29.750> by<00:05:29.900> and

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
we didn't like about the car but by and

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.019 
we didn't like about the car but by and
large<00:05:30.110> it's<00:05:30.500> a<00:05:30.589> really<00:05:30.860> good<00:05:30.979> effort<00:05:31.099> so<00:05:31.909> if

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:32.029 
large it's a really good effort so if

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:33.309 
large it's a really good effort so if
