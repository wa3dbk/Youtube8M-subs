00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.880
 Money has a face that is with you.

 because you are a handsome guy but it's 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.229
 woman they have to be is a series 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.209
 of things and I was impressed that 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.410
 A lot of people are making friends there. 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.959
 false is on 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.180

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.070
 My stuff and the guy after the end of 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.450
 a child would soon be human fire and now 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.370
 I'm going to fuck you up 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.040

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.810
 take care of your many friendships 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.180
 friendships will lead the bad side circus and 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.620
 another woman your side bomb then had 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.600
 who take great care in this friendship 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.310
 What are you doing, I 'm saying? 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.720
 experience has already been 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.090
 quite with friendship 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.830
 people who wanted the interest that I thought 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.120
 that it was one thing and after they saw that 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.850
 I do not have any of that 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.590
 leaked so be careful people 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.690
 I never had a friend who said so 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.910
 It's okay with French, I never do. 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.620
 It's never hard for you to find a person. 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.260
 who cares about you 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.570
 It's hard for you to find a friend who failed. 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.730
 all your expensive side, let's go there because 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.860
 listening is always sometimes when you have 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.870
 friends at school pass the third 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.940
 project does not spread fire and if nobody 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.400
 but talk to nobody, bug after 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.990
 so much school contact is normal so 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.180
 enjoy your school 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.320
 You keep complaining because you do not have 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.090
 color of cdu 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.250
 and you enjoy it so that later 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.959
 Third by cable to life you have to 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.070
 attract this work will have to go 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.200

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.970
 college has to be a lot of 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.830
 thing is connected besides working that is 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.470
 The worse when you make an age 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.050
 very large this type of 18 years and 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.450

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.510
 goes from the third to the end 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.360
 clear friendship that there are exceptions of people 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.580
 that you are the exceptions of having many 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.170
 good people in the world of course 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.360
 You make friends, I will not generalize. 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.130
 say that nobody lends 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.170
 do not have people like that provide the 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.640
 people are good and people are going to make 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.860
 you happy so exercise caution 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.620

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.910
