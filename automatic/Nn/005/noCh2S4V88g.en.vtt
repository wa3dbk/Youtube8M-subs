00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.850
 Represented in the head 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.610
 The pedal is really 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.520
 I thought it would come true 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:35.750
 There is constant but I thought the Na or went even Mr. I is 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.750

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.220
 Kedo' we're able to was 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.670
 But I wonder why it is amazing 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.670
 So far 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.150

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.960

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.960
 That 's right, hey 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.990
 Yes I felt 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.680
 I think especially the final was a slippery 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.990
 There something it equity in that everyone 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.990
 It was something I could not do before 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.070
 Or you want to make your own way slip 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.480
 Could you slide like you today? 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.830
 I think I can do it 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.890
 I think that 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.520
 I talk and always say but I still have confidence 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.120
 Stand at the start of 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.900
 Anyway in the course in front of you 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.900
 If I can do it 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.750
 I think I was thinking about it 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.159
 Because it was done a 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.159
 I am really very happy for myself 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.200
 Smile is an impression 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.740
 But is the scold was to scale laughing Italy 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.740
 Now b 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.319
 I want to do my best sweat 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.980
 Really again and again 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.980
 Toka touch is 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.340

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.100
 This is 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.810
 Oh, say a lot of long things 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.820

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.050
 The memories of the Olympics are very good 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.490
