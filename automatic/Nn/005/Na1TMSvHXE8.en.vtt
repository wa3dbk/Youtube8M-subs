00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.750
 and what kind of colleagues are I going to teach you today 

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:06.070
 how to eliminate the virus that creates access 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.139
 direct on computers 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:13.410
 desk or laptops in the system 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.410
 operative windows 8.1 let's start 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.780
 very well as you see I am in the 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:43.430
 windows 8.1 system 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.989
 in a virtual machine to show you 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.839
 how to eliminate the virus that creates access 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.720
 direct how do you see this is the virus I'm going 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:56.440
 to extract 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.440
 and I'm going to add the expression bbc 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.460
 ok this is the file what I'm going to 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.510
 to do is simply paste it 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.510
 in the usb memory 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.399
 because usually the virus is 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.210
 expand or multiply that way 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.770
 by means of the usb memories 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.800
 I'm going to paste 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.380
 and this is where I'm going to run 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.380
 the virus we double-click 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.490
 and it's going to start very well, it did not take long 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.330
 a lot and this virus already hid us the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.280
 good folders but do not be alarmed right now 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.350
 what we are going to do is activate the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.930
 option to see the files and 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.540
 Hidden folders like we do 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:52.880
 simply by clicking here on view 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.830
 hidden elements we select them and 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.010
 this one we go again again 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.770
 here in the options part we click 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:05.250
 and change folder and search options 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.170
 It's very full, we click again and in the 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.270
 part of seeing 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.300
 we click here to show files and 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.010
 hidden folders I already have this one 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.250
 selected but if you have it 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.470
 so click here to show files and 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.860
 hidden folders 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.060
 very well and here in this part of hide 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.660
 protected files of the system 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:31.140
 operative this we are going to take the 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.320
 palomita we say yes and we give 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.690
 click on accept as they see that they are 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:41.080
 files simply the virus what has 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:44.760
 fact is this hide them and then 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.390
 and try to give us a cardiac arrest 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.390
 all right 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.710
 now 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.180
 that the toolbar we are going to 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.549
 give you right click 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.549
 and we're heading here in this option 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:04.019
 notice of tasks opens this little window 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:06.689
 and this is where we will see at the beginning 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.269
 virus this virus so that at 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:11.459
 moment to start the system, be it 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.340
 the first thing to run and you can 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.709
 keep hurting our lives now 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.900
 We also see here a file that 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.480
 this is the one that is always running 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.400
 in this windows file so that the 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.950
 antivirus does not detect it but as now 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.169
 already the antivirus are already improved 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.329
 they can detect so it is also 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:34.079
 It is recommended that you install the antivirus 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:35.730
 kaspersky or not them if they detect it 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.069
 We quickly do the following 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.340
 we finished the process from this 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.340
 virus 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.950
 is this this is the virus and just 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.950
 they click on finish task 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.090
 we minimize this because after a while we're going 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:58.650
 to use click here again and we 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:03.360
 direct we headed in on the local disk c 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:05.970
 in the user part we click this 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.920
 is the name of my computer but in 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.159
 the case of you are going to see this the 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.799
 name that you have assigned to your machine 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:16.410
 my case is this problem 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.290
 I'm going here in app data 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.840
 in local 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.940
 then in tempo and this is where it 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.700
 find the virus this virus is the one 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.930
 the main one runs and this is what 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.620
 we are going to eliminate 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.560
 all right 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.070
 Once this is done, we would not have 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.070
 problem 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:41.750
 Now what we are going to do is this 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:44.570
 back to the task manager 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.340
 and here at the beginning we click on 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.639
 this file 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.280
 and we give you here to open the location of 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.760
 archive 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.590
 he sent us direct and this is the the 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.990
 file that was going to be executed at the moment 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.650
 that restart your good computer 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.650
 we also eliminate it 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:11.849
 and then we have this removed the 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:13.709
 virus 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:17.680
 the next one is to eliminate the one 

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:21.470
 we have already in memory usb 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:24.200
 we say yes and unlimited 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.560
 now walls hide this the archives 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.900
 or the folders 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.360
 we already have and in the fastest way 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.810
 uncover the folders is realizing 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.110
 this next step in this we 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:41.350
 we have here the beginning of windows we give 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:44.260
 right click on it right click and 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:47.169
 these options appear to us and we give 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.449
 click on command prompt 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:52.490
 this little window opens 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:55.280
 and what are we going to do this 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:58.610
 let's continue on the blog that we have 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.259
 created and here in this part of how 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.120
 hinder hidden files of the 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:05.310
 usb memory we click 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.430
 Now they have very good load 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:11.130
 finished loading and here in this part 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.470
 I tell them how difficult this the 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.419
 hidden files and what interests us 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.020
 is this copy this code that we have 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:19.910
 here this command 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.600
 we copy it right click on it 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.020
 copy 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.070
 as is the symbol of the system 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:29.190
 we stick 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:32.520
 and in this section here for example 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:35.580
 I have in the unit let's see what 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:38.750
 unit is in my memory as 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.750
 come is in the e 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:45.830
 then we go back and see that it is 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.690
 in the unit well what are we going to do 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.560
 is simply change according to the 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:53.360
 unit that you have will change 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:56.810
 the letters for example I have l then 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.690
 I'm going to put you here in this part 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:02.900
 and the only thing that remains for us is to give him 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:05.249
 nothing but hope and ready as you can see from 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.699
 finished working 

00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:11.069
 we have yachts hidden the folders 

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:12.510
 we only have to eliminate the accesses 

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:16.500
 direct 

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:19.740
 and smartly good friends that would be all that 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:22.580
 have an excellent day and see you in 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.580
 the next tutorial
