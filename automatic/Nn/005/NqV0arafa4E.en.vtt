hi<00:00:02.100> again<00:00:03.080> I'm<00:00:04.080> going<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.440> go<00:00:04.560> over<00:00:05.000> three

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
hi again I'm going to go over three

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.209 
hi again I'm going to go over three
methods<00:00:06.870> of<00:00:08.389> connecting<00:00:09.389> your<00:00:10.010> hairpin<00:00:11.010> lace

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
methods of connecting your hairpin lace

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.680 
methods of connecting your hairpin lace
strips<00:00:11.700> together

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.769 

the<00:00:15.690> first<00:00:15.960> method<00:00:17.270> involves<00:00:18.270> slip<00:00:18.510> stitch

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
the first method involves slip stitch

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:26.420 
the first method involves slip stitch
and<00:00:19.820> for<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.500> you<00:00:22.500> take<00:00:22.740> your<00:00:22.890> hook<00:00:25.160> and<00:00:26.160> I'm

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
and for that you take your hook and I'm

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.519 
and for that you take your hook and I'm
going<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.609> put<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.869> loop<00:00:27.869> on<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.260> end<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.470> my

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
going to put a loop on the end of my

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:43.810 
going to put a loop on the end of my
yarn<00:00:28.859> here<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.429> have<00:00:29.699> that

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.569 

good

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.410 
good
take<00:00:46.239> a<00:00:46.269> loop<00:00:46.539> from<00:00:46.749> one<00:00:46.989> side<00:00:48.359> you're<00:00:49.359> gonna

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
take a loop from one side you're gonna

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.849 
take a loop from one side you're gonna
go<00:00:49.629> to<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:49.870> other<00:00:49.960> side<00:00:50.260> you're<00:00:50.469> gonna<00:00:50.559> take<00:00:50.829> a

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 
go to the other side you're gonna take a

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:56.700 
go to the other side you're gonna take a
loop<00:00:51.129> from<00:00:51.309> there<00:00:55.379> you're<00:00:56.379> just<00:00:56.409> going<00:00:56.679> to

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
loop from there you're just going to

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.910 
loop from there you're just going to
slip<00:00:56.949> stitch<00:00:56.979> them<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:59.530> you're<00:00:59.649> going<00:00:59.799> to<00:00:59.829> do

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
slip stitch them and you're going to do

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.439 
slip stitch them and you're going to do
the<00:01:00.010> same<00:01:00.190> thing<00:01:00.429> again<00:01:00.549> you<00:01:00.760> got<00:01:01.030> to<00:01:01.059> take<00:01:01.239> one

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.190 
side slip stitch you can get a little
bit<00:01:12.250> confusing<00:01:12.970> they<00:01:13.270> should<00:01:13.450> get<00:01:13.570> along<00:01:13.840> but

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
now give you the general idea mine's a

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.530 
now give you the general idea mine's a
little<00:02:25.010> messy<00:02:25.520> at<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.730> end<00:02:25.880> because<00:02:26.240> I<00:02:26.270> wasn't

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
little messy at the end because I wasn't

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.250 
little messy at the end because I wasn't
that<00:02:26.840> careful<00:02:27.440> with<00:02:28.190> it<00:02:28.460> but<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:29.870> gives<00:02:30.080> you<00:02:30.170> an

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
that careful with it but it gives you an

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.330 
that careful with it but it gives you an
idea<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.710> what<00:02:30.890> it<00:02:31.010> would<00:02:31.160> look<00:02:31.310> like<00:02:31.600> if<00:02:32.600> you

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
idea of what it would look like if you

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.590 
idea of what it would look like if you
you<00:02:34.340> know<00:02:34.430> just<00:02:34.610> took<00:02:34.850> one<00:02:35.090> look<00:02:35.240> from<00:02:35.390> one

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
you know just took one look from one

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.380 
you know just took one look from one
side<00:02:35.870> one<00:02:36.680> loop<00:02:36.860> from<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.100> other<00:02:37.250> side<00:02:37.490> slip

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
side one loop from the other side slip

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.710 
side one loop from the other side slip
stitch<00:02:38.630> them<00:02:38.870> together<00:02:39.160> okay<00:02:40.390> that's<00:02:41.390> one

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
stitch them together okay that's one

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.620 
stitch them together okay that's one
method<00:02:43.690> now<00:02:44.690> their<00:02:44.870> method<00:02:46.360> doesn't<00:02:47.360> even

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
method now their method doesn't even

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
going to take two loops from one side

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.900 
going to take two loops from one side
two<00:03:00.020> loops<00:03:00.230> from<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.470> other<00:03:00.710> side<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:01.760> you're

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
two loops from the other side and you're

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.900 
two loops from the other side and you're
going<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.090> take<00:03:02.270> these<00:03:02.570> loops<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:04.430> you're

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
going to take these loops and you're

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.640 
going to take these loops and you're
going<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:06.130> pull<00:03:07.130> them<00:03:07.250> through<00:03:08.380> you<00:03:09.380> can<00:03:09.530> get

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650

and<00:06:28.560> that's<00:06:28.980> how<00:06:29.190> that<00:06:29.250> comes<00:06:29.670> out<00:06:31.340> those<00:06:32.340> are

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
and that's how that comes out those are

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.040 
and that's how that comes out those are
the<00:06:32.580> three<00:06:32.820> methods<00:06:33.060> that<00:06:33.600> I'm<00:06:33.750> most<00:06:33.960> familiar

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
the three methods that I'm most familiar

the three methods that I'm most familiar
with<00:06:34.470> as<00:06:35.160> far<00:06:35.430> as<00:06:36.440> joining<00:06:37.670> hairpin<00:06:38.670> lace

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:38.850 
with as far as joining hairpin lace

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:43.400 
with as far as joining hairpin lace
trips<00:06:40.550> that's<00:06:41.550> pretty<00:06:41.790> much<00:06:41.880> it<00:06:42.290> thanks<00:06:43.290> for

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.410 
trips that's pretty much it thanks for
