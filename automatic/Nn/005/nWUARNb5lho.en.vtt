00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 Y 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.290
 Y 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.950
 all species are different all 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.910
 they have different behaviors 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.340
 then what we obviously 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.279
 you must know the behavior of each 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.570
 species to be able to achieve your goal 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.270
 depending also on the many species 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.910
 of the times first in cages 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.180
 independent those who see their 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.730
 be together that they know each other after 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.460
 little by little you are opening cages 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.050
 they go knowing they are touching 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.610
 they begin to groom then you start 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.890
 to see all their behaviors up 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.890
 that you decide to leave them public if 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.570
 we want to arrive is to have reproduction 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.760
 of many different species 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.310
 species as good for example those 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.310
 toucans that is a species then that is 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.870
 in danger of extinction or one of the 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.329
 greater challenges of reproducing your 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.610
 Meat is forming right now to couples 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:09.070
 date we have six couples as it is 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.110
 they are forming before there was only one 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.110
 then today we are on the right path 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.580
 and 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.500
 in the almost two that are coj or little 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.600
 bear with pheasants turkeys their ice cream 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.360
 there are suddenly they are like very 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.010
 aggressive to protect your egg to protect 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.990
 hatchlings well what we do 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.550
 to prevent them from happening 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.470
 something new that is going to break or that 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.090
 an accident for us what 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.369
 we do is preserve what we do 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.500
 we remove that egg we send it healing 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.840
 and good we make it sprout so 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.660
 artificial but the whole process that 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.119
 took this is to put the little egg going to 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.610
 having it is completely natural and 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.100
 talking about the almost two the classrooms are 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.960
 just as then we have to give it for 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.680
 the closest thing they would be in life 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.320
 free are birds that are arboreal and that 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.830
 weigh and that are always above the 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.570
 trees is to put the hangers around 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.570
 of those in the classrooms 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.349
 Y 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.920
 we have had success with the flamingos the 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.730
 flamingos they incubate the egg alone 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.890
 they raise the chickens 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.300
 naturally then there is no need 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.940
 us to intervene 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.530
 the more or less and approximately that 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.840
 they are one year old of their chicks 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.610
 what we do is a management we separate 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.440
 the chickens and the 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.150
 single breeding pairs to start 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.190
 again the same procedure 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.470
 flamencos when they eat their parents 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.710
 once they eat something comes in the crop 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.660
 and an enzyme that naturally passes it 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.030
 the father and the mother because both 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.010
 they wanted the chick they go to 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.720
 chick then this chick has 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.150
 more chances of being a chicken as 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.640
 stronger more active and be one of the 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.210
 candidates for the next colony of 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.070
 breeders in artificial breeding 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.560
 listen to the disadvantage because it does not receive 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.080
 those nutrients to the purpose of the 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.870
 resolution is always to keep having 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.750
 more have more species have more 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.900
 organisms then in specific 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.270
 macaws toucans because no flamingos 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.970
 is to try to free them try to 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.920
 repopulate more places and then good to form 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.620
 part of conservation and achieve that 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.900
 these pups in turn later have the 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.940
 offspring then is the as the goal 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.650
 final that we all look for and for being the 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.750
 mom of the chicks of all 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.530
 copies that are here is a great 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.530
 pride the truth
