00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello friends from youtube 024 and we are in 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.410
 a life of pippa will be seeing a 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.389
 video of a game of chivas against 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.400
 America in the background since I played with 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.679
 that comes the classic but good this 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.109
 video I do because they have left 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.890
 recently rumors of what 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.939
 will be the next fifa 16 typhoon 2016 and 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.080
 The truth is that these rumors have 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.650
 been very good and hopefully so 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.570
 be good the first good rumor is in 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.120
 the rumor that like all deliveries of 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.290
 fifa depart at the end of September or 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.370
 early October 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.950
 Well the first rumor is that they are going to come 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.270
 the two European competitions such 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.650
 like the champions league and the europe 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.320
 league 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.320
 although james for all does not confirm it is 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.900
 because the license with konami this is 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.330
 expires in 2016 what james ports 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.730
 would use to include the new 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.440
 European competitions in fifa 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.320
 and then that the champions league and the 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.540
 europa league that the fifa already has a 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.119
 called European Cup I think it's the 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.770
 champions league in career mode but 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:13.420
 they already want to bring it officially 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:16.420
 licensed good the second the second 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.810
 rumor would be the 20 stadiums in the league 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.670
 bbva such as they already did as in 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.110
 English Premier League league that 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.380
 they included all stages of the 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.090
 fifa first division this coming 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.670
 they want to bring the 20 stadiums in the league 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.080
 Spanish such as San MamÃ©s the 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.450
 anoeta riazor etc. 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.150
 and the truth is that it would be a little 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.330
 better because it adds more realism to 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.880
 video game good the third would be the 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.450
 improvement in the faces of the players in 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.360
 fifa 15 was a drastic change in the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.560
 consoles next good and the truth if 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.920
 they think doing it better would be 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.640
 spectacular 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.520
 the fourth rumor is that it returns to the league 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.250
 Brazilian if it was not with 1.015 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.110
 they want to bring her back to the fifa 2016 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.509
 because it 's a league with a lot 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.269
 competitiveness 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.959
 fifth rumor is more South American leagues 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:16.909
 such as the Uruguayan of Ecuador and 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.790
 with few possibilities but in the rumor 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:22.870
 p the Peruvian league now what would happen if 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.980
 They include new South American leagues as 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.989
 this trade and have the liberators cup 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.349
 they would add the liberators cup because 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.569
 is the american league would add the league 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.450
 Uruguayan to that of Ecuador with the 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.849
 Brazilian Argentina 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.180
 I think the Chilean one is also with 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.680
 all these leagues this would have already part 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.530
 of the liberators cup 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.989
 and well, those were the five 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.360
 rumors that I have found six with the 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.580
 of the liberators cup 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.860
 well hopefully and put them in the fifa 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.190
 because it would add more realism in the 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.190
 video game and now these rumors are 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.170
 just rumors of the day that could 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.240
 confirm would be the day that is the 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.870
 three that's going to be this year out there 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.850
 June I think June July well if you 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.700
 liked the video of like comenten 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.800
 share the good in the comments 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.410
 put for a something that you 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.480
 would like to see in the fan of 16 either in 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.180
 career mode in the online 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.540
 in any good they already know until the 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.540
 next
