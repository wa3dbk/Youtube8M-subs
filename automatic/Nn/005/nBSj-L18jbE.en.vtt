writers so as I wanted to grow quite
quickly<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:22.170> then<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.530> grew<00:01:22.770> from

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
quickly and and then it just grew from

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.920 
quickly and and then it just grew from
there<00:01:23.009> each<00:01:23.280> year<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.640> just<00:01:23.939> recruited<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.509> few

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
gradually I didn't want to just just

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.870 
gradually I didn't want to just just
like<00:01:30.299> create<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.570> massive<00:01:30.810> team<00:01:31.229> yeah<00:01:31.880> because

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
like create a massive team yeah because

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.140 
like create a massive team yeah because
I<00:01:33.240> think<00:01:33.540> qualities<00:01:34.470> been<00:01:34.650> quantity<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.700> I've

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
I think qualities been quantity and I've

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.580 
I think qualities been quantity and I've
certainly<00:01:36.720> found<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.079> because<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.290> kind<00:01:37.470> of

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
certainly found it because I kind of

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.370 
certainly found it because I kind of
experimented<00:01:38.310> with<00:01:39.060> kind<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.869> accidental

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
experimented with kind of accidental

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.840 
experimented with kind of accidental
experimentation<00:01:41.270> i<00:01:42.270> had<00:01:43.579> in<00:01:44.579> i<00:01:45.299> think<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.600> was

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
experimentation i had in i think it was

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.520 
experimentation i had in i think it was
2011<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.090> think<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.780> had<00:01:49.020> like<00:01:49.200> something<00:01:49.439> like

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
2011 I think I had like something like

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.370 
2011 I think I had like something like
six<00:01:49.920> hundred<00:01:50.280> articles<00:01:50.670> yeah<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.170> year

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
six hundred articles yeah in that year

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.410 
six hundred articles yeah in that year
and<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.710> thought<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.220> might<00:01:54.000> be<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.180> bit<00:01:54.390> too

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
and I thought that might be a bit too

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.780 
and I thought that might be a bit too
many<00:01:54.899> because<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.320> thought<00:01:55.530> maybe<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.549> stands

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
many because I thought maybe the stands

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.560 
many because I thought maybe the stands
on<00:01:57.000> quite<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.450> high<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.200> 2012<00:01:59.299> we<00:02:00.299> ended<00:02:00.450> up

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
on quite so high so in 2012 we ended up

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.749 
on quite so high so in 2012 we ended up
having<00:02:00.719> less<00:02:01.049> but<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.890> felt<00:02:02.280> they<00:02:02.430> were<00:02:02.490> much

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
having less but I felt they were much

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.980 
having less but I felt they were much
more<00:02:03.290> you<00:02:04.290> know<00:02:04.380> kind<00:02:04.740> of

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649
