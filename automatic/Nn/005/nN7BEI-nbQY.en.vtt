00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello friends of the fans welcome to dvd 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.740
 criticism with another trailer check 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:14.219
 namely to a German genre film 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:26.789
 called lost place the weather the weather 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:28.439
 This goal is especially at home 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.130
 wanted to spend the same time with her 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.130
 you but rather to 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.820
 gps is every day 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.520
 sure of what 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.180
 the technology for the third 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.920
 world war mind control 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.140
 The waves could be the same frequency 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.740
 the human brain 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.740
 hours of music 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.490
 can run 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.890
 I think the trailer is not even 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.229
 so bad especially for one 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.119
 german trailer in lost place us 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.820
 nfp movie or warner bros off 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.409
 the 19 september 2013 in the german 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.090
 Cinema brings the story is told 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.310
 a group of teenagers are up 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.259
 a kind treasure hunt and in the 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.150
 forests on their way to one 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.770
 Abandoned campsite bumping 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.720
 or a campsite of the 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.940
 has something mysterious and as 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.709
 then a lack in radiation protection suit 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.840
 the big question is this one crops up 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.730
 man a friend or enemy but he himself 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.410
 this group provides you find yourself 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.840
 still evening will be in a fight 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.180
 between life and death is back with it 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.739
 lost place a kind of horror thriller 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.239
 what the trailer supposedly a bit too 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.620
 at Chernobyl Diaries also remembers 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.450
 this whole theme radiates but 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.550
 actually on a technology 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.530
 fall back on the one supposedly that 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.090
 awareness of people can drive 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.220
 and in fact there was a cold war 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.260
 paranormal sciences of both 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.150
 Soviet Union as well as on the part of the USA and 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.709
 That's why this film has one 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.959
 or others probably not quite 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.370
 in the inner core and within 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.890
 maybe very interesting in the 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.840
 cast we have the biggest goeske the 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.900
 wonderful josefine pruss or pit 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.340
 bukowski on acting performance 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.390
 I think now what the trailer so a 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.040
 a bit of feeling is left 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.329
 not so cool about 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.190
 the nice cut can not quite be that way 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.450
 horror thriller typical that maybe 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.630
 even the one or the other million 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.370
 the basic optics would have given more feeling 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.350
 can budget here but especially 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.239
 I think is always good if it is 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.620
 in germany a genre push exists 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.120
 who had rule last year with 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.220
 an end time movie this year with room 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.440
 205 a horror thriller of the leg bad 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.459
 was or with ruby â€‹â€‹red a push 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.620
 genre 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.420
 that's why I can only do that 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.010
 support when the Germans go away 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.079
 Comes from comedy romantic comedy 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.760
 or drama dealing with the Nazi regime 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.070
 or second world war or 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.600
 to deal with the ddr time that i find 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.100
 I love it if you walk in this direction 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.500
 horror thriller against that I will be with 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.090
 lost place on the 19th of september on each 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.680

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.769
 comments and you find that special 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.880
 well done for a German film or 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.410
 then tell her that 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.390
 German movie is not mine that is 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.650
 yes, often the opinion here on 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.510
 youtube I'm curious about this 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.430
 That's what we've been through right now 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.870
