00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.580
 m 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.260
 it's based on two characters like that 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.500
 to fictitious ones who come out of the head of 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.909
 the author and who create their own 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.770
 universe universe story that wants to be 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:01:03.740
 poetic 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:05.690
 strange weird funny also time in 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.700
 time there is a passage like that that are 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:13.430
 involved characters are few 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:15.920
 wacky whose two characters on 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.110
 scene and that two escaped characters 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.450
 of eugenic work ionesco so a 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.670
 little his right foot and Julian dancing 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.690
 on stage and so we invented with them 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.130
 and this is the actor this system is 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.080
 finally intervened a third 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.070
 character who is this picture and 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.930
 imagine thank you ve 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.000
 this image that gives to see 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.560
 the imaginary eugenic ionesco and that is 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.780
 based in fact on our technologies of 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.450
 virtual reality the ice and in the 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.530
 measure he pushed these technologies 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.600
 immersive a simulation a notch to 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.610
 on it we only have one 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.810
 found to designate this show it was 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.090
 said sir and madam dream was a 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.780
 show finally said reality 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.780
 Virtual 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.310
 we started a story and I'm going 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.080
 say a temporality a positioning 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.140
 on stage on which the images must 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.570
 graft themselves they made their 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.120
 3D scenography and it will be up to us to 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.920
 to reinsert themselves in and maybe even 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.380
 to improve what we did is that this 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.910
 a true real interaction and 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.910
 and then it's very inspiring especially 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.170
 the squad was saying the icare myth has 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.460
 existed before the portion of the plane that 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.580
 the wish is that all these myths 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.690
 or this imaginary can become real and 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.070
 it turns out that this sentence in the 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.830
 lobby ama immediately resonated between 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.480
 between sweet a dream possible and that's 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.710
 really at the heart of today what 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.090
 we believe in dassault systems 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.860
 it's because there is first a dream 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.960
 it is because that is first there is a 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.960
 imagination an energy and because we 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.820
 then has the right teams of 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.800
 good tools that we can do in 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.800
 kind of advancing the real world 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.590
 we find here in the reality room 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.020
 Virtual systems that dassault 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.360
 call the live and that allows to live 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.860
 experiences through our 3d 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.240
 platform experience in fact of all 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.910
 the products that we can imagine 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.020
 the idea here being to test them in 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.020
 immersive and interactive 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.430
 I 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.480
 we reproduced this room 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.950
 she is mobile she can move from 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.630
 theater in theater and all theaters 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.060
 are not alike and that it is 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.030
 almost 200 mÂ² of image that make the 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.940
 viewer is immersed with what we 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:54.890
 Julian tells and pietra while dancing and 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:54.890
 by interacting question is now 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.489
 dassault systems is a company 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.870
 today who has experience of a 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.330
 3d experience platform that is 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.130
 unique in the world and that brings a 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.390
 extraordinary value to all 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.400
 industrialists with whom we work 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.709
 we help to innovate on a daily basis 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.150
 helps create fabulous products that 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.130
 can go from an airplane to a car 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.510
 going through the bilbao guggenheim 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.980
 so today dassault systems is 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.549
 present daily in this world of 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.630
 industry 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.140
 we realized that these softwares 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.750
 can also bring world value 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.410
 of the culture of research and of and 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.410
 education 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.820
 today bring our technologies 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.770
 to the general public confront them with 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.210
 rub to these issues there it's 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.250
 also to evolve is also 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.200
 meet the challenges of tomorrow for 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.870
 dassault systems is finally 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.740
 mastered today the engineering of a 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.200
 cultural project 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.010
 it is also another way of driver 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.010
 innovation 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.550
 I am very happy down his system 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.530
 because really the team that was there 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.390
 I felt like it was when we 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.880
 was really like a troop like 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.470
 a company you see even the pleasure 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.570
 to hear them connect on stage in 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.840
 greeting and e screaming behind 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:29.260
 I found it really very promising 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.400
 for the rest because in the end 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.670
 live show is a leaf ta 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.670
 family
