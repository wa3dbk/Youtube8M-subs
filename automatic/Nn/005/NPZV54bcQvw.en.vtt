00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.190
 at 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.570
 Hi, girls, how are you doing? 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.549
 Welcome once again to shvat dotcom 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.790
 in this case I am going to bring you a new 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.560
 clothing outfit an outfit that we say 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:24.119
 that I would wear it for an occasion 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:27.570
 Nightlife is worth a night, whether it's a party 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.550
 give everything to a dinner or whatever the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.210
 Well, good thing I wanted to make you 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.399
 one more weekend at night with a jacket 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.170
 singh of my roll that I like a lot and 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.180
 that's good, it depends on the site 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.609
 we can use this type of jackets for 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.969
 the night because it still scratches is worth more 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:46.379
 with the rains that we have mostly 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.359
 lately everywhere so 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.460
 well I wanted to tell you quickly the 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.679
 makeup that I wear as a floor 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.260
 do often in the eyes I carry with or 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:56.879
 without the makeup is very easy and 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.359
 easy to use and good that you can paste 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.429
 a lot of people I carry the kiko stick that 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.019
 is you already know these eye shadows of 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:07.290
 long duration that I love in the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.760
 tone 04 I find the tone 04 that I 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.220
 he wants to remember a little in the shade 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.530
 nash galÃ¡pagos but not so much 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.470
 three-dimensional and multi-colored flash 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.830
 OK 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.230
 Brownie has it and I like it 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.790
 much what is basically blurred by everything 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.640
 the eyelid mobile and then in the crease 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.290
 as a transition tone I wear this powder 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.000
 de marc that good that the truth 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.890
 is that I love it has a pulling tone 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.870
 to yellow and well it is the most 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.050
 wearable and as a transition color 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.930
 overcome love is worth the tone is the gold 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.580
 golightly how good I used it until the 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.710
 satiety I will know you many of 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.950
 you have the packaging of one color 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.570
 from a collection of more than being babe and 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.580
 then on the cheeks I have this one 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.540
 mineral blusher marc which is also 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.160
 of the natural collection and I do not think 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.420
 I'm sure the good thing is that it's a 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.490
 mineral tea color but that does not have 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.640
 many flashes in an orange tone 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.610
 so very very formed tablet worth and elton is 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.590
 the strawberry and very beautiful and good if not 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.660
 you have this for one of the style and then 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.479
 the lips decided to erase less a 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.430
 little bit because good eyes are something 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.260
 recharged or let's say a darker tone 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.110
 and the lips because I wanted to erase less 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.390
 so I've adapted by the lip lager 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.280
 these little boats pallets 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.960
 I think they are removed already 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.080
 I 'm not wrong, it's good these little boats 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.620
 which is like a gloss or a bar 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.910
 lips in very creamy cream but the 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.190
 truth is that for a lot and everything 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.709
 is the chelsea girls that is this color 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:40.450
 pink so nude reminds me of the turn of 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:42.400
 marc but more or less worth resembles 22 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.230
 ideas for you to go and well then already 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.970

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.390
