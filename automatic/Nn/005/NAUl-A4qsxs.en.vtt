cranial nerve three the oculomotor nerve

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.670 
cranial nerve three the oculomotor nerve
is<00:00:03.060> the<00:00:03.360> most<00:00:03.600> important<00:00:04.080> nerve<00:00:04.230> as<00:00:04.410> far<00:00:04.589> as

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
is the most important nerve as far as

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.950 
is the most important nerve as far as
eye<00:00:04.799> movement<00:00:05.430> if<00:00:05.549> you<00:00:05.640> knock<00:00:05.819> that<00:00:05.850> out<00:00:06.120> you

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
eye movement if you knock that out you

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.589 
eye movement if you knock that out you
knock<00:00:07.140> out<00:00:07.350> most<00:00:07.560> of<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.830> eye<00:00:07.859> muscles<00:00:08.189> in

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:08.599 
knock out most of the eye muscles in

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:10.820 
knock out most of the eye muscles in
fact<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:09.750> don't<00:00:09.900> need<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.080> remember<00:00:10.200> what

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
fact you don't need to remember what

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.060 
muscles criminal nervous free innervate
just<00:00:12.900> remember<00:00:13.170> what<00:00:13.290> it<00:00:13.410> doesn't<00:00:13.650> innervate

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
just remember what it doesn't innervate

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.340 
just remember what it doesn't innervate
and<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.700> doesn't<00:00:15.000> innervate<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.570> lateral

and it doesn't innervate the lateral

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.870 
and it doesn't innervate the lateral
rectus<00:00:16.500> because<00:00:17.310> that's<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.640> abducens

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
rectus because that's the abducens

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.330 
rectus because that's the abducens
nervous<00:00:18.449> number<00:00:18.869> six<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.949> doesn't

nervous number six and it doesn't
innervate<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.939> crazy<00:00:21.270> superior<00:00:22.080> oblique

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
innervate that crazy superior oblique

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.980 
innervate that crazy superior oblique
muscle<00:00:22.350> with<00:00:22.830> its<00:00:22.980> pulley<00:00:23.390> so<00:00:24.390> everything

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
muscle with its pulley so everything

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.380 
muscle with its pulley so everything
else<00:00:25.170> innervates<00:00:26.330> it<00:00:27.330> also<00:00:27.779> innervates<00:00:28.349> the

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
else innervates it also innervates the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.790 
else innervates it also innervates the
levator<00:00:30.390> muscle<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.960> levator<00:00:31.199> muscle<00:00:31.320> is

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
levator muscle and the levator muscle is

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.290 
levator muscle and the levator muscle is
that<00:00:32.009> muscle<00:00:32.250> that's<00:00:32.489> responsible<00:00:33.030> for

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
that muscle that's responsible for

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.630 
that muscle that's responsible for
keeping<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.989> eyelid<00:00:34.350> up<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:35.309> if<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.460> have<00:00:35.610> a

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
keeping the eyelid up so if you have a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.400 
keeping the eyelid up so if you have a
cranial<00:00:35.940> nerve<00:00:36.210> palsy<00:00:36.420> what<00:00:36.899> you'll<00:00:37.079> see<00:00:37.260> is

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
cranial nerve palsy what you'll see is

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.750 
cranial nerve palsy what you'll see is
that<00:00:37.440> little<00:00:37.860> bead<00:00:38.040> rupee<00:00:38.340> you'll<00:00:38.489> have<00:00:38.610> some

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
that little bead rupee you'll have some

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.900 
that little bead rupee you'll have some
ptosis<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:40.200> eye<00:00:40.230> will<00:00:40.680> be<00:00:40.829> somewhat<00:00:41.460> outwards

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
ptosis the eye will be somewhat outwards

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.840 
ptosis the eye will be somewhat outwards
because<00:00:42.180> cranial<00:00:42.809> nerve<00:00:42.930> six<00:00:43.399> still<00:00:44.399> pulling

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
because cranial nerve six still pulling

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.880 
because cranial nerve six still pulling
it<00:00:44.910> out<00:00:45.059> it'll<00:00:45.870> be<00:00:45.960> somewhat<00:00:46.320> downwards

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
it out it'll be somewhat downwards

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.190 
it out it'll be somewhat downwards
because<00:00:47.100> cranial<00:00:47.700> nerve<00:00:47.850> for<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.420> superior

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
because cranial nerve for that superior

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.450 
because cranial nerve for that superior
oblique<00:00:49.350> muscle<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.860> kind<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.070> yank<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
oblique muscle is kind of yank in the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.639 
oblique muscle is kind of yank in the
back<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.850> eye<00:00:51.079> so<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.289> eye<00:00:52.410> goes

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
back of the eye so that the eye goes

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.590 
back of the eye so that the eye goes
down<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.520> have<00:00:53.640> an<00:00:53.730> eye<00:00:53.879> that's<00:00:54.149> down<00:00:54.390> and

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
down so you have an eye that's down and

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.549 
down so you have an eye that's down and
out<00:00:54.860> down<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.129> out<00:00:56.309> as<00:00:56.550> cranial<00:00:56.969> nerve<00:00:57.120> three

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
out down and out as cranial nerve three

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.490 
out down and out as cranial nerve three
you've<00:00:58.559> got<00:00:58.739> someone<00:00:59.070> ptosis<00:00:59.489> down<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.090> I

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
you've got someone ptosis down and I

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.250 
you've got someone ptosis down and I
that's<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.710> cranial<00:01:02.100> nerve<00:01:02.250> three<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:03.260> there's

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
that's a cranial nerve three and there's

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.170 
that's a cranial nerve three and there's
also<00:01:04.470> pupil<00:01:04.920> involvement<00:01:05.400> sometimes<00:01:05.790> I'll<00:01:06.030> go

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
also pupil involvement sometimes I'll go

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.390 
also pupil involvement sometimes I'll go
over<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> second<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.590> what<00:01:07.860> causes<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
over that a second so what causes the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.700 
over that a second so what causes the
cranial<00:01:08.700> nerve<00:01:08.820> three<00:01:09.030> palsy<00:01:09.530> probably<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
cranial nerve three palsy probably the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.140 
cranial nerve three palsy probably the
biggest<00:01:10.890> cause<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.310> all<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.580> policies<00:01:11.970> is

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
biggest cause of all the policies is

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.380 
biggest cause of all the policies is
some<00:01:12.570> vascular<00:01:12.960> tech<00:01:13.200> process<00:01:14.240> either<00:01:15.240> from

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
some vascular tech process either from

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.570 
some vascular tech process either from
diabetes<00:01:15.900> hypertension<00:01:16.369> basically<00:01:17.369> have<00:01:17.549> a

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
diabetes hypertension basically have a

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.010 
diabetes hypertension basically have a
mini<00:01:17.790> stroke<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.299> one<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.570> these<00:01:18.659> cranial

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
mini stroke of one of these cranial

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.280 
mini stroke of one of these cranial
nerves<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:20.100> nerves<00:01:20.310> go<00:01:20.520> out<00:01:20.900> for<00:01:21.900> cranial

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
nerves and the nerves go out for cranial

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.480 
nerves and the nerves go out for cranial
nerve<00:01:22.409> three<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.770> also<00:01:22.920> need<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.250> think<00:01:23.340> about

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
nerve three you also need to think about

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.149 
nerve three you also need to think about
aneurysm<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.299> I'll<00:01:24.390> talk<00:01:24.570> about<00:01:24.600> that

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
aneurysm and I'll talk about that

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.969 
aneurysm and I'll talk about that
probably<00:01:26.159> but<00:01:26.400> pretty<00:01:26.759> soon<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.659> a

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
probably but pretty soon this is a

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.080 
probably but pretty soon this is a
computer<00:01:28.979> simulation<00:01:29.250> like<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.850> right<00:01:30.060> I

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
computer simulation like that right I

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.929 
computer simulation like that right I
it's<00:01:30.630> somewhat<00:01:30.930> down<00:01:31.520> someone<00:01:32.520> out<00:01:32.670> it

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
it's somewhat down someone out it

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.969 
it's somewhat down someone out it
doesn't<00:01:33.180> go<00:01:33.240> up<00:01:33.270> for<00:01:33.659> your<00:01:33.750> well<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.799> doesn't

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
doesn't go up for your well it doesn't

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.700 
doesn't go up for your well it doesn't
go<00:01:35.189> medial<00:01:35.640> very<00:01:35.820> well<00:01:36.170> goes<00:01:37.170> down<00:01:37.409> pretty

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
go medial very well goes down pretty

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.200 
go medial very well goes down pretty
good<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.159> certainly<00:01:38.490> goes<00:01:38.610> out<00:01:38.790> very<00:01:39.030> well

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
good and certainly goes out very well

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.240 
good and certainly goes out very well
and<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.869> see<00:01:40.079> our<00:01:40.170> pupils<00:01:40.500> dilate<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.950> as<00:01:41.009> well

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
and you see our pupils dilate it as well

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.880 
and you see our pupils dilate it as well
so<00:01:41.430> down<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.299> out<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.659> key<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.820> horizontal

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
so down and out is the key so horizontal

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.460 
so down and out is the key so horizontal
becomes<00:01:46.890> maybe<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.130> little<00:01:47.280> bit<00:01:47.369> more<00:01:47.490> apparent

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
becomes maybe a little bit more apparent

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.700 
becomes maybe a little bit more apparent
so<00:01:49.470> moving<00:01:49.890> on<00:01:50.450> so<00:01:51.450> what<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.320> importance

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
so moving on so what is the importance

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.069 
so moving on so what is the importance
of<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.950> pupil<00:01:53.340> well<00:01:54.329> at<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.509> point<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.869> may

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
of the pupil well at this point it may

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.139 
of the pupil well at this point it may
make<00:01:55.290> more<00:01:55.439> sense<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:56.009> look<00:01:56.310> at<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.520> brainstem

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
make more sense to look at the brainstem

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.120 
make more sense to look at the brainstem
so<00:01:57.719> we<00:01:57.810> can<00:01:57.930> understand<00:01:58.320> how<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.619> cranial

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
so we can understand how the cranial

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.620 
so we can understand how the cranial
nerve<00:01:59.250> three<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.759> really<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.000> other<00:02:00.060> cranial

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
nerve three and really the other cranial

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.319 
nerve three and really the other cranial
nerves<00:02:00.780> travel<00:02:01.619> now<00:02:02.250> cranial<00:02:02.670> three<00:02:02.909> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
nerves travel now cranial three the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.850 
nerves travel now cranial three the
nucleus<00:02:03.719> four<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.079> up<00:02:04.619> here<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.799> the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
nucleus four it is up here in the

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.609 
nucleus four it is up here in the
midbrain<00:02:05.159> it's<00:02:05.549> sort<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.880> under<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.619> superior

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
midbrain it's sort of under the superior

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.919 
midbrain it's sort of under the superior
colliculus<00:02:08.009> comes<00:02:08.819> forward<00:02:09.179> through<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.569> I

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
colliculus comes forward through the I

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.780 
colliculus comes forward through the I
guess<00:02:10.110> it's<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.440> cerebral<00:02:11.009> peduncle<00:02:11.220> it's

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
guess it's the cerebral peduncle it's

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.030 
guess it's the cerebral peduncle it's
been<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.940> little<00:02:12.150> while<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:12.450> they<00:02:12.569> looked<00:02:12.780> at

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
been a little while so they looked at

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.339 
been a little while so they looked at
Atlas<00:02:13.310> but<00:02:13.909> basically<00:02:14.299> comes<00:02:14.510> forward<00:02:14.900> in<00:02:15.260> the

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
Atlas but basically comes forward in the

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.050 
Atlas but basically comes forward in the
front<00:02:15.560> part<00:02:15.709> of<00:02:15.769> the<00:02:15.829> midbrain<00:02:16.099> and<00:02:16.849> it

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
front part of the midbrain and it

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.280 
front part of the midbrain and it
travels<00:02:17.480> towards<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.870> cavernous<00:02:18.260> sinus

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
travels towards the cavernous sinus

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.750 
travels towards the cavernous sinus
before<00:02:18.950> entering<00:02:19.219> the<00:02:19.370> back<00:02:19.519> of<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.730> eye

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
before entering the back of the eye

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.490 
before entering the back of the eye

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
somewhat special in the sense that it

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.360 
somewhat special in the sense that it
goes<00:02:25.670> very<00:02:25.939> close<00:02:26.209> to<00:02:27.250> Circle<00:02:28.250> of<00:02:28.340> Willis

it cut and cause a third nerve palsy now
you<00:02:48.859> can<00:02:49.040> imagine<00:02:49.189> that<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.609> distinction

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:49.939 
you can imagine that the distinction

you can imagine that the distinction
between<00:02:50.180> an<00:02:50.569> aneurysm<00:02:51.379> or<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.530> tumor<00:02:51.739> at<00:02:51.950> this

stroke from diabetes or hypertension is

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.720 
stroke from diabetes or hypertension is
a<00:02:56.569> very<00:02:56.900> big<00:02:57.349> distinction<00:02:57.769> that<00:02:58.189> can't<00:02:58.609> be

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
a very big distinction that can't be

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.170 
a very big distinction that can't be
missed<00:02:59.500> so<00:03:00.500> if<00:03:01.310> we<00:03:01.430> think<00:03:01.609> of<00:03:01.760> our<00:03:01.849> cranial

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
missed so if we think of our cranial

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.789 
missed so if we think of our cranial

nerve is a vasculature nerves need a
blood<00:03:11.239> supply<00:03:11.389> to<00:03:11.599> if<00:03:12.230> they're<00:03:12.590> going<00:03:12.680> to

blood supply to if they're going to

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.740 
blood supply to if they're going to
survive<00:03:13.069> and<00:03:13.430> you<00:03:14.030> can<00:03:14.150> imagine<00:03:14.269> that<00:03:14.540> the

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
survive and you can imagine that the

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.240 
survive and you can imagine that the
vasculature<00:03:15.139> nerves<00:03:15.620> is<00:03:15.829> usually<00:03:16.069> pretty

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
vasculature nerves is usually pretty

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.729 
vasculature nerves is usually pretty
deep<00:03:16.549> it's<00:03:16.879> deep<00:03:17.150> inside<00:03:17.329> that<00:03:17.720> nerve<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:18.229> if

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
deep it's deep inside that nerve and if

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:19.960 
deep it's deep inside that nerve and if
you<00:03:18.829> have<00:03:19.010> high<00:03:19.190> blood<00:03:19.220> pressure<00:03:19.519> or<00:03:19.940> diabetes

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
you have high blood pressure or diabetes

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.059 
you have high blood pressure or diabetes
and<00:03:20.629> it<00:03:20.690> hits<00:03:20.900> that<00:03:21.049> nerve<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:21.500> it<00:03:21.590> knocks<00:03:21.829> it

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
and it hits that nerve and it knocks it

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.750 
and it hits that nerve and it knocks it
out<00:03:22.629> well<00:03:23.629> it's<00:03:23.780> going<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:23.930> hit<00:03:24.079> it<00:03:24.169> deep<00:03:24.379> and

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
out well it's going to hit it deep and

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.800 
out well it's going to hit it deep and
usually<00:03:25.760> gives<00:03:25.879> you<00:03:25.970> pretty<00:03:26.180> substantial

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
usually gives you pretty substantial

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.339 
usually gives you pretty substantial
findings<00:03:27.229> however<00:03:28.359> the<00:03:29.359> parasympathetics

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
findings however the parasympathetics

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:31.990 
findings however the parasympathetics
and<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.560> parasympathetics<00:03:31.340> are<00:03:31.430> responsible

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
and the parasympathetics are responsible

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.629 
and the parasympathetics are responsible
for<00:03:32.120> pupil<00:03:32.569> constriction<00:03:33.370> so<00:03:34.370> you<00:03:34.430> see<00:03:34.609> a

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639 
for pupil constriction so you see a

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.490 
for pupil constriction so you see a
bright<00:03:34.909> light<00:03:34.940> your<00:03:35.359> parasympathetic<00:03:35.810> kick

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
bright light your parasympathetic kick

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.349 
bright light your parasympathetic kick
in<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:36.949> it<00:03:37.370> constricts<00:03:37.699> your<00:03:37.819> pupil

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
in and it constricts your pupil

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.770 
in and it constricts your pupil
those<00:03:38.989> parasympathetics<00:03:40.359> travel<00:03:41.359> with<00:03:41.659> the

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
those parasympathetics travel with the

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.309 
those parasympathetics travel with the
third<00:03:41.959> nerve<00:03:42.169> and<00:03:43.569> they<00:03:44.569> have<00:03:44.840> a<00:03:44.870> tendency<00:03:45.290> to

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
third nerve and they have a tendency to

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.920 
third nerve and they have a tendency to
run<00:03:45.590> on<00:03:45.829> the<00:03:46.250> outside<00:03:46.849> of<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.150> nerve<00:03:47.329> so

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
run on the outside of the nerve so

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.229 
run on the outside of the nerve so
they're<00:03:48.079> very<00:03:48.319> susceptible<00:03:48.680> to<00:03:49.310> compression

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
they're very susceptible to compression

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.539 
they're very susceptible to compression
so<00:03:51.169> if<00:03:51.229> you<00:03:51.319> have<00:03:51.470> an<00:03:51.560> aneurysm<00:03:52.069> or<00:03:52.220> a<00:03:52.250> tumor

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
so if you have an aneurysm or a tumor

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.210 
so if you have an aneurysm or a tumor

the nerve will sometimes spare the
parasympathetics<00:04:06.919> so<00:04:07.549> pupil<00:04:08.120> involvement<00:04:08.629> is

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
parasympathetics so pupil involvement is

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.319 
parasympathetics so pupil involvement is
