journal and Missy we're going to talk
about<00:00:07.859> pollination<00:00:08.490> I<00:00:08.760> know<00:00:08.820> that's<00:00:09.059> one<00:00:09.210> of

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
about pollination I know that's one of

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.540 
about pollination I know that's one of
the<00:00:09.360> most<00:00:09.480> critical<00:00:09.630> times<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.950> season

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
the most critical times of the season

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.160 
the most critical times of the season
with<00:00:11.700> corn<00:00:11.969> what<00:00:12.509> could<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:12.750> tell<00:00:12.900> us<00:00:12.960> about

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
with corn what could you tell us about

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.310 
with corn what could you tell us about
that<00:00:13.320> yeah<00:00:14.099> you're<00:00:14.250> right<00:00:14.719> pollination<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:16.080> so

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
that yeah you're right pollination is so

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.230 
that yeah you're right pollination is so
critical<00:00:16.830> we<00:00:17.010> spent<00:00:17.699> all<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:17.940> time<00:00:18.000> and

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
critical we spent all this time and

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.510 
critical we spent all this time and
energy<00:00:18.720> on<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.990> crop<00:00:19.199> up<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.619> point<00:00:19.920> we

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
energy on the crop up to this point we

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.769 
energy on the crop up to this point we
need<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.760> make<00:00:20.880> sure<00:00:20.939> somebody<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.720> our

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
need to make sure somebody in our

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.480 
need to make sure somebody in our
operation<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.500> going<00:00:22.769> out<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.130> doing<00:00:23.220> some

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
operation is going out and doing some

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.429 
operation is going out and doing some
scouting<00:00:23.699> at<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.119> time<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.449> pollination<00:00:24.930> we

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
scouting at the time of pollination we

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.140 
scouting at the time of pollination we
don't<00:00:25.529> get<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:25.800> crop<00:00:26.039> pollinated<00:00:26.699> we're

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
don't get this crop pollinated we're

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.900 
don't get this crop pollinated we're
going<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.330> have<00:00:27.480> very<00:00:27.689> big<00:00:28.439> losses<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:29.279> when<00:00:29.789> we

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
going to have very big losses so when we

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.460 
going to have very big losses so when we
go<00:00:30.060> up<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.359> field<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:30.689> time<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.109> year<00:00:31.289> we

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
go up the field this time the year we

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.200 
go up the field this time the year we
want<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.769> determine<00:00:31.920> how<00:00:32.790> well<00:00:32.969> are<00:00:33.149> we

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
want to determine how well are we

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.660 
want to determine how well are we
pollinating<00:00:34.050> as<00:00:34.410> far<00:00:34.710> as<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.920> percent<00:00:35.370> that

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
pollinating as far as the percent that

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.910 
pollinating as far as the percent that
some<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.180> ears<00:00:36.420> are<00:00:36.540> pollinated<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:37.800> you

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
some of the ears are pollinated so you

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.110 
some of the ears are pollinated so you
go<00:00:38.010> out<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.340> field<00:00:38.520> you're<00:00:38.760> going<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.940> grab

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
go out to the field you're going to grab

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.470 
go out to the field you're going to grab
some<00:00:39.149> actual<00:00:39.780> ears<00:00:40.140> off<00:00:40.730> slight<00:00:41.730> pull<00:00:42.329> them

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
some actual ears off slight pull them

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.520 
some actual ears off slight pull them
off<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.840> then<00:00:42.960> we're<00:00:43.079> actually<00:00:43.170> going<00:00:43.440> to

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
off and then we're actually going to

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.520 
off and then we're actually going to
slice<00:00:43.829> open<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.730> side<00:00:45.050> through<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.200> husk

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
slice open on the side through this husk

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.979 
slice open on the side through this husk
and<00:00:46.829> then<00:00:47.399> start<00:00:47.700> peeling<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.270> actual<00:00:48.690> husk

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
and then start peeling the actual husk

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.580 
and then start peeling the actual husk
back<00:00:49.320> while<00:00:49.980> trying<00:00:50.340> not<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.809> break<00:00:51.809> off<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> lot

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
back while trying not to break off a lot

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.830 
back while trying not to break off a lot
of<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.739> silks<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.730> are<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.000> there<00:00:56.660> once<00:00:57.660> we

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
of the silks that are in there once we

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.510 
of the silks that are in there once we
get<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.170> peeled<00:00:58.500> off<00:00:58.770> we're<00:00:59.160> going<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.340> do

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
get that peeled off we're going to do

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.849 
get that peeled off we're going to do
what<00:00:59.760> we<00:00:59.789> call<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.719> shape<00:01:00.989> test<00:01:01.350> where<00:01:01.710> we

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
what we call is the shape test where we

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.080 
what we call is the shape test where we
actually<00:01:02.039> take<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:04.500> ear<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.010> just<00:01:05.640> shake<00:01:05.909> it

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
actually take the ear and just shake it

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.670 
actually take the ear and just shake it
up<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.390> down<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> little<00:01:06.840> bit<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.350> see<00:01:07.650> what

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
up and down a little bit and see what

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.950 
up and down a little bit and see what
percentage<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.880> silks<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.540> actually

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
percentage of the silks that actually

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.070 
percentage of the silks that actually
break<00:01:10.200> off<00:01:10.470> if<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.220> silk<00:01:11.520> breaks<00:01:11.850> off<00:01:12.150> then<00:01:12.869> we

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
break off if the silk breaks off then we

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.480 
break off if the silk breaks off then we
know<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:13.619> already<00:01:13.860> been<00:01:13.950> pollinated

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
know that it's already been pollinated

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.330 
know that it's already been pollinated
so<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.360> can<00:01:15.600> see<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.110> ear<00:01:16.409> here<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:17.220> have

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
so you can see on this ear here we have

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.740 
so you can see on this ear here we have
a<00:01:17.369> quite<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> bit<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.119> still<00:01:18.360> needs<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.659> be

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
a quite a bit that still needs to be

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.870 
a quite a bit that still needs to be
pollinated<00:01:19.229> maybe<00:01:20.040> we're<00:01:20.280> only<00:01:20.400> at<00:01:20.640> about

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
pollinated maybe we're only at about

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.990 
pollinated maybe we're only at about
thirty<00:01:21.210> percent<00:01:21.600> pollination<00:01:22.259> okay<00:01:22.979> here<00:01:23.970> we

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
thirty percent pollination okay here we

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.539 
thirty percent pollination okay here we
have<00:01:24.270> an<00:01:24.390> example<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:25.020> an<00:01:25.200> ear<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.920> has<00:01:26.369> not

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
have an example of an ear that has not

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.580 
have an example of an ear that has not
pollinated<00:01:27.270> at<00:01:27.420> all<00:01:27.570> these<00:01:27.780> silks<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.290> just

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
pollinated at all these silks have just

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.800 
pollinated at all these silks have just
come<00:01:28.770> out<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.250> we<00:01:29.280> need<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.790> pollinate<00:01:30.329> you

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
come out so we need to pollinate you

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.480 
come out so we need to pollinate you
know<00:01:30.900> probably<00:01:31.140> ninety<00:01:31.530> five<00:01:31.710> percent<00:01:31.770> of

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
know probably ninety five percent of

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.149 
know probably ninety five percent of
this<00:01:32.729> ear<00:01:33.060> here<00:01:33.630> looks<00:01:34.590> are<00:01:34.740> quite<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> bit

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
this ear here looks are quite a bit

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.219 
this ear here looks are quite a bit
different<00:01:35.340> than<00:01:35.759> an<00:01:36.270> example<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.930> we<00:01:37.049> would

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
different than an example that we would

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.940 
different than an example that we would
have<00:01:37.409> here<00:01:37.860> we're<00:01:38.579> probably<00:01:39.020> 85<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.590> 90

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
have here we're probably 85 to 90

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.469 
have here we're probably 85 to 90
percent<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.640> ear<00:01:41.909> has<00:01:42.210> already

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
percent of this ear has already

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.210 
percent of this ear has already
pollinated<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.439> we<00:01:43.560> don't<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:43.860> too<00:01:44.070> much

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
pollinated so we don't have too much

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.510 
pollinated so we don't have too much
left<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.670> go<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:46.680> thing<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.040> we<00:01:47.130> got<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.399> keep

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
left to go the thing that we got to keep

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.470 
left to go the thing that we got to keep
an<00:01:47.700> eye<00:01:47.820> out

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
an eye out

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.630 
an eye out
when<00:01:48.630> we're<00:01:48.810> looking<00:01:48.930> for<00:01:49.380> what<00:01:50.100> percent<00:01:50.520> we

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
when we're looking for what percent we

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.850 
when we're looking for what percent we
are<00:01:50.760> pollinated<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.600> do<00:01:52.020> we<00:01:52.140> have<00:01:52.320> any<00:01:52.470> silk

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
are pollinated is do we have any silk

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.010 
are pollinated is do we have any silk
clipping<00:01:53.280> go<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:54.330> as<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.450> can<00:01:54.630> see<00:01:54.840> this

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
clipping go on so as you can see this

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.190 
clipping go on so as you can see this
year<00:01:55.290> here<00:01:55.710> has<00:01:55.950> had<00:01:56.160> some<00:01:56.850> Japanese<00:01:57.690> beetles

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
year here has had some Japanese beetles

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.740 
year here has had some Japanese beetles
or<00:01:58.470> corn<00:01:59.310> rootworm<00:01:59.520> beetles<00:01:59.670> come<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.540> and

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
or corn rootworm beetles come in and

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.810 
or corn rootworm beetles come in and
clip<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.020> silks<00:02:01.530> off<00:02:01.710> we<00:02:02.370> have<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.640> make<00:02:02.790> sure

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
clip the silks off we have to make sure

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.640 
clip the silks off we have to make sure
that<00:02:03.180> we<00:02:03.270> always<00:02:03.420> have<00:02:03.660> at<00:02:03.810> least<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.140> half<00:02:04.410> inch

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
that we always have at least a half inch

that we always have at least a half inch
of<00:02:04.890> silk<00:02:05.190> present<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:06.150> order<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.600> get<00:02:06.750> this

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
of silk present in order to get this

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.780 
of silk present in order to get this
thing<00:02:06.960> pollinated<00:02:07.830> so<00:02:08.010> if<00:02:08.070> we<00:02:08.220> go<00:02:08.340> out<00:02:08.460> we<00:02:08.670> do

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
thing pollinated so if we go out we do

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.970 
thing pollinated so if we go out we do
some<00:02:09.030> scouting<00:02:09.390> we<00:02:10.110> see<00:02:10.350> that<00:02:10.380> we<00:02:10.619> have<00:02:10.650> a<00:02:10.800> lot

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:10.980 
some scouting we see that we have a lot

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.730 
some scouting we see that we have a lot
of<00:02:11.010> so<00:02:11.310> clipping<00:02:11.700> going<00:02:11.970> on<00:02:12.120> we<00:02:12.930> slice<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.530> ear

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
of so clipping going on we slice the ear

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.140 
of so clipping going on we slice the ear
open<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.250> see<00:02:14.400> what<00:02:14.580> percent<00:02:15.030> were

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
open and see what percent were

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.420 
open and see what percent were
pollinated<00:02:15.840> if<00:02:15.960> we're<00:02:16.170> not<00:02:16.340> fifty<00:02:17.340> to

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
pollinated if we're not fifty to

seventy-five<00:02:17.820> percent<00:02:18.240> pollinated<00:02:19.080> we<00:02:19.230> might

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
seventy-five percent pollinated we might

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.410 
seventy-five percent pollinated we might
need<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.770> go<00:02:19.860> ahead<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.400> look<00:02:20.730> at<00:02:20.850> doing<00:02:21.180> some

need to go ahead and look at doing some

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.780 
need to go ahead and look at doing some
spraying<00:02:21.810> for<00:02:22.170> silk<00:02:22.500> clippers<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.490> very

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
spraying for silk clippers so very

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.120 
spraying for silk clippers so very

we've got to get in the fields and do

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.450 
we've got to get in the fields and do
some<00:02:29.460> scouting<00:02:29.670> for<00:02:30.000> pollination
