00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
characters coming out but i thought as

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.260 
characters coming out but i thought as
literally<00:00:33.070> one<00:00:33.579> of<00:00:33.670> those<00:00:33.790> things<00:00:34.000> are<00:00:34.210> just

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270

literally one of those things are just
trying<00:00:34.750> out<00:00:34.930> his<00:00:35.079> characters<00:00:35.559> literally<00:00:35.980> just

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
trying out his characters literally just

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.130 
trying out his characters literally just
see<00:00:37.000> what<00:00:37.149> they're<00:00:37.269> like<00:00:37.300> you<00:00:37.660> know<00:00:37.690> because

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
balance to show different levels just to

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.189

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.509 
week by all of this and I've got to
admit<00:00:55.870> I'm<00:00:56.050> not<00:00:56.320> entirely<00:00:56.589> too<00:00:56.980> convinced

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
admit I'm not entirely too convinced

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:58.770 
admit I'm not entirely too convinced
that<00:00:57.579> this<00:00:57.730> is<00:00:57.879> a<00:00:57.909> great<00:00:58.179> way<00:00:58.210> to<00:00:58.390> go<00:00:58.600> with

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
that this is a great way to go with

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.899 
that this is a great way to go with
digital<00:00:59.109> characters<00:00:59.559> tell<00:01:00.339> it<00:01:00.460> feels<00:01:00.670> bad

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
digital characters tell it feels bad

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:02.880 
digital characters tell it feels bad
sort<00:01:01.239> of<00:01:01.300> playing<00:01:01.600> a<00:01:01.749> character<00:01:01.929> and<00:01:02.469> not

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
sort of playing a character and not

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.560 
sort of playing a character and not
really<00:01:03.219> being<00:01:03.429> able<00:01:03.640> to<00:01:03.819> have<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:04.449> edge<00:01:04.540> of

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
really being able to have the edge of

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.390 
really being able to have the edge of
figure<00:01:05.019> itself<00:01:05.379> but<00:01:05.740> I<00:01:05.800> thought<00:01:06.010> just<00:01:06.220> for<00:01:06.250> the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
figure itself but I thought just for the

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.510 
figure itself but I thought just for the
interests<00:01:06.820> of<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:08.409> imbalance<00:01:08.920> I've<00:01:09.159> tried

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
interests of the imbalance I've tried

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.300 
interests of the imbalance I've tried
the<00:01:09.670> character<00:01:10.090> out<00:01:10.740> at<00:01:11.740> the<00:01:11.860> minute<00:01:12.159> it's

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
the character out at the minute it's

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.800 
the character out at the minute it's
just<00:01:12.549> literally<00:01:12.850> level<00:01:13.210> zero<00:01:13.450> so<00:01:13.570> it's<00:01:13.720> a

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
just literally level zero so it's a

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.319 
just literally level zero so it's a
ground<00:01:14.170> pound<00:01:15.750> okay<00:01:16.750> so<00:01:17.049> we<00:01:17.229> get<00:01:17.409> like<00:01:17.799> a<00:01:18.329> can

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
ground pound okay so we get like a can

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.990 
ground pound okay so we get like a can
fling<00:01:19.780> thing<00:01:20.350> like<00:01:20.560> am<00:01:20.790> basically<00:01:21.790> like<00:01:21.969> the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
fling thing like am basically like the

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.940 
fling thing like am basically like the
user<00:01:22.299> dis<00:01:22.479> which<00:01:22.659> is<00:01:22.810> a<00:01:22.960> CO<00:01:23.259> and<00:01:23.469> already<00:01:23.770> would

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
user dis which is a CO and already would

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.289 
user dis which is a CO and already would
killed<00:01:24.130> myself<00:01:24.280> so<00:01:24.640> there<00:01:24.759> we<00:01:24.850> go<00:01:24.880> so<00:01:25.149> he's

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
killed myself so there we go so he's

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.080 
killed myself so there we go so he's
back<00:01:25.450> in<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.630> room<00:01:26.549> okay<00:01:27.549> so<00:01:27.610> this<00:01:27.790> a<00:01:27.850> bit<00:01:27.969> like

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
back in the room okay so this a bit like

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.990 
back in the room okay so this a bit like
a<00:01:28.119> boomerang<00:01:28.950> was<00:01:29.950> already<00:01:30.250> a<00:01:30.280> weapon<00:01:30.790> that<00:01:30.820> we

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
a boomerang was already a weapon that we

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.929 
a boomerang was already a weapon that we
can<00:01:31.149> use<00:01:31.180> so<00:01:31.899> that's<00:01:32.079> its<00:01:32.229> of<00:01:32.520> weapon<00:01:33.520> from<00:01:33.640> far

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
can use so that's its of weapon from far

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.420 
can use so that's its of weapon from far
away<00:01:33.969> now<00:01:34.630> up<00:01:34.840> close<00:01:35.229> he<00:01:35.740> has<00:01:35.950> some<00:01:36.219> additional

there we go ok so now let's look at a

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.459 
there we go ok so now let's look at a
haze<00:02:03.700> skill<00:02:04.060> tree<00:02:04.299> and<00:02:04.780> let's<00:02:05.020> see<00:02:05.200> what<00:02:05.350> he

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
haze skill tree and let's see what he

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.490 
haze skill tree and let's see what he
looks<00:02:05.649> like<00:02:05.740> on<00:02:06.100> here<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:07.450> this<00:02:07.810> is<00:02:07.990> his<00:02:08.170> skill

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
looks like on here so this is his skill

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.450 
looks like on here so this is his skill
tree<00:02:08.770> here<00:02:09.009> so<00:02:09.880> let's<00:02:10.090> open<00:02:10.179> this<00:02:10.539> up<00:02:11.100> so<00:02:12.100> first
