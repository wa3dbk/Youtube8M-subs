one thing I will talk about still within
the<00:00:03.350> realm<00:00:04.350> of<00:00:04.470> reading<00:00:05.029> is<00:00:06.029> being<00:00:06.210> able<00:00:06.359> to

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
the realm of reading is being able to

the realm of reading is being able to
practice<00:00:07.170> reading<00:00:07.379> I<00:00:07.589> know<00:00:07.649> when<00:00:07.950> we<00:00:08.069> all

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
practice reading I know when we all

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.400 
practice reading I know when we all
practice<00:00:08.550> by<00:00:08.670> ourselves<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:09.330> think<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.290> lot<00:00:10.380> of

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
practice by ourselves I think a lot of

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.980 
practice by ourselves I think a lot of
people<00:00:10.469> have<00:00:10.710> bad<00:00:10.860> practice<00:00:11.400> habits<00:00:11.870> say<00:00:12.870> for

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
people have bad practice habits say for

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.749 
people have bad practice habits say for
example<00:00:13.019> if<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.590> seal<00:00:13.889> off<00:00:13.980> your<00:00:14.130> 18<00:00:14.370> practicing

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
ok for muscle repetition but if you want

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.830 
ok for muscle repetition but if you want
to<00:00:43.620> be<00:00:44.040> able<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.250> practice<00:00:44.610> for<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.789> game<00:00:45.030> you

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
to be able to practice for a game you

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.299 
to be able to practice for a game you
also<00:00:46.020> got<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.559> know<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.680> little<00:00:46.920> bit<00:00:47.039> boring

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
also got a you know a little bit boring

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.950 
also got a you know a little bit boring
times<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.850> got<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.030> be<00:00:48.149> able<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.390> practice

times but you got to be able to practice
dribbling<00:00:49.670> practice<00:00:50.670> i<00:00:50.730> would<00:00:50.879> say<00:00:50.969> practice

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
dribbling practice i would say practice

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.340 
dribbling practice i would say practice
reading<00:00:51.510> because<00:00:51.750> there's<00:00:51.899> not<00:00:52.020> really<00:00:52.170> much

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
reading because there's not really much

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.680 
reading because there's not really much
to<00:00:52.410> look<00:00:52.920> at<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.239> practice<00:00:54.239> taking<00:00:54.480> your

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
to look at but practice taking your

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.049 
to look at but practice taking your
focus<00:00:55.050> away<00:00:55.199> from<00:00:55.410> from<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.010> ball<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.910> what<00:00:57.030> I

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
focus away from from the ball so what I

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.029 
focus away from from the ball so what I
do<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.390> help<00:00:57.480> help<00:00:57.780> enforce<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.590> have<00:00:59.010> a

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
do to help help enforce that is I have a

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.090 
do to help help enforce that is I have a
drill<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:01.289> like<00:01:01.530> like<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.980> do

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
drill that I that I like like like to do

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.780 
drill that I that I like like like to do
or<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.280> actually<00:01:02.520> force<00:01:02.940> myself<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:04.670> based<00:01:05.670> on

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
or I actually force myself to based on

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.399 
or I actually force myself to based on
my<00:01:05.850> cycles<00:01:06.240> know<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.600> did<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.170> kind<00:01:07.320> of

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
my cycles know that I did this kind of

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.780 
my cycles know that I did this kind of
cycle<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.979> got<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> pork<00:01:08.850> myself<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.750> pass<00:01:09.990> on

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
cycle I got a pork myself to pass on

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.420 
cycle I got a pork myself to pass on
different<00:01:11.790> counts<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.360> i'll<00:01:12.479> count<00:01:12.750> like<00:01:13.430> 123

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
different counts so i'll count like 123

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.550 
different counts so i'll count like 123
and<00:01:17.360> i'll<00:01:18.360> pause<00:01:18.540> myself<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.990> practice<00:01:19.439> as

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
and i'll pause myself to practice as

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:35.679 
and i'll pause myself to practice as
well<00:01:19.590> as<00:01:19.890> do<00:01:20.070> for<00:01:21.680> 1230<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:24.720> i'll<00:01:24.840> go<00:01:24.960> three

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.910 

what<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> top<00:01:36.990> stops<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.530> two<00:01:37.770> different

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
what the top stops you in two different

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.679 
what the top stops you in two different
ways<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.400> helps<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.939> not<00:01:39.119> just<00:01:39.329> get<00:01:39.450> leaves

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
ways it helps you to not just get leaves

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.480 
ways it helps you to not just get leaves
and<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.930> just<00:01:40.049> bring<00:01:40.200> them<00:01:40.350> all<00:01:40.500> over<00:01:40.680> do<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
and you just bring them all over do the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.730 
and you just bring them all over do the
past<00:01:41.790> whenever<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.299> want<00:01:42.540> two<00:01:42.750> forces<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.590> to

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
past whenever you want two forces you to

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.760 
past whenever you want two forces you to
kind<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.570> you<00:01:45.570> force<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.729> pass<00:01:48.680> forces<00:01:49.680> you

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
kind of you force you to pass forces you

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.350 
kind of you force you to pass forces you
to<00:01:49.860> pass<00:01:50.100> with<00:01:50.399> someone<00:01:50.759> something<00:01:51.180> else

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
to pass with someone something else

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.880 
to pass with someone something else
telling<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.899> when<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.170> pass<00:01:52.500> because<00:01:52.680> that's

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
telling you when to pass because that's

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.609 
telling you when to pass because that's
how<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.220> works<00:01:53.369> with<00:01:53.549> with<00:01:53.939> with<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.689> game<00:01:54.930> in

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
how it works with with with in a game in

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.109 
how it works with with with in a game in
a<00:01:55.680> game<00:01:55.710> it's<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.310> holes<00:01:56.579> gonna<00:01:56.670> be<00:01:56.820> opened

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
a game it's that holes gonna be opened

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.030 
a game it's that holes gonna be opened
up<00:01:57.240> when<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.990> defender<00:01:58.350> decides<00:01:58.710> he's<00:01:58.950> going

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
up when the defender decides he's going

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.740 
up when the defender decides he's going
to<00:01:59.130> open<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.340> up<00:01:59.430> for<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.329> that's<00:02:00.509> when<00:02:00.659> you

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
to open it up for you so that's when you
