00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.119
 Hello everyone and welcome to the stand 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.210
 asus in the mobile world congress we are 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.630
 with him at his 65 one of the terminals 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.240
 the family in fort they have different 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.550
 sizes of screens to 64 the 5 that is 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.960
 this one that you have here and the 6 to your 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.629
 specifications are also different 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.180
 but the idea is the same a device 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.309
 with a very sober design with some 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.199
 interchangeable housings as you can see 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.930
 on the back the accessories 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.760
 we also have the book type covers and 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.250
 an interesting terminal with a 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.610
 Intel atom 2 gigahertz processor 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.890
 1.6 depending on the Android 4.3 market 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.010
 one giga of ram internal storage 16 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.979
 gigas with expandable memory by micro 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.420
 sd as you see an interface 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:02.070
 Exceptionally personalized elegant 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.739
 but very different from what we are 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.350
 used to seeing a screen in this 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.030
 5-inch HD resolution case that does not 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.299
 full hd front camera 2 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.700
 rear megapixel with 8 flash 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.730
 megapixels is not very heavy about 145 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.820
 grams this obviously varies if 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:25.370
 we passed 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:27.170
 at 65 for example the 204 as you see 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.800
 the aesthetic is similar a part 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.619
 inferior that mimics the metal that follows 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.160
 being plastic a backside that in 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:40.100
 this case the font 4 has no flash 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.020
 but it does have a gig of ram a 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.150
 processor also and equally powerful 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.100
 that his older brother 8 gigas of 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.960
 internal storage the screen 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:53.240
 passed 4 inches of 800 x 480 and by 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.090
 last we go to the largest of them to their 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.180
 in font 6 in this case the 6 screen 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:03.229
 inch resolution hd front camera 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:06.140
 2 megapixel rear of 13 stable 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.479
 also with flash led as you can see 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.860
 change the casing even the whole theme 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.410
 of the edges reminds us in this case 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.480
 to the engine or the motorcycle to change the 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.360
 accessories also the type cover 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.360
 book that we just saw 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.560
 we are very interested in your commercial 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.900
 says this by operator that what 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.180
 Free marketed more as you 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.310
 as many stores as possible 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.070
 one of the companies that has mobiles 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.020
 hungry that does not have a massive quota of 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.310
 sales but that manufactures some terminals 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.310
 really interesting
