which<00:01:58.740> actually<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.069> really<00:01:59.369> liked<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.789> didn't

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
which actually I really liked and didn't

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.940 
which actually I really liked and didn't
make<00:02:00.209> its<00:02:00.389> way<00:02:00.569> into<00:02:00.719> any<00:02:00.929> other<00:02:01.139> films<00:02:01.499> but<00:02:01.740> I

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
make its way into any other films but I

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.709 
make its way into any other films but I
think<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.459> red<00:02:02.639> eye<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.850> quite<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.420> know<00:02:03.450> it's

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
think the red eye is quite you know it's

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.120 
think the red eye is quite you know it's
quite<00:02:03.959> cool<00:02:04.170> quite<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.770> sort<00:02:05.039> of<00:02:05.069> a

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
quite cool quite a sort of a

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.869 
quite cool quite a sort of a
bloodthirsty<00:02:06.740> sort<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.799> scavenger<00:02:08.459> look<00:02:08.640> to

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
bloodthirsty sort of scavenger look to

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.330 
bloodthirsty sort of scavenger look to
it<00:02:09.319> and<00:02:10.319> then<00:02:10.439> we've<00:02:10.590> got<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.769> actual<00:02:10.920> figure

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
it and then we've got the actual figure

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.820 
it and then we've got the actual figure
itself<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.180> as<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.629> said<00:02:12.689> the<00:02:13.049> paint<00:02:13.439> job

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
itself and as I said the paint job

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.480 
itself and as I said the paint job
is<00:02:13.890> fantastic<00:02:14.250> look<00:02:15.000> at<00:02:15.120> this<00:02:15.240> blue<00:02:15.540> this

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
is fantastic look at this blue this

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.370 
is fantastic look at this blue this
gradient<00:02:17.490> of<00:02:17.670> light<00:02:17.940> blue<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.600> dark<00:02:18.630> gray<00:02:19.200> and

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
gradient of light blue to dark gray and

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.190 
gradient of light blue to dark gray and
then<00:02:19.530> like<00:02:19.770> gray<00:02:20.070> for<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:21.450> lower<00:02:21.660> bill<00:02:21.990> I

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
then like gray for the the lower bill I

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.390 
then like gray for the the lower bill I
just<00:02:22.410> think<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:22.680> looks<00:02:22.710> great

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
just think it looks great

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.470 
just think it looks great

veins<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.080> way<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.470> arm<00:02:49.680> is

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
veins and the way that the arm is

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.150 
veins and the way that the arm is
bulging<00:02:50.700> from<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.360> wing<00:02:51.570> it's<00:02:51.810> just<00:02:52.160> really

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
bulging from the wing it's just really

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.280 
bulging from the wing it's just really
nice<00:02:53.490> attention<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.240> detail<00:02:54.660> on<00:02:54.690> these<00:02:55.020> toys

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
nice attention to detail on these toys

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.860 
nice attention to detail on these toys
and<00:02:55.320> I<00:02:56.250> mean<00:02:57.090> compared<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.570> lot<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:57.780> the

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
and I mean compared to a lot of the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.270 
and I mean compared to a lot of the
dinosaur<00:02:58.290> toys<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.590> are<00:02:58.709> out<00:02:58.830> at<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:58.980> time

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
dinosaur toys that are out at the time

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.500 
dinosaur toys that are out at the time
there<00:02:59.520> really<00:02:59.550> was<00:02:59.940> nothing<00:03:00.300> else<00:03:00.420> that

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
there really was nothing else that

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.130 
there really was nothing else that
compared<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:01.080> this<00:03:02.360> so<00:03:03.360> you've<00:03:03.510> got<00:03:03.750> in

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
compared to this so you've got in

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.710 
compared to this so you've got in
articulation<00:03:05.100> wise<00:03:05.250> you've<00:03:05.520> got<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:06.180> pivot

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
articulation wise you've got a pivot

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.810 
articulation wise you've got a pivot
here<00:03:06.870> at<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.110> neck<00:03:07.320> you<00:03:08.100> can<00:03:08.280> open<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:08.790> close

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
here at the neck you can open and close

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.480 
here at the neck you can open and close
the<00:03:09.120> jaw<00:03:09.300> by<00:03:09.480> pulling<00:03:09.930> this<00:03:10.620> guy<00:03:10.680> down<00:03:11.220> and

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
the jaw by pulling this guy down and

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.820 
the jaw by pulling this guy down and
it's<00:03:11.970> spring-loaded<00:03:12.300> so<00:03:12.780> it'll<00:03:12.930> snap<00:03:13.170> shut<00:03:13.560> so

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
it's spring-loaded so it'll snap shut so

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.560 
it's spring-loaded so it'll snap shut so
you<00:03:13.920> can<00:03:14.100> you<00:03:14.730> know<00:03:14.850> you<00:03:14.910> can<00:03:15.120> attack<00:03:15.420> your

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
you can you know you can attack your

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.600 
you can you know you can attack your
action<00:03:15.959> figures<00:03:16.760> these<00:03:19.220> arms<00:03:20.220> while<00:03:20.489> the

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
action figures these arms while the

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.880 
action figures these arms while the
wings<00:03:20.820> are<00:03:21.590> articulated<00:03:22.590> but<00:03:22.680> they're<00:03:22.800> very

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
wings are articulated but they're very

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.640 
wings are articulated but they're very
loose<00:03:23.250> here<00:03:23.820> and<00:03:23.940> that's<00:03:24.630> for<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:24.930> reason<00:03:24.989> on

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
loose here and that's for a reason on

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.630 
loose here and that's for a reason on
the<00:03:26.220> back<00:03:26.430> there<00:03:27.239> is<00:03:27.269> a<00:03:27.750> button<00:03:28.470> on<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.459> back

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
the back there is a button on the back

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.110 
the back there is a button on the back
and<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.810> press<00:03:31.110> it<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:31.610> the<00:03:32.610> wings<00:03:32.910> actually

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
and you press it and the wings actually

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.830 
and you press it and the wings actually
flap<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:34.220> because<00:03:35.220> these<00:03:35.400> are<00:03:35.610> loose<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:36.660> get

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
flap and because these are loose you get

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.390 
flap and because these are loose you get
the<00:03:36.959> motion<00:03:37.140> that<00:03:37.350> it's<00:03:37.620> like<00:03:37.800> flapping<00:03:38.280> like

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
the motion that it's like flapping like

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.570 
the motion that it's like flapping like
a<00:03:38.459> wing<00:03:39.620> without<00:03:40.620> taking<00:03:40.950> out<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.190> box<00:03:41.370> is

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
a wing without taking out the box is

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.449 
a wing without taking out the box is
hard<00:03:41.820> to<00:03:42.060> describe<00:03:42.780> but<00:03:43.470> on<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.709> back<00:03:43.890> there

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
hard to describe but on the back there

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.460 
hard to describe but on the back there
is<00:03:44.580> a<00:03:44.610> diagram<00:03:45.090> explaining<00:03:45.660> this<00:03:45.900> further<00:03:46.170> and

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
is a diagram explaining this further and

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.110 
is a diagram explaining this further and
then<00:03:47.130> you<00:03:47.280> can<00:03:47.430> see<00:03:47.580> at<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.730> bottom<00:03:47.850> there

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
then you can see at the bottom there

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.479 
then you can see at the bottom there
you've<00:03:48.269> got<00:03:48.530> you've<00:03:49.530> got<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.800> legs<00:03:50.040> there<00:03:50.340> and

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
you've got you've got the legs there and

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.040 
you've got you've got the legs there and
they're<00:03:50.670> articulated<00:03:51.360> so<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:51.570> can<00:03:51.750> rotate

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
they're articulated so you can rotate

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.790 
they're articulated so you can rotate
those<00:03:52.500> around<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:54.260> at<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.350> moment<00:03:55.680> they're

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
those around and at the moment they're

then you've got the can a logo down
there<00:05:04.969> but<00:05:05.969> really<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.500> the<00:05:07.500> flapping<00:05:07.789> action

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
there but really the the flapping action

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:10.909 
there but really the the flapping action
feature<00:05:09.000> is<00:05:09.210> explained<00:05:09.629> very<00:05:09.840> well<00:05:09.900> there<00:05:10.319> and

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
feature is explained very well there and

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.820 
feature is explained very well there and
that's<00:05:11.190> why<00:05:11.400> the<00:05:11.460> wings<00:05:11.849> are<00:05:12.090> so<00:05:12.240> loose<00:05:12.830> around

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
that's why the wings are so loose around

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.670 
that's why the wings are so loose around
that<00:05:14.069> area<00:05:14.340> of<00:05:14.430> articulation<00:05:15.199> so<00:05:16.199> there's<00:05:16.620> a

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
that area of articulation so there's a
