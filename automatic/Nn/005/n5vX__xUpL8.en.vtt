00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
g-drive ET batc and what's great about

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.330 
g-drive ET batc and what's great about
it<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.360> portable<00:00:33.719> drive<00:00:34.160> that<00:00:35.160> is

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
it is it's a portable drive that is

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.910 
it is it's a portable drive that is
watertight<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:37.230> actually<00:00:37.410> will<00:00:37.739> allow

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
watertight and it actually will allow

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.040 
watertight and it actually will allow
you<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.160> be<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.340> environments<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:38.969> would<00:00:39.600> not

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
you to be in environments that would not

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.970 
you to be in environments that would not
be<00:00:40.079> as<00:00:41.040> as<00:00:41.640> hospitable<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.500> with<00:00:43.770> other

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
be as as hospitable and with other

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.750 
be as as hospitable and with other
equipment<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.530> if<00:00:46.530> we<00:00:46.739> look<00:00:46.890> at<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.190> drive<00:00:47.430> we

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
equipment so if we look at this drive we

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.910 
equipment so if we look at this drive we
see<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.420> rugged<00:00:48.719> drive<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.710> got<00:00:49.890> a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
see that it's a rugged drive it's got a

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.340 
see that it's a rugged drive it's got a
two<00:00:50.340> meter<00:00:50.520> drop<00:00:50.730> on<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.210> rug<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:51.899> it's<00:00:52.020> rated

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
two meter drop on a rug so it's rated

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.420 
two meter drop on a rug so it's rated
and<00:00:52.550> if<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:53.699> open<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.210> up<00:00:54.980> we<00:00:55.980> could<00:00:56.129> see<00:00:56.309> that

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
and if we open this up we could see that

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.450 
and if we open this up we could see that
we<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:57.059> drive<00:00:57.960> inside<00:00:58.219> that<00:00:59.219> looks

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
we have a drive inside that looks

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.580 
we have a drive inside that looks
familiar<00:00:59.609> that<00:01:00.270> looks<00:01:00.480> familiar<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.440> is

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
familiar that looks familiar so this is

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.709 
familiar that looks familiar so this is
a<00:01:01.649> one<00:01:01.859> terabyte<00:01:02.039> drive<00:01:02.460> extremely<00:01:03.270> light<00:01:03.510> and

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
a one terabyte drive extremely light and

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.280 
a one terabyte drive extremely light and
when<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.710> put<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.100> case<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.750> a<00:01:06.750> sudden

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
when you put it in the case of a sudden

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.100 
when you put it in the case of a sudden
this<00:01:07.590> becomes<00:01:07.950> watertight<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.960> actually

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
this becomes watertight and it actually

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.039 
this becomes watertight and it actually
floats<00:01:10.530> that's<00:01:11.460> cool<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.180> if<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.720> look<00:01:12.930> at

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
floats that's cool and if you look at

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.780 
floats that's cool and if you look at
the<00:01:13.140> back<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> drive<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.159> has<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> tethered

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the back of the drive it has a tethered

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.670 
the back of the drive it has a tethered
cable<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.720> now<00:01:15.930> what<00:01:16.049> we've<00:01:16.229> done<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.530> we've

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
cable so now what we've done is we've

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.820 
cable so now what we've done is we've
taken<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:17.040> USB<00:01:17.490> drive<00:01:17.790> USB<00:01:18.450> 3<00:01:18.689> drive<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.320> giving

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
taken a USB drive USB 3 drive and giving

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.679 
taken a USB drive USB 3 drive and giving
the<00:01:19.950> ability<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.400> connect<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.880> by

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
the ability to connect that by

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.960 
the ability to connect that by
thunderbolt<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.710> that's<00:01:23.369> built<00:01:23.640> into<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
thunderbolt and that's built into the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.929 
thunderbolt and that's built into the
case<00:01:24.180> now<00:01:24.780> something<00:01:25.590> else<00:01:25.740> we<00:01:26.490> built<00:01:26.790> this

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
case now something else we built this

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.350 
case now something else we built this
ecosystem<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.470> ATC<00:01:29.040> drives<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.729> this

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
ecosystem of the ATC drives and this

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.380 
ecosystem of the ATC drives and this
will<00:01:30.540> work<00:01:30.780> with<00:01:31.079> all<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.350> our<00:01:31.710> other<00:01:32.390> ATC

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
will work with all of our other ATC

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.140 
will work with all of our other ATC
products<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.530> if<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.920> take<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.310> drive<00:01:35.610> you

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
products so if you take this drive you

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.539 
products so if you take this drive you
could<00:01:36.270> actually<00:01:36.420> pop<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.960> into<00:01:37.079> our<00:01:37.200> ed<00:01:38.100> module

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
could actually pop it into our ed module

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.640 
could actually pop it into our ed module
a<00:01:38.670> TV<00:01:38.970> dock<00:01:39.210> with<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.750> rest<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> EU<00:01:40.229> view
