00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
how they handle this I've read a few of

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.940 
how they handle this I've read a few of
these<00:00:27.840> patents<00:00:28.199> myself<00:00:28.560> they're<00:00:28.739> very

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:28.950 
these patents myself they're very

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.830 
these patents myself they're very
complex<00:00:29.340> documents<00:00:29.969> I<00:00:30.059> can't<00:00:30.390> imagine<00:00:30.480> a

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
complex documents I can't imagine a

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.450 
complex documents I can't imagine a
regular<00:00:31.110> person<00:00:31.290> be<00:00:31.710> able<00:00:31.919> understand<00:00:32.369> this

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
regular person be able understand this

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.369 
regular person be able understand this
easily<00:00:32.879> especially<00:00:33.300> with<00:00:33.660> sewing<00:00:33.930> has<00:00:34.140> no

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
easily especially with sewing has no

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.979 
easily especially with sewing has no
background<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.980> computers<00:00:35.670> or<00:00:36.030> technology<00:00:36.660> so

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
background in computers or technology so

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.360 
background in computers or technology so
it's<00:00:37.140> probably<00:00:37.320> over<00:00:37.620> their<00:00:37.860> heads<00:00:38.129> and

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
it's probably over their heads and

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.010 
it's probably over their heads and
listen<00:00:38.820> no<00:00:38.969> offense<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.390> them<00:00:39.480> but<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.809> don't

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
listen no offense to them but I don't

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.299 
listen no offense to them but I don't
think<00:00:40.140> they<00:00:40.230> were<00:00:40.350> really<00:00:40.649> prepared<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
think they were really prepared to the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.860 
think they were really prepared to the
oldest<00:00:41.640> moving<00:00:42.210> on<00:00:42.329> I'm<00:00:42.450> thinking<00:00:42.510> about

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
oldest moving on I'm thinking about

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.540 
oldest moving on I'm thinking about
Google<00:00:43.110> verse<00:00:43.260> Apple<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.920> problem<00:00:44.460> we

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
Google verse Apple and the problem we

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.459 
Google verse Apple and the problem we
have<00:00:44.730> with<00:00:44.760> all<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:46.109> know<00:00:46.199> what

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
have with all this is that I know what

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.989 
have with all this is that I know what
app<00:00:46.589> was<00:00:46.769> trying<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.159> do<00:00:47.339> it<00:00:47.370> it's<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:47.940> like

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:47.999 
app was trying to do it it's just like

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:49.520 
app was trying to do it it's just like
how<00:00:48.210> they<00:00:48.390> handle<00:00:48.690> their<00:00:48.809> computers<00:00:49.320> they

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
how they handle their computers they

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.930 
how they handle their computers they
don't<00:00:49.679> want<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:49.920> whole<00:00:50.100> ecosystem<00:00:50.789> where

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
don't want this whole ecosystem where

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.090 
don't want this whole ecosystem where
people<00:00:51.359> are<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:51.659> enclosed<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.679> of<00:00:52.829> course

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
people are just enclosed in it of course

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.860 
people are just enclosed in it of course
they<00:00:53.309> want<00:00:53.489> all<00:00:53.670> apple<00:00:54.059> products<00:00:54.449> connected

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
they want all apple products connected

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.419 
they want all apple products connected
to<00:00:54.929> that<00:00:55.019> person<00:00:55.499> but<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.769> problem<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.249> is

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
to that person but the problem is is

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:57.950 
to that person but the problem is is
that<00:00:56.460> Apple<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:56.969> creating<00:00:57.390> their<00:00:57.569> products

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
that Apple is creating their products

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.540 
that Apple is creating their products
with<00:00:58.109> using<00:00:58.530> other<00:00:58.679> people's<00:00:58.949> technologies

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
with using other people's technologies

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.329 
with using other people's technologies
including<00:01:00.329> 3g<00:01:00.749> including<00:01:01.229> Wi-Fi<00:01:01.409> and<00:01:02.069> talked

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
including 3g including Wi-Fi and talked

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:04.100 
including 3g including Wi-Fi and talked
about<00:01:02.579> before<00:01:02.760> with<00:01:03.210> Google<00:01:03.690> more<00:01:03.839> roll

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
about before with Google more roll

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.870 
about before with Google more roll
paddings<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.860> Sam<00:01:05.190> some<00:01:05.430> chips<00:01:05.729> and

paddings a you Sam some chips and

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.090 
paddings a you Sam some chips and
screens<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.540> it's<00:01:06.659> not<00:01:06.900> like<00:01:07.110> Apple<00:01:07.590> uses

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
screens so it's not like Apple uses

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.770 
screens so it's not like Apple uses
everything<00:01:08.610> that's<00:01:08.880> apple<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.540> what's

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
everything that's apple and what's

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.630 
everything that's apple and what's
happening<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.680> very<00:01:10.920> obvious<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.549> I'm

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
happening here is very obvious and I'm

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.830 
happening here is very obvious and I'm
surprised<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.240> have<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> lot<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.540> people<00:01:12.780> that

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
surprised I have a lot of people that

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.180 
surprised I have a lot of people that
they<00:01:12.960> are<00:01:13.020> not<00:01:13.200> really<00:01:13.440> talking<00:01:13.830> about<00:01:13.860> this

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
they are not really talking about this

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.070 
they are not really talking about this
but<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.520> appears<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.060> be<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.510> Apple<00:01:15.930> is

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
but it appears to be that Apple is

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.900 
but it appears to be that Apple is
gaining<00:01:16.470> all<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.950> money<00:01:17.220> because<00:01:17.580> they're

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
gaining all this money because they're

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.550 
gaining all this money because they're
not<00:01:18.000> compensating<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.900> people<00:01:19.260> who<00:01:19.350> actually
