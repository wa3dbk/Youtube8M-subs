00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.040
 hi in all respects gives one finds himself 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.690
 today for a new tutorial and 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.910
 today we're finally going I'm going 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.259
 show you how to start your pc at 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.030
 distance from your home via a 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.719
 mobile device so a phone 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.690
 android 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.539
 an android tablet or so a 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.519
 apple device and in my case an ipod 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.390
 fourth generation touch 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.400
 so to start the function we 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.679
 let's use to start the pc and 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.530
 the wake on lan whose wall will we 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.660
 allow to wake up our pc via a 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.930
 a command so a magic package 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.629
 sent via the network in order to revive 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.800
 the pc so your pc must first 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.270
 return to sleep mode 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.730
 you can men standby mode 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.480
 do not consume and it will restart faster 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.449
 so we know I do not know then 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.280
 we will have to go dance md so 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:01:00.300
 start type smd and then typed 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.879
 ipconfig slash hall like these us 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.119
 let's recover 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:08.340
 excuse me our ip address then 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.940
 the physical address so our address 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.650
 mac that you will have 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.250
 so far an ethernet card connection 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.010
 local network 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.000
 you have your physical address and 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:24.100
 your address 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.350
 hyper new at 192 168 points 1 point 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.420
 254 the last figure varies according to the 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.630
 post on your network so you will see 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.150
 here you are not necessarily 254 even 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.800
 hardly at all once it's 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.520
 done you will have to download the 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.970
 applications 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.410
 so you have a lot of applications 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.150
 available for ios i tested moccia 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.630
 moccia lol and then I have used 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:54.320
 also another for for android 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.330
 it was pc auto auto workers 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.460
 here you have several available on 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.260
 principle the forgiveness principle remains the 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:06.350
 even so we will go directly 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.690
 at the configuration right now you 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.580
 just explain how to do 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.780
 since I did not learn the video but 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.940
 I will show you after 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.100
 functioning thanks to small 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.190
 videos that I took with the ipod and the 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.940
 poor phone to shoot the bullets 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.460
 and applications in use so 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.930
 I apologize for the quality 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.040
 mediocre a little bit of video but good 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.200
 here I am with the means of the edge 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.220
 we for the configuration once you 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.730

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.550
 the address mac as forgiveness of me in 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:46.310
 my case it will be f460 that 18 37 c7 and 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.400
 your ip address so 192 168 points a 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.280
 point the port of your bread the lead and 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.920
 the idea of ​​your pc or other device 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.630
 is an important thing too you 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.940
 open up high doubs you will have to open a 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.600
 port therefore the port that is advised 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.070
 it's the new 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.530
 so you can search on the internet 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.820
 how to open a port for those who 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.620
 would have the freebox 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.620
 here's how do you make it in 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.750
 local network redirect is very simple 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.510
 you 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:19.150
 so you enter your ip lan with the the 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.340
 the pc chooses me so it's the 49 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.190
 since i started for the video the pc 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.410

 the address of the management so the 49 and 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.459
 you open the the new port and 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.380
 then in comments for you 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.730

 serious once you get everything 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.049
 set up on software programs further 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.670
 several tutorials with precise images 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.530

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.280
 software anyway they are great 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.310
 simple to use 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.099
 you can go directly to 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.510
 the application and test it so I 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.420
