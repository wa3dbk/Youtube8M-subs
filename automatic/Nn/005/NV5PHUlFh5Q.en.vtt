ginger<00:02:27.610> deep<00:02:28.610> tablespoon<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.920> I'm<00:02:31.069> gonna<00:02:31.569> put

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
ginger deep tablespoon and I'm gonna put

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.589 
ginger deep tablespoon and I'm gonna put
in<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:33.380> juice<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.010> zest<00:02:34.040> of<00:02:34.519> about<00:02:34.819> one

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
in the juice and the zest of about one

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.259 
in the juice and the zest of about one
and<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.810> half<00:02:35.840> limits<00:02:36.560> so<00:02:37.459> that's<00:02:37.730> in<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.060> form

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
and a half limits so that's in the form

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:39.160 
and a half limits so that's in the form
of<00:02:38.480> ice<00:02:38.690> blocks

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
of ice blocks

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.309 
of ice blocks
so<00:02:40.099> that's<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.459> juice<00:02:40.700> in<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.120> cyst<00:02:41.510> so<00:02:42.019> what

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
so that's the juice in the cyst so what

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.740 
so that's the juice in the cyst so what
I'm<00:02:43.069> gonna<00:02:43.340> assume<00:02:43.819> that<00:02:44.150> that<00:02:44.299> will<00:02:44.450> fill<00:02:44.660> up

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
I'm gonna assume that that will fill up

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.770 
I'm gonna assume that that will fill up
the<00:02:44.900> gaps<00:02:45.170> in<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.560> cup<00:02:48.940> I'm<00:02:49.940> just<00:02:50.299> gonna<00:02:50.510> keep

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
the gaps in the cup I'm just gonna keep

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.400 
the gaps in the cup I'm just gonna keep
my<00:02:50.959> job<00:02:51.230> which<00:02:51.500> is<00:02:51.549> measuring<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:53.930> what<00:02:54.110> we<00:02:54.230> got

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
my job which is measuring so what we got

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.530 
my job which is measuring so what we got
here<00:02:54.440> is<00:02:54.620> this<00:02:55.130> is<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:55.400> moist<00:02:55.640> capsule<00:02:56.390> that

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
here is this is a moist capsule that

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.490 
cherries I'm not going to add any liquid
to<00:03:16.730> it<00:03:16.760> I'm<00:03:17.480> just<00:03:17.540> going<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:17.959> bring<00:03:18.140> it<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.470> a

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500

to it I'm just going to bring it to a
simmer<00:03:18.799> and<00:03:19.519> let<00:03:19.579> it<00:03:19.850> simmer<00:03:20.150> for<00:03:20.359> about<00:03:20.450> five

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
simmer and let it simmer for about five

minutes

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.500 
minutes
so<00:03:22.220> go<00:03:23.180> ahead<00:03:24.160> saying<00:03:25.160> that<00:03:25.310> I<00:03:25.400> said<00:03:25.639> between

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
so go ahead saying that I said between

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.650 
so go ahead saying that I said between
half<00:03:26.959> to<00:03:27.410> two-thirds<00:03:27.950> of<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.250> cup<00:03:28.280> of<00:03:28.579> sugar<00:03:28.660> for

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
half to two-thirds of a cup of sugar for

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.500 
half to two-thirds of a cup of sugar for
every<00:03:29.900> cup<00:03:30.139> of<00:03:30.170> fruit<00:03:30.590> I<00:03:31.030> probably<00:03:32.030> had<00:03:32.239> a<00:03:32.269> bad

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
every cup of fruit I probably had a bad

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.129 
every cup of fruit I probably had a bad
five<00:03:32.959> and<00:03:33.170> a<00:03:33.200> half<00:03:33.230> cups<00:03:33.769> of<00:03:33.920> raw<00:03:34.160> sugar<00:03:34.489> a<00:03:35.139> bit

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
five and a half cups of raw sugar a bit

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.729 
five and a half cups of raw sugar a bit
later<00:03:36.620> on<00:03:37.690> right<00:03:38.690> so<00:03:39.049> it's<00:03:39.230> been<00:03:39.260> simmering

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
later on right so it's been simmering

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.110 
later on right so it's been simmering
for<00:03:40.069> about<00:03:40.130> five<00:03:40.579> minutes

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
for about five minutes

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.990 
for about five minutes
one<00:03:41.389> then<00:03:41.540> do<00:03:41.690> is<00:03:41.810> turn<00:03:41.959> the<00:03:42.139> heat<00:03:42.290> right<00:03:42.410> off

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
one then do is turn the heat right off

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.759 
one then do is turn the heat right off
add<00:03:44.000> more<00:03:44.329> thought<00:03:44.660> and<00:03:44.840> a<00:03:44.870> half<00:03:45.019> cups<00:03:45.380> of<00:03:45.530> raw

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
add more thought and a half cups of raw

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.349 
add more thought and a half cups of raw
sugar<00:03:46.100> and<00:03:47.290> then<00:03:48.670> dissolve<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.880> sugar<00:03:49.910> in

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
sugar and then dissolve the sugar in

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:54.970 
sugar and then dissolve the sugar in
there<00:03:50.569> and<00:03:51.260> then<00:03:52.069> just<00:03:53.350> stir<00:03:54.350> it<00:03:54.380> around<00:03:54.530> and

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
there and then just stir it around and

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.370 
there and then just stir it around and
dissolve<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.489> sugar<00:03:55.840> and<00:03:56.840> then<00:03:57.139> the<00:03:57.350> sugar

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
dissolve the sugar and then the sugar

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.979 
dissolve the sugar and then the sugar
will<00:03:57.950> cool<00:03:58.190> it<00:03:58.400> down<00:03:58.579> sufficiently<00:03:58.940> so<00:03:59.660> I<00:03:59.690> can

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
will cool it down sufficiently so I can

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.620 
will cool it down sufficiently so I can
blend<00:04:00.290> it<00:04:00.470> with<00:04:00.590> my<00:04:00.650> hand<00:04:01.100> blender<00:04:01.639> and

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
blend it with my hand blender and

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.870 
blend it with my hand blender and
there's<00:04:02.930> my<00:04:03.170> plastic<00:04:03.680> hand<00:04:04.310> blender

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.620 

so<00:04:07.480> just<00:04:08.400> just<00:04:09.400> finish<00:04:09.760> blending<00:04:10.000> this<00:04:10.360> with<00:04:10.600> a

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
so just just finish blending this with a

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.240 
so just just finish blending this with a
stick<00:04:11.080> blender<00:04:11.260> and<00:04:12.090> what<00:04:13.090> I'm<00:04:13.210> gonna<00:04:13.330> do<00:04:13.600> is

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
stick blender and what I'm gonna do is

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.270 
stick blender and what I'm gonna do is
put<00:04:15.250> it<00:04:15.720> back<00:04:16.720> on<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.170> stove<00:04:18.450> a<00:04:19.450> lot<00:04:19.930> of<00:04:20.050> heat

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
put it back on the stove a lot of heat

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.720 
put it back on the stove a lot of heat
let<00:04:21.280> it<00:04:21.400> simmer<00:04:21.670> for<00:04:22.000> probably<00:04:22.330> bad<00:04:22.570> for<00:04:22.690> now

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
let it simmer for probably bad for now

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.340 
let it simmer for probably bad for now
I've<00:04:24.730> got<00:04:24.910> to<00:04:25.000> go<00:04:25.090> down<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.480> street<00:04:25.780> and<00:04:25.990> pick
