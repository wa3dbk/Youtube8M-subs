mouse however it does have a couple of

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.499 
mouse however it does have a couple of
really<00:01:20.220> cool<00:01:20.369> ways<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.820> doing<00:01:20.909> input<00:01:21.390> of

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
really cool ways of doing input of

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.880 
really cool ways of doing input of
course<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.810> does<00:01:21.930> have<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> touchscreen<00:01:22.590> this

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
course it does have a touchscreen this

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.399 
course it does have a touchscreen this
is<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.040> full<00:01:23.340> touchscreen<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.689> also<00:01:24.900> has<00:01:25.229> an

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
is a full touchscreen but it also has an

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.249 
is a full touchscreen but it also has an
integrated<00:01:25.700> track<00:01:26.700> area<00:01:27.060> right<00:01:27.570> here<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:28.200> you

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
integrated track area right here so you

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.260 
integrated track area right here so you
can<00:01:28.409> actually<00:01:28.710> move<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.460> mouse<00:01:29.640> around<00:01:29.670> on

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
can actually move the mouse around on

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.960 
can actually move the mouse around on
the<00:01:30.600> screen<00:01:30.900> with<00:01:31.290> your<00:01:31.320> thumb<00:01:31.860> while<00:01:32.610> you're

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
using the machine so you don't

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.260 
using the machine so you don't
necessarily<00:01:34.409> have<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.310> touch<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.820> screen<00:01:36.090> to
