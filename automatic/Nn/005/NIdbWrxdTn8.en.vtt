00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.059
 Welcome to a new episode of 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.519
 youtube and loves nor will I belong to rr 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.230
 culture and loves playing cards and the first of 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.379
 the herbs and the second one that would be his 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.050
 well out there cleared the goal they go by themselves 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:21.599
 by itself but not by itself 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.099
 and the second come back I do not have alone either 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:27.220
 two bullets in the charger thing that I did not 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:29.740
 like so let's recharge it 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.269
 and we are going to jump more take out the campers 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.740
 above 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.820
 or not 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.820
 simply the best 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.360
 and if I do not leave I 'm down here either 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.809
 the imprecise 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.680
 But it is that why why then 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.560
 nothing 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.820
 whites 2 let's say playing both this 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.640
 game that I do not know why I follow them 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.280
 trying to find logic a game in the 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.560
 that people 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.030
 he likes clicks and does not like him 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.730
 like people like clips 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.640
 singh 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.440
 to recharge 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.440
 want to block me the fast charger 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.860
 and fast 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.409
 why 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.630
 We will fuck damn to me 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.220
 I have to see him and I have not seen him I do not know 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.110
 I have not seen it 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.250
 as for the field the fast charger I 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.190
 I think it's going to be a lot simpler 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:47.800
 well quite a bit simpler 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:49.720
 get a few more low and a lot 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.440
 good stop complaining and point to play 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:58.200
 point to kill that that's what 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.200
 matter one fact was plus one here triple 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.050
 I do not get a triple because they are not going to 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.880
 It seemed trans and I would not have taken it out 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.630
 I mean people like geese 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.240
 the others are the clicks and good follow me 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.710
 enjoying this game despite all other 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.180
 yes 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.180
 and there's no irony I really mean it 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.709
 man if you go with m 8 and you stay 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:38.730
 I'm not eloping, not getting mad, it's not worth it 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:40.680
 it does not work as good as that 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.660
 your connection is not mine what the fuck 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.160
 that is 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.160
 the boats of death 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.599
 and the bad thing about doing this series 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.640
 is that if I get a game because 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.400
 look good I'm going first being 38 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.690
 duel for marga team I put together the 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.960
 Sir 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.920
 If I got some bad game or a dish that 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.709
 upload no 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.239
 what good is the case we are not the 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.940
 games in which you win is that in 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.340
 true was a bank that 's what it is 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.700
 try the road to world in upload all 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.239
 absolutely all the games and that 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:26.220
 you see that I am a producer to the player 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.220
 crisco bolts copper easy and 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.270
 and clown I'm going to laugh out there why not 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.060
 it could have already been is a collateral or 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.060
 something not 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.030
 there's one up and there were two in the 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.040
 cabin and another in the central part 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.840
 where was domain time I've seen 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.670
 so many people that I said that I do here 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.580
 in first 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.860
 it's very important what 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.010
 good so that a second element for 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.010
 here 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:05.130
 there are people who do not think like me 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.460
 but I think it's right 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.800
 completely dependent on getting a 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.890
 clip or not depends on who kills the 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.860
 first or who who more than second and 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.840
 we go very clearly that influences in 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.840
 get a clip or not because if you see a 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.080
 uncle with a light machine gun and gives a 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.730
 shot with a sniper a lot would say and 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.470
 format first that of a submachine gun 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.260
 light I beat first the sniper that is 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.120
 I ope and if it kills one or kills vote but 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.620
 it also depends on how each player is 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.660
 do not look we have already loaded fast very 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.060
 all right 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.680
 but it influences very much the 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.810
 distances also if it's closer 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.840
 this dimension so I do not go into a 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.830
 dead end but that you know 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.830
 that influences enough 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.560
 fuck city fucking triple or welcome 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.640
 to the metro club that pulls out a fifa tablet 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.640
 that you have me in an achievement 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.940
 how to reload fuck are coming 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:08.659
 out there new ones I say 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:11.159
 What do I do? I 'm 12 short. I do not know. 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:13.500
 that the next with loose 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:15.240
 I do not know 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.669
 when we give 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.900
 and that because it has not been collateral 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.740
 please, what do I want to have the whore 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.440

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.570
 please 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.670
 but let 's look on the bright side and 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.280
 we have the quick charger for the 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:36.729
 next game we play the road 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:40.360
 to the world 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:44.199

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:20.350
