people<00:00:01.270> I<00:00:01.420> changed<00:00:01.990> through<00:00:02.050> our<00:00:02.320> belt<00:00:02.679> in

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:02.889 
people I changed through our belt in

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:06.150 
people I changed through our belt in
that<00:00:03.100> floating<00:00:03.550> skull<00:00:04.090> um<00:00:04.779> but<00:00:05.380> it's<00:00:05.740> kind<00:00:06.069> of

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:06.160 
that floating skull um but it's kind of

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.860 
that floating skull um but it's kind of
too<00:00:06.339> tight<00:00:06.640> now<00:00:06.879> because<00:00:07.149> it<00:00:07.270> doesn't<00:00:07.660> go<00:00:07.750> all

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:07.870 
too tight now because it doesn't go all

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.480 
too tight now because it doesn't go all
the<00:00:07.899> way<00:00:07.990> to<00:00:08.109> top<00:00:08.500> and<00:00:08.769> sometimes<00:00:09.160> when<00:00:09.340> it's

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:09.490 
the way to top and sometimes when it's

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.450 
the way to top and sometimes when it's
trying<00:00:09.670> to<00:00:09.730> go<00:00:09.849> up<00:00:09.880> it<00:00:10.120> just<00:00:10.150> stops<00:00:10.740> but<00:00:11.740> it's

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:12.460 
trying to go up it just stops but it's

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.430 
trying to go up it just stops but it's
not<00:00:12.610> broken<00:00:13.030> right<00:00:13.330> now<00:00:13.389> but<00:00:13.750> the<00:00:14.110> mortar

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
not broken right now but the mortar

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.160 
not broken right now but the mortar
might<00:00:14.620> run<00:00:15.099> out<00:00:15.219> but<00:00:15.519> it's<00:00:16.510> not<00:00:16.690> looking<00:00:16.869> right

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
might run out but it's not looking right

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.320 
might run out but it's not looking right
now<00:00:17.199> now<00:00:17.830> I'm<00:00:18.010> sure<00:00:18.279> it<00:00:18.400> might<00:00:18.670> be<00:00:18.910> like<00:00:19.090> that

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
now now I'm sure it might be like that

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:27.850 
now now I'm sure it might be like that
on<00:00:19.539> the<00:00:19.720> four<00:00:20.380> spirits

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.130 

just<00:00:28.860> to<00:00:29.010> let<00:00:29.190> you<00:00:29.310> know<00:00:29.490> because<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.900> not

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
just to let you know because it's not

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:44.830 
just to let you know because it's not
broken<00:00:33.050> yes

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.000 

media<00:00:45.840> we<00:00:46.050> possibly<00:00:46.920> but<00:00:47.960> one<00:00:48.960> two<00:00:49.380> or<00:00:49.680> three

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
media we possibly but one two or three

00:00:50.010 --> 00:01:12.320 
media we possibly but one two or three
weeks<00:00:50.480> till<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.510> 4th<00:00:52.020> your<00:00:52.710> home

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.050 

and<00:01:13.330> the<00:01:13.479> batteries<00:01:13.869> are<00:01:14.080> good<00:01:14.619> and<00:01:14.950> it's<00:01:15.940> that

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
and the batteries are good and it's that

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:35.220 
and the batteries are good and it's that
slowly

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.510 

see<00:01:35.800> what<00:01:36.070> I<00:01:36.100> mean<00:01:37.650> it's<00:01:38.650> going<00:01:38.890> to<00:01:38.950> do<00:01:39.130> that<00:01:39.310> on

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
see what I mean it's going to do that on

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:54.270 
see what I mean it's going to do that on
the<00:01:39.640> fourth<00:01:39.910> part<00:01:41.550> /<00:01:42.550> 4<00:01:42.850> so<00:01:43.740> be<00:01:44.740> aware<00:01:44.980> that

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.940 

flowers<00:01:55.280> rubber<00:01:55.579> belts<00:01:56.000> will<00:01:56.149> be<00:01:56.179> snapped<00:01:56.659> too

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.740 

well<00:02:00.950> it's<00:02:01.189> not<00:02:01.369> snapped<00:02:01.819> it<00:02:02.090> it<00:02:02.240> still<00:02:02.450> floats

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
well it's not snapped it it still floats

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.389 
well it's not snapped it it still floats
but<00:02:03.020> when<00:02:03.619> it<00:02:03.710> goes<00:02:03.859> all<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.039> way<00:02:04.130> to<00:02:04.189> the<00:02:04.369> top

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
but when it goes all the way to the top

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.330 
but when it goes all the way to the top
it'll<00:02:04.850> just<00:02:05.060> slide<00:02:05.299> back<00:02:05.360> down<00:02:05.890> to<00:02:06.890> here

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
it'll just slide back down to here

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.210 
it'll just slide back down to here
because<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.479> rubber<00:02:09.259> belt<00:02:09.470> is<00:02:09.679> just<00:02:09.920> so

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
because the rubber belt is just so

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.030 
because the rubber belt is just so
lewistown<00:02:10.940> was<00:02:11.239> looser<00:02:11.720> though<00:02:11.989> because<00:02:12.799> when

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
lewistown was looser though because when

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.410 
lewistown was looser though because when
I<00:02:13.069> was<00:02:13.280> that<00:02:13.430> all<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.730> way<00:02:13.819> at<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:13.940> top<00:02:14.209> it

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
I was that all the way at the top it

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.789 
I was that all the way at the top it
buzzed<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.790> it<00:02:16.940> hardly<00:02:17.390> had<00:02:17.870> contact<00:02:18.410> with<00:02:18.530> the

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
buzzed so it hardly had contact with the

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.270 
buzzed so it hardly had contact with the
rubber<00:02:19.010> belt<00:02:19.340> but<00:02:20.380> now<00:02:21.380> it<00:02:21.560> really<00:02:21.769> is<00:02:22.010> too

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
rubber belt but now it really is too

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.100 
rubber belt but now it really is too
tight<00:02:22.579> it's<00:02:23.030> having<00:02:23.329> too<00:02:23.540> much<00:02:23.690> contact<00:02:24.230> now

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
tight it's having too much contact now

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.390 
tight it's having too much contact now
see<00:02:27.110> ya<00:02:27.410> not<00:02:29.380> just<00:02:30.380> because<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.890> rubber<00:02:31.130> belts

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
see ya not just because the rubber belts

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.600 
see ya not just because the rubber belts
too<00:02:31.610> tight<00:02:31.849> people<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:33.170> will<00:02:33.349> loosen<00:02:33.620> up<00:02:34.069> after

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
too tight people it will loosen up after

00:02:34.610 --> 00:03:14.690 
too tight people it will loosen up after
a<00:02:34.640> while<00:02:34.879> once<00:02:35.299> it<00:02:35.799> rubs<00:02:36.799> a<00:02:36.950> lot

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.330 

saans<00:03:15.700> this<00:03:16.330> on<00:03:16.510> Oh<00:03:17.640> his<00:03:18.640> face<00:03:18.910> is<00:03:18.940> charged

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
saans this on Oh his face is charged

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.360 
saans this on Oh his face is charged
going<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.730> footpad<00:03:22.180> it's<00:03:22.870> unplugged<00:03:23.290> now<00:03:23.590> for

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
going the footpad it's unplugged now for

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.200 
going the footpad it's unplugged now for
the<00:03:24.490> noise<00:03:24.610> one<00:03:25.030> I<00:03:26.310> have<00:03:27.310> to<00:03:27.490> take<00:03:27.670> when<00:03:28.060> it's

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
the noise one I have to take when it's

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.260 
the noise one I have to take when it's
trashed<00:03:28.510> have<00:03:28.780> to<00:03:28.930> take<00:03:29.110> this<00:03:29.320> off

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.490 

not<00:03:33.270> making<00:03:33.540> noise<00:03:33.690> because<00:03:33.960> no<00:03:34.080> batteries

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
not making noise because no batteries

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.860 
not making noise because no batteries

that's this broken beans thats as loud

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.399 
that's this broken beans thats as loud
as<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.310> is<00:03:41.670> I<00:03:42.000> think<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:43.080> circuit<00:03:43.620> board<00:03:43.860> is<00:03:44.180> is

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409 
as it is I think the circuit board is is

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.729 
as it is I think the circuit board is is
friedell<00:03:46.409> well<00:03:46.860> it's<00:03:47.159> not<00:03:47.340> right<00:03:47.610> it's<00:03:47.640> the

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
friedell well it's not right it's the

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.920 
friedell well it's not right it's the
circuit<00:03:49.739> board<00:03:49.920> is<00:03:50.159> messed<00:03:50.909> up<00:03:51.150> it<00:03:51.390> blew<00:03:51.720> out

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
circuit board is messed up it blew out

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.750 
circuit board is messed up it blew out
the<00:03:52.290> not<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.280> noise<00:03:54.799> does<00:03:55.799> circuit<00:03:56.519> board

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
the not the noise does circuit board

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.740 
the not the noise does circuit board

commands<00:04:01.349> anymore<00:04:01.560> I<00:04:02.040> think<00:04:02.819> it<00:04:03.000> like<00:04:03.500> the

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
commands anymore I think it like the

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.339 
commands anymore I think it like the
circuit<00:04:04.950> blew<00:04:05.159> out<00:04:05.370> where'd<00:04:06.329> it<00:04:06.510> makes<00:04:07.079> noise

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
circuit blew out where'd it makes noise

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.030 
circuit blew out where'd it makes noise
that's<00:04:09.230> what<00:04:10.230> happened<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.739> witch<00:04:10.920> and

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
that's what happened to the witch and

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.720 
that's what happened to the witch and
the<00:04:11.129> cauldron<00:04:11.640> too<00:04:11.819> I<00:04:12.200> need<00:04:13.200> a<00:04:13.470> new<00:04:13.859> evil<00:04:14.160> color

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
the cauldron too I need a new evil color
