Robb and David's going to take us
through<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.660> process<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.230> designing<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:26.040> super

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
through the process of designing a super

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.010 
through the process of designing a super
bike<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.640> what<00:00:26.759> he<00:00:26.880> went<00:00:27.000> through<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.509> this

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
bike and what he went through and this

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.990 
bike and what he went through and this
is<00:00:28.230> not<00:00:28.529> only<00:00:28.740> his<00:00:28.949> for<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.369> super<00:00:29.640> bike<00:00:29.789> but

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
is not only his for a super bike but

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.279 
is not only his for a super bike but
BMWs<00:00:30.510> for<00:00:30.539> super<00:00:30.990> bike

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
BMWs for super bike

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.350 
BMWs for super bike
so<00:00:31.410> David<00:00:31.710> take<00:00:32.369> us<00:00:32.489> through<00:00:32.640> what's<00:00:33.090> really

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
so David take us through what's really

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.880 
so David take us through what's really
exciting<00:00:33.720> for<00:00:33.809> us<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.110> course<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.710> this

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
exciting for us of course is that this

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.650 
exciting for us of course is that this
is<00:00:34.949> the<00:00:35.370> first<00:00:35.550> super<00:00:35.850> bike<00:00:36.000> we've<00:00:36.210> done<00:00:36.420> at

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
is the first super bike we've done at

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.509 
is the first super bike we've done at
the<00:00:36.960> same<00:00:37.170> time<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.680> should<00:00:37.830> recognize<00:00:38.070> it

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:38.519 
the same time you should recognize it

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:41.180 
the same time you should recognize it
immediately<00:00:38.640> as<00:00:39.150> it<00:00:39.269> BMW<00:00:39.750> for<00:00:40.559> us<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.920> always

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
immediately as it BMW for us that always

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.060 
immediately as it BMW for us that always
means<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.699> the<00:00:41.850> design<00:00:42.650> expresses<00:00:43.650> what<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
means that the design expresses what the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.950 
means that the design expresses what the
engineering<00:00:44.850> does<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.270> what<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.390> motorcycle

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
engineering does and what the motorcycle

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.540 
engineering does and what the motorcycle
is<00:00:46.050> about<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.710> first<00:00:46.950> thing<00:00:47.130> is<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.370> look

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
is about so the first thing is you look

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.549 
is about so the first thing is you look
at<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:47.940> it's<00:00:48.510> not<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.719> touring<00:00:49.110> bike<00:00:49.260> it's

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
at it and it's not a touring bike it's

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.760 
at it and it's not a touring bike it's
not<00:00:49.649> an<00:00:49.860> off-road<00:00:50.160> bike<00:00:50.340> it's<00:00:50.850> definitely<00:00:51.540> a

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
not an off-road bike it's definitely a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.770 
not an off-road bike it's definitely a
Superbike<00:00:52.910> when<00:00:53.910> we<00:00:54.059> started<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:54.750> were

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
Superbike when we started we were

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.569 
Superbike when we started we were
looking<00:00:55.170> at<00:00:55.230> how<00:00:55.440> do<00:00:55.500> we<00:00:55.680> still<00:00:55.920> differentiate

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
looking at how do we still differentiate

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.369 
looking at how do we still differentiate
ourselves<00:00:56.730> from<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.329> others<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.809> when<00:00:58.260> you

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
ourselves from the others and when you

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.750 
ourselves from the others and when you
look<00:00:58.559> at<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.829> other<00:00:58.950> bikes<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.579> road

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
look at the other bikes on the road

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.450 
look at the other bikes on the road
today<00:01:00.050> mostly<00:01:01.050> they<00:01:01.230> have<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:01.590> big<00:01:01.800> piece<00:01:02.399> of

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
today mostly they have one big piece of

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.639 
today mostly they have one big piece of
plastic<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.390> goes<00:01:03.539> all<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.899> way<00:01:04.050> down<00:01:04.320> here

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
plastic that goes all the way down here

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:06.859 
plastic that goes all the way down here
and<00:01:04.800> they<00:01:05.220> tend<00:01:05.489> also<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.910> have<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> very<00:01:06.450> strong

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
and they tend also to have a very strong

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.840 
and they tend also to have a very strong
line<00:01:07.140> towards<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.649> front<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.490> kind<00:01:08.759> of

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
line towards the front and I kind of

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.660 
line towards the front and I kind of
call<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.270> snow<00:01:09.479> plow<00:01:09.750> effect<00:01:10.460> we<00:01:11.460> want

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
call that the snow plow effect we want

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.160 
call that the snow plow effect we want
it<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.820> look<00:01:11.940> fast<00:01:12.210> because<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.690> fast<00:01:13.020> and

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
it to look fast because it is fast and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.160 
it to look fast because it is fast and
rather<00:01:14.039> than<00:01:14.310> accentuating<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.180> shape

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
rather than accentuating this shape

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.410 
rather than accentuating this shape
towards<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.650> front<00:01:16.920> as<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.520> see<00:01:17.970> here<00:01:18.330> we

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
towards the front as you see here we

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.929 
towards the front as you see here we
make<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.780> very<00:01:18.840> clear<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.920> shape<00:01:20.189> is

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
make it very clear that this shape is

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.060 
make it very clear that this shape is
very<00:01:21.450> aggressive<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.200> there<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.710> wedge

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
very aggressive so there is this wedge

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.280 
very aggressive so there is this wedge
shape<00:01:23.369> or<00:01:23.640> very<00:01:23.820> strong<00:01:24.030> forward<00:01:24.930> movement

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
shape or very strong forward movement

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.170 
shape or very strong forward movement
and<00:01:25.470> we<00:01:25.950> haven't<00:01:26.310> even<00:01:26.369> done<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.790> one<00:01:26.820> piece

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
and we haven't even done it in one piece

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.859 
and we haven't even done it in one piece
but<00:01:27.900> floating<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.500> head<00:01:28.710> very<00:01:29.580> sharp<00:01:30.000> like<00:01:30.689> an

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
but floating the head very sharp like an

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.109 
but floating the head very sharp like an
arrow<00:01:31.049> here<00:01:31.530> also<00:01:32.159> very<00:01:32.520> important

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
arrow here also very important

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.120 
arrow here also very important
proportions<00:01:33.720> here<00:01:34.080> we're<00:01:34.710> talking<00:01:35.040> about

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
proportions here we're talking about

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.190 
proportions here we're talking about
this<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.880> we're<00:01:36.390> really<00:01:36.630> making<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:37.049> point

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
this and we're really making a point

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.320 
this and we're really making a point
about<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.590> here<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.549> first<00:01:38.820> thing<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.180> that

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
about it here so the first thing is that

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.690 
about it here so the first thing is that
you<00:01:39.420> already<00:01:39.659> look<00:01:40.110> at<00:01:40.290> general<00:01:40.950> proportions

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
you already look at general proportions

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.550 
you already look at general proportions
it<00:01:41.850> looks<00:01:42.150> like<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:42.509> moving<00:01:42.720> compositions

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
it looks like it's moving compositions

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.030 
it looks like it's moving compositions
are<00:01:43.740> important<00:01:44.659> then<00:01:45.740> what's<00:01:46.740> very<00:01:46.979> very

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
are important then what's very very

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.190 
are important then what's very very
important<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.509> performance

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
important is that this is a performance

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.469 
important is that this is a performance
bike<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:49.710> got<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:50.100> be<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.790> fastest<00:01:51.329> out

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
bike it's got to be the fastest out

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.480 
bike it's got to be the fastest out
there<00:01:51.689> but<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:51.900> also<00:01:52.079> has<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.890> look<00:01:53.009> cool<00:01:53.250> so

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
can't kick up keep up that's not good

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.649 
can't kick up keep up that's not good
for<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.860> either<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.970> number<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.570> things

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
for you either so a number of things

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.319 
for you either so a number of things
were<00:02:03.990> new<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.649> us<00:02:04.799> ram<00:02:05.189> air<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.549> very<00:02:05.820> important

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
were new to us ram air is very important

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.660 
were new to us ram air is very important
and<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:07.079> presented<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.979> challenge<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.640> you

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
and that presented a challenge that you

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.729 
and that presented a challenge that you
have<00:02:08.880> a<00:02:08.910> big<00:02:09.179> hole<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.899> forehead<00:02:10.530> where

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
have a big hole in the forehead where

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.530 
have a big hole in the forehead where
all<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.070> has<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.310> go<00:02:11.519> in<00:02:11.700> we<00:02:11.850> used<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.299> theme

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
all this has to go in we used a theme

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.840 
all this has to go in we used a theme
that<00:02:12.690> BMW<00:02:12.959> has<00:02:13.320> been<00:02:13.440> developing<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.160> is

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
that BMW has been developing and that is

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.090 
that BMW has been developing and that is
the<00:02:15.150> left<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.600> right<00:02:15.720> halves<00:02:16.049> of<00:02:16.350> the

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
the left and right halves of the

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.260 
the left and right halves of the
motorcycle<00:02:17.820> clasp<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:19.320> mid<00:02:19.530> part

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
motorcycle clasp the mid part

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.750 
motorcycle clasp the mid part
the<00:02:20.540> core<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:20.960> the<00:02:21.110> motorcycle<00:02:21.740> and<00:02:21.890> they

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
the core of the motorcycle and they

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.220 
the core of the motorcycle and they
don't<00:02:22.940> need<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.120> be<00:02:23.270> painted<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:23.690> we've<00:02:23.960> used

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
don't need to be painted so we've used

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.290 
don't need to be painted so we've used
this<00:02:24.440> as<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.650> future<00:02:24.890> so<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.640> split<00:02:25.850> face<00:02:26.120> is

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
this as a future so the split face is

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.790 
this as a future so the split face is
actually<00:02:26.480> something<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:27.050> develop<00:02:27.440> from<00:02:27.650> our

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
actually something to develop from our

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.040 
actually something to develop from our
other<00:02:27.980> motorcycles<00:02:28.700> even<00:02:28.970> from<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.270> mid<00:02:29.630> 90s

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
other motorcycles even from the mid 90s

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.150 
other motorcycles even from the mid 90s
with<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.530> three<00:02:30.890> part<00:02:31.190> body<00:02:32.320> separation<00:02:33.320> the

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
with a three part body separation the

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160 
with a three part body separation the
body<00:02:34.370> sides<00:02:34.700> go<00:02:34.880> up<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.210> front<00:02:35.420> but<00:02:35.960> rather

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
body sides go up to the front but rather

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.020 
body sides go up to the front but rather
than<00:02:36.470> painting<00:02:36.920> it<00:02:37.100> and<00:02:37.160> closing<00:02:37.430> it<00:02:37.670> up<00:02:37.730> again

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
than painting it and closing it up again

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.690 
than painting it and closing it up again
in<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.180> front<00:02:38.450> we've<00:02:38.960> had<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.350> F<00:02:39.440> 800<00:02:39.920> s<00:02:40.070> st

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
in the front we've had the F 800 s st

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.200 
in the front we've had the F 800 s st
and<00:02:40.910> even<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.570> K<00:02:41.720> 1300<00:02:42.530> s<00:02:43.160> which<00:02:43.730> has<00:02:44.000> this

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
and even the K 1300 s which has this

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.240 
and even the K 1300 s which has this
break<00:02:44.480> in<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.720> middle<00:02:44.870> upward<00:02:45.620> offered<00:02:46.040> us<00:02:46.160> a

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
break in the middle upward offered us a

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.770 
break in the middle upward offered us a
great<00:02:46.430> opportunity<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:47.090> separate<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.540> front

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
great opportunity to separate the front

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.570 
great opportunity to separate the front
give<00:02:48.470> it<00:02:48.590> something<00:02:48.830> that<00:02:49.010> when<00:02:49.190> you<00:02:49.280> see<00:02:49.430> this

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
give it something that when you see this

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.450 
give it something that when you see this
coming<00:02:49.940> at<00:02:50.630> you<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:50.990> racetrack<00:02:51.470> very<00:02:52.010> strong

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
coming at you the racetrack very strong

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.820 
coming at you the racetrack very strong
almost<00:02:52.760> like<00:02:53.090> horns<00:02:53.570> almost<00:02:53.960> has<00:02:54.530> something

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
almost like horns almost has something

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.190 
almost like horns almost has something
very<00:02:55.070> aggressive<00:02:55.810> things<00:02:56.810> that<00:02:56.990> are<00:02:57.080> not

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
very aggressive things that are not

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.950 
very aggressive things that are not

atypical for BMW s symmetry when it

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.290 
atypical for BMW s symmetry when it
makes<00:03:00.110> sense<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:00.680> it<00:03:01.130> makes<00:03:01.310> sense<00:03:01.550> here<00:03:01.910> if

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
makes sense and it makes sense here if

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.550 
makes sense and it makes sense here if
you<00:03:02.420> look<00:03:02.570> at<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.750> right<00:03:02.930> side<00:03:03.200> of<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.380> bike

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
you look at the right side of the bike

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.830 
you look at the right side of the bike
you<00:03:03.980> have<00:03:04.130> a<00:03:04.310> lot<00:03:04.490> of<00:03:04.520> plastic<00:03:04.850> and<00:03:05.270> very<00:03:05.450> flat

you have a lot of plastic and very flat

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.170 
you have a lot of plastic and very flat
nose<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.440> a<00:03:07.100> small<00:03:07.400> round<00:03:07.700> headlight<00:03:08.150> that

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
nose and a small round headlight that

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.940 
nose and a small round headlight that
looks<00:03:08.510> like<00:03:08.600> it<00:03:08.750> came<00:03:08.900> off<00:03:08.960> in<00:03:09.110> endurance<00:03:09.500> bike

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
looks like it came off in endurance bike

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.820 
looks like it came off in endurance bike
the<00:03:10.160> 24-hour<00:03:10.850> endurance<00:03:11.540> races<00:03:12.290> so<00:03:12.470> that's<00:03:12.650> on

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
the 24-hour endurance races so that's on

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.830 
the 24-hour endurance races so that's on
the<00:03:12.920> right<00:03:13.100> side<00:03:13.370> that's<00:03:14.030> not<00:03:14.240> enough<00:03:14.600> light

to get this motorcycle homologated on

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.970 
to get this motorcycle homologated on
the<00:03:17.210> street<00:03:17.480> so<00:03:17.990> we've<00:03:18.140> got<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.530> necessary

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
the street so we've got the necessary

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.550

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
big light on the left we could have done

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.670 
big light on the left we could have done
both<00:03:22.010> like<00:03:22.670> big<00:03:23.030> like<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.600> left<00:03:23.780> side<00:03:23.990> offer

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
both like big like the left side offer

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.440 
both like big like the left side offer
symmetry<00:03:25.340> but<00:03:25.580> that<00:03:25.700> would<00:03:25.820> have<00:03:25.850> cost<00:03:26.060> us<00:03:26.240> six

on<00:03:34.569> only<00:03:34.719> one<00:03:34.959> side<00:03:34.989> lots<00:03:35.920> of<00:03:36.099> details<00:03:36.459> but

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
on only one side lots of details but

technical<00:03:43.870> reason<00:03:44.230> very<00:03:45.129> good<00:03:45.340> example<00:03:45.790> here

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
technical reason very good example here

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.559 
technical reason very good example here
is<00:03:46.180> on<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.359> left<00:03:46.599> side<00:03:46.810> we<00:03:47.409> have<00:03:47.439> the<00:03:48.120> fan<00:03:49.120> for

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569

the<00:03:49.629> radiator<00:03:50.049> and<00:03:50.260> that<00:03:50.650> takes<00:03:50.920> hot<00:03:51.280> air<00:03:51.459> out

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
of the left side and the right side we

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:54.959 
of the left side and the right side we
don't<00:03:53.920> need<00:03:54.099> that<00:03:54.310> hot<00:03:54.489> air<00:03:54.519> coming<00:03:54.819> out

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:54.969 
don't need that hot air coming out

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:56.369 
don't need that hot air coming out
because<00:03:55.209> it's<00:03:55.420> taken<00:03:55.719> care<00:03:55.870> of<00:03:55.930> with<00:03:56.079> the<00:03:56.170> left

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
because it's taken care of with the left

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.440 
because it's taken care of with the left
side<00:03:56.530> I<00:03:56.799> would<00:03:57.340> have<00:03:57.430> loved<00:03:57.700> as<00:03:57.849> a<00:03:58.000> designer<00:03:58.329> to

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
side I would have loved as a designer to

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.119 
side I would have loved as a designer to
close<00:03:58.810> off<00:03:59.049> the<00:03:59.200> right<00:03:59.349> side<00:03:59.379> completely

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
close off the right side completely

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:01.349 
close off the right side completely
because<00:04:00.370> then<00:04:00.519> that<00:04:00.670> would<00:04:00.760> really<00:04:01.060> make<00:04:01.209> the

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
because then that would really make the

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.750 
because then that would really make the
point<00:04:01.569> what<00:04:02.260> we<00:04:02.379> did<00:04:02.530> find<00:04:02.769> out<00:04:03.010> though<00:04:03.430> was

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
point what we did find out though was

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.520 
point what we did find out though was
that<00:04:03.790> if<00:04:04.209> you're<00:04:04.419> on<00:04:04.659> the<00:04:04.750> Autobahn<00:04:05.169> going

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
that if you're on the Autobahn going

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.960 
that if you're on the Autobahn going
very<00:04:05.709> hard<00:04:06.099> and<00:04:06.220> then<00:04:06.310> going<00:04:06.549> in<00:04:06.639> the<00:04:06.700> city

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
very hard and then going in the city

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.970 
very hard and then going in the city
after<00:04:07.180> that<00:04:07.510> you<00:04:08.079> will<00:04:08.319> get<00:04:08.530> a<00:04:08.560> little<00:04:08.709> bit<00:04:08.889> of

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
after that you will get a little bit of

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.099 
after that you will get a little bit of
a<00:04:09.120> you<00:04:10.120> know<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:10.299> hot<00:04:10.540> air<00:04:10.689> needs<00:04:10.840> to<00:04:10.900> get<00:04:11.049> out

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
a you know the hot air needs to get out

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:12.770 
a you know the hot air needs to get out
of<00:04:11.230> the<00:04:11.290> right<00:04:11.379> side<00:04:11.620> too<00:04:11.829> so<00:04:12.159> we<00:04:12.280> found<00:04:12.579> the

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
of the right side too so we found the

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.080 
of the right side too so we found the
minimal<00:04:13.780> amount<00:04:14.760> necessary<00:04:15.760> in<00:04:15.879> the<00:04:15.939> right

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
minimal amount necessary in the right

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.509 
minimal amount necessary in the right
got<00:04:16.419> very<00:04:16.780> cool<00:04:17.019> looking<00:04:17.349> shark<00:04:17.650> gills<00:04:17.889> and<00:04:18.430> on

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
got very cool looking shark gills and on

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.430 
got very cool looking shark gills and on
the<00:04:18.639> left<00:04:18.849> side<00:04:18.940> you<00:04:19.180> have<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.359> big<00:04:19.720> opening

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
the left side you have the big opening

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.350 
the left side you have the big opening
which<00:04:20.590> is<00:04:20.739> necessary<00:04:21.250> if<00:04:21.729> we<00:04:21.970> did<00:04:22.150> them

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
which is necessary if we did them

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.080 
which is necessary if we did them
symmetrical<00:04:23.199> for<00:04:23.500> that<00:04:23.830> its<00:04:24.160> own<00:04:24.340> sake<00:04:24.639> there

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
symmetrical for that its own sake there

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.490 
symmetrical for that its own sake there
would<00:04:25.180> be<00:04:25.210> a<00:04:25.330> disadvantage<00:04:25.690> in<00:04:26.139> this<00:04:26.289> side

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
would be a disadvantage in this side

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.310 
would be a disadvantage in this side
because<00:04:27.400> it's<00:04:27.820> got<00:04:28.360> lots<00:04:28.599> of<00:04:28.750> hot<00:04:28.900> air<00:04:28.930> coming

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
because it's got lots of hot air coming

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.140 
because it's got lots of hot air coming
out<00:04:29.500> and<00:04:29.650> causing<00:04:30.009> turbulence<00:04:30.190> and<00:04:30.610> on<00:04:31.030> the

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
out and causing turbulence and on the

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.700 
out and causing turbulence and on the
left<00:04:31.360> side<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:31.780> gills<00:04:31.990> would<00:04:32.169> not<00:04:32.289> be<00:04:32.440> enough

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
left side the gills would not be enough

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.399 
left side the gills would not be enough
everybody<00:04:33.669> that<00:04:33.849> we<00:04:34.000> look<00:04:34.240> at<00:04:34.419> has<00:04:34.630> a<00:04:34.990> left<00:04:35.260> and

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:35.409 
everybody that we look at has a left and

right side of the face and as kids we

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.839 
right side of the face and as kids we
took<00:04:38.050> the<00:04:38.199> pictures<00:04:39.039> and<00:04:39.280> then<00:04:39.400> flip<00:04:39.669> them

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
took the pictures and then flip them

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:41.790 
took the pictures and then flip them
over<00:04:39.970> and<00:04:40.120> mirror<00:04:40.419> them<00:04:40.630> we<00:04:41.080> all<00:04:41.260> look<00:04:41.530> very

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
over and mirror them we all look very

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.409 
over and mirror them we all look very
unusual<00:04:42.310> we<00:04:42.370> don't<00:04:42.610> look<00:04:42.820> like<00:04:43.000> what<00:04:43.270> we're

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
unusual we don't look like what we're

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.390 
unusual we don't look like what we're
used<00:04:43.449> to<00:04:43.810> because<00:04:44.560> the<00:04:44.680> left<00:04:44.889> and<00:04:45.070> right<00:04:45.190> side

of the brain are doing different things

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.070 
of the brain are doing different things
actually<00:04:48.820> some<00:04:49.030> of<00:04:49.060> the<00:04:49.210> top<00:04:49.419> models<00:04:49.840> are<00:04:49.960> not

worked out but they have something

worked out but they have something
unusual<00:04:54.699> about<00:04:54.789> a<00:04:54.970> twinkle<00:04:55.510> on<00:04:55.539> the<00:04:55.659> left<00:04:55.840> eye

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
unusual about a twinkle on the left eye

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.110 
unusual about a twinkle on the left eye
or<00:04:56.080> the<00:04:56.289> right<00:04:56.590> eye<00:04:56.620> droops<00:04:57.130> or<00:04:57.280> it<00:04:57.400> raises<00:04:57.940> or

the smile is not symmetrical but it's

the smile is not symmetrical but it's
got<00:05:00.190> a<00:05:00.220> little<00:05:00.310> bit<00:05:00.460> of<00:05:00.550> character<00:05:00.880> so<00:05:01.570> when

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
got a little bit of character so when

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:03.749 
got a little bit of character so when
there's<00:05:02.380> a<00:05:02.440> reason<00:05:02.860> for<00:05:02.889> it<00:05:03.130> and<00:05:03.250> people<00:05:03.430> it's

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
there's a reason for it and people it's

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:05.490 
there's a reason for it and people it's

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
the left and right half of the brain

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.920 
the left and right half of the brain
have<00:05:05.830> different<00:05:06.250> things<00:05:06.430> to<00:05:06.610> do<00:05:06.820> the<00:05:07.389> fun<00:05:07.659> side

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
have different things to do the fun side

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.420 
have different things to do the fun side
of<00:05:08.110> life<00:05:08.320> and<00:05:08.530> maybe<00:05:08.710> the<00:05:08.889> more<00:05:09.009> serious<00:05:09.250> side

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
of life and maybe the more serious side

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.260 
of life and maybe the more serious side
of<00:05:09.669> life<00:05:09.820> I<00:05:10.750> see<00:05:11.289> that<00:05:11.500> in<00:05:11.800> the<00:05:12.639> vehicles<00:05:13.150> as

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
of life I see that in the vehicles as

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.969 
of life I see that in the vehicles as
well<00:05:13.300> there's<00:05:13.690> a<00:05:13.750> function<00:05:14.289> there's<00:05:14.470> a<00:05:14.530> reason

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
well there's a function there's a reason

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.490 
well there's a function there's a reason
for<00:05:15.009> we<00:05:15.580> don't<00:05:15.759> do<00:05:15.849> it<00:05:15.940> just<00:05:16.120> to<00:05:16.210> be<00:05:16.360> cute<00:05:17.080> or<00:05:17.229> to

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
for we don't do it just to be cute or to

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.320 
for we don't do it just to be cute or to
have<00:05:17.770> something<00:05:18.099> to<00:05:18.159> talk<00:05:18.310> about<00:05:18.370> there<00:05:19.180> is<00:05:19.210> a

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
have something to talk about there is a

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.580 
have something to talk about there is a
reason<00:05:19.690> for<00:05:19.720> it<00:05:19.870> and<00:05:19.990> then<00:05:20.080> it<00:05:20.199> makes<00:05:20.349> sense

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
reason for it and then it makes sense

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.469 
reason for it and then it makes sense
and<00:05:20.830> there's<00:05:21.460> still<00:05:21.699> a<00:05:21.759> difference<00:05:21.940> between<00:05:22.449> a

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
and there's still a difference between a

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.570 
and there's still a difference between a
symmetry<00:05:23.050> and<00:05:23.229> lopsidedness<00:05:23.949> they<00:05:24.370> aren't

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
symmetry and lopsidedness they aren't

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.810 
symmetry and lopsidedness they aren't
lopsided<00:05:25.120> they're<00:05:25.419> symmetrical<00:05:26.490> the<00:05:27.490> idea

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
lopsided they're symmetrical the idea

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.279 
lopsided they're symmetrical the idea
that<00:05:27.940> this<00:05:28.090> is<00:05:28.270> Japanese<00:05:28.690> platform<00:05:29.169> is

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
that this is Japanese platform is

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.670 
that this is Japanese platform is
actually<00:05:30.240> misleading<00:05:31.240> the<00:05:32.199> whole<00:05:32.380> process

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
actually misleading the whole process

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.170 
actually misleading the whole process
from<00:05:33.070> the<00:05:33.220> very<00:05:33.250> beginning<00:05:33.789> was<00:05:33.909> what<00:05:34.150> I

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
from the very beginning was what I

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.510 
from the very beginning was what I
consider<00:05:34.630> very<00:05:34.720> typical<00:05:35.349> BMW<00:05:35.500> process<00:05:36.340> we

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
consider very typical BMW process we

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.310 
consider very typical BMW process we
didn't<00:05:36.820> say<00:05:36.969> this<00:05:37.510> is<00:05:37.690> what<00:05:37.840> the<00:05:37.960> others<00:05:38.200> are

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
didn't say this is what the others are

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.260 
didn't say this is what the others are
doing<00:05:38.440> we're<00:05:38.740> going<00:05:38.830> to<00:05:38.919> do<00:05:39.039> a<00:05:39.070> -<00:05:39.340> we<00:05:39.940> said<00:05:40.150> the

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
good how do we get there so for this

just<00:05:49.670> the<00:05:49.850> the<00:05:50.270> individual<00:05:50.930> solution<00:05:51.470> but<00:05:51.680> how

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
just the the individual solution but how

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.660 
just the the individual solution but how
it<00:05:52.520> fits<00:05:52.760> into<00:05:53.080> the<00:05:54.080> package<00:05:54.440> as<00:05:54.560> a<00:05:54.590> whole<00:05:54.830> when

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
it fits into the package as a whole when

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.070 
it fits into the package as a whole when
we<00:05:55.790> start<00:05:56.090> out<00:05:56.180> with<00:05:56.270> something<00:05:56.660> I<00:05:56.720> never<00:05:56.900> know

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
we start out with something I never know

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.600 
we start out with something I never know
exactly<00:05:57.200> what<00:05:57.650> it's<00:05:57.830> going<00:05:57.980> to<00:05:58.070> look<00:05:58.130> like<00:05:58.460> I

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
exactly what it's going to look like I

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.580 
exactly what it's going to look like I
know<00:05:58.700> what<00:05:58.820> we're<00:05:58.940> looking<00:05:59.240> for<00:05:59.540> and<00:05:59.930> as<00:06:00.440> we

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
know what we're looking for and as we

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.920 
know what we're looking for and as we
talked<00:06:00.830> about<00:06:01.100> as<00:06:01.250> symmetry<00:06:01.550> before<00:06:02.090> that's

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
talked about as symmetry before that's

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.330 
talked about as symmetry before that's
really<00:06:03.320> something<00:06:03.710> that<00:06:03.830> we're<00:06:04.100> talking

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.340 
really something that we're talking

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.340 
really something that we're talking
about<00:06:04.460> character<00:06:04.940> personality<00:06:05.660> so<00:06:06.110> you<00:06:06.170> can

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
about character personality so you can

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.620 
about character personality so you can
already<00:06:06.530> see<00:06:06.980> something<00:06:07.490> evolving<00:06:08.210> gear<00:06:08.450> or

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
already see something evolving gear or

already see something evolving gear or
something<00:06:08.690> showing<00:06:09.290> up<00:06:09.590> there's<00:06:10.010> a

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
something showing up there's a

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.310 
something showing up there's a
personality<00:06:10.820> in<00:06:10.970> this<00:06:11.120> bike<00:06:11.360> that<00:06:11.660> should<00:06:12.230> of

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 
personality in this bike that should of

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.960 
personality in this bike that should of
course<00:06:12.530> reflect<00:06:13.010> our<00:06:13.190> technology<00:06:13.820> or

come and look at the bike and it's like

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.420
