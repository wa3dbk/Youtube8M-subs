00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hello Abraham bear rank + by h 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.799
 plus this one is the same channel don't forget 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.570
 subscribe and like 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:14.130
 I think all that will be interesting to me, I will 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.650
 It will be interesting to shoot and so you do not 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.080
 forget to subscribe today 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.060
 let's talk right whether to warm up 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.100
 modern engines or not from where 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.960
 went this bike that modern 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.170
 engines do not need to warm up and went to 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.789
 straight from the instruction manual there 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.789
 it is written in Russian in white 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.649
 enough to start the engine and through 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.030
 fifteen seconds can start moving 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.540
 to the manufacturer deeply on the drum 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.160
 what 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.899
 how much will your engine go 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.430
 warranty period it departs and all a 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.350
 then either repair at your expense either 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.579
 buying a new car so just 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.230
 if you are going to exploit 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.710
 car 12 years old you can not even 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.640
 watch this video and immediately 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.770
 starts moving after 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.719
 start the engine well, and those who want 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.080
 sell a normal car either 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.530
 exploit it 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.049
 3-4 years is probably worth a look but 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.330
 Immediately tell you that the laws of physics 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.130
 not one manufacturer has not canceled what 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.830
 any metal will this gray or a 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.070
 simple cast iron high alloy steel 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.630
 or another metal when heated has 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.390
 property to expand when cooled 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.840
 narrow so now don't forget that 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.520
 grease thickens about loss and wear 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:36.240
 details and the lower the air temperature 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.150
 the larger the gap with the cylinder so when 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.979
 normal operating temperature 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.610
 form an operating temperature well environment 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.409
 water fairies mind 20 degrees celsius 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.540
 these gaps is about four 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.540
 hundredths and six hundredths of a millimeter while 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.750
 negative temperature -20 25-30 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.850
 degrees there are eight hundredths and up to 1 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.040
 10 millimeter 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.060
 you say micron and these 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.640
 crown and kill the engine so here about 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.300
 of the fact that these here are microns and we 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.730
 kill the engine plus all this u 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.569
 us while passing the dead points 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.870
 piston 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.340
 on the transfer piston beats on the transfer 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.189
 and 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.099
 yes you say that modern technology 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:25.469
 as if the finger is offset relative to the axis but 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.950
 no manufacturer has achieved 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:32.689
 good results of the fact that the piston 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.129
 stopped knocking he knocks nonetheless 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:39.299
 not to be unfounded each of you 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:42.359
 frost started the engine that is 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:46.519
 minus 25 degrees diet and heard such 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:48.900
 not natural sound not normal sound 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.840
 extraneous amounts just like that 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.569
 this is the result of the big 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.769
 gasoline enrichment two gasoline mixture 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:01.469
 that is, gasoline does not get into the cylinder 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:05.159
 the form of dust is such a form of droplets and 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:07.760
 washed off the walls of the oil 1 cm and mom 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:11.400
 grease oil that is thickened 2 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.290
 the piston hits the transfer 3 and this when 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.750
 just at startup and if you started 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.129
 movement then it is still 70 percent 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.939
 75 aggravated 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:22.769
 so here conclusions you warm 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:25.109
 engine and do not warm the engine but I tell you 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.449
 highly recommend and if will 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.769
 it is interesting for you to listen about 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:31.620
 automatic transmission pro 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:34.439
 turbine or just about any there 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.739
 mechanical knots car can 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:40.889
 leave comments i will take pictures 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:43.319
 leave video answers and and here's something 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:47.009
 all in this spirit we thank you all with 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:50.509
 you channel was bht well, plus bye put 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:50.509
 Like and do not forget to put likes
