the Jubilee torso and legs and his

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.280 
the Jubilee torso and legs and his
packaged<00:01:16.640> horribly<00:01:17.270> it's<00:01:17.750> not<00:01:18.049> a<00:01:18.080> great

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
packaged horribly it's not a great

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.990 
packaged horribly it's not a great
packaging<00:01:18.860> job<00:01:19.040> at<00:01:19.250> all<00:01:19.430> so<00:01:19.640> I<00:01:19.670> hope<00:01:19.820> they

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
change that but I do think storm is

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.800 
change that but I do think storm is

head<00:01:39.259> and<00:01:39.530> energy<00:01:39.979> effects<00:01:40.310> he<00:01:40.939> is<00:01:41.210> another

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
head and energy effects he is another

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.420 
head and energy effects he is another
one<00:01:41.780> that<00:01:41.810> could<00:01:42.170> end<00:01:42.350> up<00:01:42.500> great<00:01:42.890> he's<00:01:43.159> built

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
one that could end up great he's built

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.340 
one that could end up great he's built
on<00:01:43.610> Hyperion's<00:01:44.210> body<00:01:44.450> it<00:01:44.659> looks<00:01:44.869> like<00:01:45.020> so<00:01:45.200> I'm

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
on Hyperion's body it looks like so I'm

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.469 
on Hyperion's body it looks like so I'm
a<00:01:45.439> little<00:01:45.530> hesitant<00:01:45.740> about<00:01:46.189> that<00:01:46.579> but<00:01:47.090> I<00:01:47.119> think

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
a little hesitant about that but I think

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.090 
a little hesitant about that but I think
if<00:01:47.600> they<00:01:47.719> do<00:01:47.780> a<00:01:47.899> good<00:01:48.140> job<00:01:48.200> with<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.649> paint<00:01:48.890> and

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
if they do a good job with the paint and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.950 
if they do a good job with the paint and
if<00:01:49.579> they<00:01:49.700> make<00:01:49.880> sure<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.119> sculpt<00:01:50.479> is<00:01:50.570> nice<00:01:50.780> and

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
if they make sure the sculpt is nice and

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.510 
if they make sure the sculpt is nice and
crisp<00:01:51.259> I<00:01:51.530> think<00:01:52.070> it's<00:01:52.159> going<00:01:52.219> to<00:01:52.310> turn<00:01:52.460> out

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
crisp I think it's going to turn out

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.819 
crisp I think it's going to turn out
okay<00:01:53.060> it's<00:01:53.270> going<00:01:53.390> to<00:01:53.450> look<00:01:53.630> pretty<00:01:53.659> good<00:01:54.049> it's

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
okay it's going to look pretty good it's

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.530 
okay it's going to look pretty good it's
just<00:01:55.070> just<00:01:55.280> a<00:01:55.399> matter<00:01:55.640> of<00:01:55.729> if<00:01:55.909> they<00:01:56.060> can<00:01:56.240> really

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
just just a matter of if they can really

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.420 
just just a matter of if they can really
sell<00:01:57.079> it<00:01:57.259> and<00:01:57.409> hit<00:01:57.590> it<00:01:57.619> out<00:01:57.770> of<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:57.890> park<00:01:58.189> and

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
sell it and hit it out of the park and

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.459 
sell it and hit it out of the park and
make<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.759> solid<00:01:59.240> figure<00:01:59.540> with<00:01:59.689> this<00:01:59.869> guy<00:02:00.020> I'm

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
make a solid figure with this guy I'm

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:02.200 
make a solid figure with this guy I'm
really<00:02:00.740> hopeful<00:02:01.100> then<00:02:01.610> lastly<00:02:02.000> we<00:02:02.180> have

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
really hopeful then lastly we have

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.359 
really hopeful then lastly we have
another<00:02:02.719> Wolverine<00:02:03.380> which<00:02:03.649> i'm<00:02:03.860> really<00:02:03.890> not

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
another Wolverine which i'm really not

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:05.709 
another Wolverine which i'm really not
hopeful<00:02:04.820> for<00:02:04.969> because<00:02:05.270> we<00:02:05.390> don't<00:02:05.539> need

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
hopeful for because we don't need

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.480 
hopeful for because we don't need
anymore<00:02:05.960> i<00:02:06.350> don't<00:02:06.710> really<00:02:06.979> like<00:02:07.189> the<00:02:07.340> head

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
anymore i don't really like the head

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.670 
anymore i don't really like the head
sculpt<00:02:07.850> he<00:02:08.300> does<00:02:08.450> have<00:02:08.600> a<00:02:08.630> new<00:02:08.780> head<00:02:08.990> it<00:02:09.350> seems

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:09.680 
sculpt he does have a new head it seems

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.960 
sculpt he does have a new head it seems
like<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.920> belt<00:02:10.130> is<00:02:10.220> a<00:02:10.280> little<00:02:10.550> bit<00:02:10.640> different

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
like the belt is a little bit different

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.070 
like the belt is a little bit different
he's<00:02:11.060> got<00:02:11.210> a<00:02:11.240> little<00:02:11.420> bit<00:02:11.600> of<00:02:11.630> a<00:02:11.750> different

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
he's got a little bit of a different

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.960 
he's got a little bit of a different
paint<00:02:12.290> application<00:02:12.980> but<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.580> figure<00:02:13.850> is

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
paint application but the figure is

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.430 
paint application but the figure is
largely<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.510> same<00:02:14.690> one<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:14.960> we<00:02:15.110> got<00:02:15.290> at<00:02:15.410> the

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
largely the same one that we got at the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.780 
largely the same one that we got at the
Wolverine<00:02:15.980> wave

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
Wolverine wave

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.850 
Wolverine wave
not<00:02:17.120> too<00:02:17.360> excited<00:02:17.810> for<00:02:17.989> this<00:02:18.140> I<00:02:18.379> think<00:02:18.650> it's<00:02:18.769> a

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
not too excited for this I think it's a

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.190 
not too excited for this I think it's a
waste<00:02:19.099> of<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.519> figure<00:02:20.180> but<00:02:20.689> they<00:02:20.810> need<00:02:20.959> to<00:02:21.049> have

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
waste of a figure but they need to have

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.869 
waste of a figure but they need to have
an<00:02:21.319> anchor<00:02:21.500> character<00:02:22.099> so<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.370> guess<00:02:22.670> that's

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
an anchor character so I guess that's

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.390 
an anchor character so I guess that's
what<00:02:23.569> this<00:02:23.750> guy<00:02:23.959> is<00:02:23.989> doing<00:02:24.170> for<00:02:24.890> us<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.280> then

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
what this guy is doing for us and then

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.890 
what this guy is doing for us and then
we<00:02:25.519> have<00:02:25.640> Jubilee<00:02:26.030> that<00:02:26.209> we<00:02:26.299> saw<00:02:26.420> a<00:02:26.480> comic-con

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
we have Jubilee that we saw a comic-con

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.509 
we have Jubilee that we saw a comic-con
that's<00:02:27.650> what<00:02:27.829> the<00:02:27.920> Builder<00:02:28.129> finger<00:02:28.340> is<00:02:28.400> going

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
that's what the Builder finger is going

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.819 
that's what the Builder finger is going
to<00:02:28.579> look<00:02:28.730> like<00:02:28.760> for<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.120> most<00:02:29.180> part<00:02:29.540> is<00:02:30.530> it<00:02:30.709> the

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
to look like for the most part is it the

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.559 
to look like for the most part is it the
design<00:02:31.129> I<00:02:31.159> would<00:02:31.370> have<00:02:31.459> chosen<00:02:31.489> probably<00:02:32.450> not

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
design I would have chosen probably not

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.149 
design I would have chosen probably not
but<00:02:32.780> it's<00:02:32.930> still<00:02:33.170> going<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.530> be<00:02:33.590> Jubilee<00:02:34.099> so

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:34.159 
but it's still going to be Jubilee so

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.039 
but it's still going to be Jubilee so
I'm<00:02:34.280> kind<00:02:34.519> of<00:02:34.579> happy<00:02:34.760> about<00:02:34.939> that<00:02:35.390> thanks<00:02:35.930> for
