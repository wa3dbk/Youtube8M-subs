all the way up or crank it all the way
down<00:02:04.720> it<00:02:05.440> also<00:02:05.590> has<00:02:05.860> a<00:02:05.890> battery<00:02:06.250> indicator<00:02:06.580> so

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
down it also has a battery indicator so

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.410 
down it also has a battery indicator so
it<00:02:07.630> goes<00:02:07.780> through<00:02:07.960> P<00:02:08.229> 0<00:02:08.649> through<00:02:08.979> P

it goes through P 0 through P
and<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.410> will<00:02:10.530> also<00:02:10.710> let<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.039> know<00:02:11.160> what
