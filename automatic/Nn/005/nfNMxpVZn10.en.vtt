00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.150

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.020
 to our browser to download it 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.850
 Well now I do not know why this mom comes out 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.339
 say before, nothing came out, you just gave it to him 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.140
 in download xdddd but good or fart ya 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:52.000
 that we are going to put what he says but not 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.739
 understand each other and mothers we will try 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.739
 haha to see if I do not 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.420
 well since I already know they only give in 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.770
 download and ready you will be 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.770
 downloading does not weigh anything 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.480
 now if you leave us a rar file just 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.480
 you right click and extract here 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.390
 here as you will see I left some images 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.510
 so they can see how is the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.640
 good parking to install it is 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.680
 very simple since I put the files in 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.890
 the corresponding folders and it will be very 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.890
 easy 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.140
 well now we just copy the folder 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.110
 called data and kernel and we're going to look for the 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.270
 location of our game in my case 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.150
 this is my location you look for the 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.550
 yours to another thing you need to have 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.320
 installed kernel 3 or 4 so that they 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.320
 logically work the playoffs 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.650
 since we find the location of the 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.830
 root folder of the game in a space in 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.630
 white we right click and paste not 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.370
 it will come out that if we want to replace it 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.620
 we give everything that if it would be 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.120
 installed parking that easy 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.120
 true xd xd of d 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.390
 good friends that would be all apologize 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.520
 for not making a video of the game the fart 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.410
 is that my pc is already fucked up but 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.240

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.670
