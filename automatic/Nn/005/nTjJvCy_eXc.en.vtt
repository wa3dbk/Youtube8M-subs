00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 this power well for you nothing better than 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.240
 we make a video like planting or if 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.150
 drawn 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.550
 this is the survey if it is very simple 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.670
 with our planting takes a sticking muddle 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.220
 the musician who is a ball that people 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.970
 copper floriculture pull a little 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.600
 forward and pin the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.410
 after planted picks up a player 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.890
 a way if you 're around and wet 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.740
 good 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.250
 the plant does this for a week 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.770
 two weeks until he gave a good line and 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.690
 after the time we charge 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.110
 enjoy it here and plant more 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.110
 human 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:50.850
 the same procedure 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:53.660
 Take her and pull the screen for sale. 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:01:01.020
 I arrived with flowers appear more beautiful 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:05.659
 with more affection puts one more highlight 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.700
 together for the deaf to hold the unit and 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.460
 Wet her but everyone in here. 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.200
 preferably always with one way is 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.200
 more equals faster 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.300
 Here we are going to make another franchise. 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.410
 This one here I took a song from a 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.160
 branch 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:33.770
 There we put it, it shows 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:39.860
 You can take the thread there by the back. 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:44.540
 living very strong leaving her always 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:56.070
 more luchini gives a knot 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:57.390
 it and then put it together here we 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:03.270
 do her 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:06.060
 Come on, a guy, a walk for her. 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:14.370
 pick up string left 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:18.420
 put it in there and here it 's all right 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.880
 our little plant is so it must be 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.459
 you can also put one more 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.360
 string and if you want the wind asks you 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:31.410
 can hold a little bit more but never 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.850
 forgetting to wet her for some 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.080
 two three weeks 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:40.709
 that's how I plant blue on trees 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:46.799
 you can see over there all that 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:49.829
 is the tree in a dry trunk that does not 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:53.910
 there is no life just there 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:57.810
 I planted orchids last year and 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.600
 they gave me an air of grace this year. 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.360
 Giving me beautiful flowers does not have to be 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.239
 always a tree that has life that 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.030
 still in activities can be a 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:12.840
 little as can be a wood can be 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:17.640
 anything you love well 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.360
 it grows and develops and in this 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.260
 on here 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:25.150
 This is another variety but she is well 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.760
 also to be able to plant within the 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.750
 I wish you were inside the mani 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.410
 marley 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:37.780
 just not much in the shade they like the most 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:42.820
 from the morning sun and here and here 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.730
 show in the morning but your fact is that 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.500
 that I wanted to show you 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:53.380
 answering many questions that 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:56.920
 They came by our our group I 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.990
 I promised I was there and 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.950
 I hope you understood and any doubt 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.520
 we are still to be able to respond to 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.600
