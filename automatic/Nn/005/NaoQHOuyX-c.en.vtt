for long distances and high speeds or
even<00:01:06.330> over<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> bridge<00:01:06.840> you'll<00:01:07.710> want<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.100> put<00:01:08.340> a

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
even over a bridge you'll want to put a

even over a bridge you'll want to put a
bow<00:01:08.880> line<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.450> here<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.930> bow<00:01:10.260> line<00:01:10.620> helps

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
bow line on here a bow line helps

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.359 
bow line on here a bow line helps
counteract<00:01:11.550> the<00:01:12.120> lift<00:01:12.900> that's<00:01:13.740> generated

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
counteract the lift that's generated

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.969 
counteract the lift that's generated
when<00:01:14.490> you're<00:01:14.610> driving<00:01:14.970> at<00:01:15.060> high<00:01:15.240> speeds<00:01:18.979> I've

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
when you're driving at high speeds I've

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.810 
when you're driving at high speeds I've
attached<00:01:20.369> my<00:01:20.520> bow<00:01:20.760> line<00:01:21.060> underneath<00:01:21.450> a

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
attached my bow line underneath a

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.690 
attached my bow line underneath a
utility<00:01:23.820> hook<00:01:24.030> underneath<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.660> truck<00:01:25.140> and

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
utility hook underneath this truck and

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.770 
utility hook underneath this truck and
then<00:01:26.700> I'm<00:01:26.910> going<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.090> attach<00:01:27.690> it<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:30.570> BAL

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
then I'm going to attach it to the BAL

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:40.900 
then I'm going to attach it to the BAL
toggle<00:01:31.490> up<00:01:32.490> here<00:01:36.140> like<00:01:37.140> so

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.960 

then<00:01:41.910> I<00:01:42.240> do<00:01:42.360> what<00:01:42.870> we<00:01:42.960> call<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> trucker's<00:01:43.680> hitch

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
then I do what we call a trucker's hitch

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.700 
then I do what we call a trucker's hitch
so<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.120> loop<00:01:45.300> a<00:01:46.490> couple<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.550> twists<00:01:48.710> grab

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
so it's a loop a couple of twists grab

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.930 
so it's a loop a couple of twists grab
this<00:01:49.890> in<00:01:50.160> and<00:01:50.790> pull<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.890> take<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.190> loose<00:01:53.730> in

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
this in and pull I take this loose in

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.360 
this in and pull I take this loose in
here<00:01:54.440> and<00:01:55.440> put<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.680> through<00:01:55.770> here<00:01:58.100> now<00:01:59.100> what

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
here and put it through here now what

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.950 
here and put it through here now what
you<00:01:59.490> want<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.090> don't<00:02:00.120> want<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.480> tight<00:02:00.720> line

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
you want is you don't want a tight line

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.380 
you want is you don't want a tight line
here<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:01.620> fairly<00:02:01.920> loose<00:02:02.250> all<00:02:02.790> it's<00:02:03.060> doing<00:02:03.210> is

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
here it's fairly loose all it's doing is

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.820 
here it's fairly loose all it's doing is
just<00:02:03.450> keeping<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.080> boat<00:02:04.260> from<00:02:04.440> being<00:02:04.500> lifted

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
just keeping the boat from being lifted

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.350 
just keeping the boat from being lifted
up<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:06.380> just<00:02:07.380> give<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.650> pinch<00:02:08.090> and<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.149> just

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
up so just give it a pinch and you just

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.949 
up so just give it a pinch and you just
do<00:02:09.509> some<00:02:09.690> half<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.050> just<00:02:10.290> through<00:02:10.470> here<00:02:11.959> see

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
do some half it just through here see

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:19.280 
do some half it just through here see
that<00:02:14.870> this<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:16.050> series<00:02:16.380> of<00:02:16.560> them<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.230> don't

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
that this is series of them and I don't

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.480 
that this is series of them and I don't
want<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.530> do<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.650> million<00:02:20.070> of<00:02:20.190> them<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:20.459> just

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
want to do a million of them so I just

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.910 
want to do a million of them so I just
talk<00:02:20.820> down<00:02:21.000> here<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:22.320> do<00:02:22.440> one<00:02:22.620> here<00:02:22.740> on<00:02:22.890> the
