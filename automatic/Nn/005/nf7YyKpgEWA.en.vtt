00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello, I'm simon fire muscle 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.000
 make today it's about the grandma 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.799
 protein bar around this sheet has here 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.580
 that is a very tasty one 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.679
 watch protein bars first 25 grams 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.780
 protein per bar 0 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.400
 trans fatty acids indescribable 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.140
 taste and this indescribable 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.460
 you can taste in any case 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.270
 taste when you look at the bar 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.970
 just treat yourself 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.740
 That's definitely protein 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.720
 bar one of my favorites 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.130
 this is an extremely high quality bar 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.410
 the definitely haider right inside 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.600
 So, depending on your concern, here's ballack 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.030
 ran there are such crunches in there then 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.040
 Peanuts and his smarties just had to 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.780
 others provide, for example 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.530
 financepartner daily that kind of a yes 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.899
 cream from first employee one of the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.430
 Best latch on any case or top in 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.469
 time and so that a real man 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.700
 the later that is a deadlock on 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.219
 every event offers a taste experience 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.750
 There he was very little net carbohydrate 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.129
 if we have the subject net 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.899
 Carbohydrates are also necessary 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.000
 the whole carbohydrates honestly 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.840
 and fairer we would carry the 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.870
 cards look 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.250
 then we see already eating 36 grams 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.140
 contain carbohydrates 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.640
 Of course, these are very low blood sugar 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.840
 Relevant carbohydrates eats and eight 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.390
 contain grams of sugar 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.710
 that's not it - I'm a little but 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.210
 by no means comparable 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.790
 with a typical chocolate bar 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.110
 overall it is therefore of little rules 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.210
 faster carbohydrates did 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.580
 Total based on carbohydrates 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.380
 So on the not even relevant 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.570
 Carbohydrates did not even get that way 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.740
 Yes, that's extremely low carb 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.060
 also a very important point for 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.250
 the whole contents the quantity one can 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.240
 look at yourself naturally 360 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.100
 kilo calorie 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.470
 Of course, the rule does not offer 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.030
 only 85 grams of taste experience 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.460
 really much but more open 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.600
 total energy quantity so much you have to 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.369
 just think 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.710
 that's why the rule is for the hardware 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.600
 for those who just good a lot 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.670
 can eat without getting fat immediately 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.680
 be or super thing those the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.630
 just pay attention to your slim line 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.460
 just have those somewhere 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.290
 so far maybe problems with synonymous 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.729
 their fans should have that 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.310
 Of course, be aware that the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.140
 But it is extremely tasty 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.470
 calorie-containing that is from the 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.270
 calories are there 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.920
 calories with which tanja body deal 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.170
 but the body can work with them 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.760
 are and still are calories and 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.510
 that should not be here in any case 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.790
 underestimate 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.170
 my personal conclusion when i talk about it 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.650
 talk really openly that I as a 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.880
 Saliva gets it is an extreme 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.470
 Tasty rule not noticed 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.550
 for reasons of good taste 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.960
 can recommend any case 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.180
 nonetheless I have it right now 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.770
 said that all little calories in 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.180
 the water phase also for those who 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.960
 the difficulties are great 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.850
 build 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.890
 a very good thing for those who 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.390
 define volt and already that 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.920
 have a problem here and here 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.240
 perhaps a bit too much is the 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.890
 should definitely be in the picture 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.200
 be clear that is a thing that is 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.570
 in the rarest cases you are completely 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.209
 aware can can then as enjoyable so 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.250
 so to speak, especially we consider us see 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.200
