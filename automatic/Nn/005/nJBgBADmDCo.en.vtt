00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
see what we're doing is we're lining up

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.680 
see what we're doing is we're lining up
the<00:00:12.450> image<00:00:12.690> with<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:12.929> edge<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.559> frame<00:00:13.799> and

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
the image with the edge of the frame and

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.300 
the image with the edge of the frame and
there<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:16.109> can<00:00:16.230> either<00:00:16.470> have<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.770> gallery<00:00:16.980> wrap

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
there you can either have a gallery wrap

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.640 
there you can either have a gallery wrap
where<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.640> image<00:00:17.820> goes<00:00:17.970> all<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.150> way<00:00:18.240> around

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
where the image goes all the way around

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.560 
where the image goes all the way around
the<00:00:19.650> frame<00:00:19.890> in<00:00:20.130> which<00:00:20.369> case<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.240> doesn't<00:00:21.420> need

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
the frame in which case it doesn't need

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.660 
the frame in which case it doesn't need
to<00:00:21.630> be<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:21.869> exacting<00:00:22.320> or<00:00:22.500> non<00:00:23.039> gallery<00:00:23.430> wrap

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
to be so exacting or non gallery wrap

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.279 
to be so exacting or non gallery wrap
where<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.150> image<00:00:24.390> really<00:00:24.600> needs<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.930> be<00:00:25.019> lined

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
where the image really needs to be lined

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.439 
where the image really needs to be lined
up<00:00:25.439> edge<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.800> edge<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:25.920> corner<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.519> corner<00:00:26.699> and

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
up edge to edge and corner to corner and

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.800 
up edge to edge and corner to corner and
this<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.590> non<00:00:28.800> gallery<00:00:29.220> wrap<00:00:29.599> so<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.689> can

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
this is a non gallery wrap so you can

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.939 
this is a non gallery wrap so you can
see<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.050> first<00:00:31.199> thing<00:00:31.349> we<00:00:31.470> do<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.650> we<00:00:31.740> line<00:00:31.920> up

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
see the first thing we do is we line up

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.490 
see the first thing we do is we line up
the<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.850> corners<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.420> canvas<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.989> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
the the corners of the canvas and the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.560 
the the corners of the canvas and the
edges<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.010> then<00:00:35.219> we<00:00:35.250> start<00:00:35.880> Center<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.360> Center

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
edges and then we start Center to Center

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.560 
edges and then we start Center to Center
in<00:00:36.690> one<00:00:36.840> direction<00:00:36.989> pull<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.559> taut<00:00:38.450> using<00:00:39.450> our

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
in one direction pull it taut using our

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.650 
in one direction pull it taut using our
canvas<00:00:40.140> pliers<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.010> our<00:00:41.219> stapler<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
canvas pliers and our stapler and the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.560 
canvas pliers and our stapler and the
other<00:00:42.780> direction<00:00:43.110> we<00:00:44.070> go<00:00:44.489> Center<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.270> Center

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
other direction we go Center to Center

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.910 
other direction we go Center to Center
again<00:00:46.190> and<00:00:47.870> then<00:00:48.870> we're<00:00:49.110> going<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.500> work<00:00:49.739> on

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
again and then we're going to work on

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.340 
again and then we're going to work on
way<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.489> corners<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.899> can<00:00:52.110> see<00:00:52.230> I'm

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
way to the corners so you can see I'm

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.479 
way to the corners so you can see I'm
checking<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.710> edge<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.010> canvas<00:00:53.190> I'm

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
checking the edge of the canvas I'm

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.920 
checking the edge of the canvas I'm
checking<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.789> corners<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.270> make<00:00:54.420> sure<00:00:54.600> I've

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
checking the corners to make sure I've

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.630 
checking the corners to make sure I've
got<00:00:55.289> everything<00:00:55.500> aligned<00:00:55.860> before<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.370> start

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
got everything aligned before I start

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.029 
got everything aligned before I start
committing<00:00:57.030> myself<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.390> working<00:00:58.010> my<00:00:59.010> way

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
committing myself to working my way

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.100 
committing myself to working my way
around<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.699> canvas<00:01:01.070> we're<00:01:02.070> going<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.989> once<00:01:03.989> we

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
around the canvas we're going to once we

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.359 
around the canvas we're going to once we
start<00:01:04.320> stretching<00:01:04.680> we're<00:01:04.860> going<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.220> move

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
start stretching we're going to move

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.460 
start stretching we're going to move
either<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.600> clockwise<00:01:06.960> or

either in a clockwise or
counterclockwise<00:01:07.950> direction<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:09.119> doesn't

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
counterclockwise direction it doesn't

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.660 
counterclockwise direction it doesn't
matter<00:01:09.570> which<00:01:09.780> but<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:11.010> do<00:01:11.159> want<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.400> do<00:01:11.520> that

matter which but you do want to do that
as<00:01:11.820> opposed<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.180> working<00:01:12.540> one<00:01:13.020> side<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
as opposed to working one side of the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.200 
as opposed to working one side of the
canvas<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.860> then<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.100> other<00:01:14.220> you'll<00:01:15.060> get<00:01:15.180> a

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
canvas and then the other you'll get a

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.749 
canvas and then the other you'll get a
more<00:01:15.360> even<00:01:15.630> stretch<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:17.070> you'll<00:01:17.310> find<00:01:17.580> when

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
more even stretch and you'll find when

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.429 
more even stretch and you'll find when
you're<00:01:17.880> finished<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.390> don't<00:01:18.720> have<00:01:18.960> a

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
you're finished that you don't have a

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.149 
you're finished that you don't have a
lopsided<00:01:20.159> canvas<00:01:20.790> as<00:01:21.619> we<00:01:22.619> start<00:01:22.830> working<00:01:23.040> two

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
lopsided canvas as we start working two

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.070 
lopsided canvas as we start working two
way<00:01:23.250> around<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.880> stretching<00:01:24.600> with<00:01:24.900> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
way around and stretching with the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.249 
way around and stretching with the
canvas<00:01:25.650> pliers<00:01:26.450> you<00:01:27.450> can<00:01:27.600> see<00:01:27.750> what<00:01:27.869> I'm<00:01:27.960> doing

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
canvas pliers you can see what I'm doing

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.590 
canvas pliers you can see what I'm doing
is<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.530> will<00:01:28.590> take<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.159> I'll<00:01:29.250> pull<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.270> canvas

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
is I will take and I'll pull the canvas

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.870 
is I will take and I'll pull the canvas
in<00:01:30.720> one<00:01:30.869> direction<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.439> then<00:01:32.430> I'll<00:01:32.579> pull<00:01:32.820> it

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
in one direction and then I'll pull it

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.910 
in one direction and then I'll pull it
in<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.030> other<00:01:33.270> direction<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.530> I'll<00:01:34.680> hold<00:01:34.829> it

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
in the other direction and I'll hold it

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.980 
in the other direction and I'll hold it
down<00:01:34.979> with<00:01:35.220> my<00:01:35.340> thumb<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:36.329> what<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.630> does<00:01:36.750> is

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
down with my thumb and what that does is

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.230 
down with my thumb and what that does is
it<00:01:37.170> pulls<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.710> canvas<00:01:38.070> taut<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.670> you're

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
it pulls the canvas taut and you're

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.080 
it pulls the canvas taut and you're
you're<00:01:40.100> pulling<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.189> Bulge<00:01:41.460> out<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:42.000> that

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
you're pulling the Bulge out of that

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.929 
you're pulling the Bulge out of that
corner<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.869> canvas<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:44.369> basically<00:01:44.700> any

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939

I'm<00:02:30.130> sure<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.520> would<00:02:30.640> be<00:02:30.730> nice<00:02:30.880> we<00:02:31.540> don't

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
I'm sure that would be nice we don't

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.060 
I'm sure that would be nice we don't
really<00:02:31.870> use<00:02:31.959> them<00:02:32.260> we<00:02:32.410> stretched<00:02:32.709> a<00:02:32.860> few

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
really use them we stretched a few

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.850 
really use them we stretched a few
canvases<00:02:33.520> a<00:02:33.550> day<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:34.500> we<00:02:35.500> haven't<00:02:35.770> really

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
canvases a day and we haven't really

are<00:02:38.110> also<00:02:38.290> canvas<00:02:38.950> stretching<00:02:39.430> machines<00:02:41.040> but

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
are also canvas stretching machines but

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.370 
are also canvas stretching machines but
we<00:02:42.190> we<00:02:43.090> get<00:02:43.239> good<00:02:43.390> results<00:02:43.720> attrition<00:02:44.020> by<00:02:44.140> hand

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
we we get good results attrition by hand

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.570 
we we get good results attrition by hand
and<00:02:44.530> we<00:02:44.620> can<00:02:44.650> actually<00:02:45.040> stretch<00:02:45.280> a<00:02:45.310> canvas

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
and we can actually stretch a canvas

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.570 
and we can actually stretch a canvas
like<00:02:45.940> this<00:02:46.150> in<00:02:46.390> in<00:02:46.720> really<00:02:47.350> a<00:02:47.500> matter<00:02:47.680> of<00:02:47.830> 10<00:02:48.459> or

like this in in really a matter of 10 or

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.240 
like this in in really a matter of 10 or
15<00:02:48.880> minutes<00:02:49.680> she's<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:50.800> a<00:02:50.830> good<00:02:51.010> break

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
15 minutes she's you a good break

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.890 
15 minutes she's you a good break

I staple and then I'll pull taut as I

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.170 
I staple and then I'll pull taut as I
move<00:03:03.130> my<00:03:03.340> way<00:03:03.519> back<00:03:03.790> in<00:03:04.030> there<00:03:04.269> and<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:06.180> staple

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
almost the corner there and once we get

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.650 
almost the corner there and once we get
to<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.720> corners<00:03:32.019> we're<00:03:32.170> going<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:32.350> start

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
to the corners we're going to start

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.750 
to the corners we're going to start
cutting<00:03:34.660> and<00:03:35.280> preparing<00:03:36.280> those<00:03:36.370> corners

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
cutting and preparing those corners

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.840 
cutting and preparing those corners
there<00:03:37.660> we<00:03:38.049> go<00:03:38.160> so<00:03:39.160> what<00:03:39.340> we<00:03:39.430> do<00:03:39.549> here<00:03:39.760> is<00:03:39.820> we

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
there we go so what we do here is we

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.020 
there we go so what we do here is we
fold<00:03:40.180> this<00:03:40.299> just<00:03:40.570> like<00:03:40.690> a<00:03:41.700> Christmas<00:03:42.700> package

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
fold this just like a Christmas package

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.120 
fold this just like a Christmas package
you<00:03:43.360> get<00:03:43.480> that<00:03:43.630> nice<00:03:43.930> little<00:03:44.350> crease<00:03:44.829> there

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
you get that nice little crease there

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.800 
you get that nice little crease there
and<00:03:45.310> what<00:03:45.820> we<00:03:45.910> want<00:03:46.120> is<00:03:46.180> that<00:03:46.239> crease<00:03:46.600> that

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
and what we want is that crease that

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.569 
and what we want is that crease that
crease<00:03:47.019> gives<00:03:47.260> us<00:03:47.380> a<00:03:47.470> guideline<00:03:47.650> because<00:03:48.340> now

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
crease gives us a guideline because now

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:49.740 
crease gives us a guideline because now
what<00:03:48.760> we're<00:03:48.910> going<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.120> do<00:03:49.269> is<00:03:49.360> we're<00:03:49.510> going<00:03:49.540> to

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.630 
what we're going to do is we're going to
take<00:03:49.900> an<00:03:49.989> exacto<00:03:50.440> knife<00:03:50.590> here<00:03:50.829> as<00:03:50.950> you<00:03:51.070> see<00:03:51.250> and

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
take an exacto knife here as you see and

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.310 
take an exacto knife here as you see and
we're<00:03:51.820> going<00:03:51.940> to<00:03:52.000> cut<00:03:52.269> out<00:03:52.390> that<00:03:52.630> corner<00:03:53.140> that

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
we're going to cut out that corner that

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.420 
we're going to cut out that corner that
corner<00:03:54.220> makes<00:03:55.090> for<00:03:55.299> a<00:03:55.329> bulge<00:03:55.690> and<00:03:56.250> this<00:03:57.250> is<00:03:57.400> a

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
corner makes for a bulge and this is a

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.210 
corner makes for a bulge and this is a
standard<00:03:57.880> 3/4<00:03:58.570> inch<00:03:58.690> canvas<00:03:59.170> if<00:03:59.950> you<00:04:00.070> have<00:04:00.190> a

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
standard 3/4 inch canvas if you have a

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.039 
standard 3/4 inch canvas if you have a
one<00:04:00.489> and<00:04:00.610> a<00:04:00.670> half<00:04:00.700> inch<00:04:00.970> frame<00:04:01.480> which<00:04:01.780> is<00:04:01.959> the

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
one and a half inch frame which is the

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.190 
one and a half inch frame which is the
medium<00:04:02.320> gallery<00:04:02.709> wrap<00:04:02.950> or<00:04:03.519> medium<00:04:03.820> wraps<00:04:04.200> that

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
medium gallery wrap or medium wraps that

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.780 
medium gallery wrap or medium wraps that
bulge<00:04:05.470> really<00:04:05.799> shows<00:04:05.980> up<00:04:06.190> so<00:04:06.370> it's<00:04:06.489> nice<00:04:06.610> to

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
bulge really shows up so it's nice to

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.610 
bulge really shows up so it's nice to
cut<00:04:06.970> that<00:04:07.090> out<00:04:07.150> of<00:04:07.299> there<00:04:07.450> we<00:04:08.140> do<00:04:08.230> that<00:04:08.380> fold

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
cut that out of there we do that fold

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.289 
cut that out of there we do that fold
and<00:04:08.829> then<00:04:08.920> we<00:04:09.010> fold<00:04:09.190> it<00:04:09.340> once<00:04:09.489> again<00:04:09.730> at<00:04:09.850> a<00:04:09.910> 45

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
and then we fold it once again at a 45

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.710 
and then we fold it once again at a 45
degree<00:04:10.329> angle<00:04:10.570> there<00:04:11.280> so<00:04:12.280> that<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.329> fold<00:04:13.540> is

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
degree angle there so that the fold is

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.529 
degree angle there so that the fold is
invisible<00:04:14.190> once<00:04:15.190> the<00:04:15.579> piece<00:04:16.000> is<00:04:16.150> hanging<00:04:16.450> on

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
invisible once the piece is hanging on

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.390 
invisible once the piece is hanging on
the<00:04:16.630> wall<00:04:16.810> if<00:04:16.959> another<00:04:17.200> ends<00:04:17.829> up<00:04:17.919> hanging<00:04:18.130> with

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
the wall if another ends up hanging with

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.080 
the wall if another ends up hanging with
that<00:04:18.519> frame<00:04:19.169> we<00:04:20.169> do<00:04:20.289> that<00:04:20.440> final<00:04:20.769> staple<00:04:21.099> there

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
that frame we do that final staple there

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.360 
that frame we do that final staple there
and<00:04:22.180> then<00:04:23.139> we're<00:04:23.560> going<00:04:23.800> to<00:04:23.889> check<00:04:24.100> and<00:04:24.340> make

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
and then we're going to check and make

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.830 
and then we're going to check and make
sure<00:04:24.520> the<00:04:24.610> canvas<00:04:24.910> is<00:04:25.030> taut<00:04:25.270> like<00:04:25.510> a<00:04:25.540> drum

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
sure the canvas is taut like a drum

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.930 
sure the canvas is taut like a drum
there<00:04:26.200> it<00:04:26.290> is<00:04:26.410> nice<00:04:26.770> and<00:04:26.800> drummy<00:04:27.460> bump<00:04:27.850> bump

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
there it is nice and drummy bump bump

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.290 
there it is nice and drummy bump bump
and<00:04:28.800> one<00:04:29.800> final<00:04:30.250> check<00:04:30.460> around<00:04:30.730> the<00:04:30.850> edge<00:04:31.000> and

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
and one final check around the edge and

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.060 
and one final check around the edge and
in<00:04:31.900> corners<00:04:32.200> to<00:04:32.350> make<00:04:32.500> sure<00:04:32.650> we've<00:04:32.800> gotten

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
in corners to make sure we've gotten

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.790 
in corners to make sure we've gotten
everything<00:04:33.370> perfectly
