00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:11.396
 Wait! 

00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:17.506
 The next game of the night is ParedÃ£o. 

00:00:17.506 --> 00:00:21.210
 I'm going to read some challenges that are in this box here 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.830
 and the actors will come up here with their ideas. 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.040

00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:37.767
 Hello? 

00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:40.291
 Is it from the impotence dial? 

00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:42.456
 Yeah ... I blew up again. 

00:00:47.512 --> 00:00:48.456
 Hi good afternoon. 

00:00:48.456 --> 00:00:50.607
 Do you have there the 0800 list? 

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:58.125
 Hello, Pedro? It's the friendship dial. 

00:00:58.125 --> 00:01:00.391
 I'm already at the club! 

00:01:04.553 --> 00:01:07.770
 Places you would not take Obama. 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.935
 Hello, Obama? I'm already at the club! 

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:25.206
 Obama ... 

00:01:25.206 --> 00:01:25.850
 Yes. 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:26.855
 Osama! 

00:01:36.023 --> 00:01:36.785
 Obama ... 

00:01:36.785 --> 00:01:37.360

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.695
 Ibama! 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.373
 I sign it. 

00:01:57.904 --> 00:02:02.107
 Inappropriate ways to get away from a boring person. 

00:02:11.353 --> 00:02:12.856
 Would someone run away like this ?! 

00:02:21.197 --> 00:02:22.120
 So is... 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.200
 What is that there, man? 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.592
 Oops. You see, it's a building ... 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.036
 Aaahhhh !!! 

00:02:36.807 --> 00:02:38.000
 Enio! 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.468
 Oh, boy! 

00:02:39.468 --> 00:02:41.084
 Yeah ... I have to fix the computer. 

00:02:41.084 --> 00:02:41.550
 Hi? 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.785
 My computer ... it's up there. 

00:02:42.785 --> 00:02:44.067
 Let's take! 

00:02:44.067 --> 00:02:45.225
 I have to go! Not! 

00:02:45.225 --> 00:02:46.625
 Get out! 

00:02:50.163 --> 00:02:51.391
 Enio! 

00:02:51.391 --> 00:02:52.957
 "Haryuken"!
