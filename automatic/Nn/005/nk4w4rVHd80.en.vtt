00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.519
 a woman's vehicle had 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.420
 involved in an accident and he gave a 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.550
 very strange explanation for this fact 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.039
 is to follow the details here comes with 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.820
 people to the band on the report screen 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.970
 screen 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.250
 luiz eduardo schefer, 30, was 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.220
 arrested in flagrante by military police 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.289
 accused of robbery according to police luiz 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.930
 was arrested while trying to steal a car 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.730
 on this street right here in the center of blumenau 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.920
 the owner would have been involved in a 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.980
 traffic accident and when leaving the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.809
 vehicle the defendant tried to steal it for 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.480
 luck he was then arrested by 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.770
 here in the region who witnessed the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.050
 the whole scene 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.690
 Luiz has already had several 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.239
 police between them for theft and 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.879
 body injury he confesses he tried 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.670
 remove the car from the place but according to him 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.010
 the situation did not characterize a robbery 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.049
 I did not like the Turkish lady who 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.510
 I believed that at that moment that 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.640
 lady who was driving the vehicle 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:12.930
 was not able to take the car in the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.000
 front of the cafe house and then you went there and 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.740
 yes, yes, because I have worked hard 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.479
 time vehicles and I saw that the vehicle 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.950
 could have a problem with the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.290
 inertia to not run the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.549
 forward to where next 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.420
 from the taxi she could leave with the 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.130
 necessary training to leave. 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.070
 because it was totally unbalanced 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.080
 was dominated 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.360
 Monica's something like that but there would not be 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.060
 interesting to ask permission for this 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.950
 lady to be able to take her car away 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.630
 maybe the text would have more like the radio 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.270
 was not working and could not 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.070
 I get a good connection so I ended up 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.780
 removing it because I wanted to show it 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.150
 in the city people would be fine without 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.890
 no problem, no good time ahead 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.390
 I ended up letting the 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.920
 police took away where I stayed 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.110
 that a time of rest and such 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.330
 talking to the people who are part of 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.850
 of our confraternity is what I could 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.050
 say that the community only 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.050
 inertia to woman
