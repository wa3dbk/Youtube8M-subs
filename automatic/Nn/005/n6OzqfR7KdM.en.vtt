in fiber so you'll probably want to know

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.310 
in fiber so you'll probably want to know
what<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.130> was<00:00:29.220> spinning<00:00:29.539> it's<00:00:30.539> an<00:00:30.720> alpaca<00:00:30.869> and

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.350 
what I was spinning it's an alpaca and
silk<00:00:31.500> blend<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.340> got<00:00:32.550> at<00:00:32.820> as<00:00:33.090> fast

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
silk blend that I got at as fast

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.280 
silk blend that I got at as fast
intestacy<00:00:34.050> oh<00:00:35.239> it<00:00:36.239> looks<00:00:37.230> like<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:38.270> in<00:00:39.290> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
intestacy oh it looks like this in the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.010 
intestacy oh it looks like this in the
bat<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.530> guess<00:00:40.980> it's<00:00:41.129> called<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.960> at<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
bat I guess it's called and at the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.750 
bat I guess it's called and at the
moment<00:00:43.350> I'm<00:00:43.440> trying<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.860> spin<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.160> up<00:00:44.250> into

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
moment I'm trying to spin it up into

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.990 
moment I'm trying to spin it up into
something<00:00:45.360> that's<00:00:45.600> kind<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:47.489> light

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
something that's kind of a light

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.369 
something that's kind of a light
fingering<00:00:48.660> weight<00:00:48.829> single<00:00:49.850> and<00:00:50.850> I'll<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.870> think

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
fingering weight single and I'll I think

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.590 
fingering weight single and I'll I think
I<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.160> knit<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.460> from<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.120> single<00:00:54.480> I

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
I like to knit it from the single I

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.939 
I like to knit it from the single I
won't<00:00:54.780> fly<00:00:55.050> at<00:00:55.260> first<00:00:55.530> before<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.980> knit<00:00:56.160> it

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
won't fly at first before I knit it

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.560 
won't fly at first before I knit it
because<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.070> like<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.520> barber<00:00:59.940> pole<00:00:59.969> effect

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
because I like the barber pole effect

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.509 
because I like the barber pole effect
that<00:01:00.809> I'm<00:01:00.930> getting<00:01:01.399> in<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.760> single<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:04.519> I

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
that I'm getting in the single and I

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.240 
that I'm getting in the single and I
think<00:01:06.150> if<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.360> apply<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.590> effect<00:01:07.770> will<00:01:08.220> be

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
think if I apply it that effect will be

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.520 
think if I apply it that effect will be
lost<00:01:08.610> even<00:01:09.600> though<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:09.869> know<00:01:09.990> what<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.290> needed

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
lost even though I know what I needed

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.380 
lost even though I know what I needed
that<00:01:11.100> effect<00:01:11.340> will<00:01:11.460> be<00:01:11.490> lost<00:01:11.729> as<00:01:11.939> well<00:01:12.060> I'll

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
that effect will be lost as well I'll

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.280 
that effect will be lost as well I'll
become<00:01:12.659> immoral<00:01:13.020> but<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:14.390> think<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.750> think<00:01:15.960> it'll

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
become immoral but I think I think it'll

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.660 
become immoral but I think I think it'll
look<00:01:16.439> really<00:01:16.500> nice<00:01:16.860> once<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.280> enough<00:01:19.670> so

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
look really nice once it's enough so

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.920 
look really nice once it's enough so

and<00:01:52.420> there<00:01:53.420> we<00:01:53.510> go<00:01:53.540> our<00:01:53.930> new<00:01:54.410> lens<00:01:54.680> from<00:01:54.830> DT

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
and there we go our new lens from DT

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.340 
and there we go our new lens from DT
doing<00:01:55.700> its<00:01:55.820> thing<00:01:56.060> I'll<00:01:56.450> also<00:01:56.810> try<00:01:56.990> to<00:01:57.110> get<00:01:57.290> a

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
doing its thing I'll also try to get a

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.280 
doing its thing I'll also try to get a
long<00:01:57.620> shot<00:01:58.010> of<00:01:58.550> it<00:01:59.060> in<00:01:59.300> action<00:01:59.810> hopefully<00:02:00.230> I

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
long shot of it in action hopefully I

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:08.109 
long shot of it in action hopefully I
can<00:02:00.440> do<00:02:00.620> this<00:02:00.830> here<00:02:01.190> so<00:02:01.940> here<00:02:02.180> is<00:02:02.270> me<00:02:02.420> now<00:02:07.119> there

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
can do this here so here is me now there

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.300 
can do this here so here is me now there
we<00:02:08.210> go
