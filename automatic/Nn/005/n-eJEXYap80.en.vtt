00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.500 
right here we can easily start recording
our<00:02:23.350> screen<00:02:23.740> and<00:02:23.950> stop<00:02:24.580> it<00:02:24.790> whenever<00:02:25.000> we<00:02:25.180> want

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
our screen and stop it whenever we want

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.810 
our screen and stop it whenever we want
so<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:25.840> would<00:02:26.020> go<00:02:26.170> to<00:02:26.230> my<00:02:26.440> device<00:02:27.130> play<00:02:27.640> around

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
so I would go to my device play around

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.980 
so I would go to my device play around
with<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.240> and<00:02:28.450> then<00:02:29.350> I<00:02:29.470> can<00:02:29.650> just<00:02:29.890> hit<00:02:30.010> stop

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
with it and then I can just hit stop

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.780 
with it and then I can just hit stop

this addition sign allows you to get a
bug<00:02:34.120> report<00:02:34.420> though<00:02:34.750> it<00:02:35.080> didn't<00:02:35.950> work<00:02:35.980> too

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250
