we're here with Andrew Boddington who's
going<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.059> tell<00:00:09.269> us<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.420> little<00:00:09.570> bit<00:00:09.690> about<00:00:09.750> this

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:10.140 
going to tell us a little bit about this

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.230 
going to tell us a little bit about this
model<00:00:10.380> which<00:00:10.680> is<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.010> mini<00:00:11.730> tyro

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
model which is the mini tyro

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.390 
model which is the mini tyro
which<00:00:12.720> is<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.990> free<00:00:13.170> plan<00:00:13.470> in<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:14.040> November

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
which is the free plan in the November

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:28.769 
which is the free plan in the November
issue<00:00:14.430> of<00:00:14.670> our<00:00:14.790> cm<00:00:15.030> knee

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.109 

well<00:00:29.779> I<00:00:30.080> can<00:00:30.439> see<00:00:30.590> it's<00:00:30.740> a<00:00:30.949> it<00:00:31.460> was<00:00:31.730> originally

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
well I can see it's a it was originally

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.639 
well I can see it's a it was originally
a<00:00:32.149> single-channel<00:00:32.599> model<00:00:32.989> I<00:00:33.050> think<00:00:33.230> it<00:00:33.320> was

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.950 

David<00:00:36.649> Boddingtons<00:00:37.340> designs<00:00:37.790> it's<00:00:38.329> over<00:00:38.600> 40

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
David Boddingtons designs it's over 40

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.380 
David Boddingtons designs it's over 40
years<00:00:39.170> old<00:00:39.500> since<00:00:40.129> it<00:00:40.309> originally<00:00:40.850> came<00:00:41.090> out

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
years old since it originally came out

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.410 
years old since it originally came out
in<00:00:41.750> RC<00:00:42.530> M&amp;E<00:00:42.920> and<00:00:43.550> as<00:00:43.790> you<00:00:43.940> say<00:00:44.150> it<00:00:44.300> was<00:00:44.390> a

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
in RC M&amp;E and as you say it was a

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.630 
in RC M&amp;E and as you say it was a
single-channel<00:00:44.930> model<00:00:45.409> then<00:00:45.620> and<00:00:46.250> for<00:00:46.489> its

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
single-channel model then and for its

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.369 
single-channel model then and for its
day<00:00:46.879> it<00:00:47.089> would<00:00:47.239> have<00:00:47.329> been<00:00:47.480> regarded<00:00:48.140> as<00:00:48.320> a

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
day it would have been regarded as a

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.740 
day it would have been regarded as a
very<00:00:48.589> lightweight<00:00:49.100> small<00:00:49.940> single<00:00:50.390> channel

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
very lightweight small single channel

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.880 
very lightweight small single channel
model<00:00:51.370> this<00:00:52.370> version<00:00:52.670> I<00:00:53.000> built<00:00:53.420> this<00:00:54.019> year<00:00:54.409> has

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
model this version I built this year has

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.939 
model this version I built this year has
got<00:00:55.070> three<00:00:55.309> function<00:00:56.180> in<00:00:56.360> it's<00:00:56.690> got<00:00:56.930> an<00:00:57.500> added

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
got three function in it's got an added

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.600 
got three function in it's got an added
elevator<00:00:58.430> and<00:00:59.180> an<00:00:59.690> RC<00:01:00.110> throttle<00:01:00.589> on<00:01:00.710> it<00:01:00.890> it's

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
elevator and an RC throttle on it it's

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
elevator and an RC throttle on it it's
an<00:01:02.180> original<00:01:02.510> Mills<00:01:03.080> which<00:01:04.150> had<00:01:05.150> an<00:01:05.299> idea

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
an original Mills which had an idea

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.660 
an original Mills which had an idea
regular<00:01:06.229> control<00:01:06.650> throttle<00:01:06.890> added<00:01:07.369> right

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
regular control throttle added right

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.660 
regular control throttle added right
it's<00:01:08.390> not<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:08.869> best<00:01:09.500> of<00:01:09.680> throttling<00:01:10.159> engines

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
it's not the best of throttling engines

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.940 
it's not the best of throttling engines
but<00:01:11.000> it<00:01:11.330> allows<00:01:11.689> you<00:01:11.869> to<00:01:12.080> slow<00:01:12.290> it<00:01:12.439> slightly

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
but it allows you to slow it slightly

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.560 
but it allows you to slow it slightly
and<00:01:13.100> certainly<00:01:13.430> cut<00:01:13.700> it<00:01:13.850> when<00:01:14.030> you<00:01:14.150> need<00:01:14.360> to

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
and certainly cut it when you need to

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.630 
and certainly cut it when you need to
now<00:01:15.110> for<00:01:15.470> a<00:01:15.500> norm<00:01:15.770> diesel<00:01:16.189> personal<00:01:16.490> I<00:01:16.520> mean

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
now for a norm diesel personal I mean

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.749 
now for a norm diesel personal I mean
what<00:01:16.909> size<00:01:17.090> Mills<00:01:17.390> is<00:01:17.570> that<00:01:17.780> that's<00:01:18.290> a<00:01:18.470> Mills

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
what size Mills is that that's a Mills

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.569 
what size Mills is that that's a Mills
0.75<00:01:19.759> so<00:01:20.299> it's<00:01:20.479> just<00:01:20.720> under<00:01:21.049> 1<00:01:21.229> CC<00:01:21.799> right<00:01:22.130> ok

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
0.75 so it's just under 1 CC right ok

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:25.179 
0.75 so it's just under 1 CC right ok
and<00:01:23.020> what<00:01:24.020> sort<00:01:24.229> of<00:01:24.259> duration<00:01:24.560> can<00:01:24.890> you<00:01:25.009> get

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
and what sort of duration can you get

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.420 
and what sort of duration can you get
from<00:01:25.490> from<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:26.119> from<00:01:26.869> a<00:01:26.960> motor<00:01:27.170> run<00:01:27.439> well<00:01:28.130> it

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
from from the from a motor run well it

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.730 
from from the from a motor run well it
hasn't<00:01:28.610> got<00:01:28.939> the<00:01:28.970> original<00:01:29.600> tank<00:01:30.200> on<00:01:30.500> the

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
hasn't got the original tank on the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.340 
hasn't got the original tank on the
mills<00:01:30.950> it's<00:01:31.310> got<00:01:31.490> a<00:01:31.520> built<00:01:32.090> in<00:01:32.299> metal<00:01:32.659> tank<00:01:32.990> the

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
mills it's got a built in metal tank the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.020 
mills it's got a built in metal tank the
kind<00:01:33.590> you<00:01:33.740> might<00:01:33.890> use<00:01:34.100> in<00:01:34.280> a<00:01:34.340> small<00:01:34.609> control

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
kind you might use in a small control

certainly<00:01:36.259> you<00:01:36.439> can<00:01:36.530> get<00:01:36.619> three<00:01:36.920> to<00:01:37.100> five

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
certainly you can get three to five

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.999 
certainly you can get three to five
minutes<00:01:37.850> happily<00:01:38.600> flying<00:01:39.020> and<00:01:39.380> it's<00:01:39.499> the<00:01:39.590> kind

minutes happily flying and it's the kind
of<00:01:40.069> thing<00:01:40.219> because<00:01:40.280> you<00:01:40.460> don't<00:01:40.640> need<00:01:40.759> a

got a nice flat bottom weighing constant
cord<00:01:55.630> it<00:01:56.630> looks<00:01:56.780> fairly<00:01:56.990> fairly<00:01:57.530> easy<00:01:57.770> to

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
build would it be suitable for beginners

would<00:01:59.509> you<00:01:59.600> say<00:02:00.159> possibly<00:02:01.159> yes<00:02:01.429> it's<00:02:01.939> pretty

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
would you say possibly yes it's pretty

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.020 
would you say possibly yes it's pretty
straightforward<00:02:03.639> somebody<00:02:04.639> who's<00:02:04.789> never

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
straightforward somebody who's never

worked<00:02:05.389> with<00:02:05.569> balsa<00:02:06.020> wood<00:02:06.139> before<00:02:06.590> perhaps

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:06.859 
worked with balsa wood before perhaps

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:09.460 
worked with balsa wood before perhaps
would<00:02:07.459> be<00:02:07.670> better<00:02:08.090> thinking<00:02:08.720> of<00:02:08.840> another

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
would be better thinking of another

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.210 
would be better thinking of another
model<00:02:09.920> but<00:02:10.459> anyone<00:02:11.240> who's<00:02:11.530> had<00:02:12.530> cut<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:12.950> bit<00:02:13.130> of

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
model but anyone who's had cut a bit of

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.860 
model but anyone who's had cut a bit of
balsa<00:02:13.580> wood<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.760> feels<00:02:14.060> confident<00:02:14.690> there's

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
balsa wood and feels confident there's

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.960 
balsa wood and feels confident there's
nothing<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.319> complicated<00:02:15.980> about<00:02:16.220> it

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
nothing that complicated about it

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.559 
nothing that complicated about it
certainly<00:02:17.660> goes<00:02:17.870> together<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:20.150> did<00:02:20.360> what<00:02:20.480> have

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
certainly goes together it did what have

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.470 
certainly goes together it did what have
you<00:02:20.630> covered<00:02:20.810> yours<00:02:21.110> with<00:02:21.319> you<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:22.010> that's

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
you covered yours with you and that's

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.120 
you covered yours with you and that's
from<00:02:23.480> solar<00:02:23.780> film<00:02:24.110> I<00:02:24.319> think<00:02:24.560> it's<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:24.920> lights

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
from solar film I think it's the lights

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.059 
from solar film I think it's the lights
pan<00:02:25.490> product<00:02:25.970> is<00:02:26.810> great<00:02:27.170> stuff<00:02:27.470> because<00:02:27.740> it's

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
pan product is great stuff because it's

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.309 
pan product is great stuff because it's
a<00:02:28.280> tissue<00:02:28.760> type<00:02:29.120> finish<00:02:29.420> which<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:30.170> original

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
a tissue type finish which the original

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.740 
a tissue type finish which the original
would<00:02:30.770> have<00:02:30.920> had<00:02:31.160> been<00:02:31.400> 40<00:02:31.819> years<00:02:32.090> ago<00:02:32.270> but

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
would have had been 40 years ago but

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.860 
would have had been 40 years ago but
it's<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:33.200> lot<00:02:33.380> stronger<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:34.450> now<00:02:35.450> it's<00:02:35.690> three

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
it's a lot stronger and now it's three

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.330 
it's a lot stronger and now it's three
channels<00:02:36.230> obviously<00:02:36.680> so<00:02:36.860> rudder<00:02:37.280> elevator

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
channels obviously so rudder elevator

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.300 
channels obviously so rudder elevator
and<00:02:37.910> throttle<00:02:38.470> presumably<00:02:39.470> it's<00:02:39.620> for<00:02:39.740> fairly

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
and throttle presumably it's for fairly

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.280 
and throttle presumably it's for fairly
small<00:02:40.520> servos

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
small servos

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.199 
small servos
are<00:02:41.560> required<00:02:42.010> are<00:02:42.519> we<00:02:42.610> looking<00:02:42.849> at<00:02:42.879> micro

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
are required are we looking at micro

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.770 
are required are we looking at micro
servos<00:02:43.680> yes<00:02:44.680> fairly<00:02:45.250> small<00:02:45.489> servo<00:02:46.090> so<00:02:46.480> they're

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
servos yes fairly small servo so they're

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.440 
servos yes fairly small servo so they're
just<00:02:47.409> big<00:02:47.590> enough<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:47.890> fit<00:02:48.219> three<00:02:48.700> breasts

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
just big enough to fit three breasts

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.440 
just big enough to fit three breasts
inside<00:02:50.049> the<00:02:50.260> fuselage<00:02:50.819> they<00:02:51.819> don't<00:02:52.150> have<00:02:52.329> to

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
inside the fuselage they don't have to

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.800 
inside the fuselage they don't have to
be<00:02:52.599> the<00:02:52.719> very<00:02:52.900> smallest<00:02:54.060> maybe<00:02:55.060> mini<00:02:55.299> servos

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
be the very smallest maybe mini servos

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.940 
be the very smallest maybe mini servos
or<00:02:56.019> yes<00:02:56.349> I<00:02:56.829> mean<00:02:57.159> I<00:02:57.420> built<00:02:58.439> similar<00:02:59.439> models<00:02:59.739> to

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
or yes I mean I built similar models to

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.740 
or yes I mean I built similar models to
this<00:03:00.069> in<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.400> seventies<00:03:00.849> and<00:03:00.879> using<00:03:01.480> the

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
this in the seventies and using the

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.380 
this in the seventies and using the
small<00:03:01.870> servos<00:03:02.470> available<00:03:03.099> then<00:03:03.310> certainly<00:03:04.120> to

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
small servos available then certainly to

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.500 
small servos available then certainly to
channel<00:03:04.810> no<00:03:04.959> problems<00:03:05.379> at<00:03:05.590> all<00:03:05.769> and<00:03:06.510> probably

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
channel no problems at all and probably

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.190 
channel no problems at all and probably
the<00:03:07.599> other<00:03:08.250> modification<00:03:09.250> is<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:10.540> battery

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
the other modification is the battery

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.470 
the other modification is the battery
I've<00:03:11.349> got<00:03:11.379> right<00:03:11.889> up<00:03:12.129> underneath<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.790> tank<00:03:13.060> so

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
I've got right up underneath the tank so

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.240 
I've got right up underneath the tank so
that<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:14.079> weight<00:03:14.769> of<00:03:15.069> the<00:03:16.769> power<00:03:17.769> forward<00:03:18.069> as

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
that the weight of the power forward as

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.580 
that the weight of the power forward as
possible<00:03:18.639> means<00:03:19.569> I'm<00:03:19.780> not<00:03:19.959> have<00:03:20.139> to<00:03:20.290> add<00:03:20.439> any

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
possible means I'm not have to add any

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.009 
possible means I'm not have to add any
LED<00:03:20.889> or<00:03:21.159> do<00:03:21.340> any<00:03:21.549> variations<00:03:22.239> to<00:03:22.359> get<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.659> C<00:03:22.900> of

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
LED or do any variations to get the C of

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.229 
LED or do any variations to get the C of
G<00:03:23.260> right<00:03:23.400> we'll<00:03:24.400> see<00:03:24.549> all<00:03:24.639> that<00:03:24.790> weight<00:03:25.000> there

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
G right we'll see all that weight there

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.629 
G right we'll see all that weight there
what<00:03:25.599> are<00:03:25.629> we<00:03:25.750> looking<00:03:25.989> at<00:03:27.870> oh<00:03:29.430> that's<00:03:30.430> not

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
what are we looking at oh that's not

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.429 
what are we looking at oh that's not
much<00:03:30.790> more<00:03:30.939> than<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.120> pound<00:03:31.389> is<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:31.840> or<00:03:31.989> if<00:03:32.139> maybe

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:32.439 
much more than a pound is it or if maybe

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.190 
much more than a pound is it or if maybe
a<00:03:32.530> bit<00:03:32.709> less<00:03:32.970> possibly<00:03:33.970> is<00:03:34.180> yeah<00:03:34.510> in<00:03:35.049> the

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.770 

yes<00:04:03.690> excellent<00:04:04.620> great<00:04:05.180> well<00:04:06.180> we<00:04:06.300> better<00:04:06.510> we

yes excellent great well we better we

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:42.600 
yes excellent great well we better we
better<00:04:06.810> fly

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.820 

sure<00:04:43.300> we<00:04:43.479> will<00:04:43.720> see<00:04:43.870> some<00:04:44.050> electric<00:04:44.439> versions

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
sure we will see some electric versions

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.830 
sure we will see some electric versions
as<00:04:44.979> well<00:04:45.120> I<00:04:46.120> guess<00:04:46.449> the<00:04:48.300> parish<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.330> finger

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
as well I guess the parish the finger

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.200 
as well I guess the parish the finger
very<00:04:50.229> much<00:04:50.409> of<00:04:50.590> these<00:04:50.710> or<00:04:51.000> did<00:04:52.000> he<00:04:52.090> have

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
very much of these or did he have
