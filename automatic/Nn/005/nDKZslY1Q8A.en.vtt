00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.610

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.940

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.550

 ingredients and well I'll show you the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.850
 step by step 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.450
 first we would need three eggs 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.820
 so that you get that amount 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:01:01.060
 three whole eggs also use ham 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.430
 can be ham normal ham ham york 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:07.360
 of turkey turkey breast or any 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.160
 any of these of these sausages 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.160
 that you can use that are of course 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.340
 with practically no fat very little 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:19.000
 salt and also this cheese that you use that is 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.250
 the santé 0% cheese that comes in sabanitas 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.550
 I cut it if you do not have this 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.229
 You can use with any weight 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.590
 0% fats from cheeses to choose type 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:32.020
 cream cheese cheese smoothie and also 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.430
 you need a little salt 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.270
 these are the ingredients then 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.820
 let's see how we do it 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.170
 first let's put the three 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.170
 eggs and we're going to beat them 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.900
 you do not need to beat them too much 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.670
 in fact not even use a blender 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.940
 you can do it simply with a 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.940
 fork 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.740
 we beat them 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.060
 so mix well and then you 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.250
 let's add the salt 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.160
 remember I always tell you not too much 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.580
 we put a lot of salt and add it 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:21.170
 the ham me here use approximately 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.970
 between 70 and 80 grams of ham that does not 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.410
 I had said it so you remember it in 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.630
 the ingredients 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.940
 and I used 4 cheese sabahs 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.120
 if you're going to use the cheese has beaten cheese 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.530
 creamy are about three tablespoons 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.530
 then what you do is mix it 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.610
 mixes well 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.439
 Y 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.190
 the cheese do not worry because it 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.820
 melt if you see that you have left half 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.630
 so there seems not to be 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.000
 incorporated well to the rest of the 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.890
 ingredients afterwards it's going to melt 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.070
 so now you need to use some 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.390
 mold that serves you for I'm going to use it 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.310
 do it in the microwave but you 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.290
 you can do in the oven also these 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.540
 They are silicone molds just like I was telling you 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.790
 I wanted to make them little because 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.670
 they also look nicer when it comes to 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.650
 present it like this 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.050
 and in our diet it is also important 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.450
 the presentation makes the 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.360
 meals seem even more appetizing if 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.569
 we present them beautiful then 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.819
 you put about two tablespoons setting 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.440
 that there is not a space left 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.810
 because the egg grows without 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.170
 and now once we have them 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.630
 we all take them to the microwave 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.060
 in the microwave I had them four minutes 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.160
 at maximum temperature as always 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.830
 I say you try first with three minutes 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.700
 and you're seeing because each microwave is 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.700
 a little different 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.820
 we still have a little left over that we can 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.709
 do some more then now let's 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.650
 take them to the microwave 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:28.000
 as I told you between 3 and 4 minutes and 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.000
 we come back to stay as is 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.290
 well here we have returned from microwave 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.169
 see how the bits of 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.790
 cheese 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:51.570
 and good we have left 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:54.560
 and reach for some more they can be 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.880
 about 8 of these ham and cheese kits 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.410
 also of course if you want what 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.410
 you can do you can make a bigger one 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.430
 there are times really it's very good as 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:12.009
 entry to accompany any dish 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:15.250
 what I wanted to tell you that as you see 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:19.240
 by not having any vegetables they serve us 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.710
 for a day of pepe or good or if you're 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.210
 in the attack phase you can eat them 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.639
 leisurely only serón 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.870
 ham and cheese eggs so good 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.940
 I hope you like them to stay 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.919
 good and you tell me leave me your 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.580
