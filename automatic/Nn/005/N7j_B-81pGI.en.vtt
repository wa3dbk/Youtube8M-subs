00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
think the xbox 360 is a very organized

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.289 
think the xbox 360 is a very organized
dashboard<00:03:28.799> as<00:03:28.949> a<00:03:29.010> poll<00:03:29.489> what<00:03:29.819> it<00:03:29.910> was<00:03:30.030> only<00:03:30.209> a

to update so the blades virtually have
no<00:05:00.000> lo<00:05:00.600> time<00:05:05.030> so<00:05:06.030> a<00:05:06.060> fabrication<00:05:06.750> I'm<00:05:06.930> not

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
no lo time so a fabrication I'm not
