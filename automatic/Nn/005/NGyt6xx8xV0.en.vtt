so we get a large diameter spindle on
the<00:01:32.390> cranks<00:01:32.810> gives<00:01:33.680> us<00:01:33.799> a<00:01:33.920> lot<00:01:34.100> of<00:01:34.250> lateral

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
the cranks gives us a lot of lateral

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.170 
the cranks gives us a lot of lateral
