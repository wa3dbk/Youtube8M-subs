00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.200
 hello comrades we continue 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.830
 draw our manga and today cover 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.769
 At first I beat the heroines on the contour each 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.260
 on a separate layer it is worth noting that 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.980
 the introduction does not always give a good 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.890
 result 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.020
 even if you had a photo other than 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.380
 the contours there were shadows 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.960
 skin folds and other markers which 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.699
 we kind of determine what this pattern 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.160
 looks right 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.649
 much depends on the viewer himself 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.649
 but still a clean outline 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.120
 does not give representation in all angles and 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.129
 sometimes require refinement and change of posture 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.010
 I emphasize the problem is not in the lake 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.559
 problem in the perception system and on it 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.170
 have to make an amendment that is 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.440
 in fact we can change the drawing in 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.070
 side away from reality while 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.770
 he will be better perceived for example 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.500
 limbs and fingers like 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.799
 curl if they go towards 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.030
 to the viewer or from him and in academic 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.619
 drawing they do also but in reality 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.500
 certainly nothing like it 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.590
 observed when will tuck 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.890
 good specimens i will turn to this 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.310
 attention we have the same revision initially 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.950
 It was laid at the stage of creation 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.860
 design began with the first antagonist ki 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.189
 changed the proportions of the body legs stretched out and 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.579
 made thinner waist already and so on 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.400
 then set to the headdress with him 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.799
 having some problems first i 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.420
 I wanted to somehow determine how it is 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.659
 should look like 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.119
 then he changed his mind drawing a circle of the base and 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.159
 he was already pushing off 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.280
 to better represent as such 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.560
 peaked cap looks from the side downloaded this one 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.399
 picture 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.570
 then went clothes has a design deal 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.570
 simple 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:09.470
 the only problem is fabric and folds 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.380
 for the sleeve created a separate layer together 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.810
 fold respectively the main place where 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.530
 the fabric is crushed and lines are formed 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.200
 folds 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.319
 but with the second heroine of problems where 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.400
 more of her proportions needed to be changed 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:29.030
 stronger I broke it into three layers all that 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:33.110
 above the belt one layer the second layer below 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:36.530
 belt left leg on another separate 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:40.150
 the layer then the right leg is also separate 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.040
 traced and attached by changing its forms 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.700
 had to redo a lot 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.910
 parts moved in space 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.730
 scaled 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.519
 and redraw your hand too 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.030
 Somewhat redone especially shoulder 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.920
 heads of course i do much more 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.220
 and changing hairstyles 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.829
 after that there was a bunch of drivers face 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.560
 draw in a slight twist when 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:09.380
 the distant eye is only slightly visible always 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.470
 very difficult in the end I am from this 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.200
 actually refused visible only 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.109
 eyelashes are actually even in 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.930
 professional manga and anime series their 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:23.780
 head in such a turn is not at all 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.840
 get nice and well and 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.709
 Manga -style face structure 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.829
 if you open almost any manga 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.030
 you will find that there are almost no such positions 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:38.630
 will though 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:42.109
 exceptions are found by the very same eye 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.840
 did like this half-closed bottom 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:48.139
 the eyelid is curved upwards 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.430
 eyebrows go at an angle going down the edges 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:54.590
 eyes mouth parted and blush on cheeks 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.970
 hatching I'm not very good 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.790
 I can depict 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:02.209
 I wanted to express my emotions 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.739
 some embarrassment then needed 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:08.920
 draw a gun and the first is a mauser 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:11.290
 based on the given pictures 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.810
 the gun was not quite in that place 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.230
 where was he supposed to by this hand 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.540
 had to move and something 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:22.090
 redraw the second gun 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.220
 silicon here with this picture since 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.030
 the main character who is with this 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:30.130
 the gun is on the top layer 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.290
 I did not wash some places but simply 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.260
 painted white at the final stage 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:39.190
 drawing a sketch i could imagine it 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:42.520
 allow for this sketch took two hours and 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.440
 30 minutes a total of twenty 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.040
 four hours of pure time 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:51.970
 do not forget to put everything on this day 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:54.040
 likes and reposts and subscriptions to the past 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.080
 everyone 's video apparently happened 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.260
 the disease will not like this 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:04.500
 Roller and numbers on counters skukozhilis 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.500
 yes completely unsightly state
