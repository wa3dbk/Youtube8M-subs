we<00:00:01.020> have<00:00:01.199> this<00:00:01.380> dawn<00:00:01.949> spacecraft<00:00:04.580> approaching

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:05.779 
we have this dawn spacecraft approaching

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:08.419 
we have this dawn spacecraft approaching
the<00:00:06.779> dwarf<00:00:07.109> planet<00:00:07.170> here<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:08.040> I've<00:00:08.160> shown

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
the dwarf planet here and I've shown

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.259 
the dwarf planet here and I've shown
these<00:00:08.880> mystery<00:00:09.389> spots<00:00:10.160> several<00:00:11.160> times<00:00:11.269> the

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
these mystery spots several times the

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.640 
these mystery spots several times the
initial<00:00:12.540> one<00:00:13.610> and<00:00:14.630> then<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.750> secondary<00:00:16.230> spot

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
initial one and then the secondary spot

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.050 
initial one and then the secondary spot
that<00:00:16.830> they<00:00:16.920> have<00:00:17.070> pointed<00:00:17.430> out<00:00:19.520> now<00:00:20.520> as<00:00:20.820> you

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
that they have pointed out now as you

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.980 
that they have pointed out now as you
can<00:00:21.150> see<00:00:21.210> here<00:00:22.039> nASA<00:00:23.039> has<00:00:23.279> put<00:00:23.670> out<00:00:23.869> what<00:00:24.869> it's

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
can see here nASA has put out what it's

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.009 
can see here nASA has put out what it's
going<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.199> look<00:00:25.289> like<00:00:25.470> here<00:00:26.060> march<00:00:27.060> sixth<00:00:27.840> as

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
going to look like here march sixth as

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.389 
going to look like here march sixth as
it<00:00:28.920> comes<00:00:29.340> into<00:00:29.609> orbit<00:00:33.920> zooming<00:00:34.920> right<00:00:34.950> around

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
it comes into orbit zooming right around

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.630 
it comes into orbit zooming right around
here<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.000> starts<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.420> hook<00:00:36.630> back

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.729 

and<00:00:42.730> we'll<00:00:43.420> come<00:00:43.660> back<00:00:43.840> on<00:00:44.050> the<00:00:44.079> dark<00:00:44.530> side

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.479 

till<00:00:47.739> it<00:00:47.860> finally<00:00:48.660> dies<00:00:49.660> down<00:00:50.370> right<00:00:51.370> around

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
till it finally dies down right around

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.869 
till it finally dies down right around
there<00:00:51.910> is<00:00:53.250> where<00:00:54.250> we're<00:00:54.370> going<00:00:54.489> to<00:00:54.550> get<00:00:54.699> some

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
there is where we're going to get some

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.829 
there is where we're going to get some
of<00:00:54.940> our<00:00:55.149> best<00:00:55.329> shots<00:00:56.170> once<00:00:56.620> they<00:00:56.860> release<00:00:57.070> them

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
of our best shots once they release them

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:04.880 
of our best shots once they release them
but<00:00:58.839> i<00:00:59.100> want<00:01:00.100> to<00:01:00.129> show<00:01:00.309> you<00:01:00.339> this<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:04.239> see<00:01:04.420> that

but i want to show you this you see that
we<00:01:05.890> now<00:01:05.920> have<00:01:06.369> a<00:01:06.400> better<00:01:06.700> look<00:01:07.920> at<00:01:09.150> this

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
we now have a better look at this

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.310 
we now have a better look at this
mystery<00:01:10.840> spot<00:01:11.310> instead<00:01:12.310> of<00:01:12.460> one<00:01:12.700> image<00:01:13.320> try

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
mystery spot instead of one image try

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.480 
mystery spot instead of one image try
and<00:01:14.440> take<00:01:14.560> it<00:01:14.680> slow<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.869> see<00:01:17.280> we've<00:01:18.280> got<00:01:18.340> a

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
and take it slow you see we've got a

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.560 
and take it slow you see we've got a
couple<00:01:18.700> a<00:01:19.060> couple<00:01:19.270> slides<00:01:19.660> here<00:01:20.160> and<00:01:21.539> it<00:01:22.539> looks

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
couple a couple slides here and it looks

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.370 
couple a couple slides here and it looks
to<00:01:22.960> be<00:01:23.140> like<00:01:23.170> these<00:01:24.720> mystery<00:01:25.720> spots<00:01:26.110> are

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
to be like these mystery spots are

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.090 
to be like these mystery spots are
indeed<00:01:27.369> reflective<00:01:29.039> not<00:01:30.039> a<00:01:30.070> light<00:01:31.830> as<00:01:32.830> you<00:01:32.979> can

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
indeed reflective not a light as you can

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.560 
indeed reflective not a light as you can
see<00:01:33.250> once<00:01:33.460> it<00:01:33.610> goes<00:01:33.700> around<00:01:33.940> the<00:01:34.060> corner<00:01:34.420> they

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
see once it goes around the corner they

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.139 
see once it goes around the corner they
dim<00:01:34.810> out<00:01:35.050> but<00:01:35.979> you<00:01:36.100> can<00:01:36.280> see<00:01:36.429> these<00:01:36.610> objects

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
dim out but you can see these objects

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.520 
dim out but you can see these objects
are<00:01:37.300> there<00:01:37.690> in<00:01:38.039> this<00:01:39.039> one<00:01:39.720> I'm<00:01:40.720> not<00:01:41.020> so<00:01:41.259> sure<00:01:41.289> if

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
are there in this one I'm not so sure if

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.889 
are there in this one I'm not so sure if
that<00:01:41.800> could<00:01:41.920> be<00:01:41.979> considered<00:01:42.429> to<00:01:42.670> be<00:01:42.789> water<00:01:43.149> it

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
that could be considered to be water it

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.660 
that could be considered to be water it
looks<00:01:44.229> more<00:01:44.470> like<00:01:44.590> a<00:01:44.679> structure<00:01:45.360> right<00:01:46.360> there

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
looks more like a structure right there

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.580 
looks more like a structure right there
one<00:01:48.670> more<00:01:49.680> goes<00:01:50.680> dark<00:01:51.630> as<00:01:52.630> soon<00:01:52.840> as<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.079> Sun<00:01:53.350> is

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
one more goes dark as soon as the Sun is

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:03.970 
one more goes dark as soon as the Sun is
off<00:01:54.520> of<00:01:54.700> it<00:01:54.790> it<00:01:54.880> goes<00:01:55.030> dark

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.230 

that's<00:02:04.980> the<00:02:05.190> latest<00:02:05.340> i'll<00:02:05.670> leave<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.850> link<00:02:05.940> so
