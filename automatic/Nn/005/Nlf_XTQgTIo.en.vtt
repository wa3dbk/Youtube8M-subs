we've learned a bit about the stakes

made the brain hello everyone welcome to
our<00:00:15.360> blind<00:00:15.599> tasting<00:00:16.199> for<00:00:16.410> today<00:00:16.680> we<00:00:17.100> have

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
our blind tasting for today we have

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.000 
our blind tasting for today we have
three<00:00:17.880> different<00:00:18.029> ways<00:00:18.270> for<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.840> try<00:00:19.080> okay

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
three different ways for you to try okay

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.920 
three different ways for you to try okay
what's<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.789> got<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.090> do<00:00:21.359> with<00:00:21.390> learning

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
what's this got to do with learning

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.050 
what's this got to do with learning
about<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.289> brain<00:00:22.590> there's<00:00:23.460> actually<00:00:24.029> a

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
about the brain there's actually a

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.390 
about the brain there's actually a
method<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.570> my<00:00:24.810> madness<00:00:24.890> the<00:00:25.890> three<00:00:26.070> different

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
method to my madness the three different

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.960 
method to my madness the three different
wines<00:00:26.580> are<00:00:27.260> 1535<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.590> $90<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.460> we'll<00:00:29.580> start<00:00:29.820> up

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
wines are 1535 and $90 so we'll start up

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.420 
wines are 1535 and $90 so we'll start up
for<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.330> first<00:00:30.510> one<00:00:30.810> okay<00:00:31.109> I'm<00:00:31.769> here<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.309> learn

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
for the first one okay I'm here to learn

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.060 
for the first one okay I'm here to learn
how<00:00:32.669> our<00:00:32.700> brains<00:00:33.210> want<00:00:33.570> us<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.899> be<00:00:34.050> happy<00:00:34.590> and

what they try to do it the ends of the
day<00:02:57.739> what<00:02:58.190> we<00:02:58.310> show<00:02:58.549> is<00:02:58.760> that<00:02:58.790> you<00:02:59.540> pay<00:02:59.780> more

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
day what we show is that you pay more

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.770 
day what we show is that you pay more
for<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.980> wine<00:03:01.160> and<00:03:01.580> it<00:03:01.640> makes<00:03:02.120> you<00:03:02.299> more<00:03:02.330> happy

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
for the wine and it makes you more happy

for the wine and it makes you more happy
so<00:03:03.049> you<00:03:03.110> get<00:03:03.379> what<00:03:03.530> you<00:03:03.620> pay<00:03:04.040> for<00:03:04.069> the<00:03:04.310> moment

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
so you get what you pay for the moment

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.130 
so you get what you pay for the moment
right<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:04.879> mean<00:03:05.060> not<00:03:05.360> may<00:03:05.480> not<00:03:05.510> be<00:03:05.810> for<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:05.989> long

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
right I mean not may not be for the long

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.539 
right I mean not may not be for the long
haul<00:03:06.379> but<00:03:06.590> I<00:03:06.620> kids<00:03:06.830> for<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.010> moment<00:03:07.310> it<00:03:07.370> makes

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
haul but I kids for the moment it makes

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.729 
haul but I kids for the moment it makes
you<00:03:07.670> makes<00:03:08.330> you<00:03:08.420> happy<00:03:08.720> so<00:03:08.930> it's<00:03:09.440> actually<00:03:09.590> a

the fMRI proves you don't just think the
