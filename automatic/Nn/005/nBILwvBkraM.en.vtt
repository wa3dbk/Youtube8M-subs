00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
when it's time to grow up and in the

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.619 
when it's time to grow up and in the
case<00:00:04.799> of<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:04.980> Vauxhall<00:00:05.370> Meriva<00:00:05.490> that<00:00:06.270> time

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
case of the Vauxhall Meriva that time

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.799 
case of the Vauxhall Meriva that time
it's<00:00:06.930> now<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:08.550> new<00:00:08.700> model<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.150> almost<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.570> fort

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
it's now the new model is almost a fort

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.169 
it's now the new model is almost a fort
longer<00:00:10.170> than<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.530> car<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:10.920> replaces<00:00:11.179> this

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
longer than the car it replaces this

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.820 
longer than the car it replaces this
means<00:00:12.480> it's<00:00:12.690> more<00:00:12.870> suitable<00:00:13.290> for<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.559> growing

large enough to be called a compact

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.910 
large enough to be called a compact
rather<00:00:19.260> than<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.619> small<00:00:20.160> MPV<00:00:21.680> but<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.740> big<00:00:22.890> news

rather than a small MPV but the big news

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.529 
rather than a small MPV but the big news
is<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.580> more<00:00:23.699> Eva's<00:00:24.060> clever<00:00:24.480> flex<00:00:24.900> doors<00:00:26.539> the

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
is the more Eva's clever flex doors the

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.359 
is the more Eva's clever flex doors the
front<00:00:27.810> ones<00:00:27.990> open<00:00:28.380> almost<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.010> complete

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
are hinged at the back this means it's

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.780 
are hinged at the back this means it's
very<00:00:36.960> easy<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.590> fit<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> child<00:00:38.129> seat<00:00:38.399> into<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.610 
very easy to fit a child seat into the
back<00:00:38.940> because<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.600> don't<00:00:39.750> have<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.079> twist<00:00:40.379> and

back because you don't have to twist and

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.889 
back because you don't have to twist and
cuz<00:00:41.070> you're<00:00:41.190> facing<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.640> baby<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.629> make<00:00:42.780> sure

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
cuz you're facing the baby you make sure

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.450

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
to kind of look around like this like

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.990 
to kind of look around like this like
you<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.500> other<00:00:46.649> cars<00:00:46.950> that's<00:00:47.730> if<00:00:47.879> you've

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
you do in other cars that's if you've

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.760 
you do in other cars that's if you've
got<00:00:48.149> kids<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.450> course

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.900 

however<00:00:54.770> it's<00:00:54.950> also<00:00:55.100> good<00:00:55.430> if<00:00:55.579> you<00:00:55.670> need<00:00:55.820> to

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
however it's also good if you need to

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.430 
however it's also good if you need to
carry<00:00:56.090> older<00:00:56.450> people<00:00:56.780> as<00:00:56.870> well<00:00:57.050> because<00:00:57.320> they

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
carry older people as well because they

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.290 
carry older people as well because they

array it means that you can have some

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.170 
array it means that you can have some
extra<00:01:20.869> shoulder<00:01:21.470> room<00:01:21.650> anyway<00:01:22.550> that's<00:01:22.880> enough

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
extra shoulder room anyway that's enough

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.090 
extra shoulder room anyway that's enough
about<00:01:23.300> the<00:01:23.540> back<00:01:23.780> of<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:23.990> Meriva<00:01:24.470> it's<00:01:24.770> time

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
about the back of the Meriva it's time

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.980 
about the back of the Meriva it's time
to<00:01:25.250> see<00:01:25.399> what<00:01:25.520> it's<00:01:25.670> like<00:01:25.850> from<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:26.509> driver's

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.810 

obviously<00:01:43.260> the<00:01:43.560> Mareva<00:01:44.010> isn't<00:01:44.280> exactly<00:01:44.610> going

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
obviously the Mareva isn't exactly going

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.490 
obviously the Mareva isn't exactly going
to<00:01:44.970> set<00:01:45.210> your<00:01:45.390> world<00:01:45.660> alight<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.020> mean<00:01:46.260> after

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
all it is an MPV but the handling it's

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.150 
all it is an MPV but the handling it's
very<00:01:50.220> secure<00:01:50.550> very<00:01:51.000> stable<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.470> ride<00:01:52.680> is

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
to its predecessor this new model feels

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.330 
to its predecessor this new model feels
a<00:01:59.310> lot<00:01:59.520> more<00:01:59.580> grown-up<00:02:00.120> in<00:02:00.990> fact<00:02:01.230> it<00:02:02.010> felt<00:02:02.250> like
