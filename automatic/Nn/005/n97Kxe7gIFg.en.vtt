00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.719
 and 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.170
 good perfect that we are going to prepare 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.810
 Today is a delicious marzipan 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.660
 Christmas that will make us great as 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.000
 dessert for these holidays for 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.460
 doing it we're going to need the marzipan that 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.529
 I already taught you to do in another recipe that 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.009
 I will leave you in the description of 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.349
 video and the egg yolk of the clear 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.250
 that we used to make the marzipan 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.440
 remember that the marzipan we have had 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.710
 one day in the fridge more than anything for 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.539
 I took the body and the yolk we go to 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.870
 have also in the fridge covered with a 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:47.739
 film paper we will first start cutting 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.760
 our marzipan in portions that we are going to 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.680
 do 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.940
 after 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.870
 in which we are going to do next 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.870
 our marzipans 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.989
 we are interested in being very big 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.120
 one 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.470
 once we have them cut because then 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.320
 we are going to start to shape 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.690
 we can give them the ones we want 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.200
 but for example if you look at the 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:23.580
 that they already sell because for example there are some 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.580
 that look like braids 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.729
 once we have the central formed 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.030
 we put it in the oven tray that 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:51.310
 we already have paper with this 2 other 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.310
 option for example we take we give 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.170
 rectangular shape 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.420
 and with a spoon 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.190
 we mark 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.580
 three parts 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.680
 and we can put it in the tray of the 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.680
 oven 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.269
 we take the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.269
 the marzipan 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:45.720
 and if we have a cookie cutter 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.720
 well, we use it 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.410
 to shape our marzipan for 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.460
 that is of heart and when we have it 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.010
 inside we will take it from behind 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.650
 slowly more than anything so you do not 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.190
 we deformed the front and if we 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.190
 look pretty 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.260
 and when we have it, we have just 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.490
 give the shape that I could lose and what 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.800
 we put in our oven paper 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.340
 and so man doing the forms that more 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.269
 we like 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.269
 or that we prefer 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.640
 once we have our 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:39.830
 finished marzipan then let's paint 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:43.250
 with the egg yolk that has left us 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:48.400
 well whipped and brush we will do what it is 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.400
 the top of our marzipan 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.470
 and while we have preheated in the 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.350
 200 degree oven and now when I 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.670
 let's say we will only put the athina 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.350
 because what interests us is that 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.300
 they are out above what we are 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.130
 it costs and it's only until we see that the 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.860
 top part costs us a little bit 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.140
 good and here we have our delicious 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.030
 Marzipan is to enjoy these 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.730
 Christmas you have already seen that they are very 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.920
 easy to make and delicious 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.840
