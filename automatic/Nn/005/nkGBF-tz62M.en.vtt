00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.640

 so the first gift I go 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.970
 To show you, it's a case that I 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.460
 my boyfriend and that was super cute 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.829
 I loved this crisis and it's one of the things 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.720
 More special because it's from my boyfriend. 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.670
 nor is she very much like the mini girl 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.399
 transparent double sides and white 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.470
 the front is acrylic is completely 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.480
 hard then type new command over it 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.960
 different from the one I got here from my 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.300
 father who is a whole line her whole 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.460
 foldable and protects to oversize this 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.270
 does not protect because I'm staying 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.140

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.110

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.240

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.850
 this business around then snakes 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.520
 enough has a very good coverage and 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.280
 I can have the price from here because 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.119

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:22.470

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:26.189
 And that one from here was 25 with 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:30.090

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.710
 and here is the shampoo and conditioner and 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.439
 this very good line I have not used 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.390
 She and I think it's helping the 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.759
 My hair is moisturizing and it keeps getting 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.860
 with the very beautiful shine very scared 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.430
 even he in addition to leaving super hair 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.220
 hydrated it hydrates 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.290
 deep in hydrates at the time and stayed 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.790
 treating throughout the day 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.259
 I'll make a later review of the 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:04.020

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:08.670

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.790
 This gloss of color trim and taste 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.040
 tutti frutti and is very good because it leaves 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.140
 the lips all together between the day's goal 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.920
 that leaves lips full type of 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.080
 culture knows that everything is very dry 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.900
 and it's really tasty and has a child 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.209

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.870
 Who is this one of the nature of my life? 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:55.980
 what is a body cream is natura 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:03:03.320
 every day is soap 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:03.320
 so I can not tell if it's good or bad 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:32.910
 also that skirt I won those two 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:40.290

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:55.230
 This one that opens like this and here too 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:59.910
 because I got her this wallet from my 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:02.340
 Mom was really in need of a wallet. 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.940
 and everywhere I went I went in and saw 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:09.540
 a wallet I practically took away 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:12.239
 because it was so yuck 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.880
 Then Mom said to wait to buy 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:19.229
 because at the beginning what to tell 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:22.310

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:25.950
 I have some things who you are. 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.200
 it is to open at this stage there for 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.430

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.580

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.530

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.260
 finding super large lets was the 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.440
 My mother bought it on the boat. 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:45.450
 So if you want Spanish then 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.100
 last and not least is 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.380

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.710
 anxious to win I was super kind 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.640
 even to get here is my iphone 5 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.260
 and if it's like this 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.930
 It was taking too long because my father brought 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:10.230
 united states and my gray with 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:13.590
 white 16 and it's from there that I recorded 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.900
 with him then but then when I 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.090
 I got a camera to show your home and 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.030
 You will see in this period are practical 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:24.630

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:26.250

 I hope you liked it was a 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.900

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.600
 without asking the channel and gives you liked 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.110
