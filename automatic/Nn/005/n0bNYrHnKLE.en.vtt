make it more cool so this flying cap it
now<00:00:11.340> normally<00:00:11.910> you<00:00:12.030> can't<00:00:12.210> do<00:00:12.360> this<00:00:12.509> you<00:00:12.780> have

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
now normally you can't do this you have

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.910 
now normally you can't do this you have
to<00:00:13.200> have<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.440> block<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:14.089> blow<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.150> carpet

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
to have a block I blow the carpet

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.090 
to have a block I blow the carpet
otherwise<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.130> will<00:00:17.220> just<00:00:17.279> despawn<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:19.100> at

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
otherwise it will just despawn and at

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.830 
otherwise it will just despawn and at
not<00:00:20.279> be<00:00:20.400> spawned<00:00:20.730> fall<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.300> as<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.720> can<00:00:21.810> see

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
not be spawned fall and as you can see

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.390 
not be spawned fall and as you can see
here<00:00:22.140> some<00:00:22.260> other<00:00:22.439> examples<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.070> carpet

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
here some other examples of the carpet

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.890 
here some other examples of the carpet
flowing<00:00:24.050> so<00:00:25.050> in<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.710> past<00:00:26.689> don't<00:00:27.689> know<00:00:27.810> where

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
flowing so in the past don't know where

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.349 
flowing so in the past don't know where
you<00:00:27.960> could<00:00:28.050> build<00:00:28.199> up<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.920> or<00:00:29.160> not<00:00:29.340> but<00:00:30.150> now

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
you could build up is it or not but now

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.799 
you could build up is it or not but now
you<00:00:30.990> break<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:32.040> happens<00:00:32.600> okay<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.530> I

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
you break that that happens okay so I

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.080 
you break that that happens okay so I
find<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.840> way<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.350> make<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.739> by<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.399> it's<00:00:38.910> very

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
find a way to make it by this it's very

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.420 
find a way to make it by this it's very
glitch<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:40.350> chances<00:00:40.770> are<00:00:40.920> it's<00:00:41.129> going<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.340> get

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
glitch so chances are it's going to get

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:49.959 
glitch so chances are it's going to get
patched<00:00:42.440> but<00:00:43.850> if<00:00:44.850> you've<00:00:45.090> seen<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:46.820> set<00:00:47.820> flings

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
patched but if you've seen a set flings

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.869 
patched but if you've seen a set flings
one<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.059> these<00:00:51.180> videos<00:00:51.420> recently<00:00:52.579> you<00:00:53.579> showed

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
one of these videos recently you showed

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.580 
one of these videos recently you showed
how<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.120> make<00:00:54.360> flight<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.750> grapple<00:00:55.020> now<00:00:55.469> this

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
how to make flight and grapple now this

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.500 
how to make flight and grapple now this
follows<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> exact<00:00:56.460> same<00:00:56.699> concept<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> exact

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
follows the exact same concept the exact

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.010 
follows the exact same concept the exact
same<00:00:57.890> wait<00:00:59.000> so<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.390> see<00:01:00.539> here<00:01:00.660> got<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
same wait so you see here got the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.590 
same wait so you see here got the
floating<00:01:01.350> carpet<00:01:01.920> if<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:03.030> want<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.210> recreate

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
floating carpet if we want to recreate

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.980 
floating carpet if we want to recreate
that<00:01:03.750> over<00:01:03.960> here<00:01:04.110> what<00:01:04.890> we're<00:01:05.040> going<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.220> do

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
but what we're gonna do we're going to

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.039 
but what we're gonna do we're going to
recreate<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.909> can<00:01:08.939> talk<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.990> can

recreate this and you can talk you can

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.140 
recreate this and you can talk you can
touch<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.290> yourself<00:01:10.680> from<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.850> know<00:01:11.939> makes

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
touch it yourself from you know makes

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.550 
touch it yourself from you know makes
them<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> lot<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.140> we're<00:01:13.380> going<00:01:13.439> to

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
them a lot of this so we're going to

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.080 
them a lot of this so we're going to
recreate<00:01:13.950> something<00:01:14.250> like<00:01:14.490> something<00:01:14.970> like

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
recreate something like something like

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.700 
recreate something like something like
this<00:01:15.470> just<00:01:16.470> know<00:01:17.400> when<00:01:18.060> you're<00:01:18.180> doing<00:01:18.420> a

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
this just know when you're doing a

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.710 
this just know when you're doing a
design<00:01:19.710> like<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.340> recommend<00:01:21.060> starting<00:01:21.420> at

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
design like this I recommend starting at

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.350 
design like this I recommend starting at
the<00:01:21.930> highest<00:01:22.409> top<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.159> going<00:01:23.490> down<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.939> being

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
the highest top and going down and being

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.670 
the highest top and going down and being
careful<00:01:24.570> with<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.869> water<00:01:25.080> because<00:01:25.409> as<00:01:25.530> soon

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
careful with the water because as soon

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.830 
careful with the water because as soon
as<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.950> place<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.220> block<00:01:26.490> here<00:01:26.549> here<00:01:27.540> or<00:01:27.570> here

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
as you place a block here here or here

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.539 
as you place a block here here or here
it's<00:01:28.560> going<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.770> update<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.220> that's<00:01:29.340> going<00:01:29.490> to

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
it's going to update and that's going to

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.569 
it's going to update and that's going to
fall<00:01:30.470> alright<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:31.829> if<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:31.979> put<00:01:32.130> water<00:01:32.280> there

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
fall alright so if I put water there

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.830 
fall alright so if I put water there
it's<00:01:32.790> going<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.970> update<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.240> block<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.810> that

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
it's going to update that block and that

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.590 
it's going to update that block and that
block<00:01:34.110> will<00:01:34.259> fall<00:01:34.939> so<00:01:35.939> just<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.180> careful<00:01:36.329> with

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
block will fall so just be careful with

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.560 
block will fall so just be careful with
that<00:01:37.130> anyway<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.460> we're<00:01:39.240> going<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.420> place

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
that anyway so we're going to place

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.850 
that anyway so we're going to place
water<00:01:39.920> water<00:01:40.920> place<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> lily<00:01:42.240> pad<00:01:42.680> and<00:01:43.680> then

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
water water place a lily pad and then

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.710 
water water place a lily pad and then
we're<00:01:43.979> going<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.130> place<00:01:44.340> our<00:01:44.460> carpet<00:01:44.880> now<00:01:45.570> what

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720

that's gonna this block isn't gonna

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.100 
that's gonna this block isn't gonna
update<00:01:54.369> so<00:01:55.240> this<00:01:55.390> doesn't<00:01:55.420> recognize<00:01:55.930> there's

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
anyone I should update the blocks I

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.860 
anyone I should update the blocks I

don't think I've seen anyone do this and

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.420 
don't think I've seen anyone do this and
maybe<00:03:09.870> this<00:03:10.049> is<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.230> first<00:03:10.470> time<00:03:10.680> like<00:03:11.159> I<00:03:11.250> say

maybe this is the first time like I say

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
maybe this is the first time like I say
it<00:03:11.549> follows<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.879> same<00:03:12.030> concept<00:03:12.569> as<00:03:14.450> Seth

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
it follows the same concept as Seth

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
that method got my knees video basically

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.849 
that method got my knees video basically
rather<00:03:27.780> than<00:03:27.870> putting<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.200> carpet<00:03:28.500> they<00:03:28.590> put

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
a piece of gravel and then gravel is

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.410 
a piece of gravel and then gravel is
going<00:03:30.299> to<00:03:30.359> flow<00:03:32.000> but<00:03:33.000> that's<00:03:33.120> gonna<00:03:33.239> be<00:03:33.329> it
