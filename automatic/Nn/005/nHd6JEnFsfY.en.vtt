of the best central defenders in the
league<00:01:43.310> this<00:01:43.430> season<00:01:43.670> while<00:01:43.909> that<00:01:44.090> was<00:01:44.540> an

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
league this season while that was an

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.060 
league this season while that was an
absolute<00:01:44.930> still<00:01:45.170> more<00:01:45.320> penalty<00:01:45.680> wasn't<00:01:45.920> it

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
absolute still more penalty wasn't it

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.820 
absolute still more penalty wasn't it
yeah<00:01:46.490> it<00:01:46.940> was<00:01:47.360> I<00:01:47.510> mean<00:01:47.540> I<00:01:47.960> fell<00:01:48.470> from<00:01:48.590> a<00:01:48.650> little

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
yeah it was I mean I fell from a little

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.010 
yeah it was I mean I fell from a little
big<00:01:48.950> so<00:01:49.100> I<00:01:49.310> think<00:01:49.520> can<00:01:49.910> be<00:01:50.630> great<00:01:50.840> term

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
big so I think can be great term

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.620 
big so I think can be great term
berahino<00:01:51.740> almost<00:01:52.190> more<00:01:52.340> gummy<00:01:52.790> got<00:01:53.060> screaming

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
berahino almost more gummy got screaming

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.749 
berahino almost more gummy got screaming
behind<00:01:54.050> Gary<00:01:54.320> Cahill<00:01:54.710> and<00:01:54.890> I<00:01:55.010> think<00:01:55.190> Terry<00:01:55.550> had

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
behind Gary Cahill and I think Terry had

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.550 
behind Gary Cahill and I think Terry had
nothing<00:01:56.180> really<00:01:56.330> but<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:56.570> try<00:01:57.229> to<00:01:57.259> make<00:01:57.500> a

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
nothing really but to try to make a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.170 
nothing really but to try to make a
challenge<00:01:57.950> but<00:01:58.130> you're<00:01:58.640> never<00:01:58.759> gonna<00:01:58.970> get<00:01:59.090> to

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
challenge but you're never gonna get to

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.719 
challenge but you're never gonna get to
the<00:01:59.240> ball<00:01:59.450> the<00:02:00.140> most<00:02:00.290> no<00:02:00.410> one<00:02:00.560> comes<00:02:00.710> in<00:02:00.890> you

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
the ball the most no one comes in you

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.340 
the ball the most no one comes in you
could<00:02:01.880> argue<00:02:01.970> that<00:02:02.180> actually<00:02:02.720> came<00:02:02.960> in<00:02:03.080> the

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350

magnificent around he was a thought I

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.160 
magnificent around he was a thought I

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
put in the midst of all those some great

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.600 
put in the midst of all those some great

performers for our being great already
performance<00:02:23.090> but<00:02:23.150> I<00:02:23.239> thought<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.660> two<00:02:24.200> old

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
performance but I thought the two old

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.520 
performance but I thought the two old
stages<00:02:25.420> not<00:02:26.420> in<00:02:26.540> aged<00:02:26.690> 2<00:02:26.930> billion<00:02:27.290> tucking
