00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.000 

so<00:00:00.630> with<00:00:00.780> this<00:00:00.900> bumper<00:00:01.260> sticker<00:00:01.290> of<00:00:01.680> course<00:00:01.890> I

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
so with this bumper sticker of course I

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.010 
so with this bumper sticker of course I
got<00:00:02.159> asked<00:00:02.490> all<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.730> time<00:00:02.939> how<00:00:03.689> does<00:00:03.750> this

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
got asked all the time how does this

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.740 
got asked all the time how does this
grease<00:00:04.350> car<00:00:04.589> work<00:00:04.770> let<00:00:05.279> me<00:00:05.310> show<00:00:05.580> you<00:00:05.640> this<00:00:06.420> is

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
grease car work let me show you this is

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.039 
grease car work let me show you this is
a<00:00:07.350> 40<00:00:08.280> gallon<00:00:08.550> tank<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:11.570> as<00:00:12.570> you<00:00:12.900> can<00:00:12.990> see

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
a 40 gallon tank and as you can see

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.620 
a 40 gallon tank and as you can see
there's<00:00:13.530> where<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.250> oil<00:00:14.790> goes<00:00:15.179> into<00:00:15.420> the

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
there's where the oil goes into the

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.730 
there's where the oil goes into the
filtered<00:00:16.440> oil<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.150> gauge<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.289> tell

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
filtered oil this is the gauge to tell

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.519 
filtered oil this is the gauge to tell
me<00:00:19.859> how<00:00:19.980> much<00:00:20.100> oil<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:20.760> there<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.529> then

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
me how much oil is in there and then

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.630 
me how much oil is in there and then
over<00:00:22.769> here<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.369> pressure<00:00:24.090> release<00:00:24.510> valve<00:00:24.840> and

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
over here a pressure release valve and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.210 
over here a pressure release valve and
that<00:00:26.640> makes<00:00:26.880> sure<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.949> tank<00:00:28.949> doesn't

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
that makes sure that this tank doesn't

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.170 
that makes sure that this tank doesn't
get<00:00:29.490> too<00:00:29.869> pressurized<00:00:31.730> the<00:00:32.730> way<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.059> this

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
get too pressurized the way that this

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.209 
get too pressurized the way that this
system<00:00:33.390> works<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.320> basically<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.950> want

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
system works is that basically you want

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.250 
system works is that basically you want
this<00:00:35.579> vegetable<00:00:36.239> oil<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.630> be<00:00:36.780> as<00:00:36.870> hot<00:00:37.110> as

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
this vegetable oil to be as hot as

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.910 
this vegetable oil to be as hot as
possible

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
possible

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.780 
possible
before<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.000> gets<00:00:39.180> into<00:00:39.559> the<00:00:40.559> engine<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.760> that

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
before it gets into the engine so that

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.389 
before it gets into the engine so that
its<00:00:42.329> viscosity<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.680> way<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.920> atomized

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
its viscosity and the way it atomized

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.479 
its viscosity and the way it atomized
this<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.910> same<00:00:45.149> as<00:00:45.450> diesel<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.340> one<00:00:47.340> way

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
this is the same as diesel and one way

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.610 
this is the same as diesel and one way
to<00:00:47.520> do<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.360> use<00:00:48.480> waste<00:00:48.780> heat<00:00:49.050> from<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
to do that is to use waste heat from the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.639 
to do that is to use waste heat from the
engine<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.570> pipe<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.780> all<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.020> way<00:00:52.140> into

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
engine and pipe that all the way into

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.299 
engine and pipe that all the way into
this<00:00:53.070> external<00:00:53.699> tank<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:55.440> way<00:00:55.559> grease

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
this external tank and the way grease

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.670 
this external tank and the way grease
carter<00:00:56.670> has<00:00:56.879> designed<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.750> by<00:00:58.079> using<00:00:58.440> a

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
carter has designed that is by using a

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.220 
carter has designed that is by using a
hose<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.129> hose<00:00:59.280> design<00:01:00.270> where<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.629> coolant

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
hose and hose design where the coolant

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.910 
hose and hose design where the coolant
from<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.640> cools<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.030> engine<00:01:03.920> goes

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
from the that cools the engine goes

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.450 
from the that cools the engine goes
around<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.360> fuel<00:01:06.810> line<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:08.250> there's

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
around the fuel line and so there's

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.179 
around the fuel line and so there's
actually<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:09.060> fuel<00:01:09.420> line<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.840> goes<00:01:09.990> through

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
actually a fuel line that goes through

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.330 
actually a fuel line that goes through
this<00:01:11.189> coolant<00:01:11.580> line<00:01:11.810> into<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.840> tank<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.470> pick

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
this coolant line into the tank to pick

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.300 
this coolant line into the tank to pick
up<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.640> fuel<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:16.080> coolant<00:01:16.409> itself<00:01:16.799> runs

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
up the fuel and the coolant itself runs

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.210 
up the fuel and the coolant itself runs
in<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.700> tank<00:01:17.909> as<00:01:18.090> well<00:01:18.560> basically<00:01:19.560> there<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.100> a

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
in the tank as well basically there is a

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.990 
in the tank as well basically there is a
copper<00:01:20.880> coil<00:01:21.150> inside<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:22.020> tank<00:01:22.320> which<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.520> a

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
copper coil inside this tank which is a

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.200 
copper coil inside this tank which is a
good<00:01:24.659> way<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.869> transfer<00:01:25.470> heat<00:01:25.820> into<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
good way to transfer heat into the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.200 
good way to transfer heat into the
vegetable<00:01:27.930> oil<00:01:27.960> without<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:29.040> course<00:01:29.369> mixing

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
vegetable oil without of course mixing

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.660 
vegetable oil without of course mixing
the<00:01:30.390> coolant<00:01:30.750> with<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.290> vegetable<00:01:32.280> oil<00:01:32.400> so

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
the coolant with the vegetable oil so

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.520 
the coolant with the vegetable oil so
that<00:01:33.119> actually<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.630> closed<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.229> loop

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
that actually is a closed is a loop

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.219 
that actually is a closed is a loop
closed<00:01:35.280> loop<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.820> that's<00:01:35.909> not<00:01:36.150> going<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.390> mix

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
closed loop and that's not going to mix

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.670 
closed loop and that's not going to mix
up<00:01:37.439> with<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:37.979> fuel<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.960> runs<00:01:40.290> right

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
up with the fuel and so it runs right

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.330 
up with the fuel and so it runs right
into<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:42.299> tank<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.840> then<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.439> runs<00:01:43.590> out<00:01:43.950> back

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
into the tank and then it runs out back

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.630 
into the tank and then it runs out back
into<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.229> engine<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.979> gets<00:01:47.159> reheated

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
into the engine so that it gets reheated

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.060 
into the engine so that it gets reheated
and<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.909> just<00:01:48.119> keeps<00:01:48.360> cycling<00:01:48.840> through<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.350> so

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
and it just keeps cycling through and so

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.770 
and it just keeps cycling through and so
basically<00:01:50.460> you're<00:01:50.729> just<00:01:50.970> teeing<00:01:51.210> into<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
basically you're just teeing into the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.130 
basically you're just teeing into the
coolant<00:01:52.079> system<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:53.670> way<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.240> oil<00:01:54.270> gets

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
coolant system and that way the oil gets

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.679 
coolant system and that way the oil gets
hotter<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.590> hotter<00:01:56.299> so<00:01:57.299> here's<00:01:57.479> why<00:01:57.630> the

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
hotter and hotter so here's why the

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.590 
hotter and hotter so here's why the
coolant<00:01:58.320> hoses<00:01:58.500> with<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.280> fuel<00:01:59.520> line<00:01:59.700> inside

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
coolant hoses with the fuel line inside

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.620 
coolant hoses with the fuel line inside
of<00:02:00.719> them<00:02:00.840> goes<00:02:01.140> underneath<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.100> truck<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:03.390> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
of them goes underneath the truck to the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.920 
of them goes underneath the truck to the
front<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:05.100> ensures<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.659> fuel

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
front so this ensures that the fuel

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.380 
front so this ensures that the fuel
stays<00:02:07.200> hot<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:08.039> whole<00:02:08.220> way<00:02:08.429> from<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.149> tank

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
stays hot the whole way from the tank

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.900 
stays hot the whole way from the tank
all<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.780> way<00:02:09.899> up<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.560> injection

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
all the way up to the injection

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.180 
all the way up to the injection
and<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:12.690> here<00:02:12.990> this<00:02:13.200> is<00:02:13.260> where<00:02:13.620> one<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:13.980> the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
and so here this is where one of the

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.670 
and so here this is where one of the
coolant<00:02:14.880> lines<00:02:15.060> comes<00:02:15.840> into<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.500> goes

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
coolant lines comes into the and it goes

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.340 
coolant lines comes into the and it goes
around<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.700> fuel<00:02:21.030> filter<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.750> oil<00:02:21.960> fuel

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
around the fuel filter the oil fuel

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.470 
around the fuel filter the oil fuel
filter<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.980> as<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.030> can<00:02:24.150> see<00:02:26.000> here<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.210> fuel

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
filter and as you can see here the fuel

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.480 
filter and as you can see here the fuel
filter<00:02:27.810> has<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.990> temperature<00:02:28.800> gauge<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:29.340> that

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
filter has a temperature gauge so that

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.580 
filter has a temperature gauge so that
tells<00:02:29.670> me<00:02:29.880> how<00:02:30.000> hot<00:02:30.240> is<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.660> oil<00:02:30.900> inside<00:02:31.410> the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
tells me how hot is the oil inside the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.920 
tells me how hot is the oil inside the
fuel<00:02:31.850> filter<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:35.370> because<00:02:35.820> this<00:02:36.090> filter<00:02:36.510> here

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
fuel filter and because this filter here

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.190 
fuel filter and because this filter here
is<00:02:37.170> using<00:02:37.710> a<00:02:37.950> coolant<00:02:38.430> coil<00:02:38.930> that<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.170> a

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
is using a coolant coil that is a

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.740 
is using a coolant coil that is a
natural<00:02:40.530> way<00:02:40.950> using<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.730> waste<00:02:41.970> heat<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.420> the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
natural way using the waste heat of the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.220 
natural way using the waste heat of the
engine<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.410> heat<00:02:43.950> up<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.370> fuel<00:02:44.640> filter<00:02:45.230> now

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
engine to heat up this fuel filter now

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.460 
engine to heat up this fuel filter now
then<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:47.160> fuel<00:02:47.460> does<00:02:48.060> have<00:02:48.240> to<00:02:48.330> run<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.570> bit<00:02:48.870> you

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
then the fuel does have to run a bit you

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.250 
then the fuel does have to run a bit you
know<00:02:49.620> from<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.100> lift<00:02:50.580> pump<00:02:50.820> down<00:02:51.780> here<00:02:52.080> in<00:02:52.170> the

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
know from the lift pump down here in the

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.860 
know from the lift pump down here in the
bottom<00:02:52.410> I<00:02:52.620> use<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:52.950> lift<00:02:53.160> pump<00:02:53.360> to<00:02:54.360> draw<00:02:54.810> the

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
bottom I use the lift pump to draw the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.870 
bottom I use the lift pump to draw the
oil<00:02:55.460> towards<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:56.610> injector<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.650> then

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
oil towards the injector and then

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.640 
oil towards the injector and then
finally<00:02:59.880> I<00:03:00.090> have<00:03:00.390> what's<00:03:00.780> called<00:03:00.990> a<00:03:01.110> veg<00:03:01.290> therm

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
finally I have what's called a veg therm

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.570 
finally I have what's called a veg therm
and<00:03:01.970> that<00:03:02.970> is<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.620> electronically<00:03:04.620> heated<00:03:04.980> pipe

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
and that is a electronically heated pipe

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.200 
and that is a electronically heated pipe
basically<00:03:06.440> that<00:03:07.440> make<00:03:07.980> sure<00:03:08.190> that<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:09.030> oil

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
basically that make sure that the oil

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.850 
basically that make sure that the oil
that's<00:03:09.510> going<00:03:09.870> into<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.200> injectors<00:03:10.650> is

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
that's going into the injectors is

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.950 
that's going into the injectors is
really<00:03:11.220> really<00:03:11.400> hot<00:03:11.640> because<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.690> may<00:03:12.810> have

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
really really hot because it may have

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.360 
really really hot because it may have
cooled<00:03:13.200> off<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.470> little<00:03:13.770> bit<00:03:14.010> especially

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
cooled off a little bit especially

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.760 
cooled off a little bit especially
during<00:03:14.820> really<00:03:15.030> cold<00:03:15.300> days<00:03:15.510> may<00:03:16.410> have<00:03:16.530> cooled

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
during really cold days may have cooled

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.240 
during really cold days may have cooled
off<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.160> little<00:03:17.460> bit<00:03:17.610> from<00:03:18.020> the<00:03:19.020> the<00:03:19.710> lift<00:03:20.010> pump

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
off a little bit from the the lift pump

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.760 
off a little bit from the the lift pump
all<00:03:20.550> the<00:03:20.580> way<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.780> injector<00:03:22.200> pump<00:03:22.410> and

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
all the way to the injector pump and

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.420 
all the way to the injector pump and
then<00:03:23.670> there's<00:03:23.850> these<00:03:24.000> two<00:03:24.140> solenoids<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.620> one

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
then there's these two solenoids and one

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.470 
then there's these two solenoids and one
make<00:03:26.670> sure<00:03:26.910> that<00:03:27.210> you<00:03:27.360> switch<00:03:27.780> from<00:03:28.130> diesel<00:03:29.130> to

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
make sure that you switch from diesel to

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.050 
make sure that you switch from diesel to
veg<00:03:30.480> tomorrow<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.530> other<00:03:31.680> one<00:03:31.920> is<00:03:32.730> for

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
veg tomorrow and the other one is for

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.880 
veg tomorrow and the other one is for
the<00:03:33.120> return<00:03:33.270> line<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:33.930> make<00:03:34.050> sure<00:03:34.110> that<00:03:34.650> when

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
the return line to make sure that when

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.580 
the return line to make sure that when
you<00:03:35.010> finish<00:03:35.310> off<00:03:35.610> at<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:35.970> end<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.270> day

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
you finish off at the end of the day

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.500 
you finish off at the end of the day
that<00:03:37.590> there's<00:03:37.800> no<00:03:38.100> vegetable<00:03:38.790> oil<00:03:38.880> left<00:03:39.240> in

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
that there's no vegetable oil left in

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.270 
that there's no vegetable oil left in
the<00:03:39.780> fuel<00:03:39.990> line's<00:03:40.260> going<00:03:40.830> towards<00:03:41.130> the

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
the fuel line's going towards the

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.310 
the fuel line's going towards the
injection<00:03:41.730> pump<00:03:41.970> so<00:03:42.420> that<00:03:42.600> it's<00:03:42.750> all<00:03:42.900> back<00:03:43.110> to

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
injection pump so that it's all back to

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.740 
injection pump so that it's all back to
diesel<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.910> so<00:03:44.910> that's<00:03:45.090> pretty<00:03:45.240> important

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
diesel and so that's pretty important

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.750 
diesel and so that's pretty important
and<00:03:46.160> it's<00:03:47.180> grounded<00:03:48.180> here<00:03:48.750> on<00:03:48.990> the<00:03:49.110> side

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
and it's grounded here on the side

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.140 
and it's grounded here on the side
because<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:51.030> do<00:03:51.180> not<00:03:51.300> ever<00:03:51.690> want<00:03:51.959> the

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
because you do not ever want the

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.560 
because you do not ever want the
solenoids<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.450> get<00:03:54.630> ungrounded<00:03:55.170> and<00:03:55.920> not<00:03:56.130> work

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
solenoids to get ungrounded and not work

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.890 
solenoids to get ungrounded and not work
that<00:03:57.570> happened<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:58.020> me<00:03:58.140> so<00:03:59.420> and<00:04:00.420> then<00:04:00.540> finally

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
that happened to me so and then finally

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.770 
that happened to me so and then finally
I<00:04:00.990> have<00:04:01.200> a<00:04:01.700> pressure<00:04:02.700> gauge<00:04:02.970> here<00:04:03.360> that<00:04:03.570> just

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
I have a pressure gauge here that just

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.600 
I have a pressure gauge here that just
tells<00:04:03.990> me<00:04:04.170> when<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.740> filter<00:04:05.100> is<00:04:05.160> starting<00:04:05.550> to

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
tells me when the filter is starting to

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.630 
tells me when the filter is starting to
get<00:04:05.730> too<00:04:06.140> clogged<00:04:07.140> because<00:04:07.740> then<00:04:07.980> it's<00:04:08.340> harder

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
get too clogged because then it's harder

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.340 
get too clogged because then it's harder
and<00:04:08.670> harder<00:04:08.820> for<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:09.450> oil<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:09.870> get<00:04:10.020> through

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
and harder for the oil to get through

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.060 
and harder for the oil to get through
and<00:04:10.590> that<00:04:11.150> happens<00:04:12.150> in<00:04:12.300> my<00:04:12.450> case<00:04:12.690> about<00:04:13.500> once<00:04:13.920> a

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
and that happens in my case about once a

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.090 
and that happens in my case about once a
year<00:04:14.100> I've<00:04:14.550> change<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.240> filter<00:04:15.600> so<00:04:16.500> you<00:04:17.010> know

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
year I've change the filter so you know

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.460 
year I've change the filter so you know
three<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.489> five<00:04:17.670> thousand<00:04:18.060> miles<00:04:18.290> that's<00:04:19.290> when

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
three to five thousand miles that's when

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.210 
three to five thousand miles that's when
I<00:04:19.500> change<00:04:19.770> the<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:21.090> vegetable<00:04:21.780> oil<00:04:21.900> filter<00:04:22.320> so

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
I change the the vegetable oil filter so

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.129 
I change the the vegetable oil filter so
from<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.669> dashboard<00:04:23.910> here<00:04:24.630> in<00:04:24.810> the

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
from the dashboard here in the

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:26.899 
from the dashboard here in the
am<00:04:25.229> i<00:04:25.530> can<00:04:25.770> do<00:04:25.919> a<00:04:25.949> couple<00:04:26.280> of<00:04:26.340> things<00:04:26.550> I<00:04:26.729> can

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:26.909 
am i can do a couple of things I can

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:29.600 
am i can do a couple of things I can
turn<00:04:27.120> on<00:04:27.409> the<00:04:28.409> veg<00:04:28.620> theorem<00:04:29.039> which<00:04:29.249> allows

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
turn on the veg theorem which allows

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.600 
turn on the veg theorem which allows
that<00:04:29.909> last<00:04:30.389> little<00:04:30.629> boost<00:04:31.020> of<00:04:31.289> heat<00:04:31.830> so<00:04:32.520> it

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
that last little boost of heat so it

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.399 
that last little boost of heat so it
allows<00:04:32.789> me<00:04:32.939> to<00:04:33.060> switch<00:04:33.270> over<00:04:33.449> to<00:04:33.629> vegetable

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:34.409 
allows me to switch over to vegetable

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:37.159 
allows me to switch over to vegetable
oil<00:04:34.499> a<00:04:34.710> little<00:04:34.949> bit<00:04:35.069> quicker<00:04:35.249> and<00:04:35.900> then<00:04:36.900> here's

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
oil a little bit quicker and then here's

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.580 
oil a little bit quicker and then here's
the<00:04:37.229> fuel<00:04:37.590> gauge<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.300> here's<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.479> on<00:04:39.599> button

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
the fuel gauge and here's the on button

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.670 
the fuel gauge and here's the on button
for<00:04:41.069> switching<00:04:41.310> to<00:04:41.729> vegetable<00:04:42.240> oil<00:04:42.419> and<00:04:42.680> then

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
for switching to vegetable oil and then

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.749 
for switching to vegetable oil and then
the<00:04:43.860> purge<00:04:44.069> button<00:04:44.400> and<00:04:44.719> then<00:04:45.719> in<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:47.490> middle

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
the purge button and then in the middle

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.469 
the purge button and then in the middle
is<00:04:47.939> the<00:04:48.300> regular<00:04:49.020> going<00:04:49.529> back<00:04:49.680> to<00:04:49.830> diesel<00:04:50.039> and

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
is the regular going back to diesel and

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.779 
is the regular going back to diesel and
here<00:04:51.479> on<00:04:51.569> the<00:04:51.659> other<00:04:51.779> side<00:04:53.449> I've<00:04:54.449> got<00:04:55.050> the

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
here on the other side I've got the

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:58.700 
here on the other side I've got the
temperature<00:04:56.789> gauge<00:04:56.999> and<00:04:57.379> this<00:04:58.379> is<00:04:58.590> the

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
temperature gauge and this is the

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.659 
temperature gauge and this is the
temperature<00:04:59.099> of<00:04:59.400> the<00:05:00.139> fuel<00:05:01.139> by<00:05:02.069> the<00:05:02.129> time<00:05:02.460> it's

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
temperature of the fuel by the time it's

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.409 
temperature of the fuel by the time it's
in<00:05:03.050> the<00:05:04.050> fuel<00:05:04.830> filter<00:05:05.189> the<00:05:05.400> oil<00:05:05.639> filter<00:05:05.969> at<00:05:06.300> the

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
in the fuel filter the oil filter at the

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.010 
in the fuel filter the oil filter at the
front<00:05:06.770> so<00:05:07.770> that<00:05:08.699> gives<00:05:08.909> me<00:05:09.060> a<00:05:09.090> good<00:05:09.300> set<00:05:09.599> idea

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
front so that gives me a good set idea

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.670 
front so that gives me a good set idea
of<00:05:10.379> how<00:05:10.770> hot<00:05:11.009> the<00:05:11.219> fuel<00:05:11.460> is<00:05:11.699> and<00:05:12.029> then<00:05:12.960> I<00:05:13.349> can

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
of how hot the fuel is and then I can

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.379 
of how hot the fuel is and then I can
determine<00:05:13.949> whether<00:05:14.250> or<00:05:14.370> not<00:05:14.520> to<00:05:14.639> use<00:05:14.879> the

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
determine whether or not to use the

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.409 
determine whether or not to use the
vegetable<00:05:15.990> the<00:05:16.680> veg<00:05:16.830> through<00:05:17.129> to<00:05:17.909> boost<00:05:18.300> that

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
vegetable the veg through to boost that

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.709 
vegetable the veg through to boost that
fuel<00:05:18.900> temperature<00:05:19.620> or<00:05:20.400> just<00:05:20.849> you<00:05:21.389> know<00:05:21.479> once

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:21.719 
fuel temperature or just you know once

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:23.409 
fuel temperature or just you know once
it's<00:05:21.930> hot<00:05:22.080> enough<00:05:22.349> then<00:05:22.589> I<00:05:22.680> can<00:05:22.830> turn<00:05:23.009> this

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
it's hot enough then I can turn this

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.420 
it's hot enough then I can turn this
electronic<00:05:24.419> heat<00:05:24.629> thing<00:05:25.409> off<00:05:25.620> because<00:05:25.949> the

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
electronic heat thing off because the

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.149 
electronic heat thing off because the
motor<00:05:26.999> will<00:05:27.210> be<00:05:27.240> so<00:05:27.509> hot<00:05:27.749> and<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.770> fuel<00:05:28.979> will

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.159 
motor will be so hot and the fuel will

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:30.829 
motor will be so hot and the fuel will
be<00:05:29.279> hot<00:05:29.430> enough<00:05:29.580> to<00:05:29.759> where<00:05:30.270> I<00:05:30.300> don't<00:05:30.509> need<00:05:30.719> to

00:05:30.829 --> 00:05:30.839 
be hot enough to where I don't need to

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:34.429 
be hot enough to where I don't need to
worry<00:05:31.020> about<00:05:32.330> giving<00:05:33.330> it<00:05:33.569> an<00:05:33.689> extra<00:05:33.990> boost<00:05:34.199> in

00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:34.439 
worry about giving it an extra boost in

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:37.069 
worry about giving it an extra boost in
temperature
