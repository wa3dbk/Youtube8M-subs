00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
I switch now ain't got my flip-flops

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.970 
I switch now ain't got my flip-flops
because<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.459> have<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:30.000> stop<00:02:30.239> this<00:02:30.360> Lucario

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
because I have to stop this Lucario

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.979

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
goes for the ice punch and it was like

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.460 
goes for the ice punch and it was like
well<00:02:35.909> we<00:02:36.060> took<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.239> lot<00:02:36.510> but<00:02:36.780> it's<00:02:36.989> a<00:02:37.079> critical

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
well we took a lot but it's a critical

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.119 
well we took a lot but it's a critical
hit<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:37.890> not<00:02:38.459> that<00:02:38.489> word<00:02:39.319> am<00:02:40.319> I<00:02:40.560> going<00:02:40.799> for<00:02:41.040> the

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
hit so not that word am I going for the

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.740 
hit so not that word am I going for the
thunder<00:02:41.459> wave<00:02:41.579> right<00:02:41.940> now<00:02:42.120> he<00:02:42.180> goes<00:02:42.329> for<00:02:42.690> the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
thunder wave right now he goes for the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.270 
thunder wave right now he goes for the
extreme<00:02:43.079> speed<00:02:43.290> because<00:02:43.620> i<00:02:43.650> think<00:02:43.769> it's<00:02:44.129> the

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
extreme speed because i think it's the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.580 
extreme speed because i think it's the
only<00:02:44.549> thing<00:02:44.700> i<00:02:44.849> think<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.360> he<00:02:45.510> can<00:02:45.629> go<00:02:45.840> for

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
only thing i think that he can go for

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.289 
only thing i think that he can go for
the<00:02:46.709> neutral<00:02:47.160> damage<00:02:47.459> because<00:02:47.790> i'm<00:02:47.940> assuming

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
the neutral damage because i'm assuming

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.460 
the neutral damage because i'm assuming
I<00:02:48.890> sponge<00:02:49.890> fire<00:02:50.459> punch<00:02:50.940> xing<00:02:51.660> speed<00:02:52.049> close

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
I sponge fire punch xing speed close

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.559 
I sponge fire punch xing speed close
combat<00:02:52.859> or<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.549> boat<00:02:53.730> punch<00:02:54.060> i<00:02:54.209> really<00:02:54.390> don't

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569

know<00:02:54.629> but<00:02:55.079> if<00:02:55.440> he<00:02:55.650> has<00:02:55.829> the<00:02:55.950> both<00:02:56.129> punch<00:02:56.430> if<00:02:57.030> he

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
know but if he has the both punch if he

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.910 
know but if he has the both punch if he
has<00:02:57.299> extreme<00:02:57.690> speed<00:02:57.930> he<00:02:58.049> does<00:02:58.440> not<00:02:58.620> have<00:02:58.799> the

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
has extreme speed he does not have the

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.949 
has extreme speed he does not have the
bullet<00:02:59.129> punch<00:02:59.280> so<00:02:59.459> i<00:02:59.640> get<00:03:00.269> him<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.599> enter<00:03:00.690> waved

bullet punch so i get him to enter waved
an<00:03:01.170> extreme<00:03:01.560> speed<00:03:01.799> took<00:03:02.010> more<00:03:02.250> time<00:03:02.430> than<00:03:02.670> I

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
an extreme speed took more time than I

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.940 
an extreme speed took more time than I
thought<00:03:03.209> it<00:03:03.269> would<00:03:03.390> I<00:03:03.720> go<00:03:04.140> into<00:03:04.290> my<00:03:04.440> zapdos<00:03:04.799> now

live<00:03:22.109> an<00:03:22.319> extreme<00:03:22.950> speed<00:03:23.190> but<00:03:23.880> gets<00:03:24.359> now<00:03:24.569> the

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
live an extreme speed but gets now the

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.629 
live an extreme speed but gets now the
paralyzed<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.440> was<00:03:25.709> really<00:03:26.069> really<00:03:26.280> really

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
paralyzed it was really really really

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.580 
paralyzed it was really really really
really<00:03:26.790> lucky<00:03:27.359> because<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:28.019> thought<00:03:28.290> he<00:03:28.440> was

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
really lucky because I thought he was

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.140 
really lucky because I thought he was
going<00:03:28.769> for<00:03:28.859> the<00:03:29.069> sword<00:03:29.340> since<00:03:29.549> right<00:03:29.819> now<00:03:29.849> when

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
going for the sword since right now when

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.479 
going for the sword since right now when
a<00:03:30.269> plus<00:03:30.629> for<00:03:30.930> it<00:03:31.139> seems<00:03:31.379> he<00:03:31.530> was<00:03:31.620> was<00:03:32.129> going<00:03:32.370> to

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
a plus for it seems he was was going to

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.330 
a plus for it seems he was was going to
take<00:03:32.609> a<00:03:32.669> lot<00:03:32.879> so<00:03:33.569> he<00:03:33.599> gets<00:03:34.169> now<00:03:34.500> they<00:03:34.919> paralyze

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
take a lot so he gets now they paralyze

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.970 
take a lot so he gets now they paralyze
again<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.180> he<00:03:37.079> goes<00:03:37.260> out<00:03:37.410> for<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.590> extreme

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
again and he goes out for the extreme

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.949 
again and he goes out for the extreme
speed<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:38.489> does<00:03:38.940> not<00:03:39.120> take<00:03:39.180> that<00:03:39.540> much<00:03:39.599> because

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
speed it does not take that much because

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.890 
speed it does not take that much because
it's<00:03:40.290> only<00:03:40.650> plus<00:03:40.889> two<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.430> will<00:03:42.269> be<00:03:42.419> able<00:03:42.599> to

the u-turn right now my Ralph can
resisted<00:04:06.030> but<00:04:06.209> it<00:04:06.329> took<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:06.540> lot<00:04:06.870> after<00:04:07.859> the

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
resisted but it took a lot after the

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.180 
resisted but it took a lot after the
stealth<00:04:08.280> rocks<00:04:08.579> and<00:04:08.819> I<00:04:09.540> had<00:04:10.019> my<00:04:10.319> infinite<00:04:11.040> to

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
stealth rocks and I had my infinite to

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.180 
stealth rocks and I had my infinite to
take<00:04:11.430> that<00:04:11.730> better<00:04:12.299> but<00:04:13.049> my<00:04:13.560> infinite<00:04:13.980> does

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
take that better but my infinite does

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.270 
take that better but my infinite does
not<00:04:14.370> have<00:04:14.639> anything<00:04:15.030> to<00:04:15.750> hit<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.680> salamence

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
not have anything to hit the salamence

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.729 
not have anything to hit the salamence
or<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.669> togekiss<00:04:18.030> if<00:04:18.599> he<00:04:18.959> had<00:04:19.139> gone<00:04:19.320> for<00:04:19.620> the

one hit KO because i think it's a

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310 
thought it was going to take a little

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.880 
thought it was going to take a little
more<00:06:57.640> and<00:06:58.120> you<00:06:58.240> will<00:06:58.360> see<00:06:58.660> it<00:06:58.930> does<00:06:59.290> not<00:06:59.530> take

00:06:59.880 --> 00:06:59.890 
more and you will see it does not take

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.810 
more and you will see it does not take
half<00:07:00.610> of<00:07:00.790> my<00:07:01.000> HP<00:07:01.420> so<00:07:02.170> because<00:07:03.130> my<00:07:03.280> slowbro<00:07:03.640> it's

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:03.820 
half of my HP so because my slowbro it's

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.300 
half of my HP so because my slowbro it's
not<00:07:04.030> my<00:07:04.300> the<00:07:04.750> physical<00:07:05.410> special<00:07:05.890> defensive

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:06.310 
not my the physical special defensive

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.340

guy<00:07:07.030> but<00:07:07.300> he<00:07:07.450> has<00:07:07.660> a<00:07:07.690> special<00:07:08.170> of<00:07:08.230> the

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:08.350

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.350 
guy but he has a special of the
defensive<00:07:08.770> stat<00:07:09.430> pretty<00:07:09.730> high<00:07:09.940> and<00:07:10.180> think

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360 
defensive stat pretty high and think

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.690 
defensive stat pretty high and think
it's<00:07:10.510> almost<00:07:10.900> 200<00:07:11.440> without<00:07:11.620> any<00:07:12.100> investment

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:12.700 
it's almost 200 without any investment
