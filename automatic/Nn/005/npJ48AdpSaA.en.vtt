00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.900
 Hello everyone, they reminded me that I was 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.330
 channel still not covered 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.099
 water lift and so the topic of today 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.740
 the lesson will be my version of such a mechanism 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.749
 what kind of mechanism does it allow 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.089
 smoothly enough to go down with 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:21.919
 water at any depth let's check 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:24.079
 his action comes here here under 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:26.329
 we get water and go smooth 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.890
 downhill descent after ended 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.569
 water automatically disappears 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.489
 well now let's get such a mechanism 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:33.559
 let's build build here in this wall 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.809
 we will need a gap of three blocks 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.910
 width here will be our 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.260
 hatch retreat one block depth and 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.640
 install sticky piston 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.949
 aiming here 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.440
 next we need to put one block here 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.809
 here and set the red torch then 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.370
 a piece of roadstone and one block up here 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.589
 here and one block here 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.390
 set repeat and one click 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.640
 delays on this opening mechanism 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.530
 hatch we finished goes to the mechanism 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.109
 which spills water set 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.109
 distributor over here let's close right away 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.570
 all around the edges like this then set 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:07.700
 block here is another block 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.950
 install below here and on it 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.010
 sticky plunger pointing up one 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.710
 unit drove on piston repeater further 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.410
 block right here two blocks down one level 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.990
 here and two more blocks like this 2 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.970
 repeater here and here on one of 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.770
 repeaters set the delay to 3 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.480
 crack and that is a full pave 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.670
 redstone right here and all that to us 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.070
 it remains to put in our distributor 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.320
 a bucket of water and make an activation scheme 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.480
 to activate i use stretching she 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.400
 is set above the level of hands 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.980
 that is like this and let's put it here 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.870
 The thread here is the mechanism completely ready 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.420
 to simplify working with the mechanism 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.460
 incomplete blocks can be placed at the edges 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.680
 ie here and here not to 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.610
 interfere with stretching how it works 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.560
 this mechanism 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.000
 Well, this part is very simple when 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.010
 we have this stretch signal 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.290
 horse high latency turns off 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.510
 the red torch moves in our porridge and 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.950
 opens space right here with 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.720
 the other side is located 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.670
 short pulse generator signal 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.410
 passes here it turns out short 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.929
 a signal that is small 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.000
 arrives at our surrender who allows 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.560
 pour out the water and take it back 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.540
 let's check it in 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.790
 shame comes under us water appears 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.200
 and we go down some of you 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.480
 that may be much simpler 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.940
 place deep ponds with water on 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.980
 we need the depth however this scheme 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.959
 there is one advantage since 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.090
 descent goes very smoothly we can 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.500
 go out at different depths that is possible 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.540
 make a few outs and 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.489
 need not go down to the very end 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.830
 in any case, I hope that this scheme 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.410
 you liked it and that's it for today 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.970
 thank you very much for your attention do not forget
