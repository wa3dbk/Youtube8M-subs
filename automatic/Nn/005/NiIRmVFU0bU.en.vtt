huh

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.630 

son<00:03:22.080> so<00:03:22.319> bright<00:03:22.530> out<00:03:22.709> here<00:03:22.890> I<00:03:22.920> can't<00:03:23.190> even<00:03:23.310> see

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
son so bright out here I can't even see

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.640 
son so bright out here I can't even see
my<00:03:23.790> camera

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.460 

I<00:03:26.709> think<00:03:27.280> what<00:03:27.459> I'll<00:03:27.579> do<00:03:27.760> is<00:03:27.790> I'll<00:03:28.150> take<00:03:28.599> this

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
I think what I'll do is I'll take this

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.869 
I think what I'll do is I'll take this
all<00:03:29.680> apart<00:03:29.709> but<00:03:30.280> basically<00:03:30.790> you've<00:03:30.970> got<00:03:31.000> this

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
all apart but basically you've got this

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.960 
all apart but basically you've got this
expanded<00:03:33.879> metal<00:03:34.090> stuff<00:03:34.540> here<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:36.670> I'll<00:03:36.760> be

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
expanded metal stuff here and I'll be

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.690 
expanded metal stuff here and I'll be
the<00:03:37.090> first<00:03:37.329> thing<00:03:37.510> that<00:03:37.629> comes<00:03:37.810> up<00:03:38.549> then<00:03:39.549> I've

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
the first thing that comes up then I've

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.270 
the first thing that comes up then I've
got<00:03:39.909> some<00:03:40.319> carpet<00:03:41.400> up<00:03:42.400> further<00:03:42.730> I've<00:03:42.970> got<00:03:43.150> some

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
got some carpet up further I've got some

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.470 
got some carpet up further I've got some
cheap<00:03:45.280> rubber<00:03:45.549> matting<00:03:45.849> I<00:03:46.030> bought<00:03:46.239> from

I<00:04:31.339> haven't<00:04:32.119> Pam<00:04:32.329> Mills<00:04:32.599> concentrates<00:04:33.289> yet

00:04:33.549 --> 00:04:33.559 
I haven't Pam Mills concentrates yet

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:35.499 
I haven't Pam Mills concentrates yet
hopefully<00:04:34.099> this<00:04:34.249> is<00:04:34.369> the<00:04:34.399> one<00:04:34.639> but<00:04:34.879> so<00:04:35.269> far<00:04:35.449> I

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
hopefully this is the one but so far I

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:40.040 
hopefully this is the one but so far I
haven't<00:04:35.749> had<00:04:35.929> too<00:04:36.169> much<00:04:36.409> luck

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.990 

think<00:04:40.320> I'll<00:04:40.500> just<00:04:40.889> start<00:04:41.220> running<00:04:41.460> a<00:04:41.669> bunch<00:04:41.850> of

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
think I'll just start running a bunch of

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.140 
think I'll just start running a bunch of
dirt<00:04:43.070> put<00:04:44.070> all<00:04:44.160> the<00:04:44.250> concentrates<00:04:44.880> in<00:04:45.060> a

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
dirt put all the concentrates in a

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.930 
dirt put all the concentrates in a
plastic<00:04:45.840> bag<00:04:46.110> or<00:04:46.440> a<00:04:46.500> bucket<00:04:47.009> and<00:04:47.220> take<00:04:47.789> them

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
plastic bag or a bucket and take them

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.719 
plastic bag or a bucket and take them
all<00:04:48.090> home<00:04:48.120> and<00:04:48.630> run<00:04:48.750> them<00:04:48.870> so<00:04:49.050> I<00:04:49.080> can<00:04:49.610> run<00:04:50.610> the

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
all home and run them so I can run the

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.969 
all home and run them so I can run the
max<00:04:50.940> amount<00:04:51.150> of<00:04:51.449> dirt<00:04:51.630> instead<00:04:51.900> of<00:04:52.139> sitting

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
max amount of dirt instead of sitting

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.140 
max amount of dirt instead of sitting
here<00:04:53.130> running<00:04:53.280> my<00:04:53.580> concentrates<00:04:54.300> so<00:04:55.970> this<00:04:56.970> may

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
here running my concentrates so this may

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.790 
here running my concentrates so this may
end<00:04:57.180> up<00:04:57.419> being<00:04:57.570> a<00:04:57.750> two-part<00:04:58.169> video<00:04:58.500> if<00:04:58.650> it

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
end up being a two-part video if it

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.529 
end up being a two-part video if it
doesn't<00:04:59.190> end<00:04:59.250> up<00:04:59.370> being<00:04:59.639> too<00:04:59.850> long<00:05:00.060> I'll<00:05:00.300> put

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
doesn't end up being too long I'll put

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:06.260 
doesn't end up being too long I'll put
it<00:05:00.660> in<00:05:00.690> one<00:05:00.930> but<00:05:02.210> it<00:05:03.210> may<00:05:03.539> be<00:05:03.600> two<00:05:04.050> parts<00:05:05.270> we'll

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
it in one but it may be two parts we'll

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.960 
it in one but it may be two parts we'll
see<00:05:06.660> in<00:05:06.870> a<00:05:06.990> little<00:05:07.020> bit<00:05:07.550> well<00:05:08.550> there's<00:05:08.789> the

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
see in a little bit well there's the

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.600 
see in a little bit well there's the
hole<00:05:09.330> I've<00:05:09.570> been<00:05:09.750> digging<00:05:10.080> at<00:05:10.430> get<00:05:11.430> about

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
hole I've been digging at get about

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:18.369 
hole I've been digging at get about
three<00:05:11.970> more<00:05:12.120> cleanups<00:05:13.099> but<00:05:14.099> it's<00:05:15.380> certain

00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:18.379 
three more cleanups but it's certain

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:21.820 
three more cleanups but it's certain
get<00:05:18.830> darker<00:05:19.279> here<00:05:20.110> probably<00:05:21.110> oughta<00:05:21.349> start

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
get darker here probably oughta start

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.390 
get darker here probably oughta start
cleaning<00:05:22.249> up

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.500 

so<00:05:24.910> I<00:05:25.000> can<00:05:25.210> take<00:05:26.169> these<00:05:27.300> concentrates<00:05:28.300> back

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
so I can take these concentrates back

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.610 
so I can take these concentrates back
home<00:05:29.310> start<00:05:30.310> processing<00:05:31.300> those<00:05:31.660> and<00:05:32.080> see<00:05:32.410> if<00:05:32.500> I

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
home start processing those and see if I

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.490 
home start processing those and see if I
can't<00:05:32.860> get<00:05:33.010> a<00:05:33.070> video<00:05:33.400> out<00:05:35.100> ASAP<00:05:37.199> get<00:05:38.199> a<00:05:38.229> little

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
can't get a video out ASAP get a little

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.310 
can't get a video out ASAP get a little
chilly<00:05:38.650> so<00:05:38.830> I<00:05:39.040> started<00:05:39.400> a<00:05:39.430> little<00:05:39.550> fire

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
chilly so I started a little fire

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.920 
chilly so I started a little fire
figured<00:05:41.320> I'd<00:05:41.410> put<00:05:41.830> that<00:05:42.010> in<00:05:42.130> the<00:05:42.190> video<00:05:42.460> too

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.659 

well<00:05:46.930> I<00:05:46.960> finished<00:05:47.320> running<00:05:47.740> all<00:05:47.979> the<00:05:48.130> material

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
gold in the pan and it was fun getting

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.080 
gold in the pan and it was fun getting
out<00:05:58.510> there<00:05:58.750> on<00:05:58.900> the<00:05:58.990> river<00:05:59.639> but<00:06:00.639> maybe<00:06:00.850> next

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
out there on the river but maybe next

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.480
