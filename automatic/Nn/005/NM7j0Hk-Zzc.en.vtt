00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:22.800
 Hello, I present to you my 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.670
 next job here before i 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.720
 actually I would like to show 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:35.190
 talk about how it is at all 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:41.190
 I probably had a lot of people know 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:43.640
 who watched before my especially first 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.640
 videos 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.579
 this mentioned that the first 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.930
 directly to the video I shot the camera 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.629
 which I took from a friend right now I bought 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.399
 their respective other chamber gave 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.090
 Nevertheless, he told me very much in his time 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:09.540
 Well you can say it did not want to help 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:14.189
 did something for him too in response he 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:20.480
 also a lover of the model which of you that he 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:25.780
 doesn't like to collect them 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:29.300
 does not like to paint well, love what they are 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.800
 the only thing that he collects it so 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.710
 called models with an assembly without glue 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:41.210
 here on again without painting 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:43.490
 Well, that as I said made 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.360
 let's say so to him in response to something that is not good 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:52.310
 I don't have one model room for him 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:57.140
 painted in general now i will show you that 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.610
 It turned out but for the beginning at the show I will 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.560
 use this stand 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.940
 I thought that he was already very dirty having 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.950
 somehow uncomfortable to show on it 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:12.200
 so I come up with such a thing from 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:15.620
 paper on time puller filming it will be 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.130
 shut down so here itself 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.130
 model 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.690
 please immediately 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.990
 I do not want to ask you much not 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:31.850
 to criticize first is the triac 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:35.180
 scale I'm not very friendly with him let's say 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:40.880
 so in the second it technology i 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:45.680
 I used for the first time in general, that there's a 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:51.290
 model if fake a little bit 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.680
 try to focus closer and where 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.340
 her 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.340
 Well, something like this 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.470
 from what I did here exactly 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.000
 models in principle almost nothing 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.870
 do 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.120
 drilled barrel you can see here 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:21.830
 now wait a second go yes there 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:25.720
 trunk hole here in my opinion i 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:31.190
 I think hardly anyone will then argue 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:34.370
 barrel with a hole to win much in 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.579
 the visual plan rather than the trunk without 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:44.590
 holes he made another antenna 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:44.590
 and there was no drilled nipples 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:54.430
 exhaust again they were not easy 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.989
 were half full 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.900
 the hole was n't and it looked too and it didn't 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.010
 very good the only thing that I probably 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.650
 did not 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:08.180
 I confess honestly I just forgot the project 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:11.720
 it is the cables at first they were generally 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.510
 here are not the most successful I will postpone them 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.539
 Aside, and in general, I forgot, but now 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.120
 do the media seems too late well 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:24.139
 actually say something more especially 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:27.020
 you don't forget anything it's 72 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:31.190
 scale detail for scale 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:36.590
 weak yes and if someone will 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:41.000
 make yourself these models here without glue 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:43.849
 build if you want it to you 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.880
 the guys kept glue them because 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:49.669
 they are still not very good 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.430
 falling apart and stuff like that is 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.599
 The first thing I did when I brought me 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.750
 all her taped 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:58.669
 top to bottom well except that 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.430
 the tower the tower continues to spin 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:05.010
 will say 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:10.700
 no, that's what I got 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:16.590
 snow I don't know the twigs planted so for 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:19.680
 so that at least the devil was for the entourage did 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:24.630
 I snow for the first time how it happened here the seams are not 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:28.230
 write in principle it seems to me 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:32.910
 a little brute force on technology but on the other 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:36.300
 hand i don't like but how do you 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.390
 write in the comments here actually 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.390
 everything 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:46.729
 Thanks again and Garik for the camera 

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:53.439
 which the guys gave you thanks for 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:53.439
 what are you looking at?
