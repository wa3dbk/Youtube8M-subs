00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.569 
maintain that beauty that beautiful
aesthetics<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.379> doesn't<00:00:46.680> really<00:00:46.829> change<00:00:46.980> much

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
aesthetics it doesn't really change much

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.060 
aesthetics it doesn't really change much
with<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.390> it's<00:00:48.870> form-fitting<00:00:49.230> doesn't

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
with it and it's form-fitting doesn't

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.010 
with it and it's form-fitting doesn't
add<00:00:50.190> much<00:00:50.219> bulk<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.180> maintains<00:00:51.750> this

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
add much bulk and maintains this

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.910 
add much bulk and maintains this
handsets<00:00:52.649> relatively<00:00:53.280> slim<00:00:53.550> profile<00:00:54.920> because

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
handsets relatively slim profile because

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.470 
handsets relatively slim profile because
they're<00:00:56.039> about<00:00:56.219> getting<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.699> display

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
they're about getting the display

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.139 
they're about getting the display
scratched<00:00:58.140> up<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:59.190> worth<00:00:59.460> noting<00:00:59.850> that<00:00:59.879> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
scratched up it's worth noting that the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.270 
scratched up it's worth noting that the
case<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.510> actually<00:01:00.899> raised<00:01:01.199> around<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.829> edges

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
case is actually raised around the edges

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.520 
case is actually raised around the edges
so<00:01:02.309> even<00:01:02.789> if<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.910> place<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.359> flat<00:01:03.629> down<00:01:03.660> it's

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
so even if you place it flat down it's

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.380 
so even if you place it flat down it's
not<00:01:04.650> gonna<00:01:04.830> come<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.070> contact<00:01:05.700> but<00:01:06.119> they<00:01:06.210> also

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
not gonna come to contact but they also

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.899 
not gonna come to contact but they also
include<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:07.080> free<00:01:07.470> screen<00:01:07.860> protector<00:01:07.890> with<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
packaging when it comes to protecting

the handset you get the bare minimum

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.929 
the handset you get the bare minimum
with<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.530> spigen<00:01:14.280> ultra<00:01:14.369> thin<00:01:14.729> air
