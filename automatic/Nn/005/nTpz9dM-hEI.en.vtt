my<00:02:08.250> right<00:02:08.610> side<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.819> my<00:02:08.910> body<00:02:08.970> and

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
my right side of my body and

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.040 
my right side of my body and
legs<00:02:10.130> ABS<00:02:10.280> everything<00:02:10.760> I<00:02:10.820> can<00:02:10.970> train<00:02:11.150> and<00:02:11.960> i

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
legs ABS everything I can train and i

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.240 
legs ABS everything I can train and i
think<00:02:12.260> that<00:02:12.380> i<00:02:12.410> think<00:02:12.440> has<00:02:12.650> some<00:02:12.890> effect<00:02:13.160> on

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
think that i think has some effect on

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.650 
think that i think has some effect on
their<00:02:13.460> inter<00:02:14.090> side<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.360> keep<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.570> from

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
their inter side to keep it from

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.090 
their inter side to keep it from
atrophying<00:02:15.080> so<00:02:15.260> much<00:02:15.440> yeah<00:02:15.800> i<00:02:15.830> think<00:02:15.950> the

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
atrophying so much yeah i think the

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.590 
atrophying so much yeah i think the
nervous<00:02:16.400> system<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:16.820> gets<00:02:16.970> stimulated<00:02:17.240> now

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
nervous system it gets stimulated now

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.910 
nervous system it gets stimulated now
what<00:02:17.780> is<00:02:17.990> that<00:02:18.140> what<00:02:18.260> you<00:02:18.380> did<00:02:18.530> when<00:02:18.650> you<00:02:18.710> hurt
