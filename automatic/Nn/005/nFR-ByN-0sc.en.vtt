00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:22.700 
the horse to understand the wind you

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.730 
the horse to understand the wind you
pick<00:00:22.910> up<00:00:23.060> on<00:00:23.210> the<00:00:23.329> reins<00:00:23.570> that<00:00:23.869> you're<00:00:24.529> going

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
pick up on the reins that you're going

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.159 
pick up on the reins that you're going
to<00:00:24.770> change<00:00:25.099> directions<00:00:25.279> and<00:00:25.869> you're<00:00:26.869> using

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:27.169 
to change directions and you're using

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.530 
to change directions and you're using
the<00:00:27.829> change<00:00:28.189> of<00:00:28.430> directions<00:00:28.579> to<00:00:29.180> get<00:00:29.329> him<00:00:29.419> to

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:29.540 
the change of directions to get him to

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.310 
the change of directions to get him to
slow<00:00:29.809> down

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
slow down

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.280 
slow down
so<00:00:30.980> as<00:00:31.279> we<00:00:31.579> practice<00:00:32.149> it<00:00:32.360> again<00:00:32.899> it's<00:00:33.079> going<00:00:33.230> to

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
so as we practice it again it's going to

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.490 
so as we practice it again it's going to
feel<00:00:33.500> real<00:00:33.829> awkward<00:00:34.219> don't<00:00:35.030> worry<00:00:35.500> about

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
feel real awkward don't worry about

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.130 
feel real awkward don't worry about
trying<00:00:36.920> to<00:00:37.070> have<00:00:37.340> him<00:00:37.610> change<00:00:37.910> leads<00:00:38.329> and<00:00:38.870> and

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
trying to have him change leads and and

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.410 
trying to have him change leads and and
say<00:00:39.680> on<00:00:39.829> the<00:00:39.950> correct<00:00:40.280> lead<00:00:40.520> don't<00:00:41.239> worry

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
say on the correct lead don't worry

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.389 
say on the correct lead don't worry
about<00:00:41.570> keeping<00:00:41.899> them<00:00:42.260> at<00:00:42.440> the<00:00:42.829> canter

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
about keeping them at the canter

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.090 
about keeping them at the canter
oh<00:00:43.429> if<00:00:44.089> he<00:00:44.600> breaks<00:00:44.870> down<00:00:44.989> to<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:45.379> trot<00:00:45.649> wants

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
oh if he breaks down to the trot wants

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.450 
oh if he breaks down to the trot wants
to<00:00:46.160> change<00:00:46.399> leads<00:00:46.820> on<00:00:47.719> his<00:00:47.960> own<00:00:48.199> rate<00:00:48.980> it<00:00:49.249> just

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
to change leads on his own rate it just

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.130 
to change leads on his own rate it just
gives<00:00:49.609> him<00:00:49.789> a<00:00:49.940> chance<00:00:50.149> to<00:00:50.359> practice<00:00:50.570> that<00:00:50.989> and

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
gives him a chance to practice that and

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.680 
gives him a chance to practice that and
that's<00:00:51.260> fine<00:00:51.379> but<00:00:52.249> you<00:00:52.489> really<00:00:52.789> main<00:00:53.030> mainly

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
that's fine but you really main mainly

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.979 
that's fine but you really main mainly
concerned<00:00:54.140> about<00:00:54.579> is<00:00:55.579> that<00:00:56.030> he<00:00:56.239> doesn't<00:00:56.480> speed

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
concerned about is that he doesn't speed

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.709 
concerned about is that he doesn't speed
up<00:00:57.230> you<00:00:57.710> know<00:00:57.859> and<00:00:58.100> that<00:00:58.519> eventually<00:00:59.359> when<00:00:59.539> we

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
up you know and that eventually when we

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.290 
up you know and that eventually when we
release<00:01:00.109> him<00:01:00.379> at<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:01.039> canter<00:01:01.489> that<00:01:01.940> he<00:01:02.059> stays

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
release him at the canter that he stays

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.640 
release him at the canter that he stays
nice<00:01:02.600> and<00:01:02.629> slow<00:01:03.159> remember<00:01:04.159> we're<00:01:04.309> trying<00:01:04.489> to

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
nice and slow remember we're trying to

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.990 
nice and slow remember we're trying to
get<00:01:06.650> him<00:01:06.800> to<00:01:06.830> do<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:07.580> caner

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
get him to do the caner

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.050 
get him to do the caner
on<00:01:08.150> a<00:01:08.810> loose<00:01:09.229> rein<00:01:09.590> that<00:01:09.890> takes<00:01:10.610> some<00:01:10.820> practice

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
on a loose rein that takes some practice

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.870 
on a loose rein that takes some practice
but<00:01:12.050> for<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.620> most<00:01:12.829> part<00:01:13.130> you<00:01:13.369> can<00:01:13.399> accomplish

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
but for the most part you can accomplish

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.359 
but for the most part you can accomplish
it<00:01:14.180> and<00:01:14.299> again<00:01:14.930> as<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:15.560> horse<00:01:15.770> changes

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
it and again as the horse changes

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.370 
it and again as the horse changes
directions<00:01:16.790> the<00:01:17.119> neat<00:01:17.329> thing<00:01:17.659> about<00:01:17.689> the<00:01:18.170> walk

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
directions the neat thing about the walk

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.310 
directions the neat thing about the walk
and<00:01:18.649> the<00:01:18.710> try<00:01:19.009> and<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:19.969> canter<00:01:20.420> at<00:01:20.840> first

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
and the try and the canter at first

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.219 
and the try and the canter at first
what's<00:01:21.920> natural<00:01:22.490> for<00:01:22.520> a<00:01:22.700> horse<00:01:22.969> to<00:01:23.030> do<00:01:23.390> is<00:01:23.689> when

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
what's natural for a horse to do is when

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.679 
what's natural for a horse to do is when
he<00:01:24.320> turns<00:01:24.619> to<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.009> right<00:01:25.219> that<00:01:25.520> he<00:01:25.759> leans<00:01:26.210> to

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
he turns to the right that he leans to

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.600 
he turns to the right that he leans to
the<00:01:26.719> right<00:01:26.840> how<00:01:27.469> many<00:01:27.710> turns<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:28.250> left<00:01:28.399> he

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
the right how many turns to the left he

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.520 
the right how many turns to the left he
leans<00:01:28.909> to<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:29.149> left<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:29.899> we<00:01:30.079> really<00:01:30.409> don't

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
leans to the left and we really don't

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.590 
leans to the left and we really don't
want<00:01:30.649> him<00:01:30.890> to<00:01:31.009> do<00:01:31.159> that<00:01:31.399> what<00:01:31.909> we<00:01:32.090> want<00:01:32.299> him<00:01:32.390> to

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
want him to do that what we want him to

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.810 
want him to do that what we want him to
do<00:01:32.860> actually<00:01:33.860> what<00:01:33.979> it<00:01:34.130> would<00:01:34.250> feel<00:01:34.280> what

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
do actually what it would feel what

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.700 
do actually what it would feel what
would<00:01:34.969> feel<00:01:35.149> perfect<00:01:35.780> as<00:01:35.990> if<00:01:36.380> you<00:01:36.560> were

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
would feel perfect as if you were

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.520 
would feel perfect as if you were
sitting<00:01:37.100> on<00:01:37.280> a<00:01:37.340> table<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:38.149> your<00:01:38.570> leg<00:01:38.840> legs

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
sitting on a table and your leg legs

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.649 
sitting on a table and your leg legs
were<00:01:39.770> hanging<00:01:40.159> over<00:01:40.460> that<00:01:41.030> table<00:01:41.509> would<00:01:41.630> be

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
were hanging over that table would be

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.810 
were hanging over that table would be
perfectly<00:01:42.259> flat<00:01:42.590> that's<00:01:43.039> what<00:01:43.250> we<00:01:43.369> would<00:01:43.520> want

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
perfectly flat that's what we would want

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.760 
perfectly flat that's what we would want
that's<00:01:44.329> what<00:01:44.539> the<00:01:44.659> saddle<00:01:45.049> should<00:01:45.079> feel<00:01:45.500> like

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
that's what the saddle should feel like

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.859 
that's what the saddle should feel like
when<00:01:46.159> we're<00:01:46.310> as<00:01:46.520> we're<00:01:47.000> changing<00:01:47.030> directions

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
when we're as we're changing directions

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.499 
when we're as we're changing directions
from<00:01:48.409> left<00:01:48.649> to<00:01:48.740> right<00:01:49.070> then<00:01:49.640> what<00:01:50.210> we<00:01:50.329> want

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
from left to right then what we want

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.450 
from left to right then what we want
this<00:01:50.750> saddle<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.289> feel<00:01:51.500> like<00:01:51.799> is<00:01:51.950> it's

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
this saddle to feel like is it's

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.510 
this saddle to feel like is it's
perfectly<00:01:53.119> flat<00:01:53.479> if<00:01:53.990> in<00:01:54.409> it<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:54.679> then<00:01:55.070> later

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
perfectly flat if in it and then later

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.399 
perfectly flat if in it and then later
on<00:01:55.789> in<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.119> training<00:01:56.299> we're<00:01:56.960> actually<00:01:57.109> going

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
on in the training we're actually going

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.889 
on in the training we're actually going
to<00:01:57.500> want<00:01:57.679> the<00:01:57.890> front<00:01:58.250> of<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.700> table<00:01:58.909> the<00:01:59.630> lip

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
to want the front of the table the lip

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.139 
to want the front of the table the lip
at<00:02:00.049> the<00:02:00.140> table<00:02:00.530> to<00:02:00.710> lift<00:02:00.979> up<00:02:01.219> which<00:02:01.789> is<00:02:02.000> what

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
at the table to lift up which is what

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.330 
at the table to lift up which is what
the<00:02:02.390> front<00:02:02.750> of<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:02.929> saddle<00:02:03.350> will<00:02:03.500> do<00:02:03.649> as<00:02:03.859> the

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
the front of the saddle will do as the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.419 
the front of the saddle will do as the
horse<00:02:04.549> becomes<00:02:04.880> better<00:02:05.210> collected<00:02:05.899> so<00:02:06.740> as<00:02:07.100> we

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
horse becomes better collected so as we

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.900 
horse becomes better collected so as we
practice<00:02:07.939> these<00:02:08.119> exercises<00:02:09.020> and<00:02:09.460> we<00:02:10.460> perfect

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
practice these exercises and we perfect

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.000 
practice these exercises and we perfect
them<00:02:11.090> here<00:02:11.360> in<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.600> arena<00:02:11.870> then<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.650> next

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
them here in the arena then the next

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.070 
them here in the arena then the next
thing<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.310> do<00:02:13.460> is<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:14.030> go<00:02:14.210> out<00:02:14.240> now<00:02:14.780> we're<00:02:14.960> going

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
thing to do is to go out now we're going

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.710 
thing to do is to go out now we're going
to<00:02:15.140> practice<00:02:15.500> all<00:02:16.010> of<00:02:16.070> these<00:02:16.610> exercises<00:02:17.269> and

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
to practice all of these exercises and

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.220 
to practice all of these exercises and
as<00:02:18.170> many<00:02:18.590> different<00:02:19.720> situations<00:02:20.720> as<00:02:20.900> we<00:02:21.050> can

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
as many different situations as we can

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.809 
as many different situations as we can
possibly<00:02:21.739> think<00:02:21.860> of

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
possibly think of

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.680 
possibly think of
from<00:02:23.330> here<00:02:23.720> you<00:02:24.230> know<00:02:24.849> we<00:02:25.849> would<00:02:26.000> graduate<00:02:26.420> up

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
from here you know we would graduate up

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.530 
from here you know we would graduate up
maybe<00:02:26.989> to<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.290> pasture<00:02:27.680> so<00:02:28.400> we're<00:02:29.000> working<00:02:29.269> the

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
maybe to a pasture so we're working the

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.839 
maybe to a pasture so we're working the
horse<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:29.989> pasture<00:02:30.290> again<00:02:31.040> we'd<00:02:31.489> be<00:02:31.670> by

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
horse and a pasture again we'd be by

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.920 
horse and a pasture again we'd be by
ourselves<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:34.430> we<00:02:35.390> would<00:02:35.540> work<00:02:35.720> on

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
ourselves and and and we would work on

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.380 
ourselves and and and we would work on
speeding<00:02:36.470> up<00:02:36.650> slowing<00:02:36.680> down<00:02:37.390> changing

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
speeding up slowing down changing

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.509 
speeding up slowing down changing
directions<00:02:38.629> this<00:02:39.440> is<00:02:39.680> if<00:02:39.860> we<00:02:40.040> were<00:02:40.190> here<00:02:40.400> in

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
directions this is if we were here in

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.180 
directions this is if we were here in
the<00:02:40.670> arena<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.180> then<00:02:41.840> from<00:02:42.080> that<00:02:42.110> maybe<00:02:42.769> add

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
the arena and then from that maybe add

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.479 
the arena and then from that maybe add
one<00:02:43.700> or<00:02:43.849> two<00:02:43.880> horses<00:02:44.510> around<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.950> having

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
one or two horses around and and having

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.750 
one or two horses around and and having
practice<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:47.360> then<00:02:48.160> if<00:02:49.160> you<00:02:49.280> can't<00:02:49.489> practice

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
practice and then if you can't practice

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.000 
practice and then if you can't practice
find<00:02:50.330> somebody<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.900> practice<00:02:51.349> with<00:02:51.590> where<00:02:51.920> you

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
find somebody to practice with where you

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.400 
find somebody to practice with where you
can<00:02:52.160> speed<00:02:52.459> up<00:02:52.489> and<00:02:52.940> slow<00:02:53.239> down<00:02:53.569> and<00:02:53.900> speed<00:02:54.170> up

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
can speed up and slow down and speed up

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.520 
can speed up and slow down and speed up
and<00:02:54.590> slow<00:02:55.160> down<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:55.790> and<00:02:56.120> kind<00:02:56.510> of<00:02:56.630> make<00:02:57.230> it<00:02:57.260> a

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
and slow down and and kind of make it a

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.949 
and slow down and and kind of make it a
drill<00:02:58.010> team<00:02:58.310> where<00:02:58.700> you're<00:02:58.880> for<00:02:59.450> your<00:02:59.599> plan

drill team where you're for your plan

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.190 
drill team where you're for your plan
and<00:03:00.410> practicing<00:03:01.130> and<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.610> just<00:03:02.599> kind<00:03:02.840> of<00:03:02.900> plan

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
and practicing and and just kind of plan

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.380 
and practicing and and just kind of plan
together<00:03:03.680> but<00:03:03.890> you're<00:03:04.069> actually<00:03:04.390> teaching

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
together but you're actually teaching

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.870 
together but you're actually teaching
your<00:03:05.510> horse<00:03:05.540> speed<00:03:06.079> up<00:03:06.319> slow<00:03:06.560> down<00:03:06.890> speed<00:03:07.640> up

slow down and then add in the group of

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.559 
slow down and then add in the group of
horses<00:03:11.840> if<00:03:12.140> it's<00:03:12.319> possible<00:03:12.880> add<00:03:13.880> in<00:03:14.209> a<00:03:14.329> group

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569

of horses where there's lots of
distractions<00:03:16.760> for<00:03:17.030> your<00:03:17.180> horse<00:03:17.450> but<00:03:18.079> you<00:03:18.110> stay

distractions for your horse but you stay
focused<00:03:18.799> on<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.280> exercise<00:03:20.290> well<00:03:21.290> at<00:03:21.470> that

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
focused on the exercise well at that

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.300 
focused on the exercise well at that
point<00:03:21.980> then<00:03:22.780> if<00:03:23.780> we<00:03:24.049> feel<00:03:24.349> like<00:03:24.590> we're<00:03:24.829> safe<00:03:25.099> in

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
point then if we feel like we're safe in

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.400 
point then if we feel like we're safe in
all<00:03:25.459> those<00:03:25.700> controlled<00:03:26.360> environments<00:03:27.200> then

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
all those controlled environments then

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.960 
all those controlled environments then
the<00:03:27.620> next<00:03:28.010> thing<00:03:28.160> to<00:03:28.280> do<00:03:28.430> would<00:03:28.519> be<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:28.700> go<00:03:28.940> out

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
the next thing to do would be to go out

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.590 
the next thing to do would be to go out
on<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:29.329> trail<00:03:30.519> preferably<00:03:31.519> by<00:03:31.730> ourself<00:03:31.940> and
