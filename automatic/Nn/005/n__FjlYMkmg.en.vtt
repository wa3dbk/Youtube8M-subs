00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 rarely at my last start here 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.309
 the eureka poker tour and a top 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.260
 performance so far yes I'm running out 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.719
 40,000 very well above average 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.860
 only at 28 degrees 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.120
 I can not complain 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.650
 problem is then but I have a two 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.130
 good hands played and good too 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.240
 won 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.560
 But then comes the Schlendrian again 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.000
 Do you know you are you really have to 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.109
 Being concentrated always participates 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.340
 come after that, now you have a bit 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.900
 cool now you play that way again 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.599
 a shit with leaves that would be 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.929
 situation for example yes where at 16 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.219
 Cancel all about as bad but if 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.260
 even if that is already a lady and 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.210
 Immediately lies and hears everything then it is 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.649
 actually, that's something more 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.969
 The sixth floor was one 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.079
 a little stupid, for example, me too 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.989
 a lot lost so four to five thousand 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.309
 I just think stupid but if you 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.989
 then concentrate again then runs 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.460
 currently the city I have seen 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.480
 that you are pushing yourself 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.260
 Yesterday something with nine 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.160
 viewed 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.379
 the german virgins that no no that was 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.340
 in fact as a pokerstars tv totally 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.660
 pokerstars.de night started there 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.219
 have we ever made the t-shirts so 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.480
 I'm not even ten years old or something 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.769
 I have something like that again and again 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.740
 come out and seemingly bring me 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.900
 luck on the back and show it for a short time 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.420
 youtube baby has youtube I think so 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.070
 also aspic you can play quiet times 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.270
 I think I can do another 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.000
 I see we unfortunately with very unequal 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.280
 ass king trip saas and at the end drilling 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.750
 eighth yes the poster because I have synonymous 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.549
 shit played mainly I have 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.780
 I have an idea of ​​him too 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.580
 Let's inscribe a bit because he has 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.100
 never grace but always so skillful 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.869
 I thought okay because it did not matter 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.009
 I like a very good deal of drilling 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.990
 Well, I perform it's still mine 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.400
 easy but you have to synonymous first 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.630
 then the people on leads then that they 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.460
 Nevertheless , he is not allowed to play along 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.420
 putting too much is all good you have 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.579
 how much have you got I think so 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.770
 almost doubled there 38 part is yes 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:50.430
 not bad with elton here too 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.140
 finally there you know each other yes I am me 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.740
 not sure was like a guess 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.759
 but i think i still have money from the 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.590
 all right we have a small action 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.810
 gave the audience could ask questions 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.479
 yes and there we have some nice ones 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.100
 ask among other things, or four 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.060
 would like to know what parents find in poker 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.979
 so great 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.540
 actually the game in itself so before 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.770
 all things when playing with people 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.440
 So online poker for example 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.850
 I'm not as interested as you are 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.350
 together with friends in the evening 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.910
 Beer and a Swiss printer 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.370
 for me also a social game 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.440
 and this mix between happiness and 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.010
 to challenge happiness 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.480
 that makes us beautiful beautiful 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.980
 Nice opinion also Andreas Laschet 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.560
 would like to know if you think so 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.420
 that stefan raab ogi understand correctly 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.100
 becomes 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.600
 No, he actually plays from time to time 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.310
 he is still better 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.400
 actually plays bad for the times 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.810
 as often as he plays but so slowly 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.120
 one has seen each other for the last time 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.640
 has just got it a bit and will 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.190
 always a big challenge 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.530
 for me 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.610
 but to the extent that I am in distress 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.350
 but it still lasts 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.700
 that lasts, we stay at stefan 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.000
 raab martin lima wants to know 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.180
 if you have your top 3 teams from stefan raab 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.739
 when playing poker or have hotels that are 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.140
 behaviors example when you notice 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.739
 once well holds a good hand or times 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.739
 bad is 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.070
 yes you can with stefan you have yourself 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.780
 recognize a bit but that this 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.430
 typical features of hand 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.140
 the card because of that means 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.360
 i want the safe things i want 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.670
 That's what Stefan often does or does 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.830
 lean back and if he does then 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.090
 starts to store 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.900
 then he tries to get the others out 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.150
 to store 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.680
 then he has nothing but more 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.100
 I would not like to betray here because 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.720
 Maybe he sees that and it will 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.670
 that's right, it's the next one 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.380
 tv total pokerstars.de night again man 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.630
 that will be 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.060
 So probably after the summer break 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.890
 the next october is only forced 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.910
 october a bit more because of that 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.630
 I'm playing around here a bit 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.520
 to earn money 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.350
 the final question is still nice to yes 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.480
 to one of your broadcast niklas müller 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.210
 he wants to know how you do that 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.270
 overpowering lukas podolski at blow 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.160
 want to beat the star yes that's it 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.390
 Of course this is a difficult situation 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.620
 For me, I was not 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.420
 it's just lukas 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.830
 podolski comes and you play against him 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.660
 I had to say no choice 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.220
 I do not want to be curious 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.420
 Of course, that depends on the 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.169
 So of course I play all of them 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.750
 sports games I will be inferior 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.500
 I want, I was all conditional 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.880
 alone 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.310
 I do not want to say it either 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.900
 that I might ask for at quiz 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.530
 which is definitely better than lukas because 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.700
 even many think so dull podolski the 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.230
 is not so stupid I have already 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.300
 times many think that totally 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.370
 but probably he is not totally the 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.350
 he has something on the box and I have 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.370
 Really but I can actually yes 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.290
 Do not lose even if I oppose 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.520
 lukas podolski some good game 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.520
 it should be lost Lukas 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.320
 podolski thomas lamatsch now also here 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.390
 short while your opinion on his game 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.040
 maybe sometimes I do not see 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.120
 a lot of the game but mostly still there and 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.490
 that is above average we always 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.260
 so i think i think that's her 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.730
 does not look bad at 38,000 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.600
 elton, they all play poker 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.030
 can 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.650
 So with him, it's usually a question 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.750
 how to get up left foot and right 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.690
 that's how the benefits always go 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.100
 weber tv totally that's not me 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.620
 it will not work and it will not work 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.080
 then it really will not be more extreme 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.760
 feel player, yes, rather the feeling for it 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.530
 the situation and that does not have that 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.500
 it's just about the life partner man 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.910
 He sees himself as athletic and ours 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.220
 both sports cannons also commander 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.680
 Warriors are now going to break like that 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.320
 it looks like you had 42 and run 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.880
 with queen as kings pure or as rom 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.600
 flashing yes what does not mean pure so 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.970
 all right commerce on the flop which 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.440
 beautiful with 63 standing there and who now 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.550
 already at home in the hotel room with the 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.180
 roof finished 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.220
 yes, but now I'm kind of like that 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.390
 just under 20 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.770
 So maybe there is one more 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.240
 small load longer bed who longer in the 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.890
 tournament remains or something would not be 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.990
 interesting for you further on the course 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.970
 had a bunch of new keys there 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.340
 broke does not find full I am fully there 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.720
 okay the video is in the morning 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.090
 probably if you can get this far 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.440
 Of course many thanks to elton and 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:06.030
 commander crowe wish you nice 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.030
 break and it goes on pure skin
