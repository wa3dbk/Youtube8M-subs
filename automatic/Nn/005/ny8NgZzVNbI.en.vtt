refresh<00:01:20.380> now<00:01:21.069> the<00:01:21.130> bad<00:01:21.429> part<00:01:21.789> has<00:01:22.270> been

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
refresh now the bad part has been

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.809 
refresh now the bad part has been
interior<00:01:23.050> space<00:01:23.500> or<00:01:23.800> should<00:01:24.190> I<00:01:24.250> say<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.550> lack

00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:24.819 
interior space or should I say the lack

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:27.419 
interior space or should I say the lack
thereof<00:01:25.390> because<00:01:26.289> of<00:01:26.470> sloping<00:01:26.920> roofline<00:01:27.280> and

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429 
thereof because of sloping roofline and

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:29.850 
thereof because of sloping roofline and
the<00:01:27.970> styling<00:01:28.479> of<00:01:28.600> it<00:01:28.899> doesn't<00:01:29.440> allow<00:01:29.560> for<00:01:29.740> much

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
the styling of it doesn't allow for much

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.130 
the styling of it doesn't allow for much
interior<00:01:30.220> space<00:01:30.460> so<00:01:30.729> infinity<00:01:31.630> will<00:01:32.020> be

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
interior space so infinity will be

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.350 
interior space so infinity will be

qx70 to flow with the new naming
structure<00:01:37.240> yes<00:01:37.539> I<00:01:37.720> know<00:01:37.780> just<00:01:38.679> changing<00:01:39.159> the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
structure yes I know just changing the

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.430 
structure yes I know just changing the
name<00:01:39.460> doesn't<00:01:39.850> do<00:01:40.270> much<00:01:40.450> for<00:01:40.509> interior<00:01:41.080> space

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
name doesn't do much for interior space

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.710 
name doesn't do much for interior space
but<00:01:42.280> they<00:01:42.399> will<00:01:42.549> be<00:01:42.610> adding<00:01:43.000> more<00:01:43.030> space<00:01:43.509> as

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
but they will be adding more space as

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.469 
but they will be adding more space as
well<00:01:44.140> to<00:01:44.409> match<00:01:44.619> up<00:01:44.830> better<00:01:45.100> with<00:01:45.880> competitors

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
well to match up better with competitors

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.449 
well to match up better with competitors

like the Porsche Cayenne infinity

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:49.969 
like the Porsche Cayenne infinity
promises<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.149> styling<00:01:49.570> will<00:01:49.659> remain

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
promises the styling will remain

promises the styling will remain
distinct<00:01:50.979> well<00:01:51.579> good<00:01:51.820> because<00:01:52.450> we<00:01:52.600> can't<00:01:52.810> have

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960

too<00:02:42.670> excited<00:02:42.910> with<00:02:43.359> the<00:02:43.450> angles<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.079> then

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
too excited with the angles and then

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.340 
too excited with the angles and then
this<00:02:44.470> is<00:02:44.739> just<00:02:45.100> what<00:02:45.340> happened<00:02:45.760> yeah<00:02:46.630> kind<00:02:47.319> of
