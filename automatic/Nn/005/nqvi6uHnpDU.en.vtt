 also in this program so 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.689
 spectacular today we want to teach something 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.730
 important and it is the love for art the 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.910
 passion for painting and that more than 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.560
 being very friendship let's present a 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.210
 new technique called brushwork 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.040
 American that serves to decorate 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.330
 any kind of elements and in 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.370
 special today that we're going to do some 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.590
 spectacular cards I want me to 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.110
 join today we are going to do 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.489
 some American brushstroke cards 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.440
 we are going to need so that all 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.820
 viewers annotate with materials a 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.400
 color palette 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.839
 we are going to need acrylic paints 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.940
 let's use a white let's 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:56.120
 use a red let's use a 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.489
 green use the blue let's use 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.059
 also a frosty edger for 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:05.000
 make decorations and a very important 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.830
 flat brush with soft bristles this 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.930
 brush will also serve to make 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.880
 different types of brush strokes and it's 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.580
 important that the brush is of 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.799
 soft bristles like these to use 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.770
 also a cardboard in this case 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.719
 we can use 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.109
 by different colors we have here 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:24.149
 a grade card and we're going to 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.240
 proceed to start painting a bouquet of 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.240
 flowers 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.400
 the American brush is a technique that 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.770
 it consists in giving freehand strokes in 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.960
 double load that means driving the 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.060
 light and shadows in this case what 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.100
 we do it is very easy we are going to 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.640
 load the brush halfway 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.740
 loading it 50% in color and 50% 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.300
 our color when loading we go to 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.750
 download in the palette in one movement 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.730
 vertical from top to bottom and 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.510
 we turn the brush and from below towards 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:01.119
 up to give a serious effect this 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:05.880
 process we do 2 and 3 4 times up 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:09.050
 the brush is well moisturized and we can 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.800
 see a gradient color 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.390
 after doing this step let's start 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.460
 to work on it we are going to work a 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.560
 corner of the cardboard to give 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.950
 and spaces so you can write a 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.650
 message 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.420
 in this case look let's start 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.250
 always when I work brush strokes 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.079
 we always work on what we're going to 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.329
 place once and then we're going to 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:36.840
 start to work the strokes that we 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:40.370
 allow in this case the first 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.370
 petal so on 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.790
 pink the spectacular reasons for 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.480
 work love you are simply instead 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.760
 let's work a flat stroke 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.459
 we push 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.939
 we give direction and we raise the brush 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.939
 on point 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.980
 here at this moment we are giving ourselves 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.780
 some brushstrokes we are simply 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.780
 lowering the brush and we raise again 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.060
 to give as a kind of cones for 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.810
 focus and make some cones here I'm going to 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.480
 make another nice 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.340
 where are we going to give it as a kind of 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.110
 button 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.300
 and now let's start using the 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.519
 green colors we're going to use a few 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.260
 green this green when it takes a 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.690
 little bit of red are going to give some greens 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.310
 more burned and as the cardboard carries 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.790
 green between me I want me to stay a 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.090
 green plus olive to distinguish the 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.950
 color in one of the other 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.040
 simply with a brushstroke of a 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.739
 stroke placed the brush of the next 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.700
 way pressed and lift together they 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.700
 she may be doing 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.989
 our 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.230
 then I'm going to make them several 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.480
 buttons and here I'm going to do another kind of 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.060
 of leaves that allows me to give you more 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.610
 movements we place the brush equal to 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.200
 rule of the time we press in tip and 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.830
 we give movements 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.630
 tip 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.540
 we return in tip but we are going to 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:17.160
 give it a light part we press and 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.160
 again we give curve towards 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.310
 Now let's apply with a brush 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.919
 triple be a little water and a 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.380
 little bit of green and a little 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.810
 red color according to the color theory we 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.000
 they give brown colors 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.400
 let's apply a little more water 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.790
 and that will allow the brush 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.710
 slide easier 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.710
 I'm going to do just a few strokes 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.980
 to make a few small arabesques and 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:49.220
 Give a little decoration to everything 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.870
 which are the branches of the flower making 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.630
 this we are going to unite all that are the 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.340
 branches that we do not have anything left in the air 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:05:00.590
 let's make the decoration with the edge 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:02.360
 frosted and we want to make 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.700
 a very special invitation in this 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.860
