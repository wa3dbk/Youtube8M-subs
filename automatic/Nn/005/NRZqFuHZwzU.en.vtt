00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
I'm actually getting hyped for it cuz I

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.390 
I'm actually getting hyped for it cuz I
can't<00:01:30.810> wait<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.080> see<00:01:31.350> how<00:01:31.800> different<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.370> looks

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
can't wait to see how different it looks

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.970 
can't wait to see how different it looks
too<00:01:32.760> compared<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.330> ps3<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.140> if<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> graphical

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
too compared to ps3 and if the graphical

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.890 
too compared to ps3 and if the graphical
leap<00:01:35.160> actually<00:01:36.060> lived<00:01:36.270> up<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.690> hype

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
leap actually lived up to the hype

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.460 
leap actually lived up to the hype
and<00:01:37.430> I<00:01:38.430> know<00:01:38.520> lots<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.000> people<00:01:39.390> told<00:01:40.050> me<00:01:40.290> that

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
and I know lots of people told me that

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.660 
and I know lots of people told me that
they're<00:01:40.680> not<00:01:40.710> gonna<00:01:40.950> be<00:01:41.100> getting<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.520> on

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
they're not gonna be getting it on

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.290 
they're not gonna be getting it on
next-gen<00:01:42.540> because<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.710> how<00:01:44.520> much<00:01:44.730> they<00:01:44.790> played

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
next-gen because of how much they played

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.020 
next-gen because of how much they played
it<00:01:45.450> on<00:01:45.570> ps3<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.680> for<00:01:47.370> them<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.730> waste<00:01:47.880> of

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
it on ps3 so for them it's a waste of

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.100 
it on ps3 so for them it's a waste of
money<00:01:48.150> in<00:01:48.330> a<00:01:48.390> waste<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.690> time<00:01:48.870> and<00:01:49.020> I

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
money in a waste of time and I

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.840 
money in a waste of time and I
definitely<00:01:49.530> understand<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.670> makes

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
definitely understand that it makes

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.670 
definitely understand that it makes

sense if I were in your position I'd

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.150 
sense if I were in your position I'd
probably<00:01:53.220> do<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.610> same<00:01:53.640> thing<00:01:54.620> so<00:01:55.620> I'm

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
probably do the same thing so I'm

doing it for money cuz they made their

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.160 
doing it for money cuz they made their
share<00:02:50.860> of<00:02:50.950> money<00:02:51.130> on<00:02:51.430> last<00:02:52.150> gen<00:02:52.269> and<00:02:52.630> now<00:02:52.989> they

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
to make more money of course but I don't

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.370 
to make more money of course but I don't
think<00:02:57.970> that's<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.239> only<00:02:58.329> reason<00:02:58.720> why<00:02:59.200> they're

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
think that's the only reason why they're

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.080 
think that's the only reason why they're
doing<00:02:59.560> it<00:02:59.799> I<00:02:59.920> think<00:03:00.160> they're<00:03:00.280> doing<00:03:00.370> it<00:03:00.610> cuz<00:03:00.849> of

doing it I think they're doing it cuz of

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.110 
doing it I think they're doing it cuz of
course<00:03:01.750> lots<00:03:02.410> of<00:03:02.560> people<00:03:02.620> purchased<00:03:03.400> next-gen

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
course lots of people purchased next-gen

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.770 
course lots of people purchased next-gen
consoles<00:03:04.660> and<00:03:04.870> they're<00:03:05.410> trying<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:06.780> support

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
consoles and they're trying to support

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
and promote players to come to the

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.020 
and promote players to come to the
next-gen<00:03:11.079> side<00:03:11.349> and<00:03:11.739> stick<00:03:12.459> with<00:03:12.640> next-gen

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
next-gen side and stick with next-gen

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.640 
next-gen side and stick with next-gen
consoles<00:03:13.480> so<00:03:13.660> that<00:03:13.810> they<00:03:13.959> can<00:03:14.110> play<00:03:14.380> their

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
consoles so that they can play their

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.099

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
favorite last gen games but on next-gen

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.289 
favorite last gen games but on next-gen
I<00:03:17.290> think<00:03:17.799> that's<00:03:18.040> one<00:03:18.549> of<00:03:18.579> the<00:03:18.760> reasons<00:03:19.120> why

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
I think that's one of the reasons why

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.210 
I think that's one of the reasons why
they<00:03:19.450> also<00:03:19.600> made<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:19.989> Last<00:03:20.350> of<00:03:20.530> Us<00:03:20.680> remastered
