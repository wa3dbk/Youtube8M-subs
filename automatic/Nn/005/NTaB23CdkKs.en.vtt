00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.200 

we<00:00:21.350> have<00:00:21.560> a<00:00:21.590> degree<00:00:21.830> of<00:00:22.040> difficulty<00:00:22.640> formula

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
we have a degree of difficulty formula

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.820 
we have a degree of difficulty formula
to<00:00:23.330> help<00:00:23.480> us<00:00:23.630> understand<00:00:24.290> the<00:00:24.470> different

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
to help us understand the different

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.280 
to help us understand the different
levels<00:00:25.310> of<00:00:25.460> the<00:00:25.610> maneuvers<00:00:26.060> so<00:00:26.270> all<00:00:26.840> the<00:00:27.080> dives

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.290 
levels of the maneuvers so all the dives

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.230 
levels of the maneuvers so all the dives
have<00:00:27.529> a<00:00:27.560> different<00:00:28.100> variation<00:00:28.760> and<00:00:29.150> the

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
have a different variation and the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.730 
have a different variation and the
number<00:00:29.600> of<00:00:29.689> somersaults<00:00:30.260> and<00:00:30.350> twist<00:00:30.650> that

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
number of somersaults and twist that

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.500 
number of somersaults and twist that
they<00:00:30.890> have<00:00:31.040> so<00:00:31.279> we<00:00:31.400> need<00:00:31.640> this<00:00:31.820> tariff<00:00:32.210> to<00:00:32.330> help

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
they have so we need this tariff to help

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.750 
they have so we need this tariff to help
us<00:00:32.630> understand<00:00:33.500> how<00:00:33.530> hard<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:34.190> divers<00:00:34.550> so

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
us understand how hard the divers so

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.119 
us understand how hard the divers so
obviously<00:00:35.629> the<00:00:35.930> more<00:00:36.140> somersaults<00:00:36.770> and<00:00:36.860> twist

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
obviously the more somersaults and twist

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.630 
obviously the more somersaults and twist
that<00:00:37.250> you<00:00:37.370> add<00:00:37.489> the<00:00:37.970> more<00:00:38.000> difficult<00:00:38.540> to<00:00:38.570> dive

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
that you add the more difficult to dive

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.680 
that you add the more difficult to dive
however<00:00:40.640> you<00:00:40.760> have<00:00:40.940> more<00:00:41.150> intricate

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
however you have more intricate

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.270 
however you have more intricate
components<00:00:42.350> that<00:00:42.410> affect<00:00:42.770> the<00:00:42.920> degree<00:00:43.250> of

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
components that affect the degree of

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.189 
components that affect the degree of
difficulty<00:00:43.970> like<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:44.330> shape<00:00:44.629> in<00:00:44.809> the<00:00:44.930> air<00:00:45.050> and

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
difficulty like the shape in the air and

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:46.810 
difficulty like the shape in the air and
for<00:00:45.650> example<00:00:46.070> you<00:00:46.100> have<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:46.460> Tuck<00:00:46.640> position

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
for example you have the Tuck position

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.700 
for example you have the Tuck position
which<00:00:47.210> is<00:00:47.239> like<00:00:47.510> a<00:00:47.540> ball<00:00:47.900> shape<00:00:48.170> that<00:00:48.410> puts<00:00:48.650> you

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
which is like a ball shape that puts you

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.890 
which is like a ball shape that puts you
into<00:00:48.860> a<00:00:48.949> really<00:00:49.430> small<00:00:49.699> position<00:00:50.180> and<00:00:50.330> allows

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
into a really small position and allows

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.570 
into a really small position and allows
you<00:00:51.140> to<00:00:51.260> spin<00:00:51.589> really<00:00:51.800> fast<00:00:51.890> and<00:00:52.309> that<00:00:52.430> gives

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
you to spin really fast and that gives

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.939 
you to spin really fast and that gives
you<00:00:52.729> a<00:00:52.760> lower<00:00:53.120> degree<00:00:53.390> of<00:00:53.690> difficulty<00:00:54.199> but

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
you a lower degree of difficulty but

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:56.350 
you a lower degree of difficulty but
then<00:00:55.070> for<00:00:55.159> example<00:00:55.580> when<00:00:55.670> you<00:00:55.790> have<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.150> PI

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
then for example when you have the PI

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.119 
then for example when you have the PI
position<00:00:56.870> which<00:00:57.019> is<00:00:57.140> more<00:00:57.350> like<00:00:57.530> an<00:00:57.680> L<00:00:57.860> shape

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
position which is more like an L shape

00:00:58.129 --> 00:00:59.649 
position which is more like an L shape
that<00:00:58.309> means<00:00:58.489> you're<00:00:58.670> bigger<00:00:59.000> and<00:00:59.210> longer<00:00:59.360> and

00:00:59.649 --> 00:00:59.659 
that means you're bigger and longer and

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.049 
that means you're bigger and longer and
it's<00:01:00.110> harder<00:01:00.559> to<00:01:00.589> spin<00:01:00.949> as<00:01:01.070> fast<00:01:01.100> and<00:01:01.580> then

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
it's harder to spin as fast and then

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.410 
it's harder to spin as fast and then
that<00:01:02.239> increases<00:01:02.900> the<00:01:02.989> degree<00:01:03.260> of<00:01:03.290> difficulty

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.330 

picking<00:01:07.170> your<00:01:07.259> dies<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.710> just<00:01:07.979> something<00:01:08.189> that

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
picking your dies is just something that

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.760 
picking your dies is just something that
it<00:01:09.000> kind<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.240> depends<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:09.750> your<00:01:10.140> personal

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
it kind of depends on your personal

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.890 
it kind of depends on your personal
diving<00:01:11.189> style<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.759> what<00:01:12.420> types<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.780> maneuvers

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
diving style and what types of maneuvers

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.990 
diving style and what types of maneuvers
you<00:01:13.350> like<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.680> do<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.070> I'm<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> fan<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.729> twist

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
you like to do so I'm a fan of the twist

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.359 
you like to do so I'm a fan of the twist
my<00:01:15.229> favorite<00:01:16.229> dive<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.560> my<00:01:16.680> reverse<00:01:16.950> twister

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
my favorite dive is my reverse twister

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.830 
my favorite dive is my reverse twister
and<00:01:17.520> my<00:01:17.640> handstand<00:01:18.119> also<00:01:18.420> has<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.630> lot<00:01:18.810> of

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
and my handstand also has a lot of

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.109 
and my handstand also has a lot of
twists<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.860> think<00:01:20.009> with<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> sport

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
twists in it so I think with a sport

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.270 
twists in it so I think with a sport
that's<00:01:21.479> extreme<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.409> dangerous<00:01:22.440> like<00:01:23.070> cliff

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
that's extreme and dangerous like cliff

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.680 
that's extreme and dangerous like cliff
diving<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.789> kind<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.060> pick<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.360> ones<00:01:24.509> that

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
diving you kind of pick the ones that

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.090 
diving you kind of pick the ones that
you're<00:01:24.780> comfortable<00:01:24.990> with<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.920> ones

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
you're comfortable with and the ones

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.330 
you're comfortable with and the ones
that<00:01:26.190> you<00:01:26.340> can<00:01:26.490> feel<00:01:26.640> confident<00:01:27.119> going<00:01:27.299> into

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
that you can feel confident going into

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.160 
that you can feel confident going into
if<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:29.520> start<00:01:29.789> with<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> handstand<00:01:30.360> instantly

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
if we start with a handstand instantly

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.590 
if we start with a handstand instantly
you<00:01:31.350> have<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> higher<00:01:31.860> degree<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.610> difficulty

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
you have a higher degree of difficulty

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.929 
you have a higher degree of difficulty
then<00:01:34.110> if<00:01:34.200> we<00:01:34.320> start<00:01:34.619> with<00:01:34.830> Mikael's<00:01:35.490> dive<00:01:35.850> he

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
then if we start with Mikael's dive he

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.520 
then if we start with Mikael's dive he
does<00:01:36.090> our<00:01:36.270> back<00:01:36.450> arms<00:01:36.840> down<00:01:36.990> two<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> half

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
does our back arms down two and a half

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.990 
does our back arms down two and a half
somersaults<00:01:38.189> with<00:01:38.340> one<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> half<00:01:38.729> twist

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
somersaults with one and a half twist

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.570 
somersaults with one and a half twist
that<00:01:39.810> degree<00:01:40.289> of<00:01:40.409> difficulty<00:01:41.009> adds<00:01:41.220> up<00:01:41.550> to

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
that degree of difficulty adds up to

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.880 
that degree of difficulty adds up to
five<00:01:41.909> point<00:01:42.179> two<00:01:42.240> then<00:01:43.140> if<00:01:43.319> you<00:01:43.409> add<00:01:43.440> another

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
five point two then if you add another

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.800 
five point two then if you add another
twist<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.490> which<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:44.880> what<00:01:45.030> David<00:01:45.659> does

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
twist to it which is what David does

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.630 
twist to it which is what David does
let's<00:01:46.140> back<00:01:46.350> arm<00:01:46.619> stand<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.429> enough

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
let's back arm stand to enough

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.809 
let's back arm stand to enough
somersaults<00:01:48.210> with<00:01:48.509> three<00:01:48.929> twists<00:01:49.409> then<00:01:50.159> his

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
somersaults with three twists then his

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.380 
somersaults with three twists then his
degree<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.299> difficulty<00:01:51.810> increases<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.560> 5.6

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
degree of difficulty increases to 5.6

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.510 
degree of difficulty increases to 5.6
then<00:01:54.390> we<00:01:54.720> have<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.080> new<00:01:55.350> dive<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:56.009> Blake<00:01:56.250> or

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
then we have this new dive that Blake or

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.240 
then we have this new dive that Blake or
just<00:01:56.789> dip<00:01:56.970> which<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.270> just<00:01:57.569> insane<00:01:58.110> back<00:01:58.950> arm

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
four twists and the degree of difficulty

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.809 
four twists and the degree of difficulty
just<00:02:03.390> jumps<00:02:03.840> up<00:02:03.959> dramatically<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.860> 6.3

just jumps up dramatically to 6.3

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:08.270 
just jumps up dramatically to 6.3
because<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.299> last<00:02:07.020> twist<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.770> know<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.009> just

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
because that last twist you know it just

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.710 
because that last twist you know it just
becomes<00:02:08.519> so<00:02:08.880> much<00:02:09.000> more<00:02:09.060> difficult<00:02:09.390> when

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
becomes so much more difficult when

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:18.610 
becomes so much more difficult when
you're<00:02:09.840> going<00:02:10.049> above<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.590> twist

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.380 

in<00:02:19.620> fact<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.980> judges<00:02:20.370> are<00:02:20.640> not<00:02:20.849> supposed<00:02:21.269> to

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
in fact the judges are not supposed to

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.229 
in fact the judges are not supposed to
take<00:02:22.019> DD<00:02:22.470> into<00:02:22.800> account<00:02:23.129> their<00:02:23.640> scores<00:02:24.060> are

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
take DD into account their scores are

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.869 
take DD into account their scores are
multiplied<00:02:24.750> by<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.019> DD<00:02:25.470> afterwards<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:26.730> they

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
multiplied by the DD afterwards so they

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.339 
multiplied by the DD afterwards so they
just<00:02:26.910> have<00:02:27.239> to<00:02:27.269> take<00:02:27.540> every<00:02:27.959> dive

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
just have to take every dive

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.979 
just have to take every dive
individually<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.459> try<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.209> pick<00:02:30.629> out<00:02:30.810> the

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
individually and try and pick out the

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:37.160 
individually and try and pick out the
faults<00:02:35.030> you<00:02:36.030> want<00:02:36.239> to<00:02:36.360> have<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.599> highest<00:02:36.780> d

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
faults you want to have the highest d

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.100 
faults you want to have the highest d
that<00:02:37.349> you<00:02:37.500> can<00:02:37.799> but<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:39.180> judges<00:02:39.629> are<00:02:39.810> giving

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
that you can but the judges are giving

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.740 
that you can but the judges are giving
you<00:02:40.200> scores<00:02:40.580> based<00:02:41.580> only<00:02:41.819> on<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.209> dive<00:02:42.450> and

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
you scores based only on the dive and

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.990 
you scores based only on the dive and
not<00:02:42.900> degree<00:02:43.349> of<00:02:43.440> difficulty<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.760> have<00:02:44.879> to

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
not degree of difficulty so you have to

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.820 
not degree of difficulty so you have to
make<00:02:45.120> sure<00:02:45.180> you<00:02:45.420> do<00:02:45.569> good<00:02:46.019> quality<00:02:46.230> dives<00:02:46.650> you

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
make sure you do good quality dives you

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.259 
make sure you do good quality dives you
want<00:02:47.010> high<00:02:47.190> degree<00:02:47.519> of<00:02:47.549> difficulty<00:02:48.030> but<00:02:48.150> you

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
want high degree of difficulty but you

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.509 
want high degree of difficulty but you
want<00:02:48.450> good<00:02:48.630> quality<00:02:49.019> dives<00:02:49.280> just<00:02:50.280> doing

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
want good quality dives just doing

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.610 
want good quality dives just doing
difficult<00:02:51.120> dives<00:02:51.299> for<00:02:51.630> low<00:02:51.810> scores<00:02:52.170> it's<00:02:52.410> just

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
difficult dives for low scores it's just

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.660 
difficult dives for low scores it's just
not<00:02:52.680> going<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.040> count<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:55.250> don't<00:02:56.250> think<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.519> can

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
not going to count I don't think you can

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.479 
not going to count I don't think you can
really<00:02:56.730> put<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.180> limit<00:02:57.750> on<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.200> DD<00:02:58.590> because<00:02:59.340> if

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
really put a limit on the DD because if

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.580 
really put a limit on the DD because if
you<00:02:59.610> look<00:02:59.790> back<00:02:59.970> at<00:03:00.180> 10<00:03:00.329> meter<00:03:00.630> diving<00:03:00.840> 30

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
you look back at 10 meter diving 30

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.080 
you look back at 10 meter diving 30
years<00:03:01.950> ago<00:03:02.099> they<00:03:02.610> wouldn't<00:03:02.879> have<00:03:02.970> even

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
years ago they wouldn't have even

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.000 
years ago they wouldn't have even
imagined<00:03:03.660> doing<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:04.440> dives<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:04.860> they're

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
imagined doing the dives that they're

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.680 
imagined doing the dives that they're
doing<00:03:05.250> now<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.670> it's<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.150> same<00:03:06.390> for<00:03:06.569> this

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
doing now and it's the same for this

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.660 
doing now and it's the same for this
sport<00:03:07.049> it's<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.560> relatively<00:03:07.950> new<00:03:08.430> sport

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
sport it's a relatively new sport

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.970 
sport it's a relatively new sport
there's<00:03:09.120> only<00:03:09.299> being<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.230> few<00:03:10.440> years<00:03:10.680> where

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
there's only being a few years where

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.559 
there's only being a few years where
people<00:03:11.310> have<00:03:11.430> been<00:03:11.579> really<00:03:11.760> pushing<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.360> and

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
people have been really pushing it and

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:24.280 
people have been really pushing it and
so<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:12.810> think<00:03:12.989> it's<00:03:13.200> got<00:03:13.379> a<00:03:13.410> long<00:03:13.680> way<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:13.920> go

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.240 

every<00:03:25.290> year<00:03:25.320> I<00:03:25.500> think<00:03:25.590> there's<00:03:25.920> just<00:03:26.010> gonna<00:03:26.130> be

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
every year I think there's just gonna be

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.890 
every year I think there's just gonna be
bigger<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.790> harder<00:03:27.060> dives<00:03:27.360> that<00:03:27.570> come<00:03:27.750> out

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
bigger and harder dives that come out

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.270 
bigger and harder dives that come out
and<00:03:28.140> it's<00:03:28.260> it's<00:03:28.440> just<00:03:28.530> really<00:03:28.830> cool<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:29.160> see

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.580 
and it's it's just really cool to see
him<00:03:29.550> and<00:03:29.730> it's<00:03:30.600> awesome<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.960> be<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:31.110> part<00:03:31.170> of<00:03:31.440> it

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
him and it's awesome to be a part of it

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.290 
him and it's awesome to be a part of it
to<00:03:31.740> push<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.040> envelope<00:03:32.070> myself<00:03:32.790> it's<00:03:32.970> just<00:03:33.180> an

to push the envelope myself it's just an

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.940 
to push the envelope myself it's just an
extraordinary<00:03:33.840> feeling<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:34.530> it's<00:03:34.620> nice<00:03:34.800> to
