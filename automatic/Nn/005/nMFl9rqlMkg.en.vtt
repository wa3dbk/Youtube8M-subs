00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:11.339
 Hello everyone 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.579
 today it lets me in, a song is on sale 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:15.760
 well known 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.119
 but also very easy to play 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.950
 the song develops on the first 3 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.009
 guitar keys 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.899
 and then there are only the tillate agreement 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:29.329
 and this attention so 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.329
 and then the low agreement 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.440
 well let's start the song 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.440
 let's do the first 5 nights 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.600
 then 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.370
 how you do it 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.410
 the woolen string is played 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.450
 terrible 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.450
 p in the seven hundred key 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.800
 then I realized nothing - the third key 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.070
 and then agreed - the first 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.530
 if I run a meal 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.530
 and then the third button 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.710
 at this point the song continues 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.720
 wilson always has the colic chord 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.720
 first by pressing the third button 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.100
 then the second 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.410
 and then playing the swimming rope 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.730
 presents no key to the premier 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.040
 at least we do it again from the beginning 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.040
 let's make a small summary 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.040
 now let's continue 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.360
 there is a no-charge agreement 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.730
 with the third key thrill 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.730
 exciting the tail side of the vacuum 

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:17.399
 the song continues 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.709
 then you still play first string 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.719
 but I'm short of books - the third button 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.599
 and then prink by pressing the first key 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:38.619
 in my opinion the last passage is the most difficult song 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.459
 then there are 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.459
 the mini deal by pressing the first meal 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:54.249
 the empty woolen rope 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:57.209
 and then 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.030
 still corradini taking the first the third excused button 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.459
 at this point the song begins 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:13.319
 now I'll make you a whore again 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.599
 but look at you carefully 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.599
 with my fingers to make it slowly 

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:50.719
 present where started again 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:55.199
 this song I did not learn immediately by watching this video 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:04:00.129
 marco watching him a few times and above all because he started playing 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:01.729
 the guitar recently 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:05.290
 in the group of even a week this song is learned 

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:10.139
 thank you all and see you with other videos about music
