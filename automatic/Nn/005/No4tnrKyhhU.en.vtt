success so I believe it's right to look

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.950 
success so I believe it's right to look
through<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.670> theories<00:00:12.090> that<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:12.450> guys<00:00:12.690> have

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
through the theories that you guys have

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.620 
through the theories that you guys have
set<00:00:13.170> me<00:00:13.349> within<00:00:14.099> thousands<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:15.030> comments<00:00:15.360> left

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
set me within thousands of comments left

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.590 
set me within thousands of comments left
on<00:00:15.750> these<00:00:15.929> videos<00:00:16.789> now<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:18.090> don't<00:00:18.210> believe<00:00:18.480> a

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
on these videos now I don't believe a

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.170 
on these videos now I don't believe a
theory<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.109> dead<00:00:19.590> wrong<00:00:19.890> unless<00:00:20.730> it's<00:00:20.910> really

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
theory is dead wrong unless it's really

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.840 
theory is dead wrong unless it's really
out<00:00:21.420> there<00:00:21.750> or<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.170> has<00:00:22.410> no<00:00:23.070> grounded<00:00:23.550> facts

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
out there or it has no grounded facts

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.359 
out there or it has no grounded facts
disproving<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.350> will<00:00:25.650> merely<00:00:25.830> tell<00:00:26.220> you

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
disproving it so I will merely tell you

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.240 
disproving it so I will merely tell you
guys<00:00:26.490> what<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.820> think<00:00:27.150> would<00:00:27.359> disprove<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.990> or

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
guys what I think would disprove it or

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.269 
guys what I think would disprove it or
no<00:00:29.250> perhaps<00:00:29.910> it's<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.420> good<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:31.279> nothing

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
no perhaps it's so good that nothing

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.260 
no perhaps it's so good that nothing
could<00:00:32.399> disprove<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.910> let's<00:00:33.870> see<00:00:34.790> now<00:00:35.790> click

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
could disprove it let's see now click

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.150 
could disprove it let's see now click
notice<00:00:36.660> sorry<00:00:37.350> if<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.649> don't<00:00:37.800> pronounce<00:00:37.950> your

notice sorry if I don't pronounce your
name<00:00:38.250> rights<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.940> am<00:00:39.329> not<00:00:39.510> good<00:00:39.660> with<00:00:39.690> names<00:00:39.960> so

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
name rights I am not good with names so

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.130 
name rights I am not good with names so
let's<00:00:41.070> get<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:42.270> first<00:00:42.570> theory<00:00:42.899> came

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
let's get to it the first theory came

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.540 
let's get to it the first theory came
from<00:00:43.379> ice<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.730> Harvey<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:46.309> think<00:00:47.309> gonna

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
from ice and Harvey I think gonna

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.310 
from ice and Harvey I think gonna
freddie<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> hallucination<00:00:48.570> along<00:00:49.289> with

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
freddie is a hallucination along with

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.200 
freddie is a hallucination along with
Bonnie<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.829> chica<00:00:49.980> twitching<00:00:50.760> on<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.030> night

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
Bonnie and chica twitching on the night

for<00:00:51.469> Mike<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.680> paranoid<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.430> he<00:00:53.460> thinks<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.820> su

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
for Mike is paranoid and he thinks a su

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.729 
for Mike is paranoid and he thinks a su
is<00:00:54.239> there<00:00:54.449> which<00:00:54.629> causes<00:00:55.050> him<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.230> paralyze<00:00:55.710> a

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
is there which causes him to paralyze a

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.880 
is there which causes him to paralyze a
fear<00:00:56.719> rendering<00:00:57.719> him<00:00:57.930> unable<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.559> check<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
fear rendering him unable to check the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.170 
fear rendering him unable to check the
cameras<00:00:59.300> then<00:01:00.300> he<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.600> found<00:01:00.870> but<00:01:01.969> 1987<00:01:02.969> maybe

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
cameras then he is found but 1987 maybe

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.840 
cameras then he is found but 1987 maybe
his<00:01:03.539> memories<00:01:03.930> creeping<00:01:04.320> up<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.619> him<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.920> think

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
his memories creeping up on him I think

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.789 
his memories creeping up on him I think
he<00:01:05.970> has<00:01:06.030> SaLuSa<00:01:06.390> nations<00:01:06.780> because<00:01:07.110> he<00:01:07.680> was

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
he has SaLuSa nations because he was

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.280 
he has SaLuSa nations because he was
bitten<00:01:08.040> by<00:01:08.130> foxy<00:01:08.670> he<00:01:09.479> can't<00:01:09.720> remember<00:01:10.020> he<00:01:10.170> was

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
bitten by foxy he can't remember he was

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.660 
bitten by foxy he can't remember he was
there<00:01:10.560> but<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:11.100> explains<00:01:11.460> the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
there but that explains the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.270 
there but that explains the
hallucinations<00:01:12.740> which<00:01:13.740> he<00:01:13.860> returns<00:01:14.189> to

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
hallucinations which he returns to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.910 
hallucinations which he returns to
Freddy<00:01:14.520> fast<00:01:14.729> for<00:01:14.909> pizza<00:01:15.270> because<00:01:15.780> he<00:01:16.770> feels

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
Freddy fast for pizza because he feels

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.240 
Freddy fast for pizza because he feels
connected<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.700> but<00:01:18.479> he<00:01:18.630> doesn't<00:01:18.900> know<00:01:18.930> why

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
connected to it but he doesn't know why

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.850 
connected to it but he doesn't know why
now<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> theory<00:01:21.180> for<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.390> few<00:01:21.630> reasons

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
now I like the theory for a few reasons

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.140 
now I like the theory for a few reasons
it<00:01:22.860> stays<00:01:23.189> at<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.430> subject<00:01:23.820> matter<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
it stays at the subject matter of the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.850 
it stays at the subject matter of the
game<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.509> maintains<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.439> hallucination

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
game and maintains a hallucination

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.980 
game and maintains a hallucination
theory<00:01:26.400> which<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.210> personally<00:01:27.509> believe<00:01:27.750> is

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
theory which I personally believe is

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.910 
theory which I personally believe is
true<00:01:28.790> it<00:01:29.790> also<00:01:30.000> does<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> plot<00:01:30.689> twist<00:01:30.920> perhaps

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
true it also does a plot twist perhaps

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.620 
true it also does a plot twist perhaps
Mike<00:01:32.250> was<00:01:32.460> bitten<00:01:32.670> by<00:01:32.790> foxy<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.450> bite<00:01:33.600> of

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
Mike was bitten by foxy in the bite of

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.030 
Mike was bitten by foxy in the bite of
87<00:01:34.320> now<00:01:35.280> am<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.850> by<00:01:36.000> 287<00:01:36.689> video<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.350> never<00:01:37.770> said

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
87 now am I by 287 video I never said

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.999 
87 now am I by 287 video I never said
who<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.220> victim<00:01:38.670> was<00:01:38.700> only<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.720> suspect<00:01:40.200> foxy

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
who the victim was only the suspect foxy

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.120 
who the victim was only the suspect foxy
so<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:41.880> very<00:01:42.150> convincing<00:01:42.860> okay<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:43.920> I

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
so this is very convincing okay so I

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.010 
so this is very convincing okay so I
know<00:01:44.250> what<00:01:44.579> most<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.119> are<00:01:45.240> posting<00:01:45.450> but

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
know what most of you are posting but

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.010 
know what most of you are posting but
the<00:01:46.170> person<00:01:46.380> who<00:01:46.590> was<00:01:46.710> bit<00:01:46.920> was<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> little<00:01:47.430> girl

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
the person who was bit was a little girl

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.950 
the person who was bit was a little girl
but<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.590> my<00:01:49.770> knowledge<00:01:50.390> that<00:01:51.390> was<00:01:51.570> nearly<00:01:51.810> a

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
but to my knowledge that was nearly a

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.350 
but to my knowledge that was nearly a
rumor<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.560> like<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.460> think<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.820> was<00:01:53.909> Mike<00:01:54.180> as<00:01:54.329> a

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
rumor I like to think it was Mike as a

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.719 
rumor I like to think it was Mike as a
child<00:01:54.680> however<00:01:55.680> with<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> lot<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.340> these<00:01:56.399> traits

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
child however with a lot of these traits

now his video is very convincing and
it's<00:04:53.110> a<00:04:53.259> fantastic<00:04:53.830> video<00:04:53.949> I<00:04:54.099> suggest<00:04:54.729> looking

00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:54.879 
it's a fantastic video I suggest looking

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:57.480 
it's a fantastic video I suggest looking

I<00:05:14.259> make<00:05:14.500> these<00:05:14.650> videos<00:05:16.110> now<00:05:17.110> I<00:05:17.439> have<00:05:17.830> a<00:05:17.889> few

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
I make these videos now I have a few

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:20.189 
I make these videos now I have a few
things<00:05:18.129> to<00:05:18.430> say<00:05:18.610> before<00:05:18.759> I<00:05:18.969> log<00:05:19.180> off<00:05:19.389> firstly

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
things to say before I log off firstly

thank you guys so much for making the
series<00:05:22.990> of<00:05:23.139> success<00:05:23.639> it<00:05:24.639> really<00:05:25.060> makes<00:05:25.240> me

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
these enjoying these videos I was

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.610 
these enjoying these videos I was
thinking<00:05:30.610> of<00:05:30.849> taking<00:05:30.909> this<00:05:31.389> decode<00:05:31.750> series<00:05:32.139> to

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
thinking of taking this decode series to

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.189 
thinking of taking this decode series to
a<00:05:32.650> different<00:05:33.009> game<00:05:33.360> I'm<00:05:34.360> not<00:05:34.539> quite<00:05:34.719> sure<00:05:34.750> yet

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 
a different game I'm not quite sure yet

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:37.379 
a different game I'm not quite sure yet
