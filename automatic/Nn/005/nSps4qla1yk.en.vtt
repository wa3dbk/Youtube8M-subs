00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
twenty percent from philosopher books

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.689 
twenty percent from philosopher books
and<00:00:24.300> i<00:00:24.359> found<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.689> fifty<00:00:25.050> percent<00:00:25.230> for<00:00:25.410> cheap

and i found the fifty percent for cheap

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.429 
and i found the fifty percent for cheap
so<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:27.029> was<00:00:27.779> originally<00:00:27.990> gonna<00:00:28.230> use<00:00:28.410> a

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
so I was originally gonna use a

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.779 
so I was originally gonna use a
50-percent<00:00:28.890> first<00:00:29.099> but<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.340> changed<00:00:29.699> my<00:00:29.760> mind

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
50-percent first but I changed my mind

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.099 
50-percent first but I changed my mind
he<00:00:30.119> was<00:00:30.179> thirty<00:00:30.359> percent<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.810> ended<00:00:31.019> up

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
he was thirty percent and ended up

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.729 
he was thirty percent and ended up
working<00:00:31.289> adding<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:32.009> attack<00:00:32.489> four<00:00:32.940> decks<00:00:33.180> and

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
working adding to attack four decks and

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.530 
working adding to attack four decks and
I<00:00:34.739> said<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.790> know<00:00:35.880> what<00:00:35.910> we've<00:00:36.180> had<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.390> for

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
so long waiting to scroll it I don't

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.790 
so long waiting to scroll it I don't
even<00:00:38.579> care<00:00:38.760> for<00:00:38.910> fails<00:00:39.379> so<00:00:40.379> he's<00:00:40.530> fifty

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
even care for fails so he's fifty

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.260 
even care for fails so he's fifty

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
superior wards were in cash shop at a

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.610 
superior wards were in cash shop at a
time<00:00:51.180> along<00:00:51.660> with<00:00:51.690> guardian<00:00:52.110> scrolls<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.590> i

time along with guardian scrolls and i

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.250 
time along with guardian scrolls and i
had<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.920> go<00:00:53.129> boom<00:00:53.390> advanced<00:00:54.390> enhancements

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
had to go boom advanced enhancements

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.510 
had to go boom advanced enhancements
that<00:00:55.320> i<00:00:55.469> wanted<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.829> use<00:00:56.539> so<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.899> i<00:00:58.020> had<00:00:58.140> some

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
that i wanted to use so and i had some

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.349 
that i wanted to use so and i had some
five-star<00:00:59.520> enhancement<00:00:59.910> scrolls<00:01:00.120> from<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
five-star enhancement scrolls from the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.619 
five-star enhancement scrolls from the
hot<00:01:00.510> times<00:01:01.699> so<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.730> would<00:01:03.120> save<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.539> that

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
hot times so that would save and that

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.990 
hot times so that would save and that
saves<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.930> ton<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.110> an<00:01:04.290> axe<00:01:04.820> something<00:01:05.820> here

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
saves a ton of an axe something here

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.730 
saves a ton of an axe something here
past<00:01:06.270> thirty<00:01:06.479> percent<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> 50-percent<00:01:07.530> and

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
past thirty percent and a 50-percent and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.200 
past thirty percent and a 50-percent and
then<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.369> passed<00:01:08.520> another<00:01:08.640> fifty<00:01:08.970> percent

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
then it passed another fifty percent

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.770 
then it passed another fifty percent
with<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.710> five-star<00:01:10.909> so<00:01:11.909> odds<00:01:12.540> haven't

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
with the five-star so odds haven't

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.820 
with the five-star so odds haven't
really<00:01:13.020> good<00:01:13.140> luck<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.500> i<00:01:13.560> had<00:01:13.680> another

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
really good luck and i had another

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.010 
really good luck and i had another
shielding<00:01:14.280> ward<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.390> I'm<00:01:15.570> Maigari<00:01:15.869> this

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
shielding ward and so I'm Maigari this

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.600 
shielding ward and so I'm Maigari this
forty<00:01:16.320> percent<00:01:16.590> most<00:01:16.950> likely<00:01:17.189> gonna<00:01:17.280> fail

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
forty percent most likely gonna fail

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.670 
forty percent most likely gonna fail
don't<00:01:18.420> usually<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.840> good<00:01:19.049> luck

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
find NX ehlers because i switched to my

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.719 
find NX ehlers because i switched to my
marksman<00:01:54.530> mostly<00:01:55.149> and<00:01:56.649> people<00:01:57.649> don't<00:01:58.130> know<00:01:58.700> me
