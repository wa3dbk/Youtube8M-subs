00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:14.510
 rff and sncf have engaged in this 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.599
 communication action to make 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.760
 to make customers aware that the 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.740
 network is being renovated in 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.310
 the operation is planned for a period of 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.130
 six months 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.859
 we have set up stands in the station 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.350
 we are also going ahead of 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.390
 customers by going to see them in the 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.190
 trains by passing them ads by 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.559
 the controllers and we put to their 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.320
 provision of information on 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.510
 modifications of their journey especially 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:50.540
 their set of devices 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:53.690
 travelers information you have before 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.370
 you a fish on the phone to have the 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.620
 head to say we remove the ties of the 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.030
 rail to separate the rail from 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.550
 through 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.580
 as a result of audits done in the middle of 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.640
 the 2000s we accelerated the 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.650
 work we have more than doubled 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.049
 we went from less than 500 km 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.540
 see renewed every year at more than 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.520
 1000 and we came back for 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.470
 long years in vain the mans a 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.690
 fifteen years in a rhythm of 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.280
 very intense work clearly the 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.720
 building site for us is regeneration 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.759
 of the network what will allow us 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.220
 to have a much safer network 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.020
 much more reliable and that we 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.149
 will make a lot less of 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.240
 maintenance of needing an accident 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:39.080
 and to have security assured at all 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.929
 time in the cards because 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.090
 necessarily the rail to remove it from 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.159
 through for bass and outside 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.759
 working to be able to take the 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.220
 crossing 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.039
 here where we are behind us we 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.890
 we see considerable work and 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.780
 in a few hours 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.090
 will have trains that will roll on these 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.970
 ways is to know how to make unique 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.670
 than that of doing work on a 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.840
 network exploited and this knowledge is 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.810
 the railwaymen 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.289
 it is that of the sncf it is that of 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.440
 rff 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.660
 this site is composed of about 15 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.600
 this one train so whose two more 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.000
 important are two trails in which are 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.570
 first is behind us the train of 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.850
 costs or in addition a substitution where 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.770
 we renew to the components that on 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.400
 the sleepers and the rail and the train 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.010
 plant behind that one will lift the 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.470
 old balas for then we can 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.510
 discharging the ballast means 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.980
 it's 50 million euros 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.590
 these 500 agents on the jobsite 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.050
 that is to say from its 350 agents 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.090
 150 railway workers who 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.110
 safety train traffic the 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.970
 technical security 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.070
 so that means it's a big factory 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.340
 who move every night from 1000 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:01.300
 meters to successfully make the 40 km 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.300
