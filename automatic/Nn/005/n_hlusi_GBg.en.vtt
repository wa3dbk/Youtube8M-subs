00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.620
 the threat coming from the sky scientists 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.730
 warn the sun can cause a disaster 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.070
 unprecedented 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.009
 a major solar storm is 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.670
 way and the worst there is no way to 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:24.050
 accuracy when and how it will achieve 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.050
 earth the earth threatened by the sun 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.430
 is it that the imagination of the studios of 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.430
 hollywood have some basis in reality 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.930
 the solar storms 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.180
 many of them have already been 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.489
 registered by observers and 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.289
 scientists 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:50.989
 and to get an idea of ​​what can 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.989
 happen you have to go back in time 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:58.940
 in 1859 the land was hit by a 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.700
 solar storm so intense that it 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.750
 telegrams operators took 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.020
 violent 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.240
 pifaram the machines and in many cases 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.200
 papers that were on the telegraphs 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.200
 they caught fire 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.560
 at that time more than 150 years 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.530
 electricity was little used but today 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.050
 what would happen if we were 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.540
 hit again by a storm 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.180
 very strong solar 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.180
 you may even have loss signal loss 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.310
 of gps and telephony and transmission of 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.619
 electric power communication can get 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.960
 no communication on earth a bit of 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.800
 impact has already been registered in time 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.670
 recent 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:48.370
 in March 1989 6 million Canadians 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:51.130
 no light for more than nine hours 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.500
 according to the nasa an eruption in the sun affected 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.440
 the power transmission lines of the 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.860
 Canada and came to hold transformers 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.620
 new jersey in the united states 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.560
 July 2000 the sun caused a short 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.040
 circuits and satellites and left many 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.320
 radios off the air 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.120
 jeff and is now an astrophysicist at the 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.460
 natural history of new york 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.860
 he explains that the sun is a star with 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.680
 super- gas masses in October in 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.250
 constant movement inside it is 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.640
 quite stable in the old 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.920
 surface is quite different happens in 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.410
 solutions that deliver a great 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.900
 amount of energy that good sound 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:39.220
 material loses the call 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.530
 sky solar storms want to give a 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.140
 example because it's like you you 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.620
 twisting an elastic twisting cheer 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.200
 until he mops the material gate 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.880
 expelled from software released with force 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.709
 total towards the earth 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.709
 it will wreak havoc 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:01.689
 this week one of the biggest newspapers in the 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.840
 world the new york times warned in 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:08.469
 your headline forecast for storm 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.810
 a small chance of destruction 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:13.659
 the reason is that in recent months the sun 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.920
 reached the peak of a cycle 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:20.889
 the sun goes through cycles of 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.459
 about 11-year where 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:27.459
 you have maxima and minima of activity 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.409
 which can be quantified by 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.389
 by means of a count of the number of 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:33.310
 sunspots 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.659
 we're getting close to the maximum then 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.449
 every time we come close to the 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:39.519
 maximum cycle exists that this 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:42.549
 expectation that it might happen 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:45.069
 strong magnetic storms stains 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.379
 means changes in the 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.680
 temperature and pressure conditions of 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:53.260
 gases from the sun as more stains 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.810
 chances of storms and at this moment 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.349
 only registers a high number of points 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.349
 blacks 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.560
 when not handle the solar flares 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:07.250
 land in full effect is not always as 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.250
 spooky 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.230
 can be a show of lights in the sky like 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:19.910
 that 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:22.850
 the well-known Northern Lights predict 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.479
 storms will happen when they go 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:29.449
 happen is still impossible not to give 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.830
 predicting the event can predict the cycle 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.750
 during which time you will have more events 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.010
 and less events right? 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.139
 but the event is completely 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.810
 unpredictable as an earthquake 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.539
 pessimists fear that 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.729
 energy are affected and effect 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:47.030
 cascade leave two or even three 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:49.750
 continents totally in the dark by 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.750
 more than one month 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.770
 many Americans are already preparing 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.870
 keirrison is part of a group of 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.700
 prevented alarms 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.310
 he is very likely to have to 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:06.780
 facing a long period without energy 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:09.720
 the public can not imagine until the lack of 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:14.850
 light can affect the economy and cause 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:21.650
 chaos here on earth does not want it luckily 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:25.260
 on the field so they hollow all of this 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.660
 The fireman is always ready too. 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.000
 to escape from New York with his wife and 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.650
 daughters if the situation gets very 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.400
 complicated 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:38.610
 the Portuguese will put on the head in the lamp of 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.730
 put on the head to stay with the hand 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.880
 free to be able to move things in the floor 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.880
 in the dark 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:50.050
 Jackson said the family can live 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:54.970
 backpack for more than a week 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:57.699
 heavy for people like jackson does not 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:00.389
 knowing when the storm is coming is the 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:00.389
 more scary 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.130
 people were already the weather forecast 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.020
 here on earth 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.850
 imagine a prediction of space weather 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.650
 because it's much harder for you 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.800
 get accurate data because people 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.600
 use the satellite and it is much more 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.370
 complicated we do not know each other so well 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.930
 we are studying these phenomena there 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.300
 as long as we study the 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.500
 then consider a rather 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.080
 complicated 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.960
 nowadays many satellites observe 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.730
 they have the mission to disclose what they 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.100
 happens to 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:37.850
 hydroelectric power distribution networks 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:40.790
 energy and pipeline managers 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:43.580
 so you can try to prevent yourself 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.950
 according to cfp today we will have little more than 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:50.060
 eight hours until the solar storm 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:51.770
 reach the earth and the scientist thinks 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.230
 we will suffer with a great deal 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.150
 storm in the next few months or weeks 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:59.180
 for the penalties 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:01.550
 he does not risk a forecast but thinks 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:04.600
 We should also think of other 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:07.310
 ways disaster can come 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.830
 the amount of material a 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:12.380
 solar storm would launch into our 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.960
 direction is about 100 million 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:17.930
 tons more or less the same 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:20.900
 amount of carbon dioxide that 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:23.420
 we launch into the atmosphere every day with 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:26.150
 our machines and cars for him 

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.950
 we should be much more concerned 

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.710
 with the consequences of warming 

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:35.200
 or with the damage of a 

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:37.730
 solar storm should always be aware 

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.060
 man can take care of 

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:43.750
 already the fury of nature for now 

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.750
 remains unpredictable
