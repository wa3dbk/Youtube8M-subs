creep and friends i'm going to show you
guys<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.630> 1.5<00:00:20.180> counter<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.810> basically<00:00:22.619> it's

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
guys a 1.5 counter so basically it's

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
guys a 1.5 counter so basically it's
just<00:00:22.860> press<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.189> button<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.840> that<00:00:24.840> lights<00:00:25.079> up

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
just press a button and that lights up

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.370 
just press a button and that lights up
this<00:00:26.820> doesn't<00:00:27.119> have<00:00:27.239> to<00:00:27.270> be<00:00:27.419> redstone<00:00:27.960> lamps

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
this doesn't have to be redstone lamps

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.100 
this doesn't have to be redstone lamps
but<00:00:28.980> i<00:00:29.279> just<00:00:29.970> did<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.239> to<00:00:30.270> display<00:00:30.810> how<00:00:31.020> it

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
but i just did that to display how it

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.160 
but i just did that to display how it
works<00:00:31.320> one<00:00:32.279> downside<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.060> is<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.390> when

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
works one downside to this is that when

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.960 
works one downside to this is that when
you<00:00:34.290> press<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.649> button<00:00:34.680> for<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.550> last<00:00:35.760> one

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
you press the button for the last one

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.240 
you press the button for the last one
takes<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.989> little<00:00:37.140> bit<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.500> get<00:00:37.590> back<00:00:37.800> but<00:00:38.100> it's

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
takes a little bit to get back but it's

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.439 
takes a little bit to get back but it's
not<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.579> long<00:00:38.760> because<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.120> will<00:00:39.210> show<00:00:39.329> light

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
not that long because it will show light

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:42.139 
not that long because it will show light
up<00:00:39.539> right<00:00:39.750> now<00:00:40.640> so<00:00:41.640> i'll<00:00:41.789> show<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.000> guys<00:00:42.059> how

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
up right now so i'll show you guys how

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.139 
up right now so i'll show you guys how
to<00:00:42.269> make<00:00:42.359> this<00:00:43.039> so<00:00:44.039> first<00:00:44.280> off<00:00:44.489> if<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.789> isn't

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
to make this so first off if you isn't

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.599 
to make this so first off if you isn't
using<00:00:45.510> redstone<00:00:45.899> lamps<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:47.100> will<00:00:47.250> need<00:00:47.370> to

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
using redstone lamps you will need to

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:52.279 
using redstone lamps you will need to
put<00:00:49.910> blocks<00:00:50.910> under<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> redstone<00:00:51.960> lamps

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
put blocks under the redstone lamps

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.650 
put blocks under the redstone lamps
because<00:00:53.190> that's<00:00:53.370> what<00:00:53.460> will<00:00:53.670> be<00:00:53.789> powered<00:00:54.149> that

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
because that's what will be powered that

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.119 
because that's what will be powered that
way<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.929> won't<00:00:55.019> power<00:00:55.199> put<00:00:55.500> two<00:00:55.769> reds<00:00:55.949> or

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
way it won't power put two reds or

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.229 
way it won't power put two reds or
mounts<00:00:56.399> at<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.670> time<00:00:58.609> otherwise<00:00:59.609> if<00:00:59.969> you're

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
mounts at a time otherwise if you're

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.930 
mounts at a time otherwise if you're
using<00:01:00.480> anything<00:01:01.109> else<00:01:01.519> they'll<00:01:02.519> need<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.730> be<00:01:02.909> a

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
using anything else they'll need to be a

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.030 
using anything else they'll need to be a
repeater<00:01:03.830> one<00:01:04.880> after<00:01:05.880> or<00:01:06.150> right<00:01:06.450> next<00:01:06.870> to<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
repeater one after or right next to the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.020 
repeater one after or right next to the
comparator<00:01:09.200> because<00:01:10.340> it<00:01:11.340> only<00:01:11.490> goes<00:01:11.700> one

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
comparator because it only goes one

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.970 
comparator because it only goes one
redstone<00:01:13.250> length<00:01:14.780> ok<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.320> then<00:01:16.470> what<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.710> do

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 
redstone length ok so then what you do

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.630 
redstone length ok so then what you do
is<00:01:17.160> place<00:01:17.760> a<00:01:17.790> block<00:01:18.240> right<00:01:18.660> here<00:01:18.690> sorry<00:01:19.650> get

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
is place a block right here sorry get

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.680 
is place a block right here sorry get
out<00:01:20.760> your<00:01:20.910> hopper<00:01:22.970> place<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> hopper<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.570> it's

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
out your hopper place a hopper so it's

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.270 
out your hopper place a hopper so it's
pointing<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.170> block<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.920> then<00:01:25.980> hold<00:01:26.190> shift

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
pointing that block and then hold shift

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.940 
pointing that block and then hold shift
and<00:01:26.760> the<00:01:27.510> place<00:01:27.660> hoppers<00:01:28.050> going<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.470> all<00:01:28.650> into

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
and the place hoppers going it all into

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.000 
and the place hoppers going it all into
that<00:01:29.750> now<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> hopper<00:01:31.350> going<00:01:31.650> into<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:31.950> last

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
that now a hopper going into this last

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.820 
that now a hopper going into this last
one<00:01:33.080> and<00:01:34.080> delete<00:01:34.230> that<00:01:34.440> block<00:01:34.650> now

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
one and delete that block now

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.280 
one and delete that block now
operational<00:01:35.700> going<00:01:36.090> into<00:01:36.330> that<00:01:36.510> so<00:01:37.110> then<00:01:37.200> it

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
operational going into that so then it

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.700 
operational going into that so then it
just<00:01:37.380> basically<00:01:37.560> makes<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.040> complete<00:01:38.310> circle<00:01:39.710> I

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
just basically makes a complete circle I

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.810 
just basically makes a complete circle I
don't<00:01:41.100> know<00:01:41.160> if<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.280> mentioned<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.640> already

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
don't know if I mentioned this already

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.370 
don't know if I mentioned this already
but<00:01:42.120> this<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.390> be<00:01:42.480> as<00:01:42.570> long<00:01:42.720> as<00:01:42.870> you<00:01:42.930> want<00:01:43.140> you

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
but this can be as long as you want you

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.600 
but this can be as long as you want you
just<00:01:43.500> need<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.680> make<00:01:43.800> the<00:01:43.920> complete<00:01:44.220> circle

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
just need to make the complete circle

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.899 
just need to make the complete circle
longer<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.480> course<00:01:45.860> um<00:01:48.230> bootsy's

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
longer of course um bootsy's

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:58.489 
longer of course um bootsy's
okay<00:01:51.780> now<00:01:52.499> take<00:01:52.560> under<00:01:55.520> and<00:01:56.749> I<00:01:57.749> we<00:01:58.049> tried<00:01:58.079> doing

00:01:58.489 --> 00:01:58.499 
okay now take under and I we tried doing

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:02.959 
okay now take under and I we tried doing
this<00:01:59.390> great<00:02:00.390> under<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:01.049> one<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.920> line<00:02:02.789> of

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
this great under the one the line of

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.730 
this great under the one the line of
hoppers<00:02:03.299> closest<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.079> redstone<00:02:04.469> lamps

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
hoppers closest to the redstone lamps

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.919 
hoppers closest to the redstone lamps
put<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:04.979> bunch<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.250> torches<00:02:06.079> and<00:02:07.079> then<00:02:08.750> dig<00:02:09.750> like

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
put a bunch of torches and then dig like

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.530 
put a bunch of torches and then dig like
that<00:02:10.170> put<00:02:11.009> redstone<00:02:11.220> repeaters<00:02:11.819> going<00:02:12.239> into

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
that put redstone repeaters going into

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.740 
that put redstone repeaters going into
those<00:02:12.660> twitch<00:02:13.260> box<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:14.239> then<00:02:15.239> let's<00:02:15.480> don't

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
those twitch box and then let's don't

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.259 
those twitch box and then let's don't
behind<00:02:16.019> those<00:02:16.170> two<00:02:16.290> Pete<00:02:16.530> repeaters<00:02:17.989> now

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
behind those two Pete repeaters now

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.100 
behind those two Pete repeaters now
branch<00:02:21.269> it<00:02:21.450> off<00:02:21.569> I<00:02:21.989> think<00:02:22.620> one<00:02:22.860> will<00:02:22.980> be<00:02:23.129> enough

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
branch it off I think one will be enough

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.520 
branch it off I think one will be enough
let's<00:02:25.110> see<00:02:25.849> yet<00:02:26.849> one<00:02:27.030> will<00:02:27.150> be<00:02:27.239> good<00:02:27.329> enough

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
let's see yet one will be good enough

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.670 
let's see yet one will be good enough
okay<00:02:28.610> now<00:02:29.610> place<00:02:30.420> two<00:02:30.450> blocks<00:02:32.269> oops<00:02:33.470> place<00:02:34.470> two

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
okay now place two blocks oops place two

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.610 
okay now place two blocks oops place two
walks<00:02:35.090> one<00:02:36.090> above<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.629> red<00:02:36.810> zone<00:02:36.840> put<00:02:37.590> a
