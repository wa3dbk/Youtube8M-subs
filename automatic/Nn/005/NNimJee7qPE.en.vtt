00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.999 
friend of mine and you can't see there
but<00:01:29.729> it's<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.360> shawl<00:01:31.079> crystal<00:01:31.560> microphone

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
but it's the shawl crystal microphone

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.289 
but it's the shawl crystal microphone
and<00:01:33.229> it's<00:01:34.460> been<00:01:35.460> manufactured<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.060> 40s

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
and it's been manufactured in the 40s

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.969 
and it's been manufactured in the 40s
and<00:01:36.329> 50s<00:01:36.450> from<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.380> research<00:01:37.680> I've<00:01:37.799> done<00:01:37.829> I

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
and 50s from the research I've done I

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.010 
and 50s from the research I've done I
don't<00:01:38.250> know<00:01:38.369> exactly<00:01:38.880> when<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.509> one<00:01:39.720> was

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
don't know exactly when this one was

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.780 
don't know exactly when this one was
made<00:01:40.229> talk<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:40.979> pull<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.220> my<00:01:41.310> friend<00:01:41.549> only<00:01:41.700> 52

made talk I pull you my friend only 52
Burt<00:01:42.270> got<00:01:42.780> away<00:01:43.020> verifying<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.829> but<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:43.979> do

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
Burt got away verifying that but I do

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.730 
Burt got away verifying that but I do
know<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.970> would<00:01:45.149> have<00:01:45.270> been<00:01:45.360> made<00:01:45.619> probably<00:01:46.619> in

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
know it would have been made probably in

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.490 
know it would have been made probably in
the<00:01:46.860> 40s<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.340> all<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.549> 50s<00:01:48.170> is<00:01:49.170> there<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.409> only

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
the 40s of all the 50s is there the only

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.350 
the 40s of all the 50s is there the only
time<00:01:49.710> they<00:01:49.890> made<00:01:50.759> these<00:01:50.909> one<00:01:51.060> going<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.299> be

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
time they made these one going to be

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.050 
time they made these one going to be
reissued<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.920> color<00:01:53.189> or<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.490> style<00:01:53.700> I

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
reissued it in this color or the style I

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.889 
reissued it in this color or the style I
think<00:01:55.009> recently<00:01:56.149> anyway<00:01:57.149> at<00:01:57.270> least<00:01:57.299> least<00:01:57.719> not

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.209 
think recently anyway at least least not
with<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.079> badge<00:01:58.229> with<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.649> badge<00:01:58.770> on<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:59.009> foggy

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
with the badge with a badge on a foggy

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.090 
with the badge with a badge on a foggy
bottom<00:01:59.490> anyway

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
bottom anyway

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.000 
bottom anyway
the<00:02:02.610> older<00:02:02.850> microphones<00:02:03.270> tend<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.600> use

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
the older microphones tend to use

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.350 
the older microphones tend to use
different<00:02:05.010> technologies<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.640> could<00:02:06.060> crystal

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
different technologies I could crystal

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.460 
different technologies I could crystal
pick<00:02:06.540> up<00:02:06.690> and<00:02:07.760> that<00:02:08.760> gives<00:02:09.030> us<00:02:09.150> sort<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.470> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
pick up and that gives us sort of the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.030 
pick up and that gives us sort of the
one<00:02:10.619> tap

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
one tap

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.590 
one tap
louder<00:02:11.400> sound<00:02:11.760> which<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:11.970> more<00:02:12.240> common<00:02:12.570> to

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
louder sound which is more common to

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.680 
louder sound which is more common to
older<00:02:13.380> players<00:02:13.590> like<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:14.480> little<00:02:15.480> Walter

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
older players like a little Walter

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.570 
older players like a little Walter
especially<00:02:16.170> when<00:02:16.740> you<00:02:16.830> pay<00:02:16.950> them<00:02:17.070> a<00:02:17.160> different

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
especially when you pay them a different

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.450 
especially when you pay them a different
series<00:02:18.210> of<00:02:18.300> different<00:02:18.450> microphones<00:02:19.460> would

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
series of different microphones would

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.560 
series of different microphones would
imagine<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:21.030> probably<00:02:21.270> were<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.420> play

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
imagine you probably were to play

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.300 
imagine you probably were to play
something<00:02:21.840> like<00:02:21.960> this<00:02:22.050> at<00:02:22.200> least<00:02:22.410> some<00:02:22.890> points

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
something like this at least some points

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.030 
something like this at least some points
Korea<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:24.260> you<00:02:25.260> know<00:02:25.380> they're<00:02:25.530> fairly<00:02:25.710> fairly

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
Korea and you know they're fairly fairly

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.310 
Korea and you know they're fairly fairly
sought-after<00:02:26.660> anyway<00:02:27.660> it's<00:02:27.990> just<00:02:28.050> going<00:02:28.260> to

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
sought-after anyway it's just going to

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.290 
sought-after anyway it's just going to
do<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.410> demo<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:29.000> we'll<00:02:30.000> see<00:02:30.120> what<00:02:30.240> the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
do a demo and we'll see what the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.230 
do a demo and we'll see what the
difference<00:02:30.540> in<00:02:30.780> sound<00:02:30.960> is<00:02:31.340> okay<00:02:32.340> so<00:02:32.400> first<00:02:33.180> of

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
difference in sound is okay so first of

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.410 
difference in sound is okay so first of
all<00:02:33.300> plug<00:02:33.630> in<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.760> I'm<00:02:35.760> just<00:02:35.790> running<00:02:36.060> off<00:02:36.240> at

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
all plug in and I'm just running off at

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.480 
all plug in and I'm just running off at

vamp from everything I've read and heard
and<00:02:45.570> I've<00:02:45.630> do<00:02:46.170> play<00:02:46.380> on<00:02:46.410> my<00:02:46.590> friends<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:47.090> vent

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
and I've do play on my friends to vent

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.000 
and I've do play on my friends to vent
sometimes<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:49.260> does<00:02:49.410> like<00:02:49.590> run<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.860> lot

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
sometimes and it does like run a lot

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.800 
sometimes and it does like run a lot
hotter<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.640> gives<00:02:50.850> you<00:02:50.940> much<00:02:51.090> more<00:02:51.120> variety

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
hotter and gives you much more variety

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.130 
hotter and gives you much more variety
sound<00:02:52.370> but<00:02:53.370> nonetheless<00:02:53.720> your<00:02:54.720> microphone

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
sound but nonetheless your microphone

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.980 
sound but nonetheless your microphone
can<00:02:55.860> still<00:02:56.160> have<00:02:56.459> a<00:02:56.880> certain<00:02:57.270> type<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.570> effect

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
can still have a certain type of effect

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.820 
can still have a certain type of effect
on<00:02:58.230> this<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.070> so<00:03:00.140> just<00:03:01.140> placing<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.470> light<00:03:01.650> on

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
on this and so just placing a light on

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:14.330 
on this and so just placing a light on
this<00:03:02.640> one<00:03:02.820> first<00:03:10.760> okay<00:03:12.860> so<00:03:13.860> you<00:03:14.070> know<00:03:14.190> it

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
this one first okay so you know it

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.130 
this one first okay so you know it
sounds<00:03:14.610> good<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:15.120> does<00:03:15.300> munch<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:15.930> up<00:03:16.020> a<00:03:16.050> bit

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
sounds good it does munch it up a bit

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.940 
sounds good it does munch it up a bit
I'm<00:03:16.350> running<00:03:17.750> mostly<00:03:18.750> with<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.620> low<00:03:19.769> end

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
I'm running mostly with the low end

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.080 
I'm running mostly with the low end
frequencies<00:03:20.070> of<00:03:20.610> turned<00:03:20.850> all<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.000> way<00:03:21.060> up

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
frequencies of turned all the way up

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.910 
frequencies of turned all the way up
into<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.810> other<00:03:21.959> frequencies<00:03:22.230> team<00:03:22.530> down<00:03:22.709> so

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
into the other frequencies team down so

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.050 
into the other frequencies team down so
that's<00:03:23.130> what<00:03:23.370> I'm<00:03:23.430> getting<00:03:23.640> that<00:03:23.790> kind<00:03:23.940> of

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
that's what I'm getting that kind of

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.830 
that's what I'm getting that kind of
their<00:03:24.510> like<00:03:25.260> layout<00:03:26.000> sound<00:03:27.000> and

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
their like layout sound and

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.720 
their like layout sound and
and<00:03:28.470> I<00:03:28.560> recommend<00:03:29.040> playing<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.459> way<00:03:29.550> that's

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
and I recommend playing that way that's

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.309 
and I recommend playing that way that's
a<00:03:31.050> one<00:03:31.170> plays<00:03:31.349> and<00:03:31.920> down<00:03:33.319> I've

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
a one plays and down I've

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.110 
a one plays and down I've
found<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.709> to<00:03:34.800> be<00:03:34.830> to<00:03:35.610> give<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:35.819> their<00:03:35.970> last

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
found it to be to give you their last

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.260 
found it to be to give you their last
that<00:03:36.540> nice<00:03:36.720> brassy<00:03:37.440> sandwich<00:03:37.770> so<00:03:38.489> I'll<00:03:38.910> just

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
that nice brassy sandwich so I'll just

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.690 
that nice brassy sandwich so I'll just
do<00:03:39.390> a<00:03:39.420> quick<00:03:39.480> demo<00:03:39.780> with<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.890> green<00:03:41.489> bullet

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
do a quick demo with the green bullet

00:03:41.700 --> 00:04:09.229 
do a quick demo with the green bullet
the<00:03:41.880> DX<00:03:42.150> if<00:03:42.420> you<00:03:42.540> five<00:03:42.690> idiots<00:04:07.190> okay<00:04:08.190> I'm<00:04:09.030> just

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
the DX if you five idiots okay I'm just

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.780 
the DX if you five idiots okay I'm just
going<00:04:09.360> to<00:04:09.450> slice<00:04:09.600> off<00:04:09.870> like<00:04:09.989> remarks<00:04:10.350> just

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
going to slice off like remarks just

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:26.180 
going to slice off like remarks just
going<00:04:11.790> to<00:04:11.850> plug<00:04:11.970> it<00:04:12.120> on

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.830 

you<00:04:27.190> already<00:04:27.400> hear<00:04:27.670> somebody<00:04:28.630> if<00:04:28.690> you're<00:04:28.750> in

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
you already hear somebody if you're in

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.090 
you already hear somebody if you're in
turn<00:04:28.960> I<00:04:29.020> have<00:04:29.170> to<00:04:29.260> run<00:04:29.380> some<00:04:29.500> game<00:04:29.710> on<00:04:29.860> this<00:04:29.950> one

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
turn I have to run some game on this one

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.680 
turn I have to run some game on this one
because<00:04:30.250> unlike<00:04:30.760> the<00:04:30.820> the<00:04:30.970> five<00:04:31.390> to<00:04:31.510> eighty

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
because unlike the the five to eighty

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.940 
because unlike the the five to eighty
years<00:04:31.720> it<00:04:31.990> doesn't<00:04:32.170> have<00:04:32.260> to<00:04:32.320> be<00:04:32.410> the<00:04:32.710> volume

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
years it doesn't have to be the volume
