00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.239

 proud 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.969
 ps in the comments I also want to ask 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.890
 one thing the person who in addition to having me 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.960
 recommended a fashion that is not yet 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.450
 made recent by soma the serious cuts must 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.680
 also let that comment be the 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.360
 as much fun as possible so me 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.890
 dedicate a joke a joke o 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.720
 something inherent in the video that could 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.759
 make people laugh 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.680
 the comment that will have the recommended mode 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.750
 have next episode and that is also the 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.100
 more fun will appear in the next 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.830
 video and the next video will be precisely 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.560
 on his fashion then in the comments below 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.240
 destroy chat rooms and do that 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.390
 what you have to do here we are fashionable today 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.910
 sleep mode for 1.8 how does the 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.459
 sleep mode in a nutshell when we 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.929
 we suffer damage now we have f1 like 

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:34.670
 you can see there's hell this 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:36.619
 self-employed supposed especially of sliven 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.959
 creeper I don't know what he is doing there and now 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.490
 we kill others for when we have 

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:42.440
 we will be dealing with damages as you can see or 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.360
 my god so much damage 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.590
 us when we go to sleep in ours 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.319
 bed 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.410
 we will regain health we regenerate the 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.729
 health while we sleep now you see here 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.340
 there is nothing we 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.910
 we click bed and when there 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.970
 we will wake up we will have health 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.510
 regenerated 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.850
 regeneration two seconds and what it is 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.860
 happened after sleeping in the night 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.560
 our health regenerated almost 6 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.080
 completely obviously it will not be full 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.530
 life only if you have lost a few hearts 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.630
 but when we will have much of life that 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.130
 we lost in the cured night because 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.990
 if you notice in normal minecraft 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.280
 when you go home and go to sleep 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.110
 the hearts 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.380
 you have lost it and instead thanks to this 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.540
 so you can regenerate your health 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.310
 after sleeping and so it's a big one 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.440
 advantage especially if you are going to 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.440
 start or you are starting an adventure 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.450
 of minecraft in extreme arcore mode 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.450
 how you want to call it 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.300
 but what they talk about today I liked 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.980
 that is useful 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.410
 I recommend below in the description 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.200
 so read the description because if 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.210
 not the law but a suit, the knuckles 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.260
 on the head you will find the download for 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.550
 this mod 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.070
 I recommend you vote on but the serious cuts 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.020
 and subscribe to the minecraft website 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.940

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.350

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.910
 videos that are of some Microsoft 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.770

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.810
 little laugh while I read and glazed comments 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.610
