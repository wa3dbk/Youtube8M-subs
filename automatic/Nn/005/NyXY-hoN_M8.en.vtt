Word<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.160> God<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:23.970> consequently<00:00:24.330> he<00:00:24.660> took<00:00:24.840> it

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
Word of God so consequently he took it

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.660

very<00:00:24.990> seriously<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.769> they<00:00:26.010> took<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.340> idea<00:00:26.640> of

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
very seriously and they took the idea of

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.710
