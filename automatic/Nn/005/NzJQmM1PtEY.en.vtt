so<00:00:34.870> becoming<00:00:35.200> paralyzed<00:00:35.739> was<00:00:35.980> obviously<00:00:36.370> a

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
so becoming paralyzed was obviously a

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.330 
so becoming paralyzed was obviously a
shake-up<00:00:37.420> for<00:00:37.809> the<00:00:37.899> system<00:00:38.320> and<00:00:38.500> something

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
shake-up for the system and something

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.270 
shake-up for the system and something
began<00:00:39.820> used<00:00:40.149> to<00:00:41.370> back<00:00:42.370> in<00:00:42.579> those<00:00:42.789> days

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
began used to back in those days

obviously rod was a highly skilled

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:27.389 
obviously rod was a highly skilled
engineer<00:01:24.520> he<00:01:25.090> ran<00:01:25.299> a<00:01:25.329> a<00:01:25.770> car<00:01:26.770> repair<00:01:26.979> and

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
engineer he ran a a car repair and

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.760 
engineer he ran a a car repair and
engineering<00:01:27.969> business<00:01:28.209> up<00:01:29.020> here<00:01:29.380> in<00:01:29.530> North

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
engineering business up here in North

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.120 
engineering business up here in North
Dorset<00:01:30.399> and<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.840> it<00:01:31.929> occurred<00:01:32.229> to<00:01:32.469> me<00:01:32.619> that<00:01:32.649> I'd

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
Dorset and so it occurred to me that I'd

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.719 
Dorset and so it occurred to me that I'd
asked<00:01:33.429> him<00:01:33.759> if<00:01:34.630> he<00:01:34.959> would<00:01:35.200> be<00:01:35.229> repaired<00:01:35.799> and

asked him if he would be repaired and

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.709 
asked him if he would be repaired and
find<00:01:37.179> out<00:01:37.420> if<00:01:37.659> there<00:01:37.810> was<00:01:37.929> a<00:01:37.990> better<00:01:38.859> vehicle

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
find out if there was a better vehicle

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.589 
find out if there was a better vehicle
that<00:01:40.719> could<00:01:40.959> be<00:01:41.139> converted<00:01:41.499> to<00:01:41.799> take<00:01:42.189> me<00:01:43.119> while

00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:43.599 
that could be converted to take me while

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:46.260 
that could be converted to take me while
sitting<00:01:44.049> in<00:01:44.170> my<00:01:44.380> wheelchair<00:01:44.969> when<00:01:45.969> he<00:01:46.060> came

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
sitting in my wheelchair when he came

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.709 
sitting in my wheelchair when he came
back<00:01:46.539> to<00:01:46.959> me<00:01:47.109> with<00:01:47.380> a<00:01:47.409> proposal<00:01:48.509> which<00:01:49.509> was

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
back to me with a proposal which was

Prairie<00:01:53.319> month<00:01:53.709> one<00:01:54.149> which<00:01:55.149> is<00:01:55.299> this<00:01:55.539> old<00:01:55.779> lady

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
Prairie month one which is this old lady

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.699 
Prairie month one which is this old lady
here<00:01:56.349> so<00:01:57.130> I<00:01:57.159> provided<00:01:57.639> the<00:01:57.880> vehicle<00:01:58.380> he<00:01:59.380> took

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
here so I provided the vehicle he took

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:02.879 
here so I provided the vehicle he took
it<00:01:59.859> away<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:00.749> really<00:02:01.749> stripped<00:02:02.229> it<00:02:02.409> down<00:02:02.439> to

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:02.889 
it away and really stripped it down to

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:06.690 
it away and really stripped it down to
the<00:02:02.979> bare<00:02:03.189> body<00:02:03.969> shell<00:02:04.359> and<00:02:04.689> converted<00:02:05.649> it<00:02:05.799> it

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
the bare body shell and converted it it

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.469 
the bare body shell and converted it it
looks<00:02:07.029> like<00:02:07.240> an<00:02:07.389> all-new<00:02:07.749> vehicle<00:02:08.259> but<00:02:08.979> what

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
looks like an all-new vehicle but what

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.390 
looks like an all-new vehicle but what
had<00:02:10.479> done<00:02:10.690> an<00:02:10.810> awful<00:02:11.080> lot<00:02:11.410> of<00:02:11.440> work<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.010> and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
had done an awful lot of work to it and

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.880 
had done an awful lot of work to it and
believe<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.360> or<00:02:13.390> not<00:02:13.569> it<00:02:13.870> was<00:02:14.080> perfect

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
believe it or not it was perfect

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.460 
believe it or not it was perfect
right<00:02:15.430> from<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.819> start<00:02:15.849> it<00:02:16.750> has<00:02:16.870> an<00:02:17.050> integral

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
right from the start it has an integral

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.040 
right from the start it has an integral
ramp<00:02:17.739> at<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:17.950> back<00:02:18.220> so<00:02:19.209> it's<00:02:19.360> easy<00:02:19.599> for<00:02:19.900> me<00:02:19.959> to

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
ramp at the back so it's easy for me to

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.640 
ramp at the back so it's easy for me to
get<00:02:20.349> in<00:02:20.580> good<00:02:21.580> restraint<00:02:21.849> systems<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:23.410> put

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
get in good restraint systems it put

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.610 
get in good restraint systems it put
another<00:02:23.740> roof<00:02:24.250> on<00:02:24.520> slightly<00:02:24.940> raising<00:02:25.380> it<00:02:26.380> from

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
another roof on slightly raising it from

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.190 
another roof on slightly raising it from
the<00:02:26.800> Oh

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
the Oh

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.729 
the Oh
with<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:28.370> lowered<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.940> floor<00:02:29.379> which<00:02:30.379> meant

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
with it lowered the floor which meant

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.960 
with it lowered the floor which meant
new<00:02:31.160> fuel<00:02:31.790> tanks<00:02:32.330> new<00:02:33.050> exhaust<00:02:33.470> system<00:02:33.970> it

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
new fuel tanks new exhaust system it

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.839
