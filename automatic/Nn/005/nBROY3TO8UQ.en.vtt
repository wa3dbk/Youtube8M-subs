00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
with it it matters I didn't know what

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.890 
with it it matters I didn't know what
ever<00:02:21.560> mattered<00:02:22.010> so<00:02:22.250> if<00:02:22.640> it's<00:02:23.120> that<00:02:23.300> much<00:02:23.360> of<00:02:23.660> a

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
ever mattered so if it's that much of a

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.840 
ever mattered so if it's that much of a
problem<00:02:24.200> for<00:02:24.620> them<00:02:24.709> then<00:02:25.130> you<00:02:25.280> might<00:02:25.520> want<00:02:25.760> to

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
problem for them then you might want to

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.729 
problem for them then you might want to

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
stay away from it but at the same time

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.580 
stay away from it but at the same time
it's<00:02:28.430> just<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.790> game<00:02:28.970> like<00:02:29.330> you<00:02:29.690> shouldn't<00:02:30.050> care

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590
