projector as you can see here we're just

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.389 
projector as you can see here we're just
using<00:00:55.839> clear<00:00:56.170> tape<00:00:56.440> right<00:00:56.649> now<00:00:56.890> but<00:00:57.219> we'll

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
using clear tape right now but we'll

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.779 
using clear tape right now but we'll
find<00:00:57.969> a<00:00:58.180> better<00:00:58.329> system<00:00:58.949> probably<00:00:59.949> include

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
find a better system probably include

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.990 
find a better system probably include
velcro<00:01:01.269> so<00:01:01.629> forth<00:01:01.899> and<00:01:02.430> once<00:01:03.430> you<00:01:03.519> do<00:01:03.640> that<00:01:03.670> and

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
velcro so forth and once you do that and

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.359 
velcro so forth and once you do that and
get<00:01:04.089> it<00:01:04.210> in<00:01:04.269> the<00:01:04.330> right<00:01:04.420> position<00:01:05.039> it's<00:01:06.039> time

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
get it in the right position it's time

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.490 
get it in the right position it's time
to<00:01:06.549> do<00:01:06.850> a<00:01:06.880> demonstration<00:01:07.149> with<00:01:07.840> the<00:01:08.049> real<00:01:08.229> pins

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
to do a demonstration with the real pins

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.130 
to do a demonstration with the real pins
that<00:01:08.770> we<00:01:08.920> just<00:01:09.130> got<00:01:09.399> built<00:01:10.149> for<00:01:10.600> ten<00:01:10.780> dollars

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
that we just got built for ten dollars
