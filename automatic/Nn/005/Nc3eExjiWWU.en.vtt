00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
localized heat we do this with a

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.840 
localized heat we do this with a
hairdryer<00:00:42.590> circulating<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.860> rim<00:00:44.070> around<00:00:44.280> the

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
the process is the same

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.590 
the process is the same
independent<00:02:11.440> of<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.890> rim<00:02:12.070> depth<00:02:12.490> once<00:02:13.360> you've

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
independent of the rim depth once you've

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.300 
independent of the rim depth once you've
applied<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:14.050> decals<00:02:14.790> use<00:02:15.790> a<00:02:16.110> pa1<00:02:17.310> squeegee

dimples this way you will not negate the

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.570 
dimples this way you will not negate the
aerodynamic<00:02:27.820> advantage<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:28.750> those<00:02:28.930> dinkles

aerodynamic advantage of those dinkles

aerodynamic advantage of those dinkles
the<00:02:30.580> final<00:02:30.970> step<00:02:31.270> in<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.600> process<00:02:31.630> is<00:02:32.380> to

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
the final step in the process is to

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.270 
the final step in the process is to
apply<00:02:33.490> a<00:02:33.580> thin<00:02:34.030> coating<00:02:34.360> of<00:02:34.690> armor-all<00:02:35.320> gently

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
apply a thin coating of armor-all gently

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.150 
apply a thin coating of armor-all gently
rub<00:02:36.490> it<00:02:36.640> between<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.450> decals<00:02:37.900> so<00:02:38.740> that<00:02:38.920> they

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
rub it between the decals so that they

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.550 
rub it between the decals so that they
won't<00:02:39.430> lift<00:02:39.780> during<00:02:40.780> 2005<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:42.070> early<00:02:42.720> 2006<00:02:43.720> we

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
won't lift during 2005 and early 2006 we

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.700 
won't lift during 2005 and early 2006 we

these decals turn brown we recommend
that<00:02:54.400> you<00:02:54.580> apply<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.390> new<00:02:55.810> decals<00:02:56.290> over<00:02:56.920> the

top these are the same size and can be

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.210 
top these are the same size and can be
pressed<00:03:00.640> into<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.360> dimples<00:03:01.810> as<00:03:02.080> normal<00:03:02.980> now

we've<00:03:03.820> seen<00:03:04.120> how<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.920> decals<00:03:05.920> are<00:03:06.160> applied<00:03:06.640> on

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
we've seen how the decals are applied on

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.000 
we've seen how the decals are applied on
the<00:03:06.970> production<00:03:07.390> floor<00:03:07.780> there's<00:03:08.590> just<00:03:08.860> a

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
the production floor there's just a

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.560 
the production floor there's just a
couple<00:03:09.190> of<00:03:09.430> things<00:03:09.610> to<00:03:09.880> remember<00:03:10.150> when<00:03:10.510> you're

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
couple of things to remember when you're

doing this on your own first of all make

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.260 
doing this on your own first of all make
sure<00:03:13.600> the<00:03:14.020> rim<00:03:14.200> is<00:03:14.410> perfectly<00:03:15.070> clean<00:03:15.490> use

rim and then use a plaque turn to press
it<00:03:29.200> into<00:03:29.350> the<00:03:29.500> dimples<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.310> then<00:03:30.940> away<00:03:31.510> you<00:03:31.540> go

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
it into the dimples and then away you go

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.910 
it into the dimples and then away you go
looking<00:03:32.680> sharp<00:03:32.910> happy<00:03:33.910> writing
