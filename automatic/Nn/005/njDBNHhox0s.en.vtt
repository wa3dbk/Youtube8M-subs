which I wasn't so big on but do I think
this<00:01:38.250> makes<00:01:38.579> sense<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.090> he<00:01:39.270> could<00:01:39.479> end

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
this makes sense and that he could end

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.420 
this makes sense and that he could end
up<00:01:39.810> being<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.079> director<00:01:40.229> yeah<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.829> thought

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
up being the director yeah I thought

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.100 
up being the director yeah I thought
that<00:01:41.579> for<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> long<00:01:41.880> time<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.390> still<00:01:42.899> don't<00:01:43.049> know

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
that for a long time I still don't know

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.780 
that for a long time I still don't know
that<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.560> going<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.770> work<00:01:43.950> out<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.399> be<00:01:44.549> true

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
that it's going to work out and be true

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.660 
that it's going to work out and be true
I<00:01:45.000> mean<00:01:45.240> who<00:01:45.420> does<00:01:45.659> but<00:01:46.500> would<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.920> be<00:01:47.130> in

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
I mean who does but would it be in

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.760 
I mean who does but would it be in
theory<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.060> good<00:01:48.329> move<00:01:48.509> yeah<00:01:48.930> yeah<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.530> would<00:01:49.649> be

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
theory a good move yeah yeah it would be

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.020 
theory a good move yeah yeah it would be
a<00:01:49.799> good<00:01:49.979> move<00:01:50.159> he's<00:01:50.369> already<00:01:50.549> been<00:01:50.700> attached

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
a good move he's already been attached

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.460 
a good move he's already been attached
he's<00:01:51.240> already<00:01:51.390> committed<00:01:51.869> people<00:01:51.990> like<00:01:52.290> his

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
he's already committed people like his

like<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.549> said<00:02:05.729> it's<00:02:05.850> just<00:02:05.969> common<00:02:06.509> sense

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
like you said it's just common sense

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.880 
like you said it's just common sense
that<00:02:06.840> i<00:02:06.930> said<00:02:07.110> well<00:02:07.229> yeah<00:02:07.320> probably<00:02:07.590> he's

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
make the most sense for sure and i think

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.500 
make the most sense for sure and i think
that<00:02:11.700> there<00:02:12.569> are<00:02:12.599> so<00:02:12.720> many<00:02:12.810> different<00:02:12.930> rumors

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
that there are so many different rumors

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.449 
that there are so many different rumors
the<00:02:13.689> rumors<00:02:13.930> saying<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.680> Sinister<00:02:15.430> Six

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
the rumors saying that the Sinister Six

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.520 
the rumors saying that the Sinister Six
movie<00:02:15.939> won't<00:02:16.150> be<00:02:16.360> this<00:02:16.750> standalone<00:02:17.230> thing

movie won't be this standalone thing

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.660 
movie won't be this standalone thing
that<00:02:17.650> they<00:02:17.739> were<00:02:17.799> working<00:02:18.159> on<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.370> now<00:02:18.489> will

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
that they were working on and now will

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.600 
that they were working on and now will
fit<00:02:18.849> more<00:02:19.060> into<00:02:19.239> both<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.200> MCU<00:02:20.709> and<00:02:21.159> the<00:02:21.370> fact

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
fit more into both the MCU and the fact

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.000 
fit more into both the MCU and the fact
that<00:02:21.849> spider-man<00:02:22.750> now<00:02:23.260> we'll<00:02:23.439> be<00:02:23.620> in<00:02:23.739> it'll<00:02:23.920> be

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
that spider-man now we'll be in it'll be

more about spider-man battle in the
center<00:02:25.480> six<00:02:25.780> is<00:02:25.930> what<00:02:26.079> I<00:02:26.110> want<00:02:26.379> to<00:02:26.470> see<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.739> I

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
center six is what I want to see and I

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.500 
center six is what I want to see and I
think<00:02:26.829> good<00:02:27.430> art<00:02:27.579> is<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.790> great<00:02:28.150> choice<00:02:28.450> for

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
think good art is a great choice for

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.350 
think good art is a great choice for
that<00:02:28.810> because<00:02:29.129> he<00:02:30.129> has<00:02:30.370> been<00:02:30.610> his<00:02:30.849> brain<00:02:31.180> has

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
that because he has been his brain has

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.729 
that because he has been his brain has
been<00:02:31.390> in<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.780> Sinister<00:02:32.110> Six<00:02:32.140> so<00:02:32.379> now<00:02:32.500> he<00:02:32.560> gets

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
been in the Sinister Six so now he gets

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.380 
been in the Sinister Six so now he gets
to<00:02:32.860> put<00:02:33.069> Spidey<00:02:33.340> in<00:02:33.519> there<00:02:33.700> I<00:02:33.849> bet<00:02:34.120> you<00:02:34.239> he's

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
to put Spidey in there I bet you he's

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.270 
to put Spidey in there I bet you he's
excited<00:02:34.810> about<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:35.110> too<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:35.290> he<00:02:35.829> might<00:02:35.980> become

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
excited about it too and he might become

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.979
