00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
so I used I think two bananas to do this

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
use the back of the spoon to smash it

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.060 
use the back of the spoon to smash it
completely<00:04:24.789> and<00:04:24.820> then<00:04:25.210> pack<00:04:25.479> it<00:04:25.660> into<00:04:25.900> one<00:04:26.830> cup
