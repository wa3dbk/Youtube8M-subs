00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
basically those are them and then you

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.650 
basically those are them and then you
also<00:02:41.450> get<00:02:41.810> to<00:02:43.150> applicators<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:44.330> get<00:02:44.450> an<00:02:44.540> eye

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
well so that's kind of nice and then as

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.880 
well so that's kind of nice and then as
you<00:02:52.700> open<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.150> up<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:53.690> does<00:02:53.900> flop<00:02:54.380> into<00:02:54.860> a

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
you open it up it does flop into a

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.850 
you open it up it does flop into a
mirror<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:55.550> then<00:02:56.239> you<00:02:56.450> do<00:02:56.660> have<00:02:56.690> all<00:02:57.260> of<00:02:57.680> your

mirror and then you do have all of your
color<00:02:58.220> eye<00:02:58.610> shadows<00:02:59.380> so<00:03:00.380> there's<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.280> ton<00:03:01.640> of

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
color eye shadows so there's a ton of

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.240 
color eye shadows so there's a ton of
neutral<00:03:02.600> colors<00:03:02.959> there's<00:03:03.470> also<00:03:03.709> a<00:03:03.920> block

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
neutral colors there's also a block

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.070

right<00:03:04.550> in<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:04.790> corner<00:03:05.030> so<00:03:05.480> you<00:03:05.570> can<00:03:05.750> create<00:03:05.959> a

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.500 
right in the corner so you can create a
nice<00:03:06.200> smoky<00:03:06.709> deep<00:03:07.130> I<00:03:07.340> but<00:03:08.060> it's<00:03:08.209> just<00:03:08.390> a

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
mom a sister mother-in-law whoever this

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.170 
mom a sister mother-in-law whoever this
is<00:03:17.510> just<00:03:17.840> a<00:03:17.930> great<00:03:18.140> idea<00:03:18.739> and<00:03:19.130> then<00:03:19.790> it<00:03:19.910> folds

is just a great idea and then it folds

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.660 
is just a great idea and then it folds
just<00:03:20.810> like<00:03:20.989> that<00:03:21.200> so<00:03:21.500> it's<00:03:21.680> slim<00:03:22.130> enough<00:03:22.370> to

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
the Bobby Brown logo up front so that's

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.160 
the Bobby Brown logo up front so that's
