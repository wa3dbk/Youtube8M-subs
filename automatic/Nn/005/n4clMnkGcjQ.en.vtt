believe I really like fast ratio reels I
feel<00:02:48.720> like<00:02:48.870> I<00:02:48.989> can<00:02:49.140> do<00:02:49.290> pretty<00:02:49.560> much

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
feel like I can do pretty much

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.220 
feel like I can do pretty much
everything<00:02:50.760> with<00:02:51.030> them<00:02:51.209> except<00:02:51.930> for<00:02:51.959> when<00:02:52.200> I

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
everything with them except for when I

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.780 
everything with them except for when I
get<00:02:52.379> to<00:02:52.470> my<00:02:52.500> spinny<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.040> use<00:02:53.220> lower<00:02:53.430> stuff

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
get to my spinny and I use lower stuff

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.540 
get to my spinny and I use lower stuff
but<00:02:54.120> with<00:02:55.050> this<00:02:55.260> I've<00:02:55.500> learned<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:56.040> slow<00:02:56.310> down

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
but with this I've learned to slow down

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.270 
but with this I've learned to slow down
my<00:02:57.030> cranking<00:02:57.569> and<00:02:57.659> everything<00:02:58.080> so<00:02:58.319> I<00:02:58.560> just

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
my cranking and everything so I just

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.890 
my cranking and everything so I just
feel<00:02:59.430> comfortable<00:02:59.640> using<00:03:00.120> high<00:03:00.390> gear<00:03:00.599> ratio

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
feel comfortable using high gear ratio

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.320 
feel comfortable using high gear ratio
reels<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.220> most<00:03:02.459> likely<00:03:02.610> will<00:03:02.940> paired<00:03:03.150> up

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330

reels so that most likely will paired up
with<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.599> Veritas<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.349> they'll<00:03:04.739> probably<00:03:04.860> be

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
with the Veritas and they'll probably be

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.479

of<00:04:07.409> it<00:04:07.530> broke<00:04:07.739> off<00:04:07.920> maybe<00:04:08.310> not<00:04:08.519> even<00:04:08.700> so<00:04:09.060> it's

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
of it broke off maybe not even so it's

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.710 
of it broke off maybe not even so it's
still<00:04:09.930> really<00:04:10.110> usable<00:04:10.879> but<00:04:11.879> I<00:04:11.939> did<00:04:12.390> have<00:04:12.599> the

bill<00:04:22.610> rod<00:04:24.220> so<00:04:25.220> there's<00:04:25.430> that<00:04:25.610> one<00:04:25.820> and<00:04:26.720> then<00:04:27.320> I

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
bill rod so there's that one and then I

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.190 
bill rod so there's that one and then I
have<00:04:27.470> two<00:04:27.740> spinning<00:04:28.130> gears<00:04:28.960> really<00:04:29.960> really

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
have two spinning gears really really

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.810 
have two spinning gears really really
old<00:04:30.350> setup<00:04:30.830> so<00:04:30.950> I<00:04:31.010> really<00:04:31.280> need<00:04:31.400> to<00:04:31.430> get<00:04:31.610> a<00:04:31.640> new

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
old setup so I really need to get a new

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.140 
old setup so I really need to get a new
one<00:04:31.970> these<00:04:32.150> are<00:04:32.180> really<00:04:32.690> old<00:04:33.760> so<00:04:34.760> I<00:04:34.790> might<00:04:35.000> not

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
one these are really old so I might not

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.550 
one these are really old so I might not
even<00:04:35.180> I'm<00:04:35.600> not<00:04:35.750> gonna<00:04:35.900> know<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:36.170> full<00:04:36.350> name

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
even I'm not gonna know the full name

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.750 
even I'm not gonna know the full name
but<00:04:36.790> this<00:04:37.790> is<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.320> kvety<00:04:39.320> real<00:04:39.680> it's<00:04:40.100> quantum

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
but this is the kvety real it's quantum

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.650 
but this is the kvety real it's quantum
I<00:04:40.970> couldn't<00:04:41.360> tell<00:04:41.510> you<00:04:41.780> who's<00:04:42.770> actually<00:04:43.660> which

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
I couldn't tell you who's actually which

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.660 
I couldn't tell you who's actually which
one<00:04:44.990> it<00:04:45.140> is<00:04:45.170> I<00:04:45.680> just<00:04:45.800> know<00:04:46.010> what<00:04:46.130> the<00:04:46.220> cavity

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
one it is I just know what the cavity

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.820 
one it is I just know what the cavity
quantum<00:04:47.110> that's<00:04:48.110> all<00:04:48.260> I<00:04:48.320> really<00:04:48.560> know<00:04:48.800> about

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
quantum that's all I really know about

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.650 
quantum that's all I really know about
it<00:04:49.130> I<00:04:49.960> think<00:04:50.960> at<00:04:51.050> 6<00:04:51.910> 6<00:04:52.910> 3<00:04:53.000> 2<00:04:53.330> 1<00:04:53.480> gear<00:04:53.630> ratio

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
it I think at 6 6 3 2 1 gear ratio

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.480 
it I think at 6 6 3 2 1 gear ratio
something<00:04:54.470> like<00:04:54.620> that<00:04:54.860> and<00:04:57.160> then<00:04:58.160> I<00:04:58.280> got<00:04:58.430> a

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
something like that and then I got a

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.860 
something like that and then I got a

that real a lot for drop-shotting I use

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.890 
that real a lot for drop-shotting I use
that<00:05:09.740> a<00:05:09.770> ton<00:05:10.100> for<00:05:10.430> drop-shotting<00:05:10.910> and<00:05:11.780> that

got a Shakespeare ugly stick on here I
don't<00:05:44.000> even<00:05:44.090> know<00:05:44.330> the<00:05:45.250> it's<00:05:46.250> a<00:05:46.340> six<00:05:46.640> foot

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
don't even know the it's a six foot

don't even know the it's a six foot
medium<00:05:48.350> action<00:05:48.770> rod<00:05:49.190> again<00:05:50.180> this<00:05:50.300> could<00:05:50.510> be

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
medium action rod again this could be

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.870 
medium action rod again this could be
used<00:05:50.870> for<00:05:51.460> probably<00:05:52.690> drop-shotting<00:05:53.690> as<00:05:53.930> well

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
used for probably drop-shotting as well

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.280 
used for probably drop-shotting as well
but<00:05:55.880> I<00:05:55.940> don't<00:05:56.030> use<00:05:56.360> that<00:05:56.390> rod<00:05:56.720> anymore<00:05:57.140> it<00:05:57.260> just

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
but I don't use that rod anymore it just

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.450 
but I don't use that rod anymore it just
sits<00:05:57.680> around<00:05:58.510> so<00:05:59.510> there's<00:05:59.750> my<00:05:59.870> set<00:06:00.080> ups<00:06:00.260> guys

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
sits around so there's my set ups guys

nothing<00:06:01.460> huge<00:06:01.910> and<00:06:02.710> I'm<00:06:03.710> really<00:06:04.160> just<00:06:04.250> playing

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580
