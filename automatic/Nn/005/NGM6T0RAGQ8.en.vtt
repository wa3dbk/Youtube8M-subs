North America and so a lot of the
critters<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.630> we're<00:01:03.780> chasing<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.380> know<00:01:04.530> are

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
northern Canada and the same animals

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.190 
northern Canada and the same animals
migrate<00:01:08.670> through<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.060> United<00:01:09.390> States<00:01:09.540> down

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
America and so we're responsible for

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.650 
America and so we're responsible for
monitoring<00:01:14.310> their<00:01:14.520> populations<00:01:15.240> not<00:01:15.420> only

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
monitoring their populations not only

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.359 
monitoring their populations not only
here<00:01:15.960> but<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.710> other<00:01:16.740> countries<00:01:17.040> that

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
here but in the other countries that

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.670 
here but in the other countries that
they<00:01:17.430> go<00:01:17.700> across<00:01:17.940> and<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:19.050> a<00:01:19.200> cooperative

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
they go across and so it's a cooperative

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.410 
they go across and so it's a cooperative
effort<00:01:19.770> between<00:01:19.979> all<00:01:20.430> three<00:01:20.580> countries<00:01:20.850> as

per<00:01:21.840> treaty<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:23.160> try<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.400> look<00:01:23.490> after<00:01:23.729> them

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
per treaty and we try to look after them

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.430 
per treaty and we try to look after them
and<00:01:24.030> make<00:01:24.210> sure<00:01:24.390> their<00:01:24.570> populations<00:01:25.350> are

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
and make sure their populations are

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.109 
and make sure their populations are
healthy<00:01:25.800> and<00:01:25.830> available<00:01:26.430> for<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.670> sportsman

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
healthy and available for the sportsman

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.270 
healthy and available for the sportsman
but<00:01:27.690> what<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.050> is<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.590> about<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.860> turboprop

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
but what it is is it about a turboprop

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.280 
but what it is is it about a turboprop
with<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:29.850> kind<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.119> carrying<00:01:30.420> capacity<00:01:30.990> that

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
with this kind of carrying capacity that

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.350 
with this kind of carrying capacity that
appeals<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.920> for<00:01:32.190> that<00:01:32.310> mission<00:01:32.490> well

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
appeals to you for that mission well

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.600 
appeals to you for that mission well
we've<00:01:33.540> we're<00:01:34.080> a<00:01:34.110> long-standing<00:01:34.560> program<00:01:35.100> 50

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
we've we're a long-standing program 50

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.390 
we've we're a long-standing program 50
years<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.720> our<00:01:36.960> history<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:37.650> started

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
years in in our history and we started

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.550 
years in in our history and we started
out<00:01:38.520> with<00:01:38.640> surplus<00:01:38.940> aircraft<00:01:39.180> from<00:01:39.570> ww2<00:01:40.140> and

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
out with surplus aircraft from ww2 and

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.830 
out with surplus aircraft from ww2 and
did<00:01:41.550> quite<00:01:41.760> well<00:01:41.820> with<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> big<00:01:42.510> metal

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
did quite well with the big metal

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.930 
did quite well with the big metal
airplanes<00:01:43.260> that<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.500> were<00:01:43.590> flying<00:01:43.800> they<00:01:44.370> aged

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
airplanes that we were flying they aged

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.090 
airplanes that we were flying they aged
over<00:01:45.360> time<00:01:45.690> and<00:01:45.960> we<00:01:46.050> had<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.440> transition<00:01:46.890> into

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
over time and we had to transition into

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.490 
over time and we had to transition into
a<00:01:47.280> more<00:01:48.150> of<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.270> Cessna<00:01:48.690> based<00:01:48.930> fleet<00:01:49.350> from

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
a more of a Cessna based fleet from

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.680 
a more of a Cessna based fleet from
there<00:01:49.770> those<00:01:50.700> aircraft<00:01:51.210> weren't<00:01:51.540> big<00:01:51.659> enough

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
there those aircraft weren't big enough

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.020 
there those aircraft weren't big enough
and<00:01:52.200> capable<00:01:52.620> enough<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.280> get<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.580> to<00:01:53.610> some<00:01:53.940> of

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
and capable enough to get it to some of

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.490 
and capable enough to get it to some of
the<00:01:54.090> portions<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.930> continent<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.380> we

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
the portions of the continent that we

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.260 
the portions of the continent that we
need<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.800> get<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.190> to<00:01:56.550> monitor<00:01:56.880> these<00:01:57.000> bird

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
need to get to to monitor these bird

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.230 
need to get to to monitor these bird
populations<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.770> several<00:01:59.430> years<00:01:59.729> ago<00:01:59.909> we

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
populations and so several years ago we

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.060 
populations and so several years ago we
started<00:02:00.510> looking<00:02:00.870> around<00:02:01.110> for<00:02:01.530> replacement

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
started looking around for replacement

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.730 
started looking around for replacement
aircraft<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:03.270> tackle<00:02:04.260> some<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.440> those<00:02:04.560> issues

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
aircraft to tackle some of those issues

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.219 
aircraft to tackle some of those issues
we<00:02:05.100> were<00:02:05.250> dealing<00:02:05.430> with<00:02:05.610> logistically<00:02:06.240> about

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
we were dealing with logistically about

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.900 
we were dealing with logistically about
carrying<00:02:07.560> enough<00:02:07.770> fuel<00:02:08.010> to<00:02:08.100> get<00:02:08.310> places<00:02:08.610> and

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
carrying enough fuel to get places and

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.250 
carrying enough fuel to get places and
then<00:02:09.000> carrying<00:02:09.239> enough<00:02:09.510> people<00:02:10.170> and

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
then carrying enough people and

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.220 
then carrying enough people and
equipment<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.679> do<00:02:10.860> our<00:02:10.979> job<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:12.030> we<00:02:12.269> had<00:02:13.140> to

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
equipment to do our job and so we had to

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.420 
equipment to do our job and so we had to
go<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.500> turbine<00:02:13.890> equipped<00:02:14.220> aircraft

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
go to a turbine equipped aircraft

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.000 
go to a turbine equipped aircraft
because<00:02:15.150> AB<00:02:15.570> gas<00:02:15.840> is<00:02:16.080> just<00:02:16.110> becoming<00:02:16.650> more<00:02:16.950> and

with the Fox after the duck settle we

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.949 
with the Fox after the duck settle we

season<00:06:07.319> and<00:06:08.209> we<00:06:09.209> think<00:06:09.719> it's<00:06:09.929> going<00:06:10.110> to<00:06:10.169> be<00:06:10.319> an

season and we think it's going to be an
ideal<00:06:10.740> size<00:06:11.039> aircraft<00:06:11.369> for<00:06:12.119> that<00:06:12.389> the<00:06:12.899> other

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:14.849 
nice thing about the aircraft's it's a

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:17.389

the<00:06:31.030> Bishop's<00:06:31.390> out<00:06:31.570> before<00:06:31.930> me<00:06:32.080> will<00:06:32.230> be

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
the Bishop's out before me will be

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.280 
the Bishop's out before me will be
primarily<00:06:32.740> in<00:06:33.190> the<00:06:33.220> Northeast<00:06:33.750> although<00:06:34.750> I

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:35.290 
primarily in the Northeast although I

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.530 
primarily in the Northeast although I
will<00:06:35.800> be<00:06:35.950> involved<00:06:36.250> in<00:06:36.580> some<00:06:36.760> surveys<00:06:37.210> when<00:06:37.450> we

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:37.540 
will be involved in some surveys when we

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.330 
will be involved in some surveys when we
get<00:06:37.690> down<00:06:37.870> into<00:06:38.140> Mexico<00:06:38.320> and<00:06:38.920> Central<00:06:39.070> America

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.340

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.960 
get down into Mexico and Central America
so<00:06:40.060> pretty<00:06:40.900> much<00:06:41.080> our<00:06:41.740> surveys<00:06:42.310> follow<00:06:42.700> the

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:42.970 
so pretty much our surveys follow the

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.640 
so pretty much our surveys follow the
migratory<00:06:43.420> patterns<00:06:43.840> of<00:06:43.930> the<00:06:43.990> birds<00:06:44.230> where

anniversary just a few years ago and

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.290 
anniversary just a few years ago and
we're<00:07:14.440> thinking<00:07:14.920> that<00:07:15.130> this<00:07:15.370> technology<00:07:15.850> will

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:16.300 
we're thinking that this technology will

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.600 
we're thinking that this technology will
take<00:07:16.510> us<00:07:16.690> the<00:07:16.840> next<00:07:17.050> 50<00:07:17.440> years<00:07:17.680> into<00:07:18.250> wildlife

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:18.610 
take us the next 50 years into wildlife
