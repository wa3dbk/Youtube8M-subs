00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.010
 and good two ex ibex and today I bring you a 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.950
 more chapter of the multiplayer guide 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:09.830
 Chapter today is far less useful 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.990
 it really is very useful especially for 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.800
 those who play game modes that 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.539
 besides this ragnarok map comes out I think 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.730
 in almost all game modes it's worth 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:23.380
 less in all against all 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.029
 and I do not know in what way more good is worth it 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.860
 first you have to do to catch 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.910
 is to put on that basis, you are coming to 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.070
 this side 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.570
 in this rock that I am here is worth just 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.210
 you have to be on this rock because if 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.950
 they will not be born behind you and that's fuck 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.570
 the matter is worth being here they will not be born 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.920
 behind you the only thing you have to 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.020
 do to catch respawn as good is 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.850
 that your team more or less is not 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.430
 placed in the other response that is 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.540
 where I'm looking, I'm worth and 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.920
 suppose they are not behind as it is 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.440
 your team because then yes that 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.390
 the cag will do if you go to this other 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.769
 Rock is worth pillar 'aces' 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.350
 you have to stay right here, it's worth 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.200
 the little crack will not see you from 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.560
 no other point d 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.970
 of the map is worth and behind both 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.860
 may come of course because if you are 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.110
 your team will end up with them 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.730
 on the right you can not either 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.630
 come because you are here and not 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.790
 will be born and right on this rock is worth 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.310
 these two rocks that you have seen is 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.290
 where you have to catch the rest in this 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.860
 map is worth that in him 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.330
 sorry that serves only for the base that 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.800
 I had behind girl is worth now what 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.210
 we have to do is for the other base 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.400
 yes there are many ways to catch 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.370
 the respawn is worth the first thing you have 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.710
 what to do is good I will go here 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.060
 for more or less show you I'll do 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.800
 a complete sweep of all 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.390
 responsos you can catch worth it 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.340
 first you have to do you come to 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.650
 this little rock is worth staying here 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.210
 crouching is very important and here you will see 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.610
 to the base and those who leave 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.410
 opposite is very important this saying 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.410
 because he is also one of the responsible 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.659
 better vouchers to catch on this map 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.360
 especially if you are left behind or 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.340
 that my kill or me that I know then be 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.380
 well I do not recommend it, but also 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.519
 you can catch the answer from here to the 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.370
 left will be born to us or to the right 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.959
 either or behind this rock is worth 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.580
 you can kill those who are born there 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:20.370
 in front of us or if we even here because we 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.040
 You will see from the other side and if you go up to 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.840
 the rock or if you stay a little 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.819
 duck around this area then power 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.670
 inspire but in the background of the other 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.400
 base is worth another site to catch 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.829
 respawn on this map you have to come 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.739
 this tree is worth to this area of trees 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:40.170
 and rocks and here is the best area for 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.329
 catch respawn if you were born in the 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.370
 another base because look there you have the 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.620
 they do not do opposite, they are just born 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.569
 there in the river are not born worth because 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.239
 besides the river can not be born because 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.880
 you are here and he blocks it jce 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.680
 will be born right opposite 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.840
 from here you have visibility too 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.100
 for the whole river and for the fauna of the 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.470
 end of the right side is worth 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.260
 and well here he launched to throw two 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.240
 grenades is worth it so you can see that even 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.130
 with grenades throwing grenades you can 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.080
 doing it is pretty little to the 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.630
 enemies that are born over there and so 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.730
 you can do let's lock them in between 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.500
 yeah if you put two here asking 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.570
 he responded with putting one here 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.460
 asking for response and the team helps 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.830
 you can catch everything he answers 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.080
 perfectly so it is I think that 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.880
 a very good tactic especially for 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.420
 completely shut up the 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.550
 enemies above all, I hope it serves you 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.210
 many is worth this little trick to 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.210
 catch spam 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.740
 good good tricks or positions worth if 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.110
 you put behind that rock you can see 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.610
 how can you also catch respawn in 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.950
 the two sides without you from the 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.870
 opposite side of the restoration then it is 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.890
 that is pretty well thought out I think 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.050
 what 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.360
 I hope you serve a lot, it's worth it if you 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.520
 It has served and you want more response from more 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.319
