 who came to my own eyes 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.210

 the status of the top favorites and successfully 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.160
 progressive hard random which on 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.680
 lan finals always show 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.600
 phenomenally high level of play after 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.460
 regular season everyone just talked 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.930
 about how good shape is 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.969
 now mask file 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.399
 the regular season for this team has passed 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.579
 practically without mistakes, everyone was sure 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.250
 that m5 is better now but who could 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.380
 to think that in their first game they 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.780
 give up at the twentieth minute 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.939
 being completely unprepared for 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.770
 perfect win back from hard random 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.420
 it seemed that the first kill which 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.150
 got jinx at the beginning of the game 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.460

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.409
 just flew and shot your opponent in 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.049
 one by one this match turned out to be 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.540
 lost for m5 still at the peak stage and 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.890

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.829

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.799
 they could not counter them 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.619
 the draft phase has never been the strongest 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.570
 side 5 maybe they fell victim 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.210
 own confidence which disappeared 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.399
