00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.879
 to change a life forever 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:18.070

 just like him six weeks ago 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.449
 and then I met her 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.110
 I had imagined him bigger 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.910
 but she is not mistaken for someone Â» 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.020

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.080

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.050

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.050
 what the customers would want

 Kristiansand 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.390
 we are a brotherhood 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.810

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.040
 always free 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.040
 at that time with

 it's not easy 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.510
 1 besides 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.510
 that's why we kick 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.270
 Internet stations
