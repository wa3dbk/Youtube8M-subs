camera has a global shutter at 30 frames

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.010 
camera has a global shutter at 30 frames
per<00:00:43.230> second<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:44.550> means<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:45.300> will<00:00:45.510> be<00:00:45.629> very

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
per second that means this will be very

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.290 
per second that means this will be very
very<00:00:46.350> useful<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.280> used<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.700> multicopter

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
very useful to be used on a multicopter

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.000 
very useful to be used on a multicopter
because<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.660> don't<00:00:48.840> get<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.230> tiny<00:00:49.500> micro

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
because you don't get the tiny micro

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.410 
because you don't get the tiny micro
vibrations<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.760> everybody<00:00:51.180> knows<00:00:51.390> from

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
vibrations that everybody knows from

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.500 
vibrations that everybody knows from
GoPros<00:00:52.110> which<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.190> use<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:54.110> copters<00:00:55.850> also<00:00:56.850> you

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
GoPros which I use on copters also you

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.450 
GoPros which I use on copters also you
can<00:00:57.660> switch<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.620> rolling<00:00:58.920> shutter<00:00:59.100> and

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
can switch it to a rolling shutter and

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.040 
can switch it to a rolling shutter and
then<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.850> can<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.120> up<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.449> 60<00:01:00.750> frames<00:01:00.870> per

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
then you can have up to 60 frames per

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.579 
then you can have up to 60 frames per
second<00:01:02.270> the<00:01:03.270> really<00:01:03.840> impressive<00:01:04.019> thing<00:01:04.260> about

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
second the really impressive thing about

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.789 
second the really impressive thing about
this<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.430> has<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.780> it<00:01:06.780> has<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.049> micro<00:01:07.409> 4/3

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
this is it has a it has a micro 4/3

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.500 
this is it has a it has a micro 4/3
mount<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.520> can<00:01:08.670> use<00:01:08.820> all<00:01:09.030> your<00:01:09.210> existing

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
mount so you can use all your existing

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.960 
mount so you can use all your existing
lumix<00:01:10.080> lenses<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.710> really<00:01:11.549> really<00:01:11.760> tiny

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
lumix lenses on a really really tiny

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.090 
lumix lenses on a really really tiny
camera<00:01:12.479> which<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.780> hardly<00:01:13.560> any<00:01:13.680> bigger<00:01:13.920> than

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
camera which is hardly any bigger than

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.570 
camera which is hardly any bigger than
the<00:01:14.250> mount<00:01:14.430> itself<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:16.439> record<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:17.009> 12<00:01:17.310> bit

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
the mount itself and in record in 12 bit

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.899 
the mount itself and in record in 12 bit
raw<00:01:18.140> so<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.350> means<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:19.950> camera<00:01:20.460> can<00:01:20.670> be<00:01:20.729> a

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
raw so this means this camera can be a

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.719 
raw so this means this camera can be a
serious<00:01:21.509> serious<00:01:21.810> competitor<00:01:22.530> for<00:01:23.220> something

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
serious serious competitor for something

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.090 
serious serious competitor for something
like<00:01:23.880> an<00:01:24.000> Alexa<00:01:24.450> Mini<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.560> drone<00:01:25.830> of

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
like an Alexa Mini on on the drone of

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.640 
like an Alexa Mini on on the drone of
course<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.759> sensor<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.210> not<00:01:27.360> as<00:01:27.509> big<00:01:27.750> but<00:01:28.320> for

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
course the sensor is not as big but for

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.010 
course the sensor is not as big but for
a<00:01:29.159> drone<00:01:29.640> shot<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.000> doesn't<00:01:30.270> make<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.509> much

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
a drone shot it doesn't make that much

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.140 
a drone shot it doesn't make that much
of<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.229> difference<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:31.860> both<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.490> these<00:01:32.700> cameras

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
of a difference so both of these cameras

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.899 
of a difference so both of these cameras
use<00:01:33.810> LTE<00:01:34.350> 6<00:01:34.680> Canon<00:01:35.009> batteries<00:01:35.400> for<00:01:35.640> powering

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
use LTE 6 Canon batteries for powering

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.910 
use LTE 6 Canon batteries for powering
which<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.299> nice<00:01:36.509> because<00:01:36.840> they<00:01:37.170> are<00:01:37.290> available

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
which is nice because they are available

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.710 
which is nice because they are available
everywhere<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.240> can<00:01:39.390> use<00:01:39.570> their

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
everywhere and you can use their

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.140 
everywhere and you can use their
existing<00:01:40.140> camera<00:01:40.829> batteries<00:01:41.369> from<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> 50<00:01:42.030> or

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
existing camera batteries from the 50 or

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.080 
existing camera batteries from the 50 or
70<00:01:42.540> also<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:44.009> can<00:01:44.220> select<00:01:44.399> between<00:01:44.670> progress

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
70 also you can select between progress

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.499 
70 also you can select between progress
and<00:01:45.509> cinema<00:01:45.869> DNG<00:01:46.290> uncompressed<00:01:46.920> raw<00:01:47.450> so<00:01:48.450> you

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
and cinema DNG uncompressed raw so you

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.330 
and cinema DNG uncompressed raw so you
have<00:01:48.689> extreme<00:01:49.140> versatility<00:01:49.560> when<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.159> comes

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
have extreme versatility when it comes

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.300 
have extreme versatility when it comes
to<00:01:50.490> recording<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:51.149> record<00:01:51.450> onto<00:01:51.960> SD<00:01:52.380> cards<00:01:52.740> so

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
to recording a record onto SD cards so

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.039 
to recording a record onto SD cards so
also<00:01:53.670> another<00:01:53.820> industry<00:01:54.180> industry<00:01:54.630> standard

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
also another industry industry standard
