00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
improvements have been made to the way

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.180 
improvements have been made to the way
that<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:20.720> high<00:01:20.870> frequency<00:01:21.440> network<00:01:21.830> update

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
that the high frequency network update

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.120 
that the high frequency network update
works<00:01:22.490> basically<00:01:23.409> extending<00:01:24.409> its<00:01:24.530> range<00:01:24.799> so

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
works basically extending its range so

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.010 
works basically extending its range so
that<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.340> feedback<00:01:25.820> to<00:01:25.969> your<00:01:26.119> client<00:01:26.600> will<00:01:26.810> be

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
well more frequent in simple terms I

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.660 
well more frequent in simple terms I
understand<00:01:30.439> this<00:01:30.590> as<00:01:30.770> meaning<00:01:30.979> that<00:01:31.219> the<00:01:31.340> game

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
understand this as meaning that the game

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.179 
understand this as meaning that the game
will<00:01:32.180> feel<00:01:32.420> much<00:01:32.869> more<00:01:33.140> responsive<00:01:33.530> to<00:01:33.860> you

game<00:04:13.919> mode<00:04:14.129> it's<00:04:14.519> pretty<00:04:14.879> much<00:04:15.000> very<00:04:15.329> similar

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780

to<00:04:15.810> normal<00:04:16.320> obliteration<00:04:16.829> but<00:04:17.159> just<00:04:17.400> scaled

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
and now far more audible so pay close

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.540

this<00:04:58.050> patch<00:04:58.319> but<00:04:58.830> a<00:04:58.889> friend<00:04:59.219> tells<00:04:59.580> me<00:04:59.849> that

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:00.029 
this patch but a friend tells me that

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:02.179 
this patch but a friend tells me that
you<00:05:00.150> no<00:05:00.449> longer<00:05:00.479> feel<00:05:00.900> like<00:05:01.379> you're<00:05:02.009> in<00:05:02.099> a

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:04.379 
flying coughing anymore so I'm looking

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:06.379 
flying coughing anymore so I'm looking
forward<00:05:04.650> to<00:05:04.949> giving<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.759> helicopters

forward to giving the helicopters

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.989

another<00:05:06.870> shot<00:05:07.169> since<00:05:07.499> this<00:05:07.740> patch<00:05:08.069> they've

00:05:08.989 --> 00:05:08.999 
another shot since this patch they've

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:12.110 
another shot since this patch they've
also<00:05:09.389> patched<00:05:10.050> the<00:05:10.560> med<00:05:10.919> bag<00:05:11.189> so<00:05:11.639> you<00:05:11.699> know

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
also patched the med bag so you know

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.450 
also patched the med bag so you know
that<00:05:12.389> when<00:05:12.659> you<00:05:12.689> get<00:05:12.960> suppressed<00:05:13.560> the<00:05:14.189> length

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
that when you get suppressed the length

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.850 
that when you get suppressed the length

bag<00:05:17.099> or<00:05:17.370> a<00:05:17.400> first<00:05:17.669> aid<00:05:17.939> bag<00:05:18.180> has<00:05:18.779> been<00:05:19.080> tweaked

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
bag or a first aid bag has been tweaked

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.040 
bag or a first aid bag has been tweaked
to<00:05:19.860> make<00:05:20.219> it<00:05:20.370> a<00:05:20.460> little<00:05:20.610> bit<00:05:20.849> more<00:05:20.969> fun<00:05:21.330> and<00:05:21.629> a

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
to make it a little bit more fun and a

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.350 
to make it a little bit more fun and a
really<00:05:22.259> big<00:05:22.529> one<00:05:22.710> for<00:05:22.889> me<00:05:22.949> this<00:05:23.279> you<00:05:23.939> can<00:05:24.120> now

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
really big one for me this you can now

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.529 
really big one for me this you can now
not<00:05:24.960> spawn<00:05:25.499> on<00:05:25.800> a<00:05:25.830> teammate<00:05:26.520> if<00:05:26.729> he<00:05:27.360> is

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
not spawn on a teammate if he is

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.869 
not spawn on a teammate if he is

determined to be in combat with an enemy
so<00:05:30.479> this<00:05:31.080> will<00:05:31.319> save<00:05:31.620> you<00:05:31.949> from<00:05:32.219> spawning<00:05:32.699> to<00:05:33.060> a

guy<00:05:42.569> in<00:05:42.599> combat<00:05:43.319> with<00:05:43.349> one<00:05:43.680> other<00:05:43.830> guy<00:05:43.979> and

guy in combat with one other guy and

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.850 
guy in combat with one other guy and
then<00:05:44.939> you<00:05:45.180> spawn<00:05:45.569> in<00:05:45.779> on<00:05:45.930> your<00:05:46.050> squad<00:05:46.319> mate<00:05:46.620> it

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
then you spawn in on your squad mate it

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.769 
then you spawn in on your squad mate it
can<00:05:47.099> kind<00:05:47.370> of<00:05:47.490> unbalanced<00:05:48.060> what<00:05:48.330> was<00:05:48.509> quite<00:05:48.749> a

00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:48.779 
can kind of unbalanced what was quite a

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:51.379 
can kind of unbalanced what was quite a
good<00:05:49.080> fight<00:05:49.439> going<00:05:49.770> on<00:05:49.979> so<00:05:50.219> it<00:05:50.310> stops<00:05:50.639> that<00:05:50.969> as

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
good fight going on so it stops that as

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.329 
good fight going on so it stops that as
soon<00:05:51.599> as<00:05:51.719> your<00:05:51.870> teammate<00:05:52.439> becomes<00:05:52.889> out<00:05:53.099> of

00:05:53.329 --> 00:05:53.339 
soon as your teammate becomes out of

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:55.730 
soon as your teammate becomes out of
combat<00:05:53.639> it<00:05:54.479> will<00:05:54.719> start<00:05:54.990> ticking<00:05:55.319> down<00:05:55.500> and

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
combat it will start ticking down and

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.499 
combat it will start ticking down and
then<00:05:55.979> you<00:05:56.189> can<00:05:56.370> spawn<00:05:56.759> on<00:05:57.029> your<00:05:57.210> squad<00:05:57.419> mates

00:05:57.499 --> 00:05:57.509 
then you can spawn on your squad mates

00:05:57.509 --> 00:05:59.089 
then you can spawn on your squad mates
so<00:05:57.930> I<00:05:57.960> think<00:05:58.229> this<00:05:58.319> is<00:05:58.379> actually<00:05:58.620> gonna<00:05:58.979> be

00:05:59.089 --> 00:05:59.099 
so I think this is actually gonna be

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:00.889 
so I think this is actually gonna be
it's<00:05:59.550> a<00:05:59.669> small<00:05:59.969> thing<00:06:00.000> but<00:06:00.270> I<00:06:00.449> think<00:06:00.750> it's

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:00.899 
it's a small thing but I think it's

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:02.209 
it's a small thing but I think it's
going<00:06:00.990> to<00:06:01.080> be<00:06:01.229> quite<00:06:01.379> a<00:06:01.529> big<00:06:01.830> improvement

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:02.219 
going to be quite a big improvement

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:05.600 
going to be quite a big improvement
really<00:06:02.849> lastly<00:06:03.599> but<00:06:03.990> by<00:06:04.199> no<00:06:04.259> means<00:06:04.469> least<00:06:05.009> UI

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
really lastly but by no means least UI

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.429 
really lastly but by no means least UI
