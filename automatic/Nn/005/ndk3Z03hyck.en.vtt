00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.010
 friends to miami farmer hello 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.760
 welcome to the farm welcome on what 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.500
 we will fall today I you 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.420
 presents a headset of a pretty mark 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.470
 little known to us tech then we noted that 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.000
 for the little story we had them 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.920
 crossed over a Semite there are two or three 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.230
 years he proposed to the on-site tests the 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.430
 zorro first of the name zorro it is 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.920
 maybe a little caricature in 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.170
 any event we had been rather 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.770
 seduced by the helmet because 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.960
 reasonable tariff positioning 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.239
 modern sound quality low enough this 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.039
 it's true but rather nice 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.510
 so obviously when I introduce you 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.260
 the helmet like that you where do you come from 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.489
 immediately that it is the mark 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.430
 inspirational one does not need to 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.320
 do drawing now clearly on 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.930
 had a sound quality quite 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.000
 equivalent for at the time almost a 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.829
 third two-thirds less two-thirds of 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.449
 less widely then there today 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.760
 we come back and they will send the 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.799
 zorro de in hd so the new version 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.990
 reviewed and corrected with a little a look 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.990
 always as modern as ever 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.210
 inspired obviously now remains to 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.439
 see who has or not increase that it's 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.700
 maybe a bit of a shame because 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.710
 is on a headset that has arrived 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.369
 today 99 euros on amazon 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.110
 especially 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.100
 now you may find a 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.049
 a little bit of walking looking for good 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.450
 because I think I saw him at 82 euros 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.520
 so overall at a fair price 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.159
 consistent but you'll see from 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.180
 thise arguments not insignificant so at 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.680
 level of packaging 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.150
 it's simple we have a white box 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.590
 which is whiter with the 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.030
 presentation of the little helmet 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.560
 information 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.150
 a flap box that allows us to 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.299
 discover that it exists in black in white 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.770
 have raped and lapis lazuli yes so 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.850
 there I make the trader but clearly I 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.049
 asked him madam this day been 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.990
 unable to tell you it was different 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.369
 thing that blue so the bundle is him 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.530
 consisting of a small bag of 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.040
 transport type peach skin low gentex 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.799
 we have a small user manual 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.600
 we also find the flat cable so 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.250
 since it is detachable mentioned 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.540
 badges and we do not tech then it's 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.680
 plastic but good plastic 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.470
 quality is quite pleasant 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.100
 I will remove 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.050
 the little piece of plastic and we have a 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.570
 small remote that you never need 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.700
 found here is rectangular the button and 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.230
 the color of the cable is rather 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.800
 nice there are small efforts we have a 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.600
 microphone 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.130
 because on paper for now 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.410
 this case what promises compatibility 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.270
 complete with android and ios 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.790
 the helmet itself well you see it 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.060
 which I do not return to the inspired look 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.500
 we understood this being the finish 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.090
 is really good there is no problem 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.130
 so I return them in every 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.270
 meaning to find a micro defect that 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.010
 I could not even introduce you to the 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.450
 camera so really something of 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.190
 well done there is no concern about this 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.530
 side there it's quite pleasant 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.370
 the plastic glossy appearance is really 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.709
 well 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.300
 I like the fine settings 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.010
 small bars are established that the 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.740
 settings are also metallic and 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.880
 graduated plastic on the inside the 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.700
 cable ducts are very clean 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.950
 since we do not see them so we have a 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.350
 bow badge and take on the inside 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.420
 dwarfs sky of very good quality and p 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.400
 then there is a very small moss that 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.170
 may be a bit scary but the 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.030
 cast is really not heavy since we 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.690
 is around 160 g so it should not 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.070
 ask a problem 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.290
 obviously we are on a product enough 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.750
 nomadic then we will go down one more 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.330
 platinum platinum support with a platinum 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.530
 in brushed aluminum with newtec n 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:30.530
 stylized the same on the other side on 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.030
 the left earphone we find the 3.5 mm e 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.239
 mail the cup she is plastic 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.640
 mounted on ball joint so relatively free 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.500
 of his movements on the inside we go 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.730
 find a memory foam 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.739
 with a good quality sky coating 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.959
 a little less thick than that of 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.590
 the hoop but it's really good 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.000
 doggie set all really well 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.799
 proof of integration davis and michael 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.470
 finally there are no worries about the 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.610
 finish and feel of cac what they 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.810
 eat is relatively 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.130
 aesthetic 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.620
 after obviously he may not have the 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.570
 legitimacy of some big brands 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.250
 we know bleed for stage 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.950
 for not quoting him at kg etc. 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.360
 but the helmet is quite pleasant so 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.670
 as you can see it's a supra aural 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.019
 closed design at the level of 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.030
 technical features that I can 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.340
 you learn that globally it covers 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.700
 an astonishing spectrum of 13 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.830
 r that 26000 r it's pretty uncommon 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.650
 that hp are sort calves that 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.060
 would it seem and that's about all 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.160
 what can I bring you as 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:35.770
 information if purchased its 40 mm 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.270
 that it impedance of 32 ohms and that it has 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.940
 a sensitivity of 104 db 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.320
 so I have not really tested 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.940
 I quickly listen to the release of 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.460
 box judge too curious to wait for that 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.830
 it's a little my fault rather pleasant 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.010
 really here is rather a pleasant little 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:54.300
 are nice not unpleasant to note 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.320
 that he is farms at bhl one so 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.700
 transportable it is rather a product 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.890
 nomadic of a floating a gambling product 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.850
 we totally agree 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.860
 now it's up to you to see how 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.330
 he will behave there I listened to them 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.400
 quickly on the dax was rather 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.440
 pleasant I have not heard on 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.910
 nomadic sources so I'll go to the 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.700
 do and then again three plays 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.620
 on a little more than three by the way 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.440
 on the dac so as to see what he 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.270
 worth what is certain is that at the level 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.780
 of aesthetics me I am rather his 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.030
 charm 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.160
 I think it's even a lighter 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.080
 little bit less a little less than a 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.850
 camp that some other brands even 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.610
 if the colors are pretty flashy but 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.590
 good colors here it's still some 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.250
 eminently subjective thing as I the 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.640
 say all the time 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:39.220
 so here it was the 02 hd2 a 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.540
 Cocotte TV texture as usual I 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.950
 I wish you a very good 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.630
 day as usual I tell you to 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.630
 soon and I also say goodbye
