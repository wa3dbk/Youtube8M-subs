00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.840
 Well, how are you going? 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.680
 Confiscates this vehicle. 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.920
 Do you get in with me or what? 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.120
 Oh, hello, and your husband? 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.720
 Eh good, we will go without him. 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.380
 Or maybe even. 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.660

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.720
 You were not too attached to yourself what? 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.620
 Oh, sory. 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.360
