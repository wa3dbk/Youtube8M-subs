the<00:05:19.320> wing<00:05:19.560> see<00:05:20.220> how<00:05:20.430> spreads<00:05:21.180> out<00:05:21.360> nicely

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
the wing see how spreads out nicely

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.390 
the wing see how spreads out nicely
there<00:05:22.020> this<00:05:22.230> fly<00:05:22.500> will<00:05:22.620> set<00:05:22.800> nice<00:05:22.980> and<00:05:23.190> flush

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
there this fly will set nice and flush

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.520 
there this fly will set nice and flush
to<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:23.610> water<00:05:26.450> split<00:05:27.450> my<00:05:27.570> tails<00:05:27.870> nice<00:05:28.260> and

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
to the water split my tails nice and

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.560 
to the water split my tails nice and
clean<00:05:29.070> there<00:05:31.610> and<00:05:32.610> that's<00:05:32.880> all<00:05:33.060> there<00:05:33.210> is<00:05:33.240> to

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
clean there and that's all there is to

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.200 
clean there and that's all there is to
the<00:05:33.660> compare<00:05:33.990> done<00:05:34.310> very<00:05:35.310> simple<00:05:35.700> fly<00:05:35.910> to<00:05:35.970> tie

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
the compare done very simple fly to tie

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.480 
the compare done very simple fly to tie
for<00:05:36.480> the<00:05:36.540> most<00:05:36.720> part<00:05:37.040> hardest<00:05:38.040> parts<00:05:38.310> just

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
for the most part hardest parts just

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.480 
for the most part hardest parts just
working<00:05:38.760> with<00:05:38.880> that<00:05:39.030> deer<00:05:39.270> hair
