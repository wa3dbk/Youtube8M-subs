was engineering design development it is
a<00:00:08.790> course<00:00:09.420> where<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.990> students<00:00:10.320> are<00:00:10.380> broken

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
a course where the students are broken

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.610 
a course where the students are broken
up<00:00:10.740> into<00:00:10.920> teams<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.630> they<00:00:12.630> build<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.320> replica

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
up into teams and they build a replica

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.919 
up into teams and they build a replica
racecar<00:00:14.340> for<00:00:14.370> various<00:00:14.910> companies<00:00:15.269> they're

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.220 
racecar for various companies they're
fully<00:00:16.199> sponsored<00:00:16.550> they<00:00:17.550> have<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.300> create<00:00:19.109> the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
fully sponsored they have to create the

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.070 
fully sponsored they have to create the
drawings<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.189> computer<00:00:20.609> in<00:00:20.880> 3d<00:00:21.330> we<00:00:21.869> have

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
drawings and the computer in 3d we have

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.529 
drawings and the computer in 3d we have
to<00:00:22.230> actually<00:00:22.890> build<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.519> from<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.880> build<00:00:24.390> the

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
to actually build it from that build the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.710 
to actually build it from that build the
bodies<00:00:24.869> design<00:00:25.680> how<00:00:25.980> they're<00:00:26.250> going<00:00:26.519> to

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
bodies design how they're going to

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.210 
bodies design how they're going to
connect<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.779> engines<00:00:28.260> or<00:00:28.500> connect<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.980> tires

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
connect the engines or connect the tires

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.759 
connect the engines or connect the tires
or<00:00:29.640> put<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.300> exhaust<00:00:30.630> or<00:00:31.109> put<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.439> body<00:00:31.619> on

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
or put in the exhaust or put the body on

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.370 
or put in the exhaust or put the body on
they<00:00:32.700> have<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.030> build<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.390> it's<00:00:33.570> not<00:00:33.960> just<00:00:34.260> a

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
they have to build it it's not just a

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.080 
they have to build it it's not just a
computer<00:00:34.860> drawing<00:00:35.190> they<00:00:35.579> have<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:36.000> actually

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
computer drawing they have to actually

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.690 
computer drawing they have to actually
build<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.690> product<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.380> high<00:00:37.559> quality<00:00:37.700> and

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
build a product to a high quality and

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.959 
build a product to a high quality and
get<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.719> finished<00:00:40.050> down<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> deadline<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:41.670> race

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
get it finished down a deadline the race

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.119 
get it finished down a deadline the race
we<00:00:42.180> actually<00:00:42.570> race<00:00:42.750> down<00:00:43.050> at<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.739> briggs<00:00:44.010> and

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
we actually race down at the briggs and

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.040 
we actually race down at the briggs and
stratton<00:00:44.160> motorplex<00:00:44.910> down<00:00:45.239> at<00:00:45.660> Road<00:00:46.020> America

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
stratton motorplex down at Road America

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.900 
stratton motorplex down at Road America
and<00:00:46.590> Elkhart<00:00:46.980> Lake<00:00:47.129> Wisconsin<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
and Elkhart Lake Wisconsin so the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.720 
and Elkhart Lake Wisconsin so the
students<00:00:48.210> will<00:00:48.300> actually<00:00:48.510> take<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.079> car<00:00:49.350> and

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
students will actually take this car and

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.069 
students will actually take this car and
run<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.180> track<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.690> see<00:00:51.870> how

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
run it on the track to see how

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.680 
run it on the track to see how
fascinating<00:00:52.620> go<00:00:52.710> around<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> track<00:00:53.370> at<00:00:53.690> one

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
fascinating go around the track at one

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.150 
fascinating go around the track at one
at<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.870> time<00:00:55.050> we<00:00:55.230> don't<00:00:55.379> put<00:00:55.590> them<00:00:55.649> all<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:55.829> there

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
at a time we don't put them all on there

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.369 
at a time we don't put them all on there
at<00:00:56.280> one<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.730> we<00:00:56.910> do<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.149> one<00:00:57.270> at<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.480> time<00:00:57.660> but<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
at one so we do it one at a time but the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.869 
at one so we do it one at a time but the
students<00:00:58.649> get<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.920> actual<00:00:59.039> drive<00:00:59.430> something

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
students get the actual drive something

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.110 
students get the actual drive something
that<00:01:00.059> they<00:01:00.180> created<00:01:00.539> from<00:01:00.780> scratch<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:02.090> lot<00:01:03.090> of

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
that they created from scratch a lot of

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.109 
that they created from scratch a lot of
my<00:01:03.359> students<00:01:03.840> are<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.220> make<00:01:05.430> as<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> career

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
my students are is you make as a career

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.910 
my students are is you make as a career
a<00:01:06.150> lot<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.510> about<00:01:06.900> ninety<00:01:07.470> percent<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.799> them

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920
