00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.670
 40 dust match develop well to begin 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.300
 advise give to match 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.839
 leaves a good impression just 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.670
 gotta play like we played the first two with 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.369
 half period last ten minutes 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.670
 gave a little initiative than 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.640
 paid no goals so with this 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.260
 a rival like a leopard don't ask yourself 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.720
 relax and what attention before the game 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.380
 Brussels main thing you can be warned that 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.690
 we tried at some moments me on 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.710
 we knew that they had four equal fives 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.180
 cool play pressure active 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.420
 well ride all masters view and 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.399
 so we can not give way to traffic on 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.219
 roll back play 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:57.000
 physically strong so the focus on 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:57.539
 the gate I think everything else is like everything 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.399
 will be ok 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.199
 somehow dismantled the goalkeeper because he 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.449
 played 6 match it set a record in 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.990
 principle best player and leopard them 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.920
 somehow they could not 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:12.800
 Well, as a special attention principle, I think 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.650
 all all players they have good goalkeeper 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.900
 so, too, the Gagarin Cup final 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.619
 so we learned that you have to be in front 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.600
 stand him 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.830
 throw there will be finishing up some more 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.770
 pretty small moves well 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.430
 only today it was possible as for 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.450
 again and the second period there were matches 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.130
 will be like this 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.060
 when showers ak leopard more hit 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.190
 if you are a little bit not well 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.410
 will understand 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:50.509
 part of which are integral so here 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:53.420
 nothing terrible emotions are lagging behind 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:57.770
 here are men, that's why everything is manly. 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.420
 although different, and nothing there, and the first of 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.410
 teams from the east met meets 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.729
 still style 3 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:07.009
 in the west will be but at the moment we 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.979
 We do not pay attention to now have 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.970
 the challenge is to win the cup against whom we are 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.090
 We play and already another therefore disassembled 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:24.620
 the team knew what to expect from her 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:26.200
 what we can oppose not but i don't 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.450
 I can comment on this 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.829
 getting into the finals is always difficult no matter 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.739
 which conference play so all 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.299
 everyone here is deservedly considered 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:43.120
 Martin let him get bored 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.120
 directory lacquer disassembled you can watch 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:52.519
 don't even know how to answer this question 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:55.849
 hockey is never boring always understand 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:58.930
 there is a struggle there is always a slaughter on the ice and 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:02.769
 it does n't matter here like winning a game 10 or 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:06.919
 60 is a victory a victory is a victory therefore 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:12.250
 these are serious rivals we know with whom with 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:12.250
 who do we play an hour after
