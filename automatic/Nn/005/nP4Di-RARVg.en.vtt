of<00:06:36.299> sanctions<00:06:36.929> so<00:06:37.259> that<00:06:37.619> would<00:06:37.799> still<00:06:38.069> just

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:38.429 
of sanctions so that would still just

00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:40.189 
of sanctions so that would still just
raise<00:06:38.819> the<00:06:39.029> specter<00:06:39.179> of<00:06:39.449> economic

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:46.889 
excursion is off the table he said with

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:48.259 
excursion is off the table he said with
theirs<00:06:47.099> it<00:06:47.339> wouldn't<00:06:47.549> be<00:06:47.610> in<00:06:47.699> our<00:06:47.819> interest<00:06:47.969> it

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:48.269 
theirs it wouldn't be in our interest it

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:49.909 
theirs it wouldn't be in our interest it
wouldn't<00:06:48.479> be<00:06:48.539> in<00:06:48.659> Russia's<00:06:48.989> interest<00:06:49.019> and<00:06:49.469> one

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 
wouldn't be in Russia's interest and one

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:50.899 
wouldn't be in Russia's interest and one
thing<00:06:50.069> he<00:06:50.159> said<00:06:50.309> in<00:06:50.399> the<00:06:50.459> interview<00:06:50.610> that<00:06:50.879> I

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:50.909 
thing he said in the interview that I

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:52.549 
thing he said in the interview that I
think<00:06:51.179> was<00:06:51.329> overlooked<00:06:51.839> as<00:06:52.019> he<00:06:52.169> said<00:06:52.409> that

00:06:52.549 --> 00:06:52.559 
think was overlooked as he said that

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:55.189 
think was overlooked as he said that
Crimea<00:06:53.039> is<00:06:53.279> could<00:06:53.669> be<00:06:53.819> seen<00:06:54.059> as<00:06:54.269> in<00:06:54.809> Russia's

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 
Crimea is could be seen as in Russia's

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:57.199 
Crimea is could be seen as in Russia's
core<00:06:55.529> interests<00:06:56.309> meaning<00:06:56.909> that<00:06:56.999> their

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:57.209 
core interests meaning that their

00:06:57.209 --> 00:06:58.850 
core interests meaning that their
military<00:06:57.719> base<00:06:57.899> is<00:06:58.110> very<00:06:58.289> important<00:06:58.679> to<00:06:58.739> them

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
military base is very important to them

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.049 
military base is very important to them
so<00:06:58.889> that<00:06:59.039> is<00:06:59.429> almost<00:06:59.639> somewhat

00:07:00.049 --> 00:07:00.059 
so that is almost somewhat

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:01.850 
so that is almost somewhat
understandable<00:07:00.689> but<00:07:01.139> what<00:07:01.319> he's<00:07:01.409> saying<00:07:01.439> is

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 
understandable but what he's saying is

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.679 
understandable but what he's saying is
it<00:07:02.069> ends<00:07:02.459> there<00:07:02.759> unless<00:07:03.179> you<00:07:03.360> want<00:07:03.509> to<00:07:03.539> see

00:07:03.679 --> 00:07:03.689 
it ends there unless you want to see

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:05.539 
it ends there unless you want to see
further<00:07:03.869> sanctions<00:07:04.529> and<00:07:04.679> then<00:07:05.159> he<00:07:05.249> followed

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:05.549 
further sanctions and then he followed

00:07:05.549 --> 00:07:07.609 
further sanctions and then he followed
up<00:07:05.669> with<00:07:05.699> the<00:07:05.909> warning<00:07:06.269> that<00:07:06.300> he<00:07:06.479> also<00:07:06.619> issued

00:07:07.609 --> 00:07:07.619 
up with the warning that he also issued

00:07:07.619 --> 00:07:09.799 
up with the warning that he also issued
yesterday<00:07:07.829> it<00:07:08.759> has<00:07:09.029> to<00:07:09.239> stop<00:07:09.419> there<00:07:09.659> because

00:07:09.799 --> 00:07:09.809 
yesterday it has to stop there because

00:07:09.809 --> 00:07:12.469 
yesterday it has to stop there because
we<00:07:10.319> have<00:07:10.529> an<00:07:10.769> agreement<00:07:11.550> to<00:07:12.179> come<00:07:12.300> to<00:07:12.419> the
