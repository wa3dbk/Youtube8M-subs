00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
kept it and you know I mean it's kind of

special I bring it with me everywhere

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.709 
special I bring it with me everywhere
it's<00:00:52.920> actually<00:00:53.399> it's<00:00:53.940> actually<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.329> my<00:00:54.360> purse

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
it's actually it's actually in my purse

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.229 
it's actually it's actually in my purse
upstairs<00:00:57.859> but<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.890> didn't<00:00:59.399> start<00:00:59.850> playing

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
upstairs but I didn't start playing

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.860 
upstairs but I didn't start playing
football<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:01.020> be<00:01:01.199> here<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:02.059> didn't<00:01:03.059> even<00:01:03.120> dream

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
football to be here I didn't even dream

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.980 
football to be here I didn't even dream
that<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.199> was<00:01:04.320> possible<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.909> think<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
that it was possible and I think the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.190 
that it was possible and I think the
beauty<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.900> though<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.110> a

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
beauty of this is that though it's a

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.840 
beauty of this is that though it's a
dream<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.650> never<00:01:10.890> could<00:01:11.130> have<00:01:11.220> had<00:01:11.369> now<00:01:11.580> it's<00:01:11.760> a

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
dream I never could have had now it's a

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.380 
dream I never could have had now it's a
dream<00:01:12.090> other<00:01:12.270> girls<00:01:12.540> can<00:01:12.780> grow<00:01:12.930> up<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.260> half

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
dream other girls can grow up in half

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.700 
dream other girls can grow up in half
and<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.689> guess<00:01:15.930> if<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.170> makes<00:01:16.500> me<00:01:16.590> a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
and so I guess if that makes me a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.830 
and so I guess if that makes me a
trailblazer<00:01:17.310> then<00:01:17.840> she's<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> trailblazer

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
trailblazer then she's a trailblazer

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.330 
trailblazer then she's a trailblazer
well<00:01:21.840> then<00:01:22.170> I'm<00:01:22.290> honored<00:01:22.680> but<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.100> know<00:01:23.189> what

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
that only happens with the best possible

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.210
