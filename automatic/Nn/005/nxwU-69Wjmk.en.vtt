high<00:00:37.480> compression<00:00:37.900> landing<00:00:38.620> and<00:00:39.090> took<00:00:40.090> me<00:00:40.300> two

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
high compression landing and took me two

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.110 
high compression landing and took me two
different<00:00:41.290> days<00:00:41.470> that<00:00:42.340> we<00:00:42.460> went<00:00:42.640> there<00:00:42.790> to

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
different days that we went there to

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.290 
different days that we went there to
actually<00:00:43.809> land<00:00:43.960> it<00:00:44.230> to<00:00:44.940> pretty<00:00:45.940> high<00:00:46.090> ollie

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
actually land it to pretty high ollie

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.830 
actually land it to pretty high ollie
and<00:00:46.629> then<00:00:47.070> yeah<00:00:48.070> landing<00:00:48.670> was<00:00:48.790> hard<00:00:49.000> to<00:00:49.180> the

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
and then yeah landing was hard to the

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.590 
and then yeah landing was hard to the
nail<00:00:50.019> so<00:00:50.379> for<00:00:51.190> the<00:00:51.280> effort<00:00:51.580> that<00:00:51.610> it<00:00:52.120> took<00:00:52.330> and

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
nail so for the effort that it took and

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.049 
nail so for the effort that it took and
the<00:00:53.290> result<00:00:53.620> afterwards<00:00:54.309> I<00:00:54.489> was<00:00:54.610> so<00:00:54.790> rewarding

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
the result afterwards I was so rewarding

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.170 
the result afterwards I was so rewarding
so<00:00:55.600> I<00:00:56.020> think<00:00:56.770> was<00:00:56.890> my<00:00:57.340> favorite<00:00:57.640> shot<00:00:57.820> of<00:00:58.090> the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:05.290 
so I think was my favorite shot of the
year

hard<00:02:26.739> to<00:02:26.950> like<00:02:27.220> find<00:02:27.610> rails<00:02:28.540> I<00:02:28.750> think

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
hard to like find rails I think

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.949
