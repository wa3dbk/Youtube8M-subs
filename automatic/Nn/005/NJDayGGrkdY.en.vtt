sagging<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.290> dull<00:01:56.220> skin<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:57.000> dry<00:01:57.150> skin

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
sagging and dull skin and dry skin

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.240 
sagging and dull skin and dry skin
really<00:01:57.870> talks<00:01:58.170> about<00:01:58.260> replenishing<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.190> you

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
really talks about replenishing and you

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.010 
really talks about replenishing and you
need<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.520> replenish<00:01:59.790> but<00:02:00.210> what<00:02:00.690> if<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.870> could

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
need to replenish but what if you could

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.410 
need to replenish but what if you could
just<00:02:01.050> hold<00:02:01.470> on<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.800> what<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.040> have<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.610> started

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
just hold on to what you have I started

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.960 
just hold on to what you have I started
researching<00:02:03.600> i<00:02:04.020> found<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.650> protein<00:02:05.280> that

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
researching i found this protein that

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.120 
researching i found this protein that
had<00:02:06.240> been<00:02:06.390> discovered<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.620> was<00:02:07.830> buried

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
had been discovered that was buried

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.980 
had been discovered that was buried
under<00:02:08.310> glaciers<00:02:08.850> and<00:02:09.030> scientists<00:02:09.660> believe

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
under glaciers and scientists believe

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.330 
under glaciers and scientists believe
that<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.290> could<00:02:10.410> actually<00:02:10.440> protect<00:02:11.190> from

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
that it could actually protect from

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.100 
that it could actually protect from
oyster<00:02:11.640> loss<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.300> i<00:02:12.390> was<00:02:12.510> reading<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:12.990> i

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
oyster loss and i was reading that and i

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.040 
oyster loss and i was reading that and i
thought<00:02:13.350> wow<00:02:14.160> protect<00:02:15.030> from<00:02:15.240> moisture<00:02:15.420> loss<00:02:15.750> i

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
thought wow protect from moisture loss i

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.720 
thought wow protect from moisture loss i
think<00:02:16.410> i<00:02:16.530> really<00:02:16.920> found<00:02:17.130> what<00:02:17.430> has<00:02:17.550> been

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
think i really found what has been

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.400 
think i really found what has been
missing<00:02:17.850> in<00:02:18.120> skin<00:02:18.480> care<00:02:18.690> i<00:02:18.900> knew<00:02:19.260> at<00:02:19.380> that

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
missing in skin care i knew at that

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.010 
missing in skin care i knew at that
minute<00:02:19.710> I<00:02:19.980> had<00:02:20.220> an<00:02:20.460> amazing<00:02:21.150> anti-aging

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
minute I had an amazing anti-aging

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.470 
minute I had an amazing anti-aging
breakthrough<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.880> was<00:02:24.000> our<00:02:24.090> glacial

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
breakthrough and that was our glacial

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.560 
breakthrough and that was our glacial
protein<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:25.020> call<00:02:25.740> it<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:26.040> glacial<00:02:26.460> facial<00:02:27.180> in

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
protein I call it a glacial facial in

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.720 
protein I call it a glacial facial in
only<00:02:28.080> two<00:02:28.380> minutes<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.860> couldn't<00:02:29.250> believe<00:02:29.370> the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
only two minutes I couldn't believe the

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.250 
only two minutes I couldn't believe the
immediate<00:02:30.180> difference<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.600> saw<00:02:30.780> in<00:02:30.900> my<00:02:30.930> skin

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
immediate difference I saw in my skin

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.830 
immediate difference I saw in my skin
I'm<00:02:31.860> so<00:02:32.310> excited<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.120> discovered<00:02:33.690> ice

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
I'm so excited that I discovered ice

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.780 
I'm so excited that I discovered ice
elements<00:02:34.350> because<00:02:34.800> it's<00:02:34.950> designed<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.610> give

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790
