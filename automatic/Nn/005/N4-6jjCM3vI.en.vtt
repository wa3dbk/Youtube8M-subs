seven min switches the first which is by
stamina<00:02:01.250> up<00:02:01.429> you<00:02:01.640> need<00:02:01.789> to<00:02:01.909> flip<00:02:02.090> these

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
stamina up you need to flip these

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.899 
stamina up you need to flip these
switches<00:02:02.509> until<00:02:03.170> they<00:02:03.590> stop<00:02:03.920> sparking<00:02:04.700> now

over here but this is the second switch
right<00:02:10.190> here<00:02:10.369> now<00:02:10.910> these<00:02:11.270> switches<00:02:11.570> do<00:02:11.810> not

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
right here now these switches do not

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.530 
right here now these switches do not
light<00:02:12.410> up<00:02:12.620> in<00:02:12.890> this<00:02:13.310> exact<00:02:13.820> order<00:02:14.180> every

how<00:02:15.440> much<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:15.709> got<00:02:15.890> all<00:02:16.099> the<00:02:16.519> main<00:02:16.730> switch<00:02:17.030> is

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
how much you got all the main switch is

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.119 
how much you got all the main switch is
where<00:02:17.330> you<00:02:17.420> need<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:17.750> go<00:02:17.780> sauce<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.800> second

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.899 
switch I just flipped it wasn't sparked
anymore<00:02:21.349> now<00:02:21.769> the<00:02:21.830> third<00:02:22.310> switch<00:02:22.670> is<00:02:22.879> located

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
anymore now the third switch is located

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:26.500 
anymore now the third switch is located
up<00:02:23.950> by<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.010> church<00:02:25.459> now<00:02:25.730> for<00:02:25.909> example<00:02:26.330> if<00:02:26.480> the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
third switch wasn't here it might have

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.130 
third switch wasn't here it might have
been<00:02:28.190> by<00:02:28.370> spawn<00:02:28.819> you<00:02:29.269> have<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.599> go<00:02:29.720> to<00:02:29.780> spawn

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
been by spawn you have to go to spawn

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.740 
been by spawn you have to go to spawn
and<00:02:30.409> flip<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.799> make<00:02:31.099> sure<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.370> doesn't<00:02:31.750> spark

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
sparks you have to run them to this one

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.890 
sparks you have to run them to this one
to<00:02:37.069> make<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.280> spark<00:02:37.879> so<00:02:38.330> if<00:02:38.390> you<00:02:38.480> gotta<00:02:38.660> hope

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
to make it spark so if you gotta hope

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.530 
to make it spark so if you gotta hope
not<00:02:39.080> confusion<00:02:39.500> guy's<00:02:39.799> arm<00:02:40.099> a<00:02:40.730> little<00:02:41.000> bit<00:02:41.269> but
