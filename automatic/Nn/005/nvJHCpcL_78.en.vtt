00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.160
 How appropriate is the putting time of asparagus in the first place 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:23.000
 How good is saltiness ? 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:30.010
 There are a lot of things that you just don't understand just saying boil

 So, this time I will teach you how to cook delicious asparagus farmer direct transmission 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:38.480
 At first we prepare asparagus 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.480
 Mukimasu the skin per under one-third of the asparagus with peeler 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.100
 Boil the asparagus 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:50.839
 It is also good to use a large pot 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:57.039
 You can leave and use the frying pan a long asparagus one intact 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:57.039
 We use approximately 6g in 1 liter of hot water 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.000
 Please reduce the size of the pan according to the amount of asparagus 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:14.520
 If hot water is boiling , put only the root of asparagus in hot water 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.520
 Wait you 10 seconds 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.360
 Then lie down and wait 40 seconds 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.110
 40 has passed so let's raise it 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.990
 r 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.710
 Because the heat goes through with the residual heat 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.710
 I leave it as it is 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:02:01.469
 Large If you are not fit in the eyes Let's put in 2 equally divided into small Saki and the root 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.610
 When would cut less than two horses worth will help out escape flavor so be careful 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:09.899
 Please give me 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:13.260
 If the asparagus is thick, try adjusting it by slightly increasing the time with a scissors 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:17.900
 It is okay if you still live in asparagus 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:23.769
 Fresh asparagus is delicious even if eaten raw 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.769
