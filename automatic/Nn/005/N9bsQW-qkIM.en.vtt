happening yet i didn't get think that's

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.920 
happening yet i didn't get think that's
like<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:48.940> whole<00:01:49.060> beginning<00:01:49.270> this<00:01:49.600> is<00:01:49.750> just

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
like the whole beginning this is just

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.289 
like the whole beginning this is just
kind<00:01:50.080> of<00:01:50.140> i<00:01:50.350> left<00:01:51.159> in<00:01:51.310> there<00:01:51.460> since<00:01:51.670> I<00:01:51.820> died<00:01:52.060> out

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
kind of i left in there since I died out

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.149 
kind of i left in there since I died out
you<00:01:52.510> know<00:01:52.630> basically<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.530> whole<00:01:53.619> idea<00:01:54.100> of

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
you know basically the whole idea of

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.560 
you know basically the whole idea of
this<00:01:54.310> year's<00:01:54.580> if<00:01:54.729> you<00:01:54.790> don't<00:01:54.940> know<00:01:55.030> already<00:01:55.060> is

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
this year's if you don't know already is

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.020 
this year's if you don't know already is
basically<00:01:56.140> showing<00:01:56.799> my<00:01:57.040> first<00:01:57.310> death<00:01:57.700> and

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
basically showing my first death and

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.940 
basically showing my first death and
then<00:01:58.330> my<00:01:58.900> whole<00:01:59.080> life<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.560> then<00:01:59.650> my<00:01:59.890> next

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
then my whole life and then my next

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.130 
then my whole life and then my next
death<00:02:00.430> so<00:02:00.820> it<00:02:01.060> just<00:02:01.090> kind<00:02:01.420> of<00:02:01.450> closes<00:02:01.840> off<00:02:01.960> like

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
death so it just kind of closes off like

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.570 
death so it just kind of closes off like
that<00:02:02.290> and<00:02:02.500> I<00:02:02.560> needed<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:02.890> show<00:02:03.010> that<00:02:03.130> but<00:02:03.490> it
