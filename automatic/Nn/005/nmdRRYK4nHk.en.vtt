natural hair I had a perm at the end of

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.119 
natural hair I had a perm at the end of
junior<00:00:46.890> high<00:00:47.570> that<00:00:48.570> grew<00:00:49.260> out<00:00:49.289> eventually<00:00:49.770> on

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
junior high that grew out eventually on

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.330 
junior high that grew out eventually on
its<00:00:50.309> own<00:00:50.690> maybe<00:00:51.690> after<00:00:51.960> hair<00:00:52.890> breaking<00:00:53.219> off

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
its own maybe after hair breaking off

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.860 
its own maybe after hair breaking off
and<00:00:53.370> trimming<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.059> all<00:00:54.180> other<00:00:54.420> stuff<00:00:54.510> I

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
and trimming and all other stuff I

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.840 
and trimming and all other stuff I
chopped<00:00:55.500> off<00:00:55.649> most<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:56.010> my<00:00:56.100> hair<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.579> guess<00:00:56.730> you

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
chopped off most of my hair I guess you

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.389 
chopped off most of my hair I guess you
can<00:00:57.000> say<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.480> did<00:00:58.170> do<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> big<00:00:58.710> chop<00:00:58.949> because<00:00:59.280> I

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
can say I did do a big chop because I

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.700 
can say I did do a big chop because I
consider<00:00:59.910> cutting<00:01:00.149> off<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:01.230> know<00:01:01.350> four

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
consider cutting off you know four

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.860 
consider cutting off you know four
inches<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.980> hair<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:03.000> consider<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.449> big

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
inches of hair so I consider that a big

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.200 
inches of hair so I consider that a big
chop<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.409> think<00:01:04.769> that's<00:01:04.860> pretty<00:01:05.070> big<00:01:05.280> I

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
chop I think that's pretty big I

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.530 
chop I think that's pretty big I
basically<00:01:06.840> war<00:01:07.409> quite<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> few<00:01:08.640> styles<00:01:08.909> i<00:01:09.299> wore

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
basically war quite a few styles i wore

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.330

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
have as much hair to work with so you

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.719 
have as much hair to work with so you
have<00:04:35.050> to<00:04:35.169> kind<00:04:35.319> of<00:04:35.439> make<00:04:35.830> sure<00:04:35.860> it<00:04:36.189> stays<00:04:36.460> and

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729

have to kind of make sure it stays and
everything<00:04:37.090> and<00:04:37.240> I<00:04:37.300> know<00:04:37.389> that<00:04:37.539> was<00:04:37.659> problem

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
everything and I know that was problem

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.450 
but that is it's kind of up to you to
figure<00:05:14.050> that<00:05:14.319> out<00:05:14.500> because<00:05:14.770> it<00:05:15.009> depends<00:05:15.310> on

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
figure that out because it depends on

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.459 
figure that out because it depends on

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
would probably have to do some really

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.409 
would probably have to do some really
large<00:05:26.460> flat<00:05:27.460> twist<00:05:27.759> because<00:05:27.909> I<00:05:28.060> know<00:05:28.120> that's

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
large flat twist because I know that's

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.659

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:34.779 
girls then you could probably use

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:39.329
