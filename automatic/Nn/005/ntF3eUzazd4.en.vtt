00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.680
 for lack of cucumber that is very easy 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.050
 I went to the super or the evening and there I 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.390
 I bought a roasted chicken here already 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.340
 I have ready and we will be accompanied by two 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.130
 delicious sauces a sauce that is very 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.890
 very known stem that is a sauce 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.050
 tsatsiki that is made from cucumber 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.780
 grated that since it was grated what 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.660
 we squeeze here I have it I'm going to put 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.590
 down 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.520
 like lemon 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.520
 and yogurt 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.720
 the cucumber if it is very widespread with the 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.880
 gas to take all this away from me 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.470
 salt moisture of course but that 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.420
 cool you see the times that I and I 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.629
 love this salsita they sell it in the 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.760
 department store is pepper 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.030
 self-service than behind with credentials 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.860
 and it costs very expensive I do not know why not the 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.470
 can prepare one of the towns and this 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.560
 it's a sachs sauce and that very well very 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.320
 very Greek ok although now we have in a 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.700
 bowl can put my roasted chicken not 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.550
 move him here and now I'm going to put 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.110
 in another bowl chopped seed tomatoes 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.030
 2 on the diced cucumber 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.250
 finally minced that is that 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.630
 let's put parsley 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.630

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.160
 sauces to txiki nothing more as a single 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.990
 it's the only thing he has that we can say 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.700
 that is foreign but that we can 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.869
 find in the super and prepare at home 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.990

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.590
 we have romaine lettuce and it's finely 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.560

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.000
 aroma immediately that one puts all 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.370
 the herbs so dry is also another 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.130
 important thing starts one to smell 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:52.380

 and roasted but we want to give it a 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.600
 different flavor so that not everyone 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.600

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.110

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.180
 true that it is a flavor completely 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.569
 green with the fact that you put other 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.000
 oils spices spices other herbs 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.220

 melt hair and do different things 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.960
 because in those big tortillas of 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.880
 flour that are selling art in the 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.650
 super can do a few watts that 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.180
 they call very famous with all this of 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.639
 better without asad to which you can 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.850
 go aside and well let's start 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.650
 to order the kitchen is to vary 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.930
 exactly what do you think if we grab 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.660
 rye those sauces to demand although in 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.530
 our Arab plans and we bathe them 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.530
 completely 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.490
 that goes deep that goes deep in the 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.380
 part of up down 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.380
 how delicious and fresh 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.530

 we're 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.280
 we mix we put enough sauce sachs 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.490
 its 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.020
 it's like the basis of our recipe is 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.180
 imagine the taste that bread has 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.889
 Arab with that combination of oil that 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.840
 we just made with this infusion of 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:19.880
 oil with those herbs that delicious 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.880
 How are we going to see chicken? 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.360
 we avoided a lot of cooking time on 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.000
 Chicken not process what we buy 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.350

 the chick does not 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:48.140
 and it's like a pizza could also be 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:51.820
 say that maybe I 'm going to grab little plant 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.820

 little like dieting because I really do not 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.680

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.360
