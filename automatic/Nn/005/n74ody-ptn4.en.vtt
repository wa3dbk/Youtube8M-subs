ponytail<00:00:22.470> trimming<00:00:22.890> it's<00:00:23.010> actually<00:00:23.340> one<00:00:23.580> of

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
ponytail trimming it's actually one of

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.700 
ponytail trimming it's actually one of
the<00:00:23.789> very<00:00:23.970> easiest<00:00:24.510> things<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.990> be<00:00:25.170> able<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.529> do

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
the very easiest things to be able to do

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.339 
the very easiest things to be able to do
and<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.580> also<00:00:26.880> helps<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.449> create<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:28.050> little

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
and it also helps to create that little

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.279 
and it also helps to create that little
kind<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.890> roundness<00:00:29.460> into<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.179> face<00:00:30.480> frame<00:00:30.840> or

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
kind of roundness into a face frame or

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.410 
kind of roundness into a face frame or
into<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.890> bangs<00:00:32.099> whichever<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.820> prefer<00:00:32.940> but

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
into the bangs whichever you prefer but

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.630 
into the bangs whichever you prefer but
remember<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.860> going<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.160> be<00:00:35.250> shorter

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
remember that it is going to be shorter

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.240 
remember that it is going to be shorter
onto<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.090> inside<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.960> longer<00:00:37.770> towards<00:00:38.100> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
onto the inside and longer towards the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.000 
onto the inside and longer towards the
outside<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:39.450> my<00:00:39.660> model<00:00:39.870> Jana<00:00:40.260> here<00:00:40.649> she's

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.229 

and<00:02:09.659> what<00:02:10.499> I<00:02:10.679> like<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:10.979> do<00:02:11.249> not<00:02:11.549> to<00:02:11.760> make<00:02:11.909> any

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
and what I like to do not to make any

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.339 
and what I like to do not to make any
kind<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.989> solid<00:02:13.469> line<00:02:14.069> is<00:02:14.459> I<00:02:14.719> will<00:02:15.719> be<00:02:15.989> point

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
kind of solid line is I will be point

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.099 
kind of solid line is I will be point
sniffing<00:02:16.769> which<00:02:16.950> is<00:02:17.129> taking<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.609> shears<00:02:18.109> into

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.109 
sniffing which is taking the shears into

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:23.959 
sniffing which is taking the shears into
an<00:02:19.230> upward<00:02:19.730> motion<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:20.849> just<00:02:21.950> slowly<00:02:22.969> slicing

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:23.969 
an upward motion and just slowly slicing

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.209 
an upward motion and just slowly slicing
in<00:02:24.239> and<00:02:24.510> what<00:02:24.749> that's<00:02:24.959> going<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.379> do<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.829> just

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.219 
in and what that's going to do is just

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:28.970 
in and what that's going to do is just
give<00:02:26.400> me<00:02:26.549> a<00:02:26.579> little<00:02:26.909> jagged<00:02:27.239> you<00:02:27.900> know<00:02:27.989> fringe

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
give me a little jagged you know fringe

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.000 
give me a little jagged you know fringe
onto<00:02:29.549> that<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.719> it's<00:02:30.870> not<00:02:31.049> a<00:02:31.319> solid

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
onto that so that it's not a solid

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.360 
onto that so that it's not a solid
outline<00:02:32.819> it'll<00:02:33.659> just<00:02:33.900> be<00:02:34.079> a<00:02:34.109> nice<00:02:34.620> wispy

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
outline it'll just be a nice wispy

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.629 
outline it'll just be a nice wispy
little<00:02:35.969> ends<00:02:36.359> I'm<00:02:36.480> just<00:02:37.290> gonna<00:02:37.409> rock<00:02:38.340> back<00:02:38.609> and

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:38.639 
little ends I'm just gonna rock back and

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.759 
little ends I'm just gonna rock back and
forth<00:02:39.150> just<00:02:39.749> to<00:02:39.930> make<00:02:40.079> sure<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.379> that<00:02:40.560> is

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
forth just to make sure that that is

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:47.929 
forth just to make sure that that is
even<00:02:44.030> bring<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.180> back<00:02:45.359> down<00:02:46.370> go<00:02:47.370> back<00:02:47.639> over

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:47.939 
even bring it back down go back over

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:54.339 
even bring it back down go back over
these<00:02:48.299> ends<00:02:50.359> and<00:02:52.159> just<00:02:53.159> remember<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:53.699> center

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
these ends and just remember the center

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.929 
these ends and just remember the center
is<00:02:55.349> going<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.709> be<00:02:55.769> a<00:02:55.829> straight<00:02:56.250> line<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.790> will

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:56.939 
is going to be a straight line and will

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.449 
is going to be a straight line and will
be<00:02:56.969> the<00:02:57.209> shortest<00:02:57.659> well<00:02:57.989> these<00:02:58.349> sides<00:02:59.040> are

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
be the shortest well these sides are

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.789 
be the shortest well these sides are
traveling<00:03:00.419> and<00:03:00.599> moving<00:03:01.049> in<00:03:01.199> which<00:03:01.439> will<00:03:01.590> keep

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
traveling and moving in which will keep

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.229 
traveling and moving in which will keep
that<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.040> little<00:03:02.189> bit<00:03:02.579> longer

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
that a little bit longer

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.990 
that a little bit longer
once<00:03:04.109> you're<00:03:04.319> done<00:03:04.590> take<00:03:05.400> off<00:03:05.609> your<00:03:05.790> rubber

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
band shake and you have a nice form that

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.240 
band shake and you have a nice form that
will<00:03:11.669> flow<00:03:12.199> around<00:03:13.199> into<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.530> face<00:03:13.769> as<00:03:13.979> a<00:03:14.009> nice

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
will flow around into the face as a nice
