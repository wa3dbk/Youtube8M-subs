00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
here's a little demonstration on how I

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.760 
here's a little demonstration on how I
take<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.969> case<00:01:24.179> off<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.630> remove<00:01:25.020> one<00:01:25.289> corner<00:01:25.710> of

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
take the case off I remove one corner of

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.270 
take the case off I remove one corner of
the<00:01:25.859> case<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.340> work<00:01:26.969> my<00:01:27.119> way<00:01:27.149> down<00:01:28.130> keep<00:01:29.130> in

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
the case and work my way down keep in

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.099 
the case and work my way down keep in
mind<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.609> when<00:01:29.789> you<00:01:29.909> buy<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.090> case<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.810> also

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:31.109 
mind that when you buy this case it also

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:32.959 
mind that when you buy this case it also
suffers<00:01:31.590> from<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.799> same<00:01:31.920> problem<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.609> other

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
suffers from the same problem that other

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:35.539 
suffers from the same problem that other
slim<00:01:33.509> cases<00:01:34.049> have<00:01:34.259> when<00:01:34.679> taking<00:01:35.009> off<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.310> case

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
slim cases have when taking off the case

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.029 
slim cases have when taking off the case
it<00:01:35.850> leaves<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.389> slight<00:01:36.780> gash<00:01:37.139> in<00:01:37.499> the<00:01:37.649> corners

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
it leaves a slight gash in the corners

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.660 
it leaves a slight gash in the corners
of<00:01:38.069> your<00:01:38.280> phone<00:01:38.520> because<00:01:38.789> of<00:01:39.090> how<00:01:39.270> tight<00:01:39.569> it<00:01:39.780> is

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
of your phone because of how tight it is

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.340 
of your phone because of how tight it is
so<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:41.819> conclusion<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.509> don't<00:01:42.840> believe<00:01:43.079> that

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
so in conclusion I don't believe that

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.169 
so in conclusion I don't believe that
this<00:01:43.560> case<00:01:43.889> is<00:01:44.219> with<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.639> thirty<00:01:44.939> dollar

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
this case is with the thirty dollar

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.149 
this case is with the thirty dollar
price<00:01:45.539> tag<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:46.079> made<00:01:46.319> of<00:01:46.469> cheap<00:01:46.709> feeling

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
price tag it's made of cheap feeling

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.709 
price tag it's made of cheap feeling
plastic<00:01:47.700> doesn't<00:01:47.999> offer<00:01:48.329> much<00:01:48.509> protection

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
plastic doesn't offer much protection

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:51.349 
plastic doesn't offer much protection
and<00:01:49.530> there<00:01:49.889> are<00:01:49.979> definitely<00:01:50.399> more<00:01:50.670> economical
