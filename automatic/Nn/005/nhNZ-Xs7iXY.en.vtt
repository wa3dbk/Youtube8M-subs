00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello my name is Victoria and in this 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.759
 video i want to show you that i 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.890
 cooked on the erosion of her bedroom 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.320
 how to get this is my first room 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.179
 by which went here but so little i 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.190
 she picked the most important thing 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.740
 considering it was a wardrobe and chest of drawers 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.260
 here but it passed during the shift 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.880
 seasonal clothes and so everything was there 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.830
 neatly this already such trifles which 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.420
 I managed to collect 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.519
 Well, first thing I turned 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.140
 attention that for some reason I keep a brush 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.570
 boxes of brushes real these neff 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.030
 why honestly not clearly found such 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.770
 an empty box of cream blush 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.120
 honestly ruble on opinion 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.399
 liked at all some not very 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.079
 many quality long thought what is this 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.840
 Gizmo so then I realized that this 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.640
 mattress ventilation as it fell but 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.660
 back it is not attached that's why 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.800
 win a couple of perfume probes 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.699
 water from living 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.860
 do not use will not be here well, and such 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.629
 a little thing to me Makovsky consultant wrote 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.390
 all that I liked well all that 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.120
 I wanted to buy it all ! 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.330
 no, well, such a thing will show you 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.439
 this flower is my poor soaked facies 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.390
 three years somewhere she lives with me and here 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.590
 honestly all three years tormenting me 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.780
 and it just happened that 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.570
 the plant got caught with some insects 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.490
 which I have already endured four times 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.960
 tried to process the street and they all 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.479
 equals from somewhere later 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.759
 that's how it was like a struggle but I 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.290
 just here with the last weeks of trawling 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.540
 tired to fight 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.549
 therefore, the last of the leaves break off your 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.270
 and most likely this whole spine 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.409
 give mom want to let him try say 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.960
 so his again 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.850
 recreate but honestly I did not achieve 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.820
 the very same plant that saw 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.380
 anywhere in the Shanghai parks 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.520
 huge beautiful with dark green 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.579
 shiny leaves 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.500
 Well that's why both would have such a thing in 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.420
 viewing here's a video received with 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.329
 very short therefore on demand I gave 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.130
 I'll show you some flowers 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.229
 it is in my bedroom which i have 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.890
 I can immediately say nothing special 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.540
 therefore so purely curious further 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.129
 here u does not grow chlorophytum the most 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.959
 the usual one is like this 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.239
 don't need i have one designer 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.130
 I need a project in the kitchen 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.890
 these here 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.750
 kids I actively breed here 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.400
 then when I do there for you 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.840
 show there grows with me 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.130
 poor-unfortunate plant which 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.830
 just adore red currant 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.380
 they come in red and green here 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.930
 only recently had a cap opened 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.720
 the balcony she froze and almost all died 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.240
 but I kind of survived a lot 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.800
 she's on the other side of me on the floor 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.500
 near the balcony door grow two 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.930
 wax shoulders chic on a sunny 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.390
 side they bloom so let's say 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.670
 inflorescences in the form of a ball just very 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.950
 I like them here but this is mine 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.990
 philodendron chick is long here 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.100
 generally comes down a man who is very 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.750
 loves various climbing plants himself 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.300
 You can say a dark corner 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.700
 my bedroom lives with me aloe vera he 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.700
 It is considered as if it were true that Oleg is 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.100
 but in tropical areas such he is huge 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.350
 sizes and I do not know maybe something like that 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.100
 here he is too imposingly lounging there 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.650
 because he's so huge 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:18.710
 leaves let's say looks up well 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.480
 I like him very rarely this particular 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.340
 version i'm quietly somewhere 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.520
 Germany itself on some small 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.440
 cosmetic mask 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.410
 Well, this thing has already shown you how 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.990
 she lay with me like this and while we 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.250
 bought the regiment understood that it is very difficult 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.800
 back straighten out because she 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.350
 relatively stiff in principle 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.510
 I did not want me up 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.980
 sticking her 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.740
 dieffenbachia it is well, let it be so original 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.560
 I have it curled up 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.380
 on the floor I have here also such 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.840
 big ficus well I do not know maybe someone 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.700
 over decently but already it is necessary to vymahal 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.730
 continue to support him further 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.090
 more right here is the usual greenback 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.400
 ficus but my windowsill is growing here with 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.980
 one side a pair of such flowers is 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.500
 let's say so little pieces that 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.660
 stayed after accidentally bad 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.010
 by taking care of the money tree 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.140
 we have 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.730
 all has gone bad and that's what 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.799
 sprouts left here they were planted in 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.200
 separate pot and this is the antlers 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.000
 who were huge bush he have us 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.090
 children's room stood but I have a child 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.100
 rolling down a hill 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.770
 just quite got into this bush all by 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.169
 broke off here bye now standing here 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.889
 getting them pots in my color scheme 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.990
 bedrooms 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.910
 but in principle, plans to give someone 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:40.530
 because they are here so little in 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:42.449
 Mexico is not a city but three of my favorites 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.479
 can say . I'm just the same besides 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.760
 genes adore various ferns here 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.800
 so here they are with me here on 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.949
 the windowsill of such triple compositions 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:56.010
 two of them are a little bit I have dried up this 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.600
 in the summer, here I am then their cycles well in general 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.720
 it's like all the plants 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.900
 my bedroom I wish everyone happiness everyone 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.900
 until
