impressive<00:01:56.219> looking<00:01:56.549> little<00:01:57.299> camera<00:01:57.719> here

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
impressive looking little camera here

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.340 
impressive looking little camera here
it's<00:01:58.619> not<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.009> thin<00:01:59.610> but<00:01:59.850> it's<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.299> sort<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.899> do

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
it's not that thin but it's a sort of do

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.950 
it's not that thin but it's a sort of do
really<00:02:01.680> wondering<00:02:02.040> thinner<00:02:02.850> because<00:02:03.149> the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
really wondering thinner because the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.319 
really wondering thinner because the
actual<00:02:04.320> camera<00:02:04.920> fits<00:02:05.280> nice<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.610> solid<00:02:06.030> lead

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329

large screen around the back and I can

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.179 
large screen around the back and I can
definitely<00:02:19.150> say<00:02:20.019> that<00:02:20.049> when<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:20.709> was<00:02:20.890> on<00:02:21.010> is

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
definitely say that when I was on is

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.099 
definitely say that when I was on is
actually<00:02:21.310> very<00:02:21.519> very<00:02:21.939> sharp<00:02:22.239> and<00:02:22.420> crisp<00:02:22.629> so

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:23.109

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
all the other modes that you want to use

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.860 
all the other modes that you want to use
which<00:02:47.049> is<00:02:47.169> normally<00:02:47.590> designed<00:02:47.919> for<00:02:48.459> higher

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
which is normally designed for higher

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.300 
which is normally designed for higher
sort<00:02:49.870> of<00:02:49.959> cameras<00:02:50.379> and<00:02:50.409> professionals<00:02:51.099> but

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
sort of cameras and professionals but

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.539 
sort of cameras and professionals but
they've<00:02:51.609> shrunk<00:02:51.939> it<00:02:52.150> into<00:02:52.299> this<00:02:52.389> smaller<00:02:52.689> body

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
they've shrunk it into this smaller body

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.580 
they've shrunk it into this smaller body
one<00:02:54.549> of<00:02:54.639> the<00:02:54.730> reasons<00:02:54.909> is<00:02:55.359> so<00:02:55.569> good<00:02:55.840> is<00:02:56.079> that

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
one of the reasons is so good is that

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.129 
one of the reasons is so good is that
it's<00:02:56.829> got<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.069> lens<00:02:57.849> that<00:02:58.150> has<00:02:58.359> an<00:02:58.629> aperture<00:02:58.900> of

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
it's got a lens that has an aperture of

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.619 
it's got a lens that has an aperture of
f<00:02:59.439> 1.8<00:03:00.069> what<00:03:00.310> that<00:03:00.459> means<00:03:00.669> it<00:03:00.969> allows<00:03:01.239> a<00:03:01.269> lot<00:03:01.540> of

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
f 1.8 what that means it allows a lot of

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.119 
f 1.8 what that means it allows a lot of
lights<00:03:01.900> coming<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.439> camera<00:03:02.739> even<00:03:03.010> in

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
lights coming the camera even in

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.699 
lights coming the camera even in
low-light<00:03:03.280> situations<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.959> only<00:03:05.109> works<00:03:05.439> the

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
low-light situations it only works the

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.970 
low-light situations it only works the
more<00:03:05.889> wide<00:03:06.189> angle<00:03:06.819> so<00:03:07.389> it<00:03:07.810> doesn't<00:03:08.290> always<00:03:08.409> say

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
more wide angle so it doesn't always say

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.339 
more wide angle so it doesn't always say
at<00:03:09.219> one<00:03:09.400> point<00:03:09.579> eight<00:03:09.760> when<00:03:09.879> you<00:03:09.969> zoom<00:03:10.180> in<00:03:10.450> but

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
at one point eight when you zoom in but

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.559 
at one point eight when you zoom in but
it<00:03:11.469> definitely<00:03:11.680> is<00:03:12.639> pretty<00:03:13.030> unique<00:03:13.269> in<00:03:13.540> that

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
it definitely is pretty unique in that

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.140 
it definitely is pretty unique in that
sense<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.829> camera<00:03:15.189> also<00:03:15.219> has<00:03:15.459> this<00:03:15.730> front

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
sense the camera also has this front

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.719 
sense the camera also has this front
dial<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.230> it<00:03:17.650> allows<00:03:17.979> you<00:03:18.159> to<00:03:18.310> change

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:18.729 
dial and it allows you to change

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:20.430 
dial and it allows you to change
different<00:03:19.389> modes<00:03:19.599> and<00:03:19.750> you<00:03:19.840> can<00:03:19.989> set<00:03:20.199> this<00:03:20.379> up

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
different modes and you can set this up

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.599 
different modes and you can set this up
however<00:03:20.829> you<00:03:21.040> like<00:03:21.129> but<00:03:21.639> it's<00:03:22.239> a<00:03:22.299> very<00:03:22.329> smooth

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
however you like but it's a very smooth

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.309 
however you like but it's a very smooth
set<00:03:24.609> up<00:03:24.729> so<00:03:25.000> you<00:03:25.090> can<00:03:25.269> use<00:03:25.479> a<00:03:25.510> for<00:03:25.780> focusing

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
set up so you can use a for focusing

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.170 
set up so you can use a for focusing
user<00:03:26.680> for<00:03:26.979> shutter<00:03:27.220> priority<00:03:27.430> you<00:03:27.819> can<00:03:27.940> use<00:03:28.030> it

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
user for shutter priority you can use it

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.149 
user for shutter priority you can use it
for<00:03:28.299> a<00:03:28.359> whole<00:03:28.629> different<00:03:28.989> things<00:03:29.229> and<00:03:29.500> adjust

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 
for a whole different things and adjust

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.509 
for a whole different things and adjust
it<00:03:30.340> that<00:03:30.459> way<00:03:30.609> as<00:03:30.790> well<00:03:30.900> so<00:03:31.900> that's<00:03:32.049> pretty

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
it that way as well so that's pretty

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.920 
it that way as well so that's pretty
interesting<00:03:33.519> to<00:03:34.060> have<00:03:36.569> having<00:03:37.569> a<00:03:37.629> look<00:03:37.780> at<00:03:37.840> the

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
interesting to have having a look at the

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.300 
interesting to have having a look at the
camera<00:03:38.260> around<00:03:38.409> the<00:03:38.530> front<00:03:38.709> you<00:03:38.919> can<00:03:38.949> see<00:03:39.069> it's

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
camera around the front you can see it's

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.920 
camera around the front you can see it's
