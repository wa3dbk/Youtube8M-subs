is going to end up in that starting

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.819 
is going to end up in that starting
lineup<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:45.030> could<00:01:45.210> be<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.479> potent<00:01:46.320> offense

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
lineup so this could be a potent offense

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.789 
lineup so this could be a potent offense
and<00:01:47.009> now<00:01:47.430> with<00:01:47.640> Bradley<00:01:48.180> Beal<00:01:48.659> out<00:01:49.229> for<00:01:49.770> I

and now with Bradley Beal out for I

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.889 
and now with Bradley Beal out for I
think<00:01:49.890> he's<00:01:50.130> out<00:01:50.250> for<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.520> couple<00:01:50.820> months<00:01:51.180> we

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
think he's out for a couple months we

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.319 
think he's out for a couple months we
could<00:01:52.110> definitely<00:01:52.409> see<00:01:52.920> ourselves<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.729> that

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.209 
could definitely see ourselves and that
three<00:01:54.720> or<00:01:54.930> four<00:01:55.200> position<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.860> think<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
three or four position I think the

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.969 
three or four position I think the
Toronto<00:01:56.850> Raptors<00:01:57.390> will<00:01:58.170> probably<00:01:58.619> be<00:01:58.799> the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
Toronto Raptors will probably be the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.219 
Toronto Raptors will probably be the
other<00:01:59.189> team<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.820> course<00:02:00.420> are<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.689> Indiana
