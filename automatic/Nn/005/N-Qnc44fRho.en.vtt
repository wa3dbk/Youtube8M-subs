production of a storm bowling ball what

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.930 
production of a storm bowling ball what
makes<00:00:13.679> them<00:00:13.830> hook<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.099> much<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.490> back<00:00:14.610> end

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
makes them hook so much on the back end

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.220 
makes them hook so much on the back end
what<00:00:15.150> makes<00:00:15.299> them<00:00:15.450> do<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.809> things<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.080> they

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
what makes them do the things that they

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.500 
what makes them do the things that they
do<00:00:16.289> on<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.680> lane<00:00:16.940> well<00:00:17.940> let's<00:00:18.090> take<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.300> little

headquarters now there's three very
important<00:00:23.130> items<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.699> consider<00:00:23.850> when<00:00:24.240> you're

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
important items to consider when you're

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.099 
important items to consider when you're
looking<00:00:24.390> at<00:00:25.109> ball<00:00:25.529> motion<00:00:25.980> or<00:00:26.099> ball<00:00:26.279> reaction

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
inner part this orange part you see on

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.470 
inner part this orange part you see on
our<00:00:34.559> booster<00:00:35.489> core<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.880> rocket<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.360> is

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
our booster core in the rocket this is

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.569 
our booster core in the rocket this is
actually<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.870> weight<00:00:37.079> block<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:38.160> white

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
actually the weight block that white

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.160 
actually the weight block that white
material<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.390> goes<00:00:39.510> around<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.989> weight

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
material that goes around the weight

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.619 
material that goes around the weight
block<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.620> called<00:00:40.770> core<00:00:41.129> material<00:00:41.670> number<00:00:42.210> two

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
block is called core material number two

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.319 
block is called core material number two
you'll<00:00:43.350> want<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.680> consider<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.670> cover<00:00:44.969> stock

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
you'll want to consider the cover stock

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.170 
you'll want to consider the cover stock
or<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.600> shell<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.289> then<00:00:46.710> three<00:00:47.250> you'll<00:00:47.969> want

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
or the shell and then three you'll want

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.029 
or the shell and then three you'll want
to<00:00:48.239> consider<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:49.350> finish<00:00:50.570> is<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.809> polished<00:00:52.320> is

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
to consider the finish is it polished is

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.189 
to consider the finish is it polished is
it<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.370> very<00:00:53.579> dull<00:00:53.910> finish<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.360> matte<00:00:54.660> finish<00:00:54.899> or

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
it a very dull finish a matte finish or

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.119 
it a very dull finish a matte finish or
is<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.410> maybe<00:00:55.559> somewhere<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.219> between<00:00:57.920> so<00:00:58.920> when

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
is it maybe somewhere in between so when

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.279 
is it maybe somewhere in between so when
we're<00:00:59.280> looking<00:00:59.609> at<00:00:59.760> superior<00:01:00.629> performance

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
we're looking at superior performance

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.590 
we're looking at superior performance
and<00:01:01.530> ball<00:01:01.680> reaction<00:01:02.250> we're<00:01:03.090> talking<00:01:03.480> about

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
and ball reaction we're talking about

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.830 
and ball reaction we're talking about
balancing<00:01:04.530> those<00:01:05.070> three<00:01:05.400> items<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.510> get

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
balancing those three items if you get

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.190 
balancing those three items if you get
too<00:01:07.229> much<00:01:07.380> core<00:01:07.770> not<00:01:08.580> enough<00:01:08.820> cover<00:01:09.060> stock<00:01:09.390> or

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
too much core not enough cover stock or

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.140 
too much core not enough cover stock or
let's<00:01:10.409> say<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.650> get<00:01:10.950> too<00:01:11.250> much<00:01:11.430> finish<00:01:11.909> and

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
let's say you get too much finish and

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.929 
let's say you get too much finish and
not<00:01:12.659> enough<00:01:12.930> shell<00:01:13.170> material<00:01:13.760> you're<00:01:14.760> not

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
not enough shell material you're not

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.820 
not enough shell material you're not
going<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.180> get<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.689> optimum<00:01:16.140> ball<00:01:16.290> reaction

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
going to get the optimum ball reaction

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.679 
going to get the optimum ball reaction
that<00:01:17.310> you're<00:01:17.430> looking<00:01:17.759> for<00:01:17.970> all<00:01:18.240> right<00:01:18.479> well

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
that you're looking for all right well

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.270 
that you're looking for all right well
what<00:01:18.990> we're<00:01:19.080> gonna<00:01:19.229> try<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.710> show<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:19.950> here

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
what we're gonna try and show you here

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.010 
what we're gonna try and show you here
now<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.640> we've<00:01:20.790> got<00:01:20.970> three<00:01:21.299> different<00:01:21.450> rockets

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
now is we've got three different rockets

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.719 
now is we've got three different rockets
you<00:01:22.140> can<00:01:22.259> see<00:01:22.350> they<00:01:22.470> look<00:01:22.500> pretty<00:01:22.740> similar<00:01:23.009> but

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
you can see they look pretty similar but

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:24.920 
you can see they look pretty similar but
you<00:01:23.820> can<00:01:23.939> actually<00:01:24.119> notice<00:01:24.689> if<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.900> look

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
you can actually notice if you look

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.539 
you can actually notice if you look
closely<00:01:25.290> we<00:01:25.560> have<00:01:25.680> three<00:01:25.979> different<00:01:26.159> colored

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
closely we have three different colored

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.569 
closely we have three different colored
finger<00:01:26.970> grips<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.229> going<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:29.009> denote

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
finger grips and this is going to denote

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.190 
finger grips and this is going to denote
a<00:01:29.850> little<00:01:30.150> bit<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.390> difference<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.930> some

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
a little bit of a difference in some

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.620 
a little bit of a difference in some
component<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.860> ball<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.509> Justin<00:01:33.509> why

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
component of the ball so Justin why

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
component of the ball so Justin why
don't<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.840> tell<00:01:34.020> us<00:01:34.049> what<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.320> have<00:01:34.500> going

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
don't you tell us what you have going

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.649 
don't you tell us what you have going
here<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.310> have<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.909> ball<00:01:36.030> at<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.210> white<00:01:36.390> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
here I have the ball at the white the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.130 
here I have the ball at the white the
white<00:01:37.100> inserts<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:39.000> ball<00:01:39.240> actually<00:01:39.750> has<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
white inserts this ball actually has the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.710 
white inserts this ball actually has the
booster<00:01:40.530> core<00:01:40.740> which<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.460> rocket<00:01:41.850> but

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
booster core which is in the rocket but

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.359 
booster core which is in the rocket but
the<00:01:43.020> cover<00:01:43.409> stock<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.829> actually<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.220> much

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
the cover stock is actually a much

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.630 
the cover stock is actually a much
milder<00:01:44.640> or<00:01:44.909> less<00:01:45.149> reactive<00:01:45.479> cover<00:01:45.899> stock

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.610 

so<00:01:49.640> you<00:01:49.730> can<00:01:49.880> tell<00:01:50.060> at<00:01:50.210> the<00:01:50.300> very<00:01:50.510> last<00:01:51.230> end<00:01:51.560> of

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
so you can tell at the very last end of

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.050 
so you can tell at the very last end of
the<00:01:51.680> lane<00:01:51.860> it<00:01:52.040> doesn't<00:01:52.340> actually<00:01:52.430> come<00:01:52.880> back

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
the lane it doesn't actually come back

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.940 
the lane it doesn't actually come back
in<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.300> depends<00:01:53.690> like<00:01:53.840> it<00:01:53.960> should<00:01:54.230> with<00:01:54.800> that

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
in the depends like it should with that

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.710 
in the depends like it should with that
aggressive<00:01:55.370> core<00:01:55.610> it<00:01:55.940> should<00:01:56.180> actually<00:01:56.330> bite

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
aggressive core it should actually bite

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.160 
aggressive core it should actually bite
a<00:01:56.750> lot<00:01:56.990> harder<00:01:58.060> what's<00:01:59.060> going<00:01:59.570> on<00:01:59.690> there<00:01:59.960> is

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
a lot harder what's going on there is

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.980 
a lot harder what's going on there is
the<00:02:00.620> cover<00:02:00.920> stock<00:02:01.250> being<00:02:01.760> less<00:02:02.240> porous<00:02:02.570> and

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
the cover stock being less porous and

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.740 
the cover stock being less porous and
with<00:02:03.800> a<00:02:03.830> lot<00:02:04.010> less<00:02:04.040> friction<00:02:04.460> in<00:02:04.730> it<00:02:04.850> it's<00:02:05.390> just

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
with a lot less friction in it it's just

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.040 
with a lot less friction in it it's just
going<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:05.900> keep<00:02:06.110> sliding<00:02:07.420> that's<00:02:08.420> mainly

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
going to keep sliding that's mainly

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.580 
going to keep sliding that's mainly
because<00:02:09.200> of<00:02:09.770> as<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:10.850> ball<00:02:11.090> gets<00:02:11.240> older<00:02:11.600> the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
because of as the ball gets older the

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.310 
because of as the ball gets older the
poor<00:02:12.830> start<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.220> build<00:02:13.520> up<00:02:13.700> with<00:02:14.390> dirt<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:14.840> oil

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
poor start to build up with dirt and oil

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.180 
poor start to build up with dirt and oil
and<00:02:15.590> due<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.460> lack<00:02:16.580> of<00:02:17.120> maintenance<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:18.290> lot<00:02:18.890> of

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
and due to lack of maintenance a lot of

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.560 
and due to lack of maintenance a lot of
people<00:02:19.460> might<00:02:19.610> actually<00:02:19.730> see<00:02:20.150> this<00:02:20.300> reaction

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
people might actually see this reaction

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.650 
people might actually see this reaction
in<00:02:20.840> their<00:02:20.960> own<00:02:21.080> ball<00:02:21.880> which<00:02:22.880> would<00:02:23.120> probably<00:02:23.630> a

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
in their own ball which would probably a

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.170 
in their own ball which would probably a
good<00:02:23.870> indicator<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.560> you<00:02:25.070> know<00:02:25.190> upgrade<00:02:25.640> get<00:02:26.150> a

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
good indicator to you know upgrade get a

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.960 
good indicator to you know upgrade get a
new<00:02:26.360> ball<00:02:26.510> max<00:02:27.410> your<00:02:27.650> ball<00:02:27.800> has<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.040> orange

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
new ball max your ball has the orange

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.360 
new ball max your ball has the orange
grips<00:02:29.270> it<00:02:29.420> looks<00:02:29.600> like<00:02:29.780> yep<00:02:30.380> orange<00:02:31.100> grips

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
grips it looks like yep orange grips

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.510 
grips it looks like yep orange grips
what<00:02:32.090> we<00:02:32.240> have<00:02:32.450> here<00:02:32.780> we<00:02:33.200> have<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.500> actual<00:02:33.860> r2s

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
what we have here we have the actual r2s

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.640 
what we have here we have the actual r2s
cover<00:02:34.850> stock<00:02:35.210> which<00:02:35.810> will<00:02:35.960> be<00:02:36.080> coming<00:02:36.260> out<00:02:36.470> on

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
cover stock which will be coming out on

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.410 
cover stock which will be coming out on
the<00:02:36.770> rocket<00:02:37.220> but<00:02:37.640> we<00:02:37.760> have<00:02:37.910> an<00:02:38.090> entry-level

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
the rocket but we have an entry-level

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.110 
the rocket but we have an entry-level
core<00:02:38.990> which<00:02:39.500> is<00:02:39.530> a<00:02:39.710> lot<00:02:40.040> milder<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:40.730> we'll<00:02:40.910> see

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
core which is a lot milder and we'll see

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.960 
core which is a lot milder and we'll see
how<00:02:41.270> that<00:02:41.330> performs<00:02:41.870> against<00:02:42.320> the<00:02:42.410> rocket<00:02:42.970> as

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
how that performs against the rocket as

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.330 
how that performs against the rocket as
we<00:02:44.930> watch<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.350> ball<00:02:45.500> with<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.800> orange<00:02:46.100> grips

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
we watch the ball with the orange grips

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.030 
we watch the ball with the orange grips
it<00:02:46.670> rolls<00:02:46.880> a<00:02:47.030> lot<00:02:47.210> the<00:02:47.480> same<00:02:47.750> as<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.320> ball<00:02:48.830> with

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
it rolls a lot the same as the ball with

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.070 
it rolls a lot the same as the ball with
the<00:02:49.160> white<00:02:49.340> grips<00:02:49.910> but<00:02:50.270> it's<00:02:50.420> for<00:02:50.600> a<00:02:50.630> totally

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
the white grips but it's for a totally

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.900 
the white grips but it's for a totally
different<00:02:51.110> reason<00:02:51.500> what<00:02:52.130> we<00:02:52.250> have<00:02:52.430> on<00:02:52.670> that<00:02:52.850> is

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
different reason what we have on that is

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.880 
different reason what we have on that is
we<00:02:53.150> have<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.450> good<00:02:53.600> aggressive<00:02:53.930> cover<00:02:54.530> stock

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
we have the good aggressive cover stock

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.690 
we have the good aggressive cover stock
the<00:02:55.520> r2s<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.959> entry-level<00:02:57.410> quarry<00:02:58.130> in<00:02:58.459> there

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
the r2s the entry-level quarry in there

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.210 
the r2s the entry-level quarry in there
holds<00:02:59.120> that<00:02:59.270> ball<00:02:59.510> so<00:02:59.780> that<00:03:00.050> it's<00:03:00.320> more<00:03:00.560> stable

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
holds that ball so that it's more stable

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.729 
holds that ball so that it's more stable
and<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:01.970> don't<00:03:02.150> get<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.540> potential<00:03:03.080> that<00:03:03.590> the

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
and you don't get the potential that the

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.070 
and you don't get the potential that the
cover<00:03:03.920> stock<00:03:04.250> can<00:03:04.550> offer

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
an aggressive motion on the backend but
