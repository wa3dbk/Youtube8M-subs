00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.119
 to 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.320
 the plant 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.490
 and now all of a video today and bring them 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.320
 well we are back minecraft and of 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.060
 what are we going to talk about today today we are going to 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.450
 talk about the block is line or give them in 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.400
 blog a block quite like saying it 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.400
 quite peculiar of this new version 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.309
 the 1.8 and then quite interesting already 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.680
 that beyond that of the pistons and 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.120
 others has many uses and good that 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.790
 unblock is the m is a block like 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.190
 any block made with hours and that 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.640
 with items and their catch would be more or less 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.989
 something like that and good are new sling 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.440
 the down les line bloco a block is 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:53.310
 line and that has can and we walk a little 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.100
 slower about it has a little bit of 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.520
 slows us down a bit apart from that 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.660
 when we jump over him we bounce 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.960
 exactly I do not know very well the percentage 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.390
 of bounce but it 's roughly 30% of the 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.490
 jump of the one that grants us and well then 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.680
 we keep bouncing is very weird and the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.250
 slim balls in case they did not know insurance plan 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.860
 This little guy's name is line good 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.660
 we kill him if he gives us one and then there is 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.750
 large there are medium and small as 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.270
 that good anyway let's see the other 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.409
 things and well let's see one of his 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.429
 characteristics for example 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.429
 so look 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.930
 to this what is here there is ice 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.119
 down below you can appreciate this 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.820
 is is line of what is the in a block 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.759
 any normal and samson very well 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.530
 then as some will know the ice 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.810
 It has the characteristic of transporting 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.429
 items goes faster than the rest of the 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.890
 items when they come on the water 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.810
 and well he is line bloc does not move a bit 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.090
 slower than ice but faster 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.189
 with normal block so that the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.899
 normal block and well back it comes 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.549
 just the sanction since it has the 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.619
 property of moving it is much slower 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.110
 and well they will say that that matters 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.640
 practically no urban use is a 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.340
 characteristic that they added and that 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.560
 you may want to mention right now I do not know if 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.950
 it was garlic or they did not make it like that 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.840
 he saw it for a moment it was strange 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.579
 well and here we have a 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.030
 experiment to see what happened when 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:25.650
 threw sytems and good here what 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.410
 unique that has special feature 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.819
 it's the ice because in the block loft there 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.909
 bounce the items good 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:37.030
 nothing happens in this summons the ice 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:39.010
 they slip a bit as you can see and well 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.630
 Well, let's see something else 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.090
 Julian 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.090
 if we put an item on where is line 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.340
 block and down has a piston and the 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.570
 piston is activated the item goes flying to 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:57.070
 a very high place and how can you see that 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.480
 is one of its properties and so and if 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.120
 we press again when I go back to 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.620
 accept and so on repeatedly and it can be 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.540
 so it arrives quite high is another 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.490
 property I do not see much utility 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.430
 although on the one hand yes since we could 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.500
 take items like this up and then not 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.970
 I know with hopper catches them or something by 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.580
 good style over here we have something more 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.580
 let's take some pressure plates and 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.790
 before that we are going to see this very well 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.670
 this is a piston but this is not so 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.570
 sticky let them take a sticky piston 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.720
 and well what happens with this is something that 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.240
 loved it and look how can you move all 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.180
 the items of one with this piston has 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.640
 a maximum of 12 items and good here 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.250
 some rumors that I would like to deny 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.240
 for example I do not know if this is already official 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.150
 or it is not 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:54.510
 more recent and good for example many 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:58.049
 they say or they said that for example 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.909
 if you put here this is line block this 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.030
 yes, he will be able to move and here he puts 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:05.220
 this and this and well the truth is that 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.590
 this is false even without altering the 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.510
 order and put this here this is going to me 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.659
 move this but if division we are 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.519
 the en bloc is no longer going to move well 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.950
 he picked it up because this block was lifted 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.920
 but it does not return 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.799
 the same thing happens if we did something like 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.009
 this 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:28.099
 it's just going to move that in accordance 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:30.569
 so let's do something like that and then 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:34.349
 nobody notices it as you can see 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:35.669
 and then there is some way of not coming 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:37.649
 doing it with sticky piston but 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.209
 did more sides and then without having to have 

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:41.969
 its usefulness but at the moment it does not 

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:44.939
 a lot and well it 's more like that 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:46.529
 to have fun for a while the maximum 

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:51.839
 blocks that can load a slam blocks 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:56.580
 are 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 with this 

00:04:51.839 --> 00:05:00.749
 eleven some 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 and 11 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:03.089
 blocks forgiveness twelfth level or the 

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:07.559
 twelfth also moves receive we have 

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:10.409
 13 no longer moves it then we remove 1 what 

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:12.779
 we add here and we go down and the 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:15.119
 move back 12 blocks is your limit 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:17.249
 so to speak good and this too 

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:19.229
 would apply if for example I did this 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:23.129
 or an insurance that no matter what 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:29.449
 block be for example here they go 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:29.449
 man 357 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:37.580
 9 I know here 

00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:41.559
 more 10 11 12 this is going to be able to move or 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.559
 I hope so, I would expect 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.639
 until it happens to me as you can see what 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:50.009
 can move but if we add it 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:52.110
 any more block can no longer 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.969
 move if we remove this can not 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.860
 back to move very well those but that 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:58.889
 part that clear and to finish another 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.479
 priority another thing that has is that 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:02.939
 we can bounce on it by 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:05.250
 example below there is a piston and then 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:08.129
 good if we apply a plate of 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.319
 pressure on here would not fly away 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:12.180
 quite high and if we put another one and it goes 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:13.940
 multiplying the jump power by 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.580
 so to speak 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:21.639
 yes wait 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:24.050
 I hate this because suddenly like ok 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:26.710
 very good 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:31.090
 we lost it 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:33.490
 I hope to go back down because I know that 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.030
 this is quite possible 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.030
 okay 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:43.130
 there we go does not exist is that yesterday if I 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.420
 it came out good the joke is that we can 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.490
 get up here and more and more 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:50.150
 big taller and good let's go up to 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:53.870
 a pretty large height and let's see 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:57.470
 how much we bounce we are right now 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.970
 same in the layer I do not know how in the 200 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.610
 I'm going to go up until I stop seeing the 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:05.960
 ground 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:08.479
 and then we are lying bay 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.430
 I do not feel that they changed this 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:13.240
 environment because I remember that before would 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:16.039
 different and now I see it much better 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:20.210
 so we're going to drop a free fall 

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:22.900
 quite extensive and bain bounced not 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:26.080
 we bounce a lot but if we bounce 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:28.190
 Now yes that a part quite 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.220
 proportionate what I'm seeing is that 

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:33.319
 the original jump does not give you status 

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.449
 strips from 100 blocks and it's going to 

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:37.520
 bounce like 20 blocks the next 

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:40.699
 jump is going to be bouncing like 18 or 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.949
 15 that is, the most affected is the fall 

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:45.110
 and the next of the jumps is less 

00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:48.500
 affected and good so far in age 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:50.960
 let's all say the officers how is 

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:53.150
 this but good and when the 

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.380
 version there will be better things and then this 

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.820
 is what is known so far from 

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:58.430
 is in block I hope it has been useful 

00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:00.830
 and then this will be all for this video are 

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.569
 its uses and others until next time 

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.259
 goodbye 

00:08:01.569 --> 00:08:04.259
 let's see if it comes out 

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.190
 goodbye
