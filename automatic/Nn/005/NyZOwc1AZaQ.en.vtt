00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.690

 code that you have to put I leave it 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.740

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.750
 ended with the vowel or 16 so here 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.060

 information along with other videos that 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.940
 I've done talking about them this little box 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.470
 She carries beauty food stuff and 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.329
 from home and I'll start so I more 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.739
 I liked the first thing 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.840
 that caught my attention were these 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.510
 milka bars is a novelty that has 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.730
 followed now and it's super good they're like this 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.520
 It's like three little squares like that inside 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.020
 of each package and it's like waffle a 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.360
 little bit darker on top or by 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.190
 below and another one lighter and inside is 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.680
 a kind of chocolate mousse is 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.630
 very very good 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.890
 and if you like chocolate milk you are going to 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.460
 love because the truth is that it is 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.460
 delicious 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.700
 the next one that I loved were these 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.500
 You are barbies because they are bars 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.880
 satiating respÃ³ndase take so much if 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.370
 you are doing a diet of taking 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.320
 little calories or as a normal extra 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.790
 they're like a waffle on the outside they're 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.250
 covered with chocolate and inside 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.960
 they carry like yogurt a cream is one thing 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.910
 a bit strange I imagined it very 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.740
 well and it's very good indeed that 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.660
 I highly recommend that only 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.880
 It has 99 calories and I think they are 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.230
 very very rich you know that I normally 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.820
 what most illusion makes me of the 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.220
 enjoy box is when things come from 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.780
 chocolate or so but this time not 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.600
 what has made me more illusion 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.800
 been this this is bread mold ie 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.479
 you are silly 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.970
 they have treated me with the one they carry 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.790
 oatmeal and baked corn is like 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.250
 seeds on the outside from the brand or what 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.290
 uy oroweat I have no idea how to 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.119
 says this now I will put you an image 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.590
 that will look closer I did not know where 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.600
 had this suitcase come out because of 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.160
 I was suddenly seeing her a lot because of 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.560
 supermarkets and that and now I've seen that 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.450
 It's live and it's super good are frogs 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.390
 pretty big and making a sandwich 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.460
 very very cool the truth 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.080
 I'm sure I bought a bread of this type 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.759
 because they have different varieties that 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.670
 is this that I have taught you one that 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.530
 has 12 cereals one of seeds 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.209
 It looks very good what has most 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.620
 I liked this little box and I think that 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.290
 all that have come to me has been 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.590
 this looks like nail polish but it's a 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.650
 liquid blush with the liquid is from the 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.380
 efe brand says that it has long duration 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.870
 and it's true I wear it at 6 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.030
 when I leave home and when I return 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.430
 in the afternoon it still still lasts me 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.110
 It 's very good for when you have 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.670
 the photo session or if you go to a 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.959
 wedding or so because it adapts very well to 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.580
 the camera does not look anything artificial 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.680
 It seems like it's coming out of you 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.130
 It's a very strange thing, what I'm going 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.239
 but I do not know if you are going to appreciate 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.370
 because I have become quite subtle 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.470
 love the result that leaves this is the 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.150
 number one I do not know the other shades like 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.920
 they will be but I have to investigate and 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.470
 buy me more because the truth is that I 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.980
 he has loved 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:05.640
 I'm going to stop saying love that once 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.440
 in my life, they will not give us the fashion 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.210
 What I liked most this month are these 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.800
 booties I know that this is nothing 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.690
 Spring, but I really wanted it 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.270
 teach because I bought it in prime art 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.730
 last week or the previous one I do not know and 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.070
 it cost me only seven euros I put that 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.650
 they were 20 that were down to 7 and I 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.540
 they look beautiful 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.060
 I do not know what this is called the rim 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.349
 it's all from a golden zipper and it has 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.879
 the zipper on this side and the 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.159
 zipper by this one 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:34.439
 and is that I always always wear ankle boots 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.120
 during autumn and had a couple but already 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:38.220
 they were pretty pachuchos because they have 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.109
 quite time and the old 7 euros and 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.000
 is that they are beautiful I loved them 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.590
 I bought these and others that I will teach you in 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.510
 the hall that I have to do that too 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.340
 they were worked at seven euros and I 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.170
 It seems like a super bargain and it's also that 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.659
 I see them very many my favorite of 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.569
 beauty has been this shadow in cream is 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:56.190
 of astor with the perfect 24 hours this 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.260
 and it's from this range that has enough 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.959
 things inside of it as bases 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.260
 of makeup lipsticks shadows all this 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.670
 and that 's the way it has this way 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.709
 jumbo guy you have to take it out 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.750
 tip has a brown color he cited 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.409
 quite natural and I was given it 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.629
 this in Christmas in a pack that came 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:17.549
 this shadow and a nail polish a mascara if 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:21.389
 I'm not mistaken astor mascara no 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:23.009
 it can be a mascara and I 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.720
 love the truth I had super forgotten 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:27.389
 I was not, I was not getting 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.819
 but he has retaken it again and that 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.620
 it stays super fixed does not pull folds the 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:33.240
 color is quite intense also the 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.800
 you can use base for other 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.169
 shadows and it's going to intensify much more the 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.319
 color and I like a lot of series 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:42.569
 movie program and this whole section what 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:44.490
 what else am I seeing is masterchef had 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:46.979
 I really wanted you to start and I'm 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.800
 super flawed I love watching it seems 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.050
 a very program 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.849
 I like it, I suppose if you do not like the 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.530
 kitchen can make you nervous 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:55.970
 and you may like it a little but in 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.289
 the kitchen I like a lot calls me the 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.050
 attention and I'm always learning 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.819
 things watching that program besides that it 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.470
 makes very enjoyable with the tests they do 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.389
 and all my favorite at the moment I think that 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.099
 it's Carlos I think he's going to win Carlos or 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.750
 seriously by instagram that if I do not 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:10.759
 you follow I leave you all the social networks 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.080
 down here below and take the opportunity to tell you 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:13.729
 that has opened a facebook page 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.289
 that it was a social network that I did not have 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.419
 I show you a picture of some daisies 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:20.210
 and I told you that that was one of 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.830
 the favorites of the month of April is one of 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.870
 the favorites but I will not teach you 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.520
 because they are in a pretty bad state 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.020
 I do not know if I've thrown a lot 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.509
 water if they have burned I do not know what they 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.460
 it happens but they are as burnt 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:33.319
 we are trying to revive but I do not know if 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.639
 we 're going to get it because they have like 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:37.159
 a kind of saying that they are 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:38.900
 eating so in this video we went to 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:41.030
 the nurseries and we were in knits on 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.710
 the daisies we buy sunflowers and 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.569
 the next week or so it came to him and 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.310
 he brought me the materials and that's 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:48.169
 love my favorite flowers 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.090
 person is not very sencillita and I 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.190
 It is very happy spring and we 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.020
 on the boat and because we love it 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.760
 we open the blind and they are all 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.140
 exposed so flowers is a 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.270
 essential of spring and has 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.100
 liked a lot and the favorite moment 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.340
 of this month that was over at the end of 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.900
 end of the month and I stayed like 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.270
 Surprising was when the sale opens 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.370
 acb sandra named me in his video of 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.950

 bunch of time to two years I do not know if

 It takes so much on Youtube I do not know the truth 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:31.400
 a long time ago and nor that a 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.470
