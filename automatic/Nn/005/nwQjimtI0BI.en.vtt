00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 Hello everyone, we often wonder how many 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.629
 hours a dog can be alone at home 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.069
 or in the garden 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.559
 in fact there are many people who 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.300
 they would like a dog but they work all the 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.429
 day away from home 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.230
 so I'm out from morning to night and 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.840
 maybe they can't even get back in 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.600
 lunch break but they would still like a 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.670
 dog and wonder if the dogs in some 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.990
 so it may be affected by this lack 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.550
 companionship 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.220
 we know that dogs are animals 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.439
 social and love the company of their own 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.809
 family and we certainly can't say that 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.579
 like instead to solitude 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.390
 I found a satisfactory answer to 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.149
 this question in this book stress 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.700
 in the dog I do n't tell you the names of the authors 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.380
 because I ca n't read them in the case then ve 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.600
 I write them must be Norwegian 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.030
 and this book is very interesting because 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.620
 precisely analyzes the various factors that 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.610
 cause stress in the dog 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.440
 and there is also a sample study 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.180
 an investigation into which they are considered 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.410
 the individual factors we see how much 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.240
 affect stress in the dog has come 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.310
 out an interesting thing in 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.380
 particularly for two of these factors 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.380
 or rest and solitude 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.500
 regarding rest if the dog 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.500
 rests for 18 hours at levels of 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.780
 low stress while resting less than 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.250
 18 hours stress levels are over 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.020
 high 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.200
 as for solitude instead 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.020
 there is a particular thing if the dog goes 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.259
 alone for five consecutive hours of 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.470
 low stress levels 6 st alone 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.530
 less than five consecutive hours to gods 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.170
 higher stress levels and if it has been 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.080
 only for more than five consecutive hours a 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.040
 considerably more stress levels 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.960
 tall 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.780
 this obviously means that 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.030
 for the dog to be able to stay five hours a 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.979
 home alone quiet 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.700
 it can be a panacea in the sense that 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.890
 can rest can relax while if 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.110
 there is always someone at home or if there 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.750
 people come out of the house evidently 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.729
 can't relax enough 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.680
 hence higher stress levels 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.930
 then bring the dog to the place of 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.590
 work may not always be a 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.750
 benefit 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.120
 depends on whether the dog to the possibility of 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.209
 to rest or not because if it is found 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.680
 behind the counter of a shop i 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.930
 customers continue to come and go 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.270
 maybe he can't rest at 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.040
 sufficiency we have seen that instead 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.280
 leave the dog for more than five hours 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.450
 consecutive trolley causes high 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.910
 stress levels 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.560
 so this is absolutely to be avoided e 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.510
 to answer the first question not 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.180
 you can leave a dog so many hours 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.490
 alone 8 10 hours at home alone 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.510
 summarizing if we want all the 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.150
 costs a dog 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.430
 and the kind of work we do is not there 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.670
 allows you to dedicate enough time to it 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.610
 and the company he would really have 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.819
 need we ask for support and help 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.540
 relatives friends and professionals like dog 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.569
 Child 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.569
 so just get organized to the next one
