00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:12.900
 5 to lead lead lead 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:43.149
 Passengers who use the Aurian aircraft will receive more than 40 million years 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:48.519
 So many people are safely in Yiwu available aircraft 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:49.930
 Thanks to an aircraft mechanic who is responsible for the safety of the aircraft 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:54.690
 It is. 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.690
 Let's listen to the son through the main character 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.980
 If you are buying a fate, if you are in an uprising, 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:07.230
 For hangar 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:12.170
 It is not one or two places where you can touch the size of an aircraft, 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.170
 You have to go through this person's hand to know. 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.970
 Hello Korea here relative 1.5 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:30.340
 Because of the aircraft crash that calls for tragic consequences of small defects 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:35.140
 Perfect maintenance and maintenance of a mechanic with a flashing main tone is important. 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:39.490
 How is the complicated structure of the aircraft organized? 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:44.710
 In Japan, Kim Hyun-jae was a safety equipment team and a basic information team. 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:49.510
 The full billing usually checks the pilot for any anomalies during flight, 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:51.580
 Through the fmc , a device that informs the regime and the control room of the overall condition of the airplane 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.600
 I will make a final check. 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:58.660
 And the basic maintenance team I work with is planning 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:03.880
 I am doing maintenance and courtship. 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:07.530
 Aircraft maintenance is largely classified into three types: 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.530
 Ding It's the simplest course. 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.670
 In the case of process equipment proceeds from the auction it is twisted when repair parts modification view 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:20.099
 To cancer 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:23.370
 Finally, electricity is the most complex maintenance process, and parts are all disassembled again 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:27.600
 It goes through the assembly process. 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:33.840
 The mechanic is in charge of day-to-day maintenance. 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:38.370
 Gender revolution is impossible'd never alone gave something going on in the hangar pato 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:41.819
 How about I come up and give 50 people from 40 people to what turns an average Bo anecdotes 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.390
 I'm working on the airline. 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:49.170
 Complex maintenance will not be over in a short period of time. 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:53.130
 Therefore , one more day of maintenance aircraft 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:57.540
 So what is the most important thing in aircraft maintenance? 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.410
 And the aircraft will be maintained in accordance with the awesome arc and manual checks in accordance with the cycle 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.500
 Because of 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:06.090
 You can see that there is hardly any corrections 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.880
 Because air maintenance is concerned with safety, 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:15.030
 Making the album regular is the most important thing 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:16.859
 More aircraft maintenance lasts for a long time, so this is sick and the electricity is 24 hours 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.930
 Never ending 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:26.700
 So what happens to the flight mechanic's working hours? 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:30.390
 Research atheism less 12 hours two working Tuesday when Mr seen anything like 12 hours 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:34.769
 I'd like to introduce 3 trillion 2 shifts to gain strength 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:37.859
 The aircraft will be accommodated during the flight , 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:42.750
 We are operating electricity. 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:47.940
 This 24-hour maintenance is a clan, so you can not fly right away. 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:53.280
 Must be signed by an airline mechanic in the aircraft maintenance log . 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:58.620
 What is the reason that the aircraft is safe to fly with no more than 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:03.569
 I can do it. I can do it. 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:05.720
 So I have to be signed to Inoue Korea, but I can do this function 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:10.700
 There is 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:14.540
 It would be hard to get by the responsibility of safety and passenger safety at the same time. 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:19.669
 What if there are difficulties in your work? 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:21.200
 Busan Jeongseo is suitable for outdoor work such as hangar runway , 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:26.540
 Steam and heat 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:32.040
 When I work in cold weather in winter and when my rhythm is unstable as long as shift work 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:36.000
 But there is no disruption to your work through steady fitness management 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:41.889
 Aircraft mechanic who is united in infinite responsibility 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:46.539
 What process does it take to become an aircraft mechanic like a hero? 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:48.969
 To be a great little secretary or a related third public listed industrial and electronics 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:53.499
 After graduation , I work in airline 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:57.520
 2 years of preparatory training for spiritual education in some cases 

00:04:53.499 --> 00:05:01.930
 In some cases, after completion of the course, 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:05.110
 South Korea is the case of many products, excluding air even if imported from abroad is coming 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:10.479
 It is also somewhat 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:15.069
 I do not need to speak English. 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:17.500
 In addition, as new production techniques are constantly coming out , 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:21.310
 A must- have charge 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:25.449
 What other materials do you need? 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:29.949
 It's a state-of-the-art road with an aircraft and millions of components. 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:34.500
 I think it would be better for someone who has a meticulous personality to itch 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:39.610
 Above all , it is a strong warrior who must put the safety of many martyrdoms first 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:41.560
 I have cooperation with dozens of electric wires because it is a cooperative business . 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:46.599
 I'm gonna be the same 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:52.360
 Add the aircraft to operate s growth as well as to low-cost air carriers for representatives 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:58.149
 Because of that situation, should the introduction of aircraft maintenance in the future be even more 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:06:02.379
 And then the passionate aircraft mechanic will avoid that much . 

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:07.599
 Boom network can see a very bright continuous increase in demand for travel and Hay 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:11.770
 I think the future of aircraft maintenance is very bright due to the increase of international exchanges. 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:16.210
 As the level of national income increases, many travel arrangements and business 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:19.449
 Because there are more aircraft and airlines in line with it, 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:24.300
 I think you need a lot of points. 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:28.440
 Finally, I would like to ask the next-generation aircraft mechanic. 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:33.360
 Yes, I have great pride in my job as an airline mechanic . 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:35.340
 Airline maintenance Airline workers are those who are engaged in this field 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:40.349
 If you have a lot of advice 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:43.789
 Preparing for preservation, such as studying in Korea and studying English , 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:43.789
 I hope we achieve a good result.
