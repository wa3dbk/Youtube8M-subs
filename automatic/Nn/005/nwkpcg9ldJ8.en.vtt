00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 Hi, I'm back because I love you 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.940
 show the books that I have read from the 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:14.009
 last rap are not books but books 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:18.090
 but good first thing I read in May 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.460
 it was a volatile journal this precious 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.910
 book that obviously gave 5 in 5 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:29.150
 stars the truth is that it is super 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:34.340
 great the mind of this designer is 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:38.430
 my literal brain flies 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:41.670
 I met this author because I do not know 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.120
 I think it's worth retweet me some image 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.880
 some I do not know something the author wrote 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.180
 so I'm super curious and I got 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.809
 and I started to investigate and it turns out that it's 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.340
 he's also a super fan of her and he's 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.950
 Like I said oh for god 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.210
 what's the deal then I saw it in the bookshop and 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:07.900
 do not hesitate and buy it 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.520
 I read it super fast and from time to time 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.090
 when I read it again because it's 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.550
 terrific great you give me the super 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.190
 well the time you are reading it 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:23.530
 then I read a manga I was going to cumaná 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:26.070
 Bakuman Bacum to one does not know the truth 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.509
 I thought a lot to read some of this 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.330
 the truth I thought a lot to read it 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.490
 because they are a jet, but I said 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.009
 x then I started reading and the truth is 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.929
 that is amazing I like it because they are 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:42.100
 two little guys that like they want 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:44.560
 draw manga then one has to in 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.750
 his past not in his past forgive me a 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.929
 family that did that then have 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.470
 as the experience or let's say that the 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:55.869
 ease of being able to achieve your dream and 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.450
 He also has a little love not 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.789
 then it 's also father I had fun 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.190
 I really liked it a lot but 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.979
 I honestly do not know if I continue I do not know 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.850
 finally I read the guard dog of the 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.429
 stars 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.230

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.120
 my best friend was super excited 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.049
 had seen his face shone the 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.989
 eyes as to the obvious then I said 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:24.189
 I want to be a part of that then what 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:26.819

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:32.549

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:35.040

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.799

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.030
 Oh God, the truth and now it's getting 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:43.079
 Now the skin is very pretty 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.019

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.540

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.569

 they recommended canyon, that is, they came to me 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.209
 tweets 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:20.640
 and the writer got in touch 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:24.050
 with me and totally I already read his work the case 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.300
 the story is very beautiful 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:31.400
 but I feel like I would have enjoyed it 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:33.500
 more if he was 13 years old or if he had 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.740
 read before the way he is 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.479
 written is very blue jeans style is not 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.960
 focuses only on a character 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:44.300
 focuses on everyone and they go to you like you 're going 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.740
 feeling what each character feels 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.810
 I gave this book three out of five stars 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.300
 because I liked it and if obviously I 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.490
