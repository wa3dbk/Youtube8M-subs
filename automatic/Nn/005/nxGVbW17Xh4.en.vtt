mouse across the screen the mouse it

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.570 
mouse across the screen the mouse it
speeds<00:03:12.180> up<00:03:12.360> gradually

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
speeds up gradually

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.830

the speed at which you're moving your
mouth<00:03:14.990> isn't<00:03:15.320> constant<00:03:16.010> which<00:03:16.160> makes<00:03:16.340> it

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
mouth isn't constant which makes it

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.880 
mouth isn't constant which makes it
quite<00:03:16.550> hard<00:03:16.850> to<00:03:16.940> learn<00:03:17.330> and<00:03:17.660> really<00:03:18.200> get<00:03:18.740> to

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890
