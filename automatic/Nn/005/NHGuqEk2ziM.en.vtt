00:00:06.502 --> 00:00:08.287
 There is a scientific theory 

00:00:08.837 --> 00:00:11.472
 for paranormal appearances according to which they are the product of the human imagination. 

00:00:12.898 --> 00:00:15.500
 And ghosts exist only because we believe in them. 

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:23.550
 Several researchers have tried to prove this theory and create a supernatural activity with their thoughts. 

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:29.807
 "We can prove that! All that is supernatural can exist when people believe it! " 

00:00:34.983 --> 00:00:36.250
 EXPERIENCE ... 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.816
 ... WAS SUCCESS! 

00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:43.208
 "What was these noises ?! What was that !!? What is this mess ! " 

00:00:49.796 --> 00:00:51.196
 " What happened to him ? " 

00:00:52.835 --> 00:00:54.217
 "We opened the door and the evil came back! " 

00:00:55.954 --> 00:00:56.952
 "What does this mean for us? " 

00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:01.933
 "It's like a virus" 

00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:04.411
 "He's determined to scare us" 

00:01:06.757 --> 00:01:09.639
 "He has enough wingspan to invade a person" 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.035
 "He wants to declare war on us ... 

00:01:21.892 --> 00:01:22.940
 he wants us! " 

00:01:30.877 --> 00:01:33.709
 "Get out of my house !! " 

00:01:36.408 --> 00:01:37.657
 "When you believe it, and it's real ... 

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:40.550
 ...YOU DIE ! " 

00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:14.300
 "I do not believe it ... It's not real, it's not real, it's not real ..." 

00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:25.270
 Once you believe in it, YOU DIE.
