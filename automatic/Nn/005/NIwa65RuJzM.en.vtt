00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
your line look at your line you're gonna

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.100 
your line look at your line you're gonna
find<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:45.069> quarter<00:02:45.370> runs<00:02:45.790> right<00:02:46.180> through<00:02:46.209> there

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
find a quarter runs right through there

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.850 
find a quarter runs right through there
you<00:02:47.349> see<00:02:47.470> that<00:02:49.620> right<00:02:50.620> there

you see that right there
okay<00:02:51.220> now<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:52.030> quartz<00:02:52.330> aims<00:02:52.599> right<00:02:52.989> down<00:02:53.980> to

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
okay now the quartz aims right down to

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.440 
okay now the quartz aims right down to
there<00:02:54.959> well<00:02:56.190> there<00:02:57.190> you<00:02:57.340> are<00:02:57.520> there's<00:02:58.180> your

there well there you are there's your

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.290 
there well there you are there's your
stand<00:02:59.069> your<00:03:00.069> water<00:03:01.260> flows<00:03:02.260> up<00:03:03.010> here<00:03:03.580> twenty

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
stand your water flows up here twenty

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.910 
stand your water flows up here twenty
thirty<00:03:04.630> feet<00:03:04.930> on<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.350> high<00:03:06.030> throws<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.390> gold

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
thirty feet on the high throws the gold

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.600 
thirty feet on the high throws the gold
which<00:03:08.920> is<00:03:08.950> coming<00:03:09.430> down<00:03:11.070> along<00:03:12.070> this<00:03:12.280> line<00:03:12.580> and

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
which is coming down along this line and

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.000 
which is coming down along this line and
this<00:03:12.970> line<00:03:13.030> sweeps<00:03:13.840> around<00:03:14.110> so<00:03:14.590> what<00:03:14.740> you<00:03:14.830> see

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
this line sweeps around so what you see

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.360 
this line sweeps around so what you see
is<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:15.340> sweeping<00:03:15.880> line<00:03:16.090> around<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.840> corner

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
is the sweeping line around the corner

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.590 
is the sweeping line around the corner
and<00:03:18.990> go<00:03:19.990> back<00:03:20.170> up<00:03:20.200> here<00:03:21.000> you'll<00:03:22.000> see<00:03:22.210> where<00:03:22.450> it

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
and go back up here you'll see where it

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.450 
and go back up here you'll see where it
hits<00:03:22.780> Steve's<00:03:23.110> from<00:03:23.290> granite<00:03:23.650> boulders<00:03:24.070> well

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
hits Steve's from granite boulders well

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.780 
hits Steve's from granite boulders well
it<00:03:24.580> throws<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:25.120> gold<00:03:25.500> down<00:03:26.500> right<00:03:27.010> there<00:03:27.280> into

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
it throws the gold down right there into

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.000 
it throws the gold down right there into
those<00:03:27.970> little<00:03:28.120> holes<00:03:28.390> you<00:03:29.380> can<00:03:29.500> even<00:03:29.740> see<00:03:29.860> the

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
those little holes you can even see the

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.320 
those little holes you can even see the
fish<00:03:30.160> in<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.460> little<00:03:30.670> holes<00:03:30.790> if<00:03:31.000> you<00:03:31.120> look

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
fish in the little holes if you look

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.580 
fish in the little holes if you look
real<00:03:31.570> hard<00:03:32.550> so<00:03:33.550> there<00:03:33.760> you<00:03:33.910> go<00:03:34.410> see<00:03:35.410> that

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
real hard so there you go see that

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.560 
real hard so there you go see that
granite<00:03:36.100> piece<00:03:36.280> right<00:03:36.490> there<00:03:36.550> and<00:03:37.000> then<00:03:37.390> you

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
granite piece right there and then you

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.320 
granite piece right there and then you
see<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:37.870> quartz<00:03:38.230> that<00:03:38.470> blob<00:03:39.400> right<00:03:39.760> in<00:03:40.060> front

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
see the quartz that blob right in front

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.250 
see the quartz that blob right in front
of<00:03:40.450> you<00:03:40.600> down<00:03:40.810> there

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
of you down there

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.530 
of you down there
you'll<00:03:41.890> see<00:03:42.070> that<00:03:42.250> if<00:03:42.460> you<00:03:42.760> go<00:03:42.880> straight<00:03:43.240> down

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
you'll see that if you go straight down

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
difference in the granite rocks well

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.110 
difference in the granite rocks well
right<00:03:48.160> there<00:03:48.370> that<00:03:48.610> blob<00:03:48.820> in<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.090> middle

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120
