00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.930
 using the sight the smell the ear 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.330
 they use everything but what we presume 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.609
 the one who uses smell that's why they locate 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.289
 people that even with hundreds of people with 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.179
 our maximum effort we could 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.859
 locate detect the particles of 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.140
 smell in the air then they are able to 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.790
 detect people who are under 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.200
 debris that we could not locate with 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.520
 the view never unless we were 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.379
 hundreds of people lifting stones 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.969
 a column we need 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.020
 Essentially that the dog when 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.020
 find a person bark 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.730
 ok many times in large areas the 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.320
 dog is out of our sight 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.360
 so we need to know when the 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.830
 dog finds someone where he is and 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.270
 be able to go as quickly as possible 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.700
 when there is a person is hidden every 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.050
 minute is very important the dust and 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.370
 all these things always affect the 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.930
 dogs we work it from 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.440
 puppies we get used to all 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.530
 factors dust to noise to 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.660
 difficult floors to the smoke to the fire 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.400
 absolutely everything to the screams of the 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.990
 people have to be used to 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.390
 everyone does not mean that it does not affect them 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.440
 they are minimally affected not by dogs 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.450
 they have to always keep a 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.460
 distance with the victim can not touch 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.760
 at the time of training we look for 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.920
 vary as much as possible to reach 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.510
 train in the most recondite places 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.770
 more rare for the dog so that nothing 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.670
 then it may surprise you in a 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.680
 real situation 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.259
 first we show them the toy and the 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.270
 dog knows what a person is looking for 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.009
 thinking about his toy in his head 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.780
 you are looking for a person but you know that you are going to 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.610
 get your player we have 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.979
 to work the dogs always and with 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.450
 very different people since children 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.210
 elderly people of different races 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.590
 with very varied clothes they have to 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.060
 know how to discriminate knowing they are 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.369
 looking for a person who is worth any 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.929
 staff we started to work 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.360
 the dogs from puppies to them 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.310
 how this job is a game for them 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.990
 they do not think they are rescuing 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.610
 people and saving lives for them 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.440
 they are playing hide and seek 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.540
 dog has what he looks for in his 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.860
 toy knows that his toy has a 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.290
 person and that person has left and it has 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.390
 hidden everything you have to look for 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.670
 later he will not see toy then he goes to 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.349
 see many more people hidden and 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.299
 they really will not have hidden 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.330
 but for the dog that is his idea 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.860
 from since we were little, so yes 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.769
 commenting on going working places 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.480
 different sites distances much more 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.099
 long we work in fields of many 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.989
 kilometers each training can 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.519
 taking between one and two years would depend 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.440
 we always reward the dog 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.380
 when he finds someone at the beginning 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.630
 then it is not essential it depends on 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.400
 every dog and we try not to work 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.590
 every day never if we always 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.060
 we have an exit protocol for 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.250
 all the dogs that they know when 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.420
 they go to look sometimes we condition them 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.340
 simply to put the 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.170
 we give them a command there are sites 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.700
 where we can not work with harness 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.870
 debris sites where you can 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.870
 hook the harness and others 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.880
