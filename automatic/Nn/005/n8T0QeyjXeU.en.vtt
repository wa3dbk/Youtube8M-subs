Mia<00:00:18.660> material<00:00:21.560> X<00:00:22.560> passes<00:00:23.600> then<00:00:24.600> let's<00:00:25.170> graph

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
Mia material X passes then let's graph

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.650 
Mia material X passes then let's graph
this<00:00:26.660> all<00:00:27.660> right<00:00:28.340> now<00:00:29.340> select<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.119> lens<00:00:30.330> and

this just to be sure I think I have

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.020 
this just to be sure I think I have
transparency<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.860> my<00:01:23.369> chrome<00:01:24.090> ah<00:01:25.549> yeah<00:01:26.549> yeah<00:01:26.580> I

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
transparency on my chrome ah yeah yeah I

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.840 
transparency on my chrome ah yeah yeah I
remember<00:01:27.390> now<00:01:27.659> when<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.829> create<00:01:29.100> chrome<00:01:29.640> and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
remember now when you create chrome and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.030 
remember now when you create chrome and
you<00:01:30.329> mix<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.720> with<00:01:30.869> copper<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.619> creates

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
you mix it with copper it creates

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.700 
you mix it with copper it creates
transparency<00:01:33.000> for<00:01:33.240> some<00:01:33.420> weird<00:01:33.570> reason<00:01:33.710> so

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
transparency for some weird reason so

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.330 
transparency for some weird reason so
make<00:01:34.950> sure<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.369> color<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.880> black

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
make sure the color is black

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.109 
make sure the color is black
transparency<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:39.150> one<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.549> I'll<00:01:41.549> take<00:01:41.820> away

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
transparency is one and I'll take away

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.149 
transparency is one and I'll take away
the<00:01:42.530> transparency<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.159> if<00:01:44.490> i<00:01:44.640> render<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.210> I

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
the transparency so if i render this I

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.060 
the transparency so if i render this I
know<00:01:47.159> bring<00:01:47.549> transparency<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.299> 0<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
know bring transparency to 0 and the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.380 
know bring transparency to 0 and the
color<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:51.229> one<00:01:52.490> there<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.790> will<00:01:53.939> take<00:01:54.149> away

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
color to one there that will take away

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.999 
color to one there that will take away
transparency<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.170> bring<00:01:55.380> back<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.710> Chrome

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
transparency and bring back to Chrome

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.340 
transparency and bring back to Chrome
all<00:01:56.729> right<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.299> anyway<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.689> let's<00:01:57.960> graph<00:01:58.229> this

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
all right so anyway so let's graph this

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.889 
all right so anyway so let's graph this
network<00:01:58.920> because<00:01:59.790> that<00:02:00.390> we're<00:02:00.600> going<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.780> be

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
network because that we're going to be

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.530 
network because that we're going to be
working<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.590> be<00:02:02.840> hi<00:02:03.840> there<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.610> let's<00:02:06.270> assign

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
working on be hi there so let's assign

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.350 
working on be hi there so let's assign
this<00:02:06.810> assign<00:02:07.380> material<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:08.009> selection<00:02:08.360> select

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
this assign material to selection select

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.950 
this assign material to selection select
this<00:02:09.509> material<00:02:10.280> now<00:02:11.280> let's<00:02:11.459> go<00:02:11.640> with<00:02:11.819> presets

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
this material now let's go with presets

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.910 
this material now let's go with presets
and<00:02:13.080> let's<00:02:13.560> do<00:02:13.800> thin<00:02:14.640> glass<00:02:15.360> then<00:02:16.100> replace<00:02:17.100> and

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
and let's do thin glass then replace and

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.400 
and let's do thin glass then replace and
let's<00:02:19.920> render<00:02:20.130> that<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.610> see<00:02:20.790> what<00:02:20.820> it<00:02:21.180> does

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:31.900 

render

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.920 

okay<00:02:32.780> so<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:33.200> makes<00:02:33.380> it<00:02:33.530> blue<00:02:33.860> bluish<00:02:34.670> I'm<00:02:35.510> not

okay so it makes it blue bluish I'm not
a<00:02:35.990> big<00:02:36.230> fan<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.620> that<00:02:37.420> bluish<00:02:38.420> feel<00:02:39.050> I<00:02:40.390> wanted

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
a big fan of that bluish feel I wanted

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.440 
a big fan of that bluish feel I wanted
to<00:02:41.570> be<00:02:42.640> fairly<00:02:43.640> transparent<00:02:45.520> yeah<00:02:46.520> so<00:02:47.090> let's

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
to be fairly transparent yeah so let's

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.540 
to be fairly transparent yeah so let's
select<00:02:47.660> this<00:02:48.020> and<00:02:48.380> as<00:02:48.740> you<00:02:48.860> can<00:02:49.040> see<00:02:49.070> here<00:02:49.460> in

select this and as you can see here in

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.690 
select this and as you can see here in
color<00:02:49.820> we<00:02:50.690> have<00:02:50.840> a<00:02:50.870> bit<00:02:51.200> of<00:02:51.230> blue<00:02:51.740> pumped<00:02:52.610> in

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
color we have a bit of blue pumped in

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.910 
color we have a bit of blue pumped in
there<00:02:52.780> let's<00:02:53.780> just<00:02:53.840> take<00:02:54.170> that<00:02:54.320> away<00:02:54.500> don't

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
there let's just take that away don't

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.680 
take it away all the way we can leave
like<00:02:56.690> point<00:02:56.990> zero<00:02:57.560> one<00:02:57.650> in<00:02:58.130> there<00:02:58.700> just<00:02:59.540> to

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
like point zero one in there just to

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.310 
like point zero one in there just to
give<00:02:59.870> it<00:02:59.900> a<00:03:00.080> tint<00:03:01.480> yeah<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.720> then<00:03:03.050> we<00:03:03.170> can

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
give it a tint yeah and then we can

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:12.070 
give it a tint yeah and then we can
enter<00:03:03.860> that

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.670 

there<00:03:12.740> you<00:03:13.010> go

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.729 

alright<00:03:19.579> let's<00:03:20.450> totally<00:03:20.840> eyelids<00:03:21.319> in<00:03:21.530> there

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
alright let's totally eyelids in there

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.500 
alright let's totally eyelids in there
and<00:03:21.950> see<00:03:22.159> how<00:03:22.340> that<00:03:22.400> reacts<00:03:22.909> to<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.239> chrome

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
and see how that reacts to the chrome

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.869 
and see how that reacts to the chrome
inside<00:03:24.019> and<00:03:24.319> let's<00:03:25.099> see<00:03:25.280> how<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:25.519> glass

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
inside and let's see how the glass

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.559 
inside and let's see how the glass
reacts<00:03:26.269> with<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.569> eyelids<00:03:27.079> so<00:03:28.329> let's<00:03:29.329> shave

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
reacts with the eyelids so let's shave

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.940 
reacts with the eyelids so let's shave
the<00:03:29.719> eyelids<00:03:31.780> this<00:03:32.780> is<00:03:32.959> where<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.469> outliner

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
the eyelids this is where the outliner

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.069 
the eyelids this is where the outliner
comes<00:03:34.340> in<00:03:34.579> handy<00:03:34.849> if<00:03:35.180> we<00:03:35.599> bring<00:03:35.780> up<00:03:35.930> our

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
comes in handy if we bring up our

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.959 
comes in handy if we bring up our
outliner<00:03:36.519> we<00:03:37.519> can<00:03:37.730> simply<00:03:38.150> select<00:03:38.389> those

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:39.969 
outliner we can simply select those

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:43.119 
outliner we can simply select those
those<00:03:40.969> eyelids<00:03:41.359> here<00:03:41.870> lower<00:03:42.230> lid<00:03:42.560> and<00:03:42.829> upper

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
those eyelids here lower lid and upper

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.160 
those eyelids here lower lid and upper
lid<00:03:43.340> then<00:03:43.730> let's<00:03:44.120> just<00:03:44.239> assign<00:03:44.780> those

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
lid then let's just assign those

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.250 
lid then let's just assign those
materials<00:03:45.500> and<00:03:46.060> let's<00:03:47.060> hit<00:03:47.209> render<00:03:47.420> see<00:03:48.139> what

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
materials and let's hit render see what

00:03:48.260 --> 00:04:05.399 
materials and let's hit render see what
happens

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:10.509 

Tata<00:04:06.640> dr.<00:04:07.640> tom<00:04:08.950> this<00:04:09.950> looks<00:04:10.159> like<00:04:10.280> it's

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
Tata dr. tom this looks like it's

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.839 
Tata dr. tom this looks like it's
popping<00:04:10.730> out<00:04:11.120> too<00:04:11.299> much<00:04:11.510> here<00:04:12.040> so<00:04:13.040> there<00:04:13.519> as

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
popping out too much here so there as

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.170 
popping out too much here so there as
you<00:04:14.629> guys<00:04:14.840> can<00:04:15.110> see<00:04:15.170> it<00:04:15.860> is<00:04:16.070> reflecting<00:04:16.759> inside

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
you guys can see it is reflecting inside

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.080 
you guys can see it is reflecting inside
now<00:04:17.570> if<00:04:17.750> you<00:04:17.870> watch<00:04:18.079> the<00:04:18.440> film<00:04:18.949> that<00:04:19.759> does<00:04:19.970> not

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
now if you watch the film that does not

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.260 
now if you watch the film that does not
happen<00:04:20.299> in<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:21.139> film<00:04:21.460> it<00:04:22.460> does<00:04:22.639> not<00:04:22.789> do<00:04:23.000> this

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
happen in the film it does not do this

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.680 
happen in the film it does not do this
so<00:04:23.810> we<00:04:24.229> will<00:04:24.380> have<00:04:24.440> to<00:04:24.590> fix<00:04:24.889> that<00:04:25.180> so<00:04:26.180> inside

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
so we will have to fix that so inside

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.850 
so we will have to fix that so inside
our<00:04:26.870> chrome<00:04:27.729> inside<00:04:28.729> our<00:04:28.910> eyepiece<00:04:29.650> we<00:04:30.650> will

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
our chrome inside our eyepiece we will

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.999 
our chrome inside our eyepiece we will
have<00:04:31.100> to<00:04:32.620> wait<00:04:33.620> let's<00:04:34.039> hide<00:04:34.850> this<00:04:35.710> command<00:04:36.710> H

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
see here we can select this then grow

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:11.850 
see here we can select this then grow
that<00:04:54.110> selection

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.089 

you<00:05:12.370> know<00:05:12.430> it's<00:05:12.789> isolate<00:05:13.270> this<00:05:13.680> and<00:05:14.680> I<00:05:14.710> will

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
you know it's isolate this and I will

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:24.330 
you know it's isolate this and I will
take<00:05:15.310> from<00:05:15.580> here<00:05:20.159> all<00:05:21.159> right<00:05:22.650> so<00:05:23.650> we<00:05:24.189> select

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
Lambert we can just bring down right

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.679 
Lambert we can just bring down right
about<00:05:37.930> here<00:05:38.729> yeah<00:05:39.729> because<00:05:40.000> we<00:05:40.270> don't<00:05:40.449> want<00:05:40.599> it

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:40.689 
about here yeah because we don't want it

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:44.339 
about here yeah because we don't want it
to<00:05:40.840> reflect<00:05:41.229> inside<00:05:41.650> and<00:05:42.419> yeah<00:05:43.419> that's<00:05:43.689> that's

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349 
to reflect inside and yeah that's that's

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:49.050 
to reflect inside and yeah that's that's
a<00:05:44.560> cheat<00:05:44.830> that's<00:05:45.159> a<00:05:45.279> nice<00:05:45.490> cheap<00:05:45.909> trick<00:05:46.270> to<00:05:48.060> to

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
a cheat that's a nice cheap trick to to

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.059 
a cheat that's a nice cheap trick to to
make<00:05:49.449> it<00:05:49.569> work<00:05:49.750> and<00:05:49.930> now<00:05:50.590> we<00:05:50.650> have<00:05:50.770> to<00:05:50.949> bring

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:51.069 
make it work and now we have to bring

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:54.659 
make it work and now we have to bring
back<00:05:51.279> our<00:05:51.460> lens<00:05:51.729> so<00:05:52.270> do<00:05:52.689> shift<00:05:53.469> h<00:05:53.800> and<00:05:54.279> the<00:05:54.490> lens

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
back our lens so do shift h and the lens

00:05:54.669 --> 00:06:06.140 
back our lens so do shift h and the lens
will<00:05:54.879> come<00:05:55.210> back<00:05:55.650> then<00:05:56.650> render<00:05:57.159> this<00:05:57.340> out

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.390 

there<00:06:06.900> you<00:06:07.050> go<00:06:08.330> now<00:06:09.330> for<00:06:09.720> the<00:06:09.840> warping<00:06:10.440> if<00:06:11.280> you

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
there you go now for the warping if you

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.510 
there you go now for the warping if you
guys<00:06:11.580> want<00:06:12.000> it<00:06:12.150> to<00:06:12.360> warp<00:06:12.660> so<00:06:13.530> we<00:06:13.710> see<00:06:14.070> most<00:06:14.280> of

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
guys want it to warp so we see most of

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.650 
guys want it to warp so we see most of
the<00:06:14.670> I<00:06:15.830> we<00:06:16.830> can<00:06:17.010> select<00:06:17.250> this<00:06:17.670> then<00:06:18.180> let's<00:06:18.420> go

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
the I we can select this then let's go

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.010 
the I we can select this then let's go
to<00:06:18.720> the<00:06:19.440> mia<00:06:19.620> material<00:06:20.160> presets<00:06:20.660> let's<00:06:21.660> try<00:06:21.900> to

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
to the mia material presets let's try to

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.040 
to the mia material presets let's try to
pick<00:06:22.260> glass<00:06:22.560> and<00:06:22.860> see<00:06:23.010> what<00:06:23.160> that<00:06:23.340> does<00:06:23.400> and

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
pick glass and see what that does and

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:33.290 
pick glass and see what that does and
that's<00:06:25.050> render<00:06:31.490> now<00:06:32.490> as<00:06:32.730> you<00:06:32.850> guys<00:06:33.030> can<00:06:33.240> see

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
that's render now as you guys can see

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.920 
that's render now as you guys can see
it's<00:06:33.660> warping<00:06:34.110> and<00:06:34.290> it<00:06:35.130> now<00:06:35.430> fits<00:06:35.900> the<00:06:36.900> whole

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
it's warping and it now fits the whole

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.000 
it's warping and it now fits the whole
thing<00:06:38.450> zooming<00:06:39.450> into<00:06:39.600> the<00:06:39.900> eye<00:06:39.930> and<00:06:40.320> that's

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.010 
thing zooming into the eye and that's
