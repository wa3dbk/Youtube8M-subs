we'll skip to at the end we'll skip to a

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.310 
we'll skip to at the end we'll skip to a
different<00:00:25.560> head<00:00:25.800> made<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.310> same<00:00:26.519> way<00:00:26.730> now<00:00:27.449> for

different head made the same way now for
starters<00:00:28.560> here<00:00:28.949> we<00:00:29.130> trimmed<00:00:29.460> off<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.849> excess

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
starters here we trimmed off the excess

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.999 
starters here we trimmed off the excess
silicone<00:00:30.480> around<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.289> base<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.830> neck

silicone around the base of the neck

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.440 
silicone around the base of the neck
just<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.430> make<00:00:32.579> sure<00:00:32.730> we<00:00:32.910> wouldn't<00:00:33.180> have<00:00:33.300> any

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
just to make sure we wouldn't have any

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.900 
just to make sure we wouldn't have any
little<00:00:34.110> silicone<00:00:34.649> stringy<00:00:35.130> things<00:00:35.430> falling

little silicone stringy things falling
into<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.239> mold<00:00:36.450> when<00:00:37.079> we<00:00:37.170> cast<00:00:37.730> now<00:00:38.730> it's

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
into the mold when we cast now it's

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.970 
into the mold when we cast now it's
always<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.210> good<00:00:39.420> idea<00:00:39.750> before<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.200> even<00:00:40.559> start

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
always a good idea before you even start

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.860 
always a good idea before you even start

like this at about 200 degrees this is a

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.110 
like this at about 200 degrees this is a
pot<00:00:54.809> full<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.170> Tex<00:00:55.530> clay<00:00:55.860> now<00:00:56.520> especially<00:00:56.879> if

pot full of Tex clay now especially if
you're<00:00:57.239> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.539> use<00:00:57.660> an<00:00:57.809> alginate<00:00:58.140> mold<00:00:58.530> you

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
you're going to use an alginate mold you

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.470 
you're going to use an alginate mold you
want<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.010> have<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.280> clay<00:00:59.550> preheated<00:01:00.329> to

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
want to have this clay preheated to

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.860 
want to have this clay preheated to
about<00:01:00.510> 200<00:01:01.140> degrees<00:01:01.489> now<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.550> notice<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.180> start

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
about 200 degrees now you notice I start

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.920 
about 200 degrees now you notice I start
by<00:01:04.049> pouring<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.589> liquid<00:01:04.739> clay<00:01:05.369> about<00:01:06.360> 1/3

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
by pouring the liquid clay about 1/3

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.380 
by pouring the liquid clay about 1/3
full<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.920> mold<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.430> then<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.000> quickly

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
full in the mold and then I quickly

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.910 
full in the mold and then I quickly
picked<00:01:09.630> up<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.900> mold<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.619> immediately

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
picked up that mold and I immediately

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.270 
picked up that mold and I immediately
start<00:01:11.490> rotating<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:12.150> around<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:13.040> that's<00:01:14.040> a

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
start rotating it around and that's a

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.179 
start rotating it around and that's a
very<00:01:14.580> important<00:01:15.060> step<00:01:15.330> because<00:01:15.930> if<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.950> were

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
very important step because if we were

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.789 
very important step because if we were
to<00:01:17.250> let<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.180> clay<00:01:18.540> sit<00:01:18.900> too<00:01:19.080> long<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.680> would

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
to let that clay sit too long it would

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.460 
to let that clay sit too long it would
create<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> freeze<00:01:20.520> line<00:01:20.880> where<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.750> stop

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
create a freeze line where I stop

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.039 
create a freeze line where I stop
pouring<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.890> clay<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.189> say<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.119> 1/3<00:01:24.420> full<00:01:24.720> at

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
pouring the clay so say it's 1/3 full at

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.020 
pouring the clay so say it's 1/3 full at
the<00:01:25.200> third<00:01:25.470> full<00:01:25.920> mark<00:01:26.280> there's<00:01:26.759> going<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.970> be

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
the third full mark there's going to be

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.969 
the third full mark there's going to be
a<00:01:27.150> line<00:01:27.479> that's<00:01:27.750> gonna<00:01:27.869> be<00:01:28.080> very<00:01:28.110> difficult<00:01:28.710> to

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
a line that's gonna be very difficult to

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.340 
a line that's gonna be very difficult to
sculpt<00:01:29.430> out<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.270> anytime<00:01:31.079> you're<00:01:31.320> working

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
sculpt out so anytime you're working

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.340 
sculpt out so anytime you're working
with<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> hot<00:01:32.220> material<00:01:32.759> like<00:01:32.909> clay<00:01:33.090> or<00:01:33.390> wax<00:01:33.630> you

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
with a hot material like clay or wax you

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.960 
with a hot material like clay or wax you
want<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.590> pour<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.920> in<00:01:35.070> again<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.790> see

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
want to pour it in again like you see

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.850 
want to pour it in again like you see
here<00:01:36.360> about<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.689> third<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.259> way<00:01:37.350> full<00:01:37.619> and

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
here about a third of the way full and

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.980 
here about a third of the way full and
immediately<00:01:38.579> pick<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.000> up<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.299> start<00:01:39.810> moving

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
immediately pick it up and start moving

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.780 
immediately pick it up and start moving
the<00:01:40.170> mold<00:01:40.439> around<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.100> doesn't<00:01:41.430> form<00:01:41.670> a

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
the mold around so it doesn't form a

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.969 
the mold around so it doesn't form a
freeze<00:01:42.090> line<00:01:42.420> where<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.049> clay<00:01:43.470> begins<00:01:43.799> to

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
freeze line where that clay begins to

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.670 
freeze line where that clay begins to
cool<00:01:44.659> you<00:01:45.659> know<00:01:45.720> you'll<00:01:45.990> notice<00:01:46.259> here<00:01:46.530> I'm

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
cool you know you'll notice here I'm

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.679 
cool you know you'll notice here I'm
taking<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.130> second<00:01:47.520> layer<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.090> we're

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
taking the second layer and we're

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.340 
taking the second layer and we're
sloshing<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.350> around<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:51.720> first<00:01:52.110> layer

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
sloshing that around and the first layer

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.810 
sloshing that around and the first layer
is<00:01:52.470> obviously<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.040> most<00:01:53.220> important<00:01:53.729> because

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
is obviously the most important because

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.330 
is obviously the most important because
that's<00:01:54.060> where<00:01:54.390> we<00:01:54.540> want<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.810> seamless<00:01:55.340> seamless

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
that's where we want a seamless seamless

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.550 
that's where we want a seamless seamless
clay<00:01:56.850> coverage<00:01:57.360> all<00:01:57.600> over<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:58.049> inside<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.500> the

mold and then our second and third slosh
of<00:02:02.460> clay<00:02:02.780> we<00:02:03.780> still<00:02:04.020> want<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.200> make<00:02:04.350> sure<00:02:04.530> we

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
we don't have to be as careful with that

we don't have to be as careful with that

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
and you'll notice this clay cools down

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.960 
and you'll notice this clay cools down
pretty<00:02:15.989> quick<00:02:16.290> very<00:02:16.830> important<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.459> it's<00:02:17.640> at

pretty quick very important that it's at
about<00:02:18.269> 200<00:02:18.840> degrees<00:02:19.819> anything<00:02:20.819> hotter<00:02:21.150> than

about 200 degrees anything hotter than
that<00:02:21.480> if<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.680> get<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.190> clay<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.459> say<00:02:24.019> 250

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
that if you get the clay to say 250

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.170 
that if you get the clay to say 250
degrees<00:02:25.379> it<00:02:26.010> will<00:02:26.250> be<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.459> little<00:02:26.670> more<00:02:26.940> liquid

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
degrees it will be a little more liquid

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.360 
degrees it will be a little more liquid
but<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:27.989> will<00:02:28.050> also<00:02:28.260> pose<00:02:28.739> a<00:02:28.769> hazard<00:02:29.010> of

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
but it will also pose a hazard of

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.400 
but it will also pose a hazard of
boiling<00:02:29.760> any<00:02:30.180> moisture<00:02:30.810> on<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.019> surface<00:02:31.379> of

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
the mold and if it boils that moisture

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.360 
the mold and if it boils that moisture
it<00:02:33.780> will<00:02:33.810> cause<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.110> little<00:02:34.290> deformed<00:02:34.830> spots

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
it will cause a little deformed spots

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.550 
it will cause a little deformed spots
and<00:02:35.700> if<00:02:36.360> you're<00:02:36.540> working<00:02:36.720> with<00:02:36.900> an<00:02:37.140> alginate

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
and if you're working with an alginate

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.400 
and if you're working with an alginate
mold<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.580> will<00:02:38.790> actually<00:02:39.209> distort<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.049> deform

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
mold it will actually distort and deform

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.800 
mold it will actually distort and deform
the<00:02:40.590> alginate<00:02:40.950> where<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.849> boils<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.569> water

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
the alginate where it boils the water

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.620 
the alginate where it boils the water
out<00:02:43.049> of<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.319> alginate<00:02:43.819> now<00:02:44.819> once<00:02:45.090> we<00:02:45.209> built<00:02:45.480> up

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
out of the alginate now once we built up

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.750 
out of the alginate now once we built up
a<00:02:45.750> suitable<00:02:46.140> thickness<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.680> clay<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.190> in<00:02:47.670> this

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
a suitable thickness of clay and in this

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.150 
a suitable thickness of clay and in this
case<00:02:48.000> we're<00:02:48.269> going<00:02:48.420> for<00:02:48.750> about<00:02:48.890> 3/8<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:50.040> an

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
case we're going for about 3/8 of an

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.000 
case we're going for about 3/8 of an
inch<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.489> a<00:02:50.730> half-inch<00:02:51.209> of<00:02:51.390> clay<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:52.410> can<00:02:52.799> go

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
inch to a half-inch of clay you can go

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.740 
inch to a half-inch of clay you can go
thicker<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.430> thinner<00:02:53.730> than<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.180> little<00:02:54.630> bit

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
thicker a thinner than that a little bit

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.350 
thicker a thinner than that a little bit
but<00:02:54.989> overall<00:02:55.380> I<00:02:55.829> really<00:02:56.340> like<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.760> about<00:02:57.329> a

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
but overall I really like the about a

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.949 
but overall I really like the about a
3/8<00:02:57.930> inch<00:02:59.030> thickness<00:03:00.030> of<00:03:00.180> clay<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.450> work<00:03:00.690> with

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
3/8 inch thickness of clay to work with

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.650 
3/8 inch thickness of clay to work with
and<00:03:01.950> once<00:03:02.310> we've<00:03:02.459> got<00:03:02.670> that<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:03.090> it's<00:03:03.299> cooled

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
and once we've got that and it's cooled

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.780 
and once we've got that and it's cooled
a<00:03:03.900> little<00:03:04.140> bit<00:03:04.290> we're<00:03:04.860> ready<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.370> back<00:03:05.549> it<00:03:05.730> up

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
a little bit we're ready to back it up

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.210 
a little bit we're ready to back it up
with<00:03:05.970> some<00:03:06.030> plaster<00:03:06.629> now<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:07.500> can<00:03:07.650> also<00:03:07.799> use

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
with some plaster now you can also use

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.360 
with some plaster now you can also use
rigid<00:03:08.519> foam<00:03:09.620> plasters<00:03:10.620> handy<00:03:10.920> because<00:03:11.190> it's

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
rigid foam plasters handy because it's

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.900 
rigid foam plasters handy because it's
cheap<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:12.079> it's<00:03:13.079> cold<00:03:13.470> so<00:03:14.190> that's<00:03:14.579> gonna<00:03:14.700> help

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
cheap and it's cold so that's gonna help

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.150 
cheap and it's cold so that's gonna help
further<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.989> when<00:03:16.170> we<00:03:16.319> initially<00:03:16.620> put<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:17.040> in

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
further and when we initially put it in

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.740 
further and when we initially put it in
there<00:03:17.340> it's<00:03:17.489> gonna<00:03:17.579> help<00:03:17.760> cool<00:03:18.060> off<00:03:18.329> the<00:03:18.510> clay

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
there it's gonna help cool off the clay

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.289 
there it's gonna help cool off the clay
even<00:03:19.109> more<00:03:19.350> but<00:03:20.340> we<00:03:20.670> also<00:03:20.819> don't<00:03:21.120> have<00:03:21.209> to

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
even more but we also don't have to

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.000 
even more but we also don't have to
worry<00:03:21.450> about<00:03:21.510> expansion<00:03:22.350> like<00:03:22.470> we<00:03:22.680> would<00:03:22.859> with

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
worry about expansion like we would with

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.270 
worry about expansion like we would with
rigid<00:03:23.370> foam<00:03:23.579> so<00:03:24.239> plaster<00:03:24.989> for<00:03:25.319> most<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.739> most

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
rigid foam so plaster for most of most

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.449 
rigid foam so plaster for most of most
of<00:03:26.489> us<00:03:26.609> that's<00:03:26.850> a<00:03:27.359> cheap<00:03:27.810> way<00:03:28.079> to<00:03:28.799> back<00:03:29.099> up<00:03:29.340> our

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
of us that's a cheap way to back up our

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.410 
of us that's a cheap way to back up our
clay<00:03:29.730> cast<00:03:30.650> now<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:31.680> don't<00:03:32.099> want<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.579> super<00:03:33.150> heavy

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
clay cast now I don't want a super heavy

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.690 
clay cast now I don't want a super heavy
head<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.260> deal<00:03:34.410> with<00:03:34.650> so<00:03:34.859> I'm<00:03:34.980> scooping<00:03:35.400> out

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
head to deal with so I'm scooping out

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.420 
head to deal with so I'm scooping out
the<00:03:35.940> plaster<00:03:36.450> as<00:03:36.569> I<00:03:36.690> work<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.380> I<00:03:38.160> want<00:03:38.370> to

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
the plaster as I work it and I want to

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.430 
the plaster as I work it and I want to
create<00:03:38.609> a<00:03:38.700> hollow<00:03:39.000> spot<00:03:39.450> on<00:03:39.569> the<00:03:39.690> inside<00:03:40.019> so<00:03:40.319> we

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
create a hollow spot on the inside so we

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.759 
create a hollow spot on the inside so we
don't<00:03:40.620> have<00:03:40.769> a<00:03:41.510> cast<00:03:42.510> that's<00:03:42.720> too<00:03:43.049> unwieldy<00:03:43.380> to

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
don't have a cast that's too unwieldy to

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.710 
don't have a cast that's too unwieldy to
deal<00:03:43.919> with<00:03:44.130> now<00:03:44.519> we<00:03:44.579> could<00:03:44.880> make<00:03:45.060> this<00:03:45.209> solid

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
deal with now we could make this solid

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.110 
deal with now we could make this solid
and<00:03:45.900> embed<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.260> pipe<00:03:46.650> in<00:03:46.950> it<00:03:47.099> so<00:03:47.579> we<00:03:47.700> could<00:03:47.790> screw

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
and embed a pipe in it so we could screw

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.879 
and embed a pipe in it so we could screw
it<00:03:48.209> onto<00:03:48.389> our<00:03:48.419> workbench<00:03:48.959> but<00:03:49.079> in<00:03:49.290> this<00:03:49.380> case<00:03:49.620> I

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
it onto our workbench but in this case I

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.610 
it onto our workbench but in this case I
just<00:03:49.919> want<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.430> simple<00:03:51.269> plaster<00:03:51.900> base<00:03:52.079> so<00:03:52.470> we

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
just want a simple plaster base so we

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.400 
just want a simple plaster base so we
just<00:03:52.829> let<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.220> plaster<00:03:54.180> set<00:03:54.480> up<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:54.900> I'm

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
just let that plaster set up and I'm

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.039 
just let that plaster set up and I'm
using<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.769> cleanup<00:03:56.040> tool<00:03:56.340> here<00:03:56.609> to<00:03:56.780> clean<00:03:57.780> it<00:03:57.930> up

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
using a cleanup tool here to clean it up

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.470 
using a cleanup tool here to clean it up
and<00:03:58.349> then<00:03:58.950> we<00:03:59.069> go<00:03:59.190> around<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.549> edge<00:03:59.700> with<00:03:59.730> some

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
and then we go around the edge with some

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.839 
and then we go around the edge with some
hemp<00:04:00.750> just<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:01.380> smooth<00:04:01.739> out<00:04:01.950> that<00:04:02.250> surface

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
hemp just to smooth out that surface

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.550 
hemp just to smooth out that surface
where<00:04:03.030> it's<00:04:03.150> going<00:04:03.299> to<00:04:03.329> come<00:04:03.900> in<00:04:04.019> contact<00:04:04.200> with

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
where it's going to come in contact with

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.640 
where it's going to come in contact with
the<00:04:04.769> table<00:04:05.160> or<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.370> workbench<00:04:06.049> and<00:04:07.049> there<00:04:07.500> you

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
the table or a workbench and there you

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.330 
the table or a workbench and there you
have<00:04:07.680> a<00:04:08.190> clay<00:04:08.669> cast<00:04:09.000> with<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:09.840> plaster<00:04:10.410> core<00:04:10.709> now

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
have a clay cast with a plaster core now

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.640 
have a clay cast with a plaster core now
keep<00:04:12.000> in<00:04:12.180> mind<00:04:12.419> at<00:04:12.660> this<00:04:12.780> point<00:04:12.900> even<00:04:13.440> though

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
keep in mind at this point even though

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.279 
keep in mind at this point even though
our<00:04:13.919> clay<00:04:14.250> is<00:04:14.400> somewhat<00:04:14.790> solid<00:04:15.120> we<00:04:15.840> don't<00:04:16.109> want

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
our clay is somewhat solid we don't want

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:17.539 
our clay is somewhat solid we don't want
to<00:04:16.349> try<00:04:16.530> to<00:04:16.560> deem<00:04:16.829> old<00:04:17.010> it<00:04:17.160> yet

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
to try to deem old it yet

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.940 
to try to deem old it yet
if<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:18.479> plaster<00:04:19.049> is<00:04:19.169> still<00:04:19.410> going<00:04:19.620> to<00:04:19.829> go

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
if the plaster is still going to go

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.180 
if the plaster is still going to go
through<00:04:20.190> it's<00:04:20.340> hot<00:04:20.579> stage<00:04:20.969> which<00:04:21.750> could

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
through it's hot stage which could

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.160 
through it's hot stage which could
soften<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.310> clay<00:04:23.580> and<00:04:24.320> we<00:04:25.320> might<00:04:25.560> run<00:04:25.710> into

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
soften the clay and we might run into

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.380 
soften the clay and we might run into
I'm<00:04:26.290> steam<00:04:26.560> molding<00:04:26.920> our<00:04:27.070> ears<00:04:27.430> or<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:27.880> nose

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
I'm steam molding our ears or the nose

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.870 
I'm steam molding our ears or the nose
or<00:04:28.750> things<00:04:28.930> like<00:04:29.020> that<00:04:29.110> ears<00:04:29.740> or<00:04:29.980> the<00:04:30.010> nose<00:04:30.550> or

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
or things like that ears or the nose or

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.430 
or things like that ears or the nose or
things<00:04:31.060> like<00:04:31.240> that<00:04:31.390> so<00:04:31.810> it's<00:04:31.930> a<00:04:31.990> good<00:04:32.140> idea

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
things like that so it's a good idea

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.290 
things like that so it's a good idea
when<00:04:32.890> you're<00:04:32.980> doing<00:04:33.310> a<00:04:33.400> clay<00:04:33.640> head<00:04:33.880> like<00:04:34.090> this

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
when you're doing a clay head like this

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.150 
when you're doing a clay head like this
to<00:04:34.750> give<00:04:34.900> it<00:04:34.930> several<00:04:35.440> hours<00:04:35.590> I<00:04:35.920> would<00:04:35.980> say

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
to give it several hours I would say

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.100 
to give it several hours I would say
five<00:04:36.370> or<00:04:36.520> six<00:04:36.700> hours<00:04:37.060> before<00:04:37.420> you<00:04:37.570> D<00:04:37.720> mold

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
five or six hours before you D mold

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.030 
five or six hours before you D mold
now<00:04:38.830> here's<00:04:39.280> a<00:04:39.360> clay<00:04:40.360> cast<00:04:40.720> with<00:04:41.410> a<00:04:41.440> plaster

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
now here's a clay cast with a plaster

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.860 
now here's a clay cast with a plaster
core<00:04:42.310> that<00:04:42.790> I've<00:04:42.910> already<00:04:43.060> removed<00:04:43.540> the<00:04:43.630> eyes

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
core that I've already removed the eyes

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.140 
core that I've already removed the eyes
from<00:04:44.290> and<00:04:44.590> obviously<00:04:45.460> this<00:04:45.580> is<00:04:45.700> a<00:04:45.730> different

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
from and obviously this is a different

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.490 
from and obviously this is a different
cast<00:04:46.390> than<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:46.750> one<00:04:46.900> we<00:04:46.990> were<00:04:47.050> pouring<00:04:47.320> up

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
cast than the one we were pouring up

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.960 
cast than the one we were pouring up
there<00:04:47.680> this<00:04:47.830> is<00:04:47.980> a<00:04:48.010> head<00:04:48.250> and<00:04:48.370> shoulders<00:04:48.700> cast

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
there this is a head and shoulders cast

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.300 
there this is a head and shoulders cast
those<00:04:49.480> done<00:04:49.720> the<00:04:49.840> same<00:04:50.050> way<00:04:50.260> and<00:04:50.590> I've<00:04:51.040> already

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
those done the same way and I've already

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.710 
those done the same way and I've already
started<00:04:51.520> sculpting<00:04:51.880> on<00:04:52.210> that<00:04:52.390> I've<00:04:52.540> removed

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
started sculpting on that I've removed

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.710 
started sculpting on that I've removed
the<00:04:53.020> eyes<00:04:53.170> here's<00:04:53.890> a<00:04:53.950> second<00:04:54.610> clay<00:04:55.090> cast<00:04:55.420> and

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
the eyes here's a second clay cast and

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.560 
the eyes here's a second clay cast and
this<00:04:56.350> one<00:04:56.620> I<00:04:56.890> didn't<00:04:57.490> back<00:04:57.700> up<00:04:57.730> with<00:04:58.030> plaster

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
this one I didn't back up with plaster

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.900 
this one I didn't back up with plaster
just<00:04:58.780> to<00:04:58.900> show<00:04:59.080> you<00:04:59.140> that<00:04:59.800> Tex<00:05:00.250> clay<00:05:00.580> that<00:05:00.790> we

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
just to show you that Tex clay that we

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.720 
just to show you that Tex clay that we
used<00:05:01.180> in<00:05:01.360> this<00:05:01.510> process<00:05:01.950> is<00:05:02.950> strong<00:05:03.400> enough

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
used in this process is strong enough

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.820 
used in this process is strong enough
that<00:05:03.970> in<00:05:04.540> some<00:05:04.810> cases<00:05:05.050> if<00:05:05.320> you<00:05:05.410> make<00:05:05.530> it<00:05:05.650> about

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
that in some cases if you make it about

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.010 
that in some cases if you make it about
a<00:05:05.860> half<00:05:06.100> inch<00:05:06.310> thick<00:05:06.460> it'll<00:05:07.330> be<00:05:07.450> strong<00:05:07.780> enough

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
a half inch thick it'll be strong enough

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.730 
a half inch thick it'll be strong enough
without<00:05:08.260> at<00:05:08.830> plaster<00:05:09.400> core
