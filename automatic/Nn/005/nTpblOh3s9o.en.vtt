 Full have Mashitae 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.730
 I think it is good to do a little bit of the impression that I saw it 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.950
 For example waiting 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.350

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:58.390
 Because it says 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:01:01.270
 In fact, if you live in a place where you kill cats and so on, there will be mud and you will always break up 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:07.140
 And among them sns 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.140

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:16.620

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:19.170
 I No say quiet Kedomo we have a father of a scene 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.490
 So let's do a little 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.870
 It is after baking 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.890

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:43.930
 I think I'm thinking of saying that 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:49.940
 It's like you know that the Deus's person is suddenly gone and you don't know the existence of that person 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:52.300
 I was crying that it would not be possible without the person 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:58.340
 That's right 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:02:04.380
 So I was feeling like watching a flame or life overall 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:06.930
 I feel like I saw it since the change of Shea position . Since the voice actor has changed. 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.030
