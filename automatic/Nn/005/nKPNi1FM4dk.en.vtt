 he knows what mercy is then the first 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.650
 episode you watch even if you should 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.230
 look at the first one that is an episode 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.929
 on a sofa where we talk about things like that 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.460
 peaceful villa will be captive note values 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.840
 different we had several paolo of 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.840
 today we have a 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.580
 there would be classic eni tea 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.570
 very british eyes your eyes eyes 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.460
 it really delicate but still then 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.820
 we have to give a file state why not 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:42.079
 we have absolutely very good lady 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:44.460
 it is hot for good is the classic one 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.850
 you died damaged you have to do if 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.140
 classes anyway then we will have 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.230
 the topic of today is now the subject 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.989
 today has been provided in the comments 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.390
 in the comments by piano I now have to 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.640
 find it because it's not great it's on 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.800
 this that every time the case is opened 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.110
 then in the meantime, however, cabaret 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.610
 how can the events remember anyway? 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.280
 as always then suggest us wide but 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.390
 then if I tell you right plan 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.549
 next time coordination 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.250
 pokémon is a game for children 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.229
 I know that badaba mines doesn't have you 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:22.500
 the perugia then improved 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:25.670
 are flying things now but as a 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.810
 game of this reality then 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.760
 we have discussed it need that 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.270
 maybe for the first time it's one thing 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.450
 actually a lot if a lot happens 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.030
 often because it matches pokémon like 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.679
 cardboard after roland to pokemon like 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:47.509
 game 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:49.130
 and this makes us all think about who 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.759
 play little is not a child anyway 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.069
 there is 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:56.869
 in the end I don't know why little has it anyway 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.979
 of the elements where to think also 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.020
 a lot for example the side 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.810
 competitive and this is fixed 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.629
 competitive to have on the straw but 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:11.090
 however it is however many people 

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:13.099
 they are afraid or hide when 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.450
 there is this this is true these 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.870
 they are history in the real life of 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.150
 person I remember in the nerd network 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.000
 runs in the miachael class between them 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.950
 with him at Christmas day day 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.239
 before Christmas we played a few 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.069
 not with everyone who looked at each other and yes 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.569
 takes a study around but for the 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.879
 unit is mounted let's put them in the clear 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.079
 this language but still in 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.079
 that your opinion my opinion 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.849
 silvio just finished we were 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.319
 written then not of course 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.040
 setting the style 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.650
 the anime is obviously the soul 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.239
 for children this does not change that now 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.730
 today I'm going to see it 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.500
 after today because according to the known lieutenant 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.920
 then in a few days I will go to see 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.139
 the film 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.030
 certainly they were we were Saturday 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.230
 see I do not know why those who do not 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.329
 we also give vitoria that we are 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.769
 been on Saturday we were we will be 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.290
 it will be a beautiful thing 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.419
 we are resisting however we are 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.730
 been Saturday because in the diagram this 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:12.980
 a woman and a Saturday and Friday 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.450
 uploading to console guides is important 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:20.150
 explain what what I'll be you go 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.459
 I absolutely told the game the soul 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.510
 actually that style doesn't 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.419
 hide 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.690
 and much is not so much says no is 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:31.639
 simply child that is lightly 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.190
 quite precisely we always explore the 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.630
 world and conquer every land 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.629
 but that is not what I mind if in the 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.099
 meaning this does not mean that if that 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.260
 which I don't like is that many 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:45.170
 video games until you shoot if you don't 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.450
 games from people cradle to a late 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.920
 matured with his own beard had been 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.959
 also written in another with another 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.150
 comment how ever games for i 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:57.230
 eighteen are played by children 9 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.610
 years and then the world of eighteen years why 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.010
 does not mean anything if this is the 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.230
 question the fact that indeed among other things 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.370
 often the prevailing things is easier 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.590
 that more people are played 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.140
 small in general at least I have 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.760
 played more things is kind of up close 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.900
 as a child because falco league 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.609
 let's face it cool apple I liked it 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.750
 indeed very much veiled determined 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.400
 matrix levels got the minimum from 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.979
 cordaro reborn 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.139
 I will not know it there is the second one I am 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:30.100
 the most relaxing thing because of 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:33.470
 to disconnect from the rhythm of the day is 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.850
 buy this cup to disconnect from the 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.220
 pace of the day is maybe doing 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.290
 something that really is carefree 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.350
 relaxed for that in the forecourts sideboard 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.690
 life is life is the same thing though kiss 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.120
 eckhart use and child but not yes 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.680
 takes seriously but is there 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.240
 then maybe you can even sometimes 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.460
 playing a more serious game is nothing but the 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.580
 fever sense the portal is not correct 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.050
 however, because it is not that you are now 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.490
 putting so many players in the fact that 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.820
 they must necessarily touch those things in 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.810
 which you shoot for super door is always 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.210
 damn fax with the old men who 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:09.260
 they say the games are violent you are 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:11.810
 however, there are many things 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.640
 according to me it is to say that even if all 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.490
 let's give a new one so today I don't know 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:20.600
 no even though everyone says pokemon is 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:24.140
 as children, there is still to say that 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.789
 from ours that still the greatest 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:29.500
 part of the Baptist gamers that of the 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:31.729
 world is over 20 years old 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.920
 this is because most help him 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:36.380
 I'm at the end 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.520
 mica is a bit krypi however however to the 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.800
 end as he said so many elements 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.330
 cohesive the suits are absolutely those 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.490
 for big people it can't be 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.350
 including except that you have a front 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.520
 genius I never understood so many 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.960
 many things not antonia yet e 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:53.210
 so it tends to be but I demand but 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.550
 sorry the bad thing has it anyway here 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.800
 what then is our opinion 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.540
 Search for these below 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.110
 with combinations that of course for the 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:07.910
 next gamers we ask you to 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:11.630
 throw a topic and ask yourself what 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:14.300
 you want us to talk about and things like that 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.860
 Exactly we would like to talk exactly then 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.630
 however we have some stock 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.460
 for security between bbc memories below 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.510
 however I also think about this 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.470
 maybe if you do n't want to insert a 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:27.800
 long comment of similar ugly point 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.420
 ugly hashtag or many writers 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.330
 but then why do people comment 9 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.910
 let's leave what you want to tell me anyway 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:38.380
 however , things are thanks for the text 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.380
 exactly see you at the next hello
