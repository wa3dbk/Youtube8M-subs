00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.770
 let's learn the hours with the clock 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.600
 needle 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.650
 but needle watches have two sticks 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.769
 they are called needles one shorter and 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.809
 another longer 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.809
 the short needle marks the hours 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.770
 long needle marks minutes the 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.759
 long needle starts counting from the 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.360
 number 12 to the right counting from 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:33.790
 one in one 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:36.079
 in each dot being five in five 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.710
 each number 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.819
 each number counts as one more dot 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.819
 [Music] 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:50.820
 the short needle counts the hours or mark 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:54.350
 the hours from 1 to 12 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.900
 when the long needle is in the 12 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:01.070
 It is said that 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.440
 what are the hours exactly how it looks 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.060
 here 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.750
 that would be one o'clock because the 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.650
 short needle is 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.520
 in 1 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.070
 and the long one is in 12 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:23.020
 two o'clock at three o'clock 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:25.229
 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and 12:00 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.700
 here would be three and five minutes 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.700
 because the short needle that marks the 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.880
 hours is on 3 and on the long needle 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.530
 which marks the minutes 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.530
 passing five dots 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.330
 but it would be this 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.720
 [Music] 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.320
 at 5 and 7 minutes because the needle 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.280
 short of the hours is at number 5 and 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.010
 the large one 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:58.330
 passing 7 points 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.330
 and now it would be this 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.640
 the 3 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.640
 and 40 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.229
 the seven 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.869
 and 50 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.869
 the ten thirty-five 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.959
 8 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.959
 and 10 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:28.789
