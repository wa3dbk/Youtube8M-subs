00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
think it was just something that I just

wanted we wanted to do like something
that's<00:03:02.360> kind<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:02.840> dumb<00:03:03.260> but<00:03:03.790> serious<00:03:04.790> at<00:03:05.090> the

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
that's kind of dumb but serious at the

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.850 
that's kind of dumb but serious at the
same<00:03:05.420> time<00:03:05.750> like<00:03:06.140> we<00:03:06.260> were<00:03:06.350> trying<00:03:06.470> to<00:03:06.620> make

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
same time like we were trying to make

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.250 
same time like we were trying to make
legit<00:03:07.280> cookies<00:03:07.790> but<00:03:08.420> you<00:03:08.450> take<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:08.989> things

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
legit cookies but you take the things

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.860 
legit cookies but you take the things
literally<00:03:09.739> and<00:03:10.370> so<00:03:11.150> I<00:03:11.180> just<00:03:11.480> always<00:03:11.600> thought

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
literally and so I just always thought

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.199 
literally and so I just always thought
it's<00:03:12.140> fun<00:03:12.350> to<00:03:12.470> do<00:03:12.800> take<00:03:13.220> things<00:03:13.370> literally<00:03:13.760> and

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
it's fun to do take things literally and

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.720 
it's fun to do take things literally and
put<00:03:14.630> them<00:03:14.750> into<00:03:14.900> a<00:03:15.019> script<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:15.709> so<00:03:15.890> I<00:03:16.100> was<00:03:16.610> like

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
put them into a script and so I was like

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:17.920

of<00:03:49.640> words<00:03:49.790> to<00:03:50.180> describe<00:03:50.209> her<00:03:50.810> but<00:03:51.170> probably

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
of words to describe her but probably

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.490 
of words to describe her but probably
one<00:03:51.920> word<00:03:52.160> it'd<00:03:52.310> probably<00:03:52.489> be<00:03:52.700> like<00:03:53.000> funny<00:03:53.540> she

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
one word it'd probably be like funny she

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.560 
one word it'd probably be like funny she
makes<00:03:54.680> me<00:03:54.890> laugh<00:03:55.130> a<00:03:55.459> lot<00:03:55.880> just<00:03:56.150> by<00:03:56.330> her

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
makes me laugh a lot just by her

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:02.150 
makes me laugh a lot just by her
personality<00:03:57.110> so<00:03:58.540> I<00:03:59.540> feel<00:04:00.049> like<00:04:00.080> her<00:04:00.830> is<00:04:00.890> like

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
personality so I feel like her is like

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.860 
personality so I feel like her is like
she<00:04:03.160> since<00:04:03.490> she's<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.760> older<00:04:04.209> one<00:04:04.330> she's<00:04:04.600> kind

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
she since she's the older one she's kind

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.170 
she since she's the older one she's kind
of<00:04:05.020> more<00:04:05.260> like<00:04:05.290> she<00:04:06.220> acts<00:04:06.430> like<00:04:06.610> the<00:04:06.850> older<00:04:07.060> one

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
of more like she acts like the older one

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.360 
of more like she acts like the older one
