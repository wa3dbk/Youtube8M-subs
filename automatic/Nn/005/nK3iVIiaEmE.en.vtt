okay<00:00:03.780> friends<00:00:04.110> in<00:00:04.259> this<00:00:04.500> video<00:00:04.799> I'm<00:00:04.890> going<00:00:05.069> to

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
okay friends in this video I'm going to

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.369 
okay friends in this video I'm going to
talk<00:00:05.339> about<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:06.359> origin<00:00:06.690> of<00:00:06.810> life<00:00:07.080> and

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
talk about the origin of life and

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.470 
talk about the origin of life and
probably<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.400> experiment<00:00:08.970> which<00:00:09.120> helped<00:00:09.330> us

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
probably the experiment which helped us

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.459 
probably the experiment which helped us
to<00:00:09.630> prove<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.380> actually<00:00:10.830> go<00:00:11.990> nearer<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.320> this

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
to prove to actually go nearer to this

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.700 
to prove to actually go nearer to this
to<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.340> answer<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.700> this<00:00:14.849> question<00:00:15.500> okay<00:00:16.500> so

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
to the answer of this question okay so

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.070 
to the answer of this question okay so
we<00:00:17.130> will<00:00:17.190> be<00:00:17.340> talking<00:00:17.460> about<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:18.119> Henri<00:00:18.600> yuria

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
we will be talking about the Henri yuria

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
ago or did unique conditions on

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.160 
ago or did unique conditions on
primitive<00:00:29.849> earth<00:00:30.029> lead<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.599> formation<00:00:30.810> of

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
primitive earth lead to the formation of

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.360 
primitive earth lead to the formation of
larger<00:00:31.740> molecules<00:00:32.340> such<00:00:32.790> as<00:00:32.820> RNA<00:00:33.390> or<00:00:33.719> DNA

answer this question for answering these
questions<00:00:39.120> there<00:00:39.690> are<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.809> lot<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.079> different

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
questions there are a lot of different

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.560 
questions there are a lot of different
experiments<00:00:40.920> which<00:00:41.280> have<00:00:41.579> been<00:00:41.969> conducted

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
experiments which have been conducted

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.440 
experiments which have been conducted
but<00:00:42.780> most<00:00:43.020> important<00:00:43.530> one<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.850> experiment

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
but most important one is the experiment

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.069 
but most important one is the experiment
by<00:00:45.629> Stanley<00:00:46.200> Miller<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.500> Harold<00:00:46.710> Urey<00:00:47.399> in

by Stanley Miller and Harold Urey in

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.860 
by Stanley Miller and Harold Urey in
1950s<00:00:49.079> they<00:00:49.770> set<00:00:50.010> up<00:00:50.160> an<00:00:50.789> experiment<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.660> find

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
1950s they set up an experiment to find

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.049 
1950s they set up an experiment to find
out<00:00:52.140> whether<00:00:52.500> biological<00:00:52.829> molecules<00:00:53.699> could

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
out whether biological molecules could

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.299 
out whether biological molecules could
have<00:00:54.239> formed<00:00:54.899> spontaneously<00:00:55.140> on<00:00:55.770> primitive

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
have formed spontaneously on primitive

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.119 
have formed spontaneously on primitive
earth<00:00:56.489> or<00:00:56.899> not<00:00:57.899> they<00:00:58.500> started<00:00:58.980> with<00:00:59.100> a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
earth or not they started with a

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.220 
earth or not they started with a
solution<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.820> simple<00:01:00.180> chemicals<00:01:00.719> which

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
solution of a simple chemicals which

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.799 
solution of a simple chemicals which
they<00:01:01.410> call<00:01:01.590> an<00:01:01.710> oceanic<00:01:02.570> environment<00:01:03.570> or

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
they call an oceanic environment or

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.200 
they call an oceanic environment or
oceanic<00:01:04.040> compartment<00:01:05.040> at<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.339> time<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
oceanic compartment at that time the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.410 
oceanic compartment at that time the
solution<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:07.409> chemicals<00:01:08.100> were<00:01:08.460> well<00:01:09.000> was

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
solution of chemicals were well was

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.940 
solution of chemicals were well was
heated<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.080> produce<00:01:10.260> an<00:01:10.530> artificial

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
heated to produce an artificial

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.429 
heated to produce an artificial
atmosphere<00:01:11.850> probably<00:01:12.659> resembling<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
atmosphere probably resembling the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.620 
atmosphere probably resembling the
atmosphere<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.369> primitive<00:01:14.549> earth<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
atmosphere of the primitive earth the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.450 
atmosphere of the primitive earth the
atmosphere<00:01:15.780> contained<00:01:16.619> methane<00:01:17.070> ammonia

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
atmosphere contained methane ammonia

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.510 
atmosphere contained methane ammonia
hydrogen<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.450> water<00:01:18.900> vapor<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.979> gases<00:01:20.490> that

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
hydrogen and water vapor the gases that

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.120 
hydrogen and water vapor the gases that
were<00:01:21.000> thought<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.720> make<00:01:22.080> up<00:01:22.320> darts<00:01:22.680> early

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
were thought to make up darts early

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.719 
were thought to make up darts early
atmosphere

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.230 
atmosphere
okay<00:01:24.590> now<00:01:25.590> Miller<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.250> Urey<00:01:26.280> used<00:01:26.700> electrical

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
okay now Miller and Urey used electrical

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.420 
okay now Miller and Urey used electrical
sparks<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.960> stimulate<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.560> lightning<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
sparks to stimulate the lightning in the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.120 
sparks to stimulate the lightning in the
early<00:01:29.790> atmosphere<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.990> they<00:01:31.229> just<00:01:31.470> start<00:01:31.979> to

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
early atmosphere so they just start to

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.280 
early atmosphere so they just start to
make<00:01:32.310> all<00:01:32.520> these<00:01:32.759> things<00:01:32.970> up<00:01:33.180> pretty<00:01:33.720> natural

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
make all these things up pretty natural

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.530 
make all these things up pretty natural
because<00:01:34.470> what<00:01:35.189> would<00:01:35.820> have<00:01:36.000> been<00:01:36.180> happening

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
because what would have been happening

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.999 
because what would have been happening
in<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.720> natural<00:01:37.110> environment<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.680> start<00:01:37.890> to

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
in the natural environment is start to

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.520 
in the natural environment is start to
replicate<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.820> in<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.240> laboratory<00:01:39.750> now

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
replicate that in in in laboratory now

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.649 
replicate that in in in laboratory now
from<00:01:40.799> from<00:01:41.220> our<00:01:41.520> knowledge<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.240> chemical

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
from from our knowledge of chemical

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.830 
from from our knowledge of chemical
reactions<00:01:43.200> what<00:01:43.770> do<00:01:44.369> we<00:01:44.490> think<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.000> happen

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
reactions what do we think that happen

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.749 
reactions what do we think that happen
when<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> chemical<00:01:46.500> gases<00:01:46.860> passed<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
when the chemical gases passed to the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.510 
when the chemical gases passed to the
electrical<00:01:48.299> sparks<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.680> sparks<00:01:50.070> alone

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
electrical sparks so the sparks alone

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.219 
electrical sparks so the sparks alone
had<00:01:50.790> no<00:01:51.000> effect<00:01:51.360> on<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.509> chemicals<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.110> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
had no effect on the chemicals in the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.920 
had no effect on the chemicals in the
artificial<00:01:53.040> atmosphere<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.600> spark

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
artificial atmosphere the spark

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.300 
artificial atmosphere the spark
stimulated<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.590> formation<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.100> new

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
stimulated the formation of new

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.880 
stimulated the formation of new
compounds<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.360> answer<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.380> yes

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
compounds and the answer is this yes

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.950 
compounds and the answer is this yes
that<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.430> what<00:01:59.790> is<00:01:59.969> actually<00:02:00.390> happening

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
that is what is actually happening

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.370 
that is what is actually happening
the<00:02:01.380> results<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.130> experiment<00:02:02.490> suggests

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
the results of this experiment suggests

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.350
