 boot the proverbial server according to gm 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:10.109

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:13.109
 in 2009 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.890
 halle 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.220
 that do something with it 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.220
 he did say 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:34.809
 be doubled time and time again 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.330
 4 this reports that I do not want known 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.330
 both 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.280
 before barcelona 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.280
 j 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.920

 parking 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.380
 how 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.520
 last month 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.230
 yy 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.230
 that happened 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.140
 just doing everything there is a more humane one 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.330
 but oh 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.480
 after rest 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.500
 therefore I never have an example of this 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.080
 all clichÃ©s 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.460

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.980

 how can that be just the starting pro how many people seem 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.660
 but 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.290
 in the last quarter earlier 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.880
 I start 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.200
 the newspaper quotes 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.450
 project manager for it 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.929
 but now the difference is decreasing 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.620
 on the tape 

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.789
 on
