okay<00:00:00.870> so<00:00:00.930> today<00:00:01.439> I'm<00:00:01.589> going<00:00:01.740> to<00:00:01.800> show<00:00:02.010> you<00:00:02.040> how

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
okay so today I'm going to show you how

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.930 
okay so today I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:02.340> set<00:00:02.730> up<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.449> red<00:00:03.810> fury<00:00:04.170> USB<00:00:04.859> minor<00:00:05.130> with

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
to set up the red fury USB minor with

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.120 
to set up the red fury USB minor with
bit<00:00:06.629> Minter<00:00:07.140> calm<00:00:07.859> or<00:00:08.069> CG<00:00:08.849> minor<00:00:09.230> so<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.860> can't

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
bit Minter calm or CG minor so you can't

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.249 
bit Minter calm or CG minor so you can't
use<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.550> same<00:00:11.580> driver<00:00:12.179> as<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.750> one<00:00:12.900> you<00:00:13.049> use

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
use the same driver as the one you use

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.340 
use the same driver as the one you use
with<00:00:13.500> BF<00:00:13.799> g<00:00:14.040> minor<00:00:14.839> basically<00:00:15.839> just<00:00:16.020> because

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
with BF g minor basically just because

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.029 
with BF g minor basically just because
CG<00:00:17.310> minor<00:00:17.520> uses<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.940> different<00:00:18.180> driver<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:19.039> I

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
CG minor uses a different driver and I

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.220 
CG minor uses a different driver and I
think<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.000> story<00:00:21.240> behind<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.900> little<00:00:22.050> bit

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
think the story behind it a little bit

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.220 
think the story behind it a little bit
is<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:23.130> creators<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:23.939> B<00:00:24.330> F<00:00:24.449> G<00:00:24.660> minor<00:00:24.930> and

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
is that the creators of B F G minor and

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.439 
is that the creators of B F G minor and
C<00:00:25.380> G<00:00:25.590> minor<00:00:25.800> don't<00:00:26.160> like<00:00:26.310> each<00:00:26.490> other<00:00:26.670> it's<00:00:27.390> a

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
C G minor don't like each other it's a

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.050 
C G minor don't like each other it's a
bit<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.689> rivalry<00:00:28.080> there<00:00:28.650> or<00:00:28.980> something<00:00:29.369> so

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
bit of rivalry there or something so

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.749 
bit of rivalry there or something so
anyway<00:00:30.480> we<00:00:31.080> need<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.260> install<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:32.130> new<00:00:32.160> driver

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
anyway we need to install a new driver

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.180 
anyway we need to install a new driver
so<00:00:33.270> they'll<00:00:33.420> work<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:34.050> we<00:00:34.649> have<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.800> store<00:00:35.160> a

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
so they'll work and we have to store a

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.540 
so they'll work and we have to store a
win<00:00:35.520> USB<00:00:36.149> Driver<00:00:36.649> so<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.710> do<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.430> need

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
win USB Driver so to do this you need

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.100 
win USB Driver so to do this you need
that<00:00:38.730> down<00:00:39.030> at<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> program<00:00:39.780> called<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.980> big

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
that down at a program called that big

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.869 
that down at a program called that big
driver<00:00:43.110> installer<00:00:43.710> which<00:00:44.370> will<00:00:44.579> let<00:00:44.730> you

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
driver installer which will let you

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.690 
driver installer which will let you
install<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.390> new<00:00:45.510> driver

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
install the new driver

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.819 
install the new driver
so<00:00:47.700> I've<00:00:48.690> already<00:00:48.989> downloaded<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.680> before

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
so I've already downloaded it before

00:00:49.829 --> 00:01:13.570 
so I've already downloaded it before
let's<00:00:50.610> go<00:00:50.670> my<00:00:50.940> downloads<00:01:00.649> exact<00:01:01.649> dig<00:01:09.380> it<00:01:10.380> again

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:37.399 

so<00:01:14.580> it's<00:01:14.790> AG<00:01:15.030> dig<00:01:16.460> driver<00:01:17.460> installer<00:01:18.530> this<00:01:19.530> one

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.139 

so<00:01:37.920> we're<00:01:38.040> going<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.250> use<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.490> program<00:01:38.759> to

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
so we're going to use this program to

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:40.850 
so we're going to use this program to
reinstall<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.689> new<00:01:39.930> driver<00:01:40.200> for<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.649> USB

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
reinstall a new driver for the USB

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.120 
reinstall a new driver for the USB
miners<00:01:41.399> and<00:01:41.960> that<00:01:42.960> should<00:01:43.200> do<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.789> let's<00:01:44.789> see

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
miners and that should do it let's see

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:55.100 
miners and that should do it let's see
open<00:01:47.130> it

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.770 

okay<00:01:55.980> so<00:01:56.730> there<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:57.030> while<00:01:57.300> I'm<00:01:57.390> doing<00:01:57.660> this

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
okay so there be while I'm doing this

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.510 
okay so there be while I'm doing this
but<00:01:57.930> I'll<00:01:58.080> just<00:01:58.200> turn<00:01:58.440> off<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.830> US<00:01:59.040> beats<00:01:59.280> for

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
but I'll just turn off the US beats for

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.390 
but I'll just turn off the US beats for
now<00:02:01.100> maybe<00:02:02.180> we'll<00:02:03.180> turn<00:02:03.480> off<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.750> hub's

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
now maybe we'll turn off the hub's

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:11.470 
now maybe we'll turn off the hub's
and<00:02:05.400> just<00:02:05.610> install<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.060> for<00:02:06.390> maybe<00:02:06.900> I<00:02:07.050> think

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.750 

one<00:02:12.480> USB<00:02:13.020> one<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:13.920> have<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.070> be<00:02:14.160> able<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.520> stick

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
one USB one you have to be able to stick

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.070 
one USB one you have to be able to stick
with

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
with

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:23.960 
with

okay go options list all devices just

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.760 
okay go options list all devices just
pick<00:02:42.960> the<00:02:43.050> first<00:02:43.080> one

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
pick the first one

pick the first one
bitfury<00:02:44.190> bf1<00:02:45.180> USB<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:47.420> mmm<00:02:48.420> we<00:02:48.900> want<00:02:49.080> to

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
bitfury bf1 USB so mmm we want to

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.570 
bitfury bf1 USB so mmm we want to
replace<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.590> driver<00:02:50.100> it's<00:02:50.460> a<00:02:50.670> USB<00:02:55.190> sir<00:02:56.190> driver

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
replace the driver it's a USB sir driver

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.980 
replace the driver it's a USB sir driver
at<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.820> moment<00:02:57.120> want<00:02:57.210> to<00:02:57.300> replace<00:02:57.540> that<00:02:57.600> with

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
at the moment want to replace that with

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:04.910 
at the moment want to replace that with
win<00:02:58.200> USB<00:02:58.730> so<00:02:59.730> we<00:02:59.880> say<00:03:00.090> replace<00:03:03.110> store<00:03:04.110> W<00:03:04.530> CID

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
win USB so we say replace store W CID

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.840 
win USB so we say replace store W CID
driver<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:05.970> say<00:03:06.180> install<00:03:06.510> driver<00:03:10.850> place

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
driver so say install driver place

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.660 
driver so say install driver place
driver<00:03:12.920> will<00:03:13.920> come<00:03:14.070> up<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.310> say<00:03:14.490> it's

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
driver will come up and say it's

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:23.040 
driver will come up and say it's
installing<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.210> driver

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.460 

okay<00:03:23.650> so<00:03:23.710> now<00:03:24.100> it<00:03:24.160> says<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.520> driver<00:03:24.760> was

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
okay so now it says the driver was

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.020 
okay so now it says the driver was
installed<00:03:26.470> successfully<00:03:26.590> so<00:03:27.520> let's<00:03:27.700> check<00:03:27.880> it

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
installed successfully so let's check it

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.390 
installed successfully so let's check it
out<00:03:29.430> so<00:03:30.430> we<00:03:30.580> click<00:03:30.790> on<00:03:30.910> any<00:03:31.120> bitfury<00:03:31.570> USB<00:03:32.410> mine

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
out so we click on any bitfury USB mine

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.670 
out so we click on any bitfury USB mine
and<00:03:33.700> now<00:03:33.820> it<00:03:34.150> shows<00:03:34.480> it<00:03:35.080> has<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.500> correct

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
and now it shows it has the correct

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.340 
and now it shows it has the correct
driver<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.310> win<00:03:36.460> USB<00:03:36.970> that's<00:03:37.930> what<00:03:38.050> we<00:03:38.170> need

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
driver the win USB that's what we need

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.900 
driver the win USB that's what we need
okay<00:03:40.050> so<00:03:41.050> sometimes<00:03:41.860> you<00:03:42.160> need<00:03:42.250> to<00:03:42.310> reset<00:03:42.760> your

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
okay so sometimes you need to reset your
