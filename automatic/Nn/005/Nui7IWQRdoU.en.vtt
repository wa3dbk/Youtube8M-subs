00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.969 

number<00:00:00.780> six<00:00:01.020> reads<00:00:01.230> what<00:00:01.469> is<00:00:01.620> the<00:00:01.770> solution

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
number six reads what is the solution

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.579 
number six reads what is the solution
set<00:00:02.490> of<00:00:02.520> the<00:00:02.700> equation<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.629> absolute<00:00:04.140> value

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
set of the equation the absolute value

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.299 
set of the equation the absolute value
for<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.040> plus<00:00:05.580> 6<00:00:05.940> minus<00:00:06.750> 4a<00:00:07.319> is<00:00:07.649> equal<00:00:08.160> to

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
for a plus 6 minus 4a is equal to

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.759 
for a plus 6 minus 4a is equal to
negative<00:00:08.580> 10<00:00:09.389> now<00:00:09.900> this<00:00:10.019> is<00:00:10.080> an<00:00:10.320> absolute

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
negative 10 now this is an absolute

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.789 
negative 10 now this is an absolute
value<00:00:11.160> equation<00:00:11.730> so<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:11.969> do<00:00:12.330> this<00:00:12.590> I'm<00:00:13.590> going

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
value equation so to do this I'm going

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.259 
value equation so to do this I'm going
to<00:00:13.889> start<00:00:14.190> off<00:00:14.250> by<00:00:14.309> writing<00:00:14.759> it<00:00:14.880> out<00:00:15.000> right

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
to start off by writing it out right

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.939 
to start off by writing it out right
here<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:19.760> am<00:00:20.760> going<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.510> first<00:00:21.810> swing<00:00:22.619> this

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
here I am going to first swing this

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.589 
here I am going to first swing this
negative<00:00:23.550> for<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.570> right<00:00:24.750> side<00:00:24.990> because

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
negative for a to the right side because

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:32.600 
negative for a to the right side because
we<00:00:27.599> need<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.869> isolate<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:30.769> absolute<00:00:31.769> value

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
we need to isolate that absolute value

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.150 
we need to isolate that absolute value
expression<00:00:33.329> over<00:00:33.960> here<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.829> have<00:00:35.040> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
expression over here so I have the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.720 
expression over here so I have the
absolute<00:00:35.309> value<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.969> 4a<00:00:36.649> plus<00:00:37.649> 6<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.219> equal<00:00:38.280> to

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
absolute value of 4a plus 6 is equal to

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.040 
absolute value of 4a plus 6 is equal to
and<00:00:39.059> it's<00:00:39.930> going<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.110> be<00:00:40.200> 4a<00:00:41.149> minus<00:00:42.149> 10<00:00:42.719> over

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
and it's going to be 4a minus 10 over

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.369 
and it's going to be 4a minus 10 over
here<00:00:44.239> now<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.300> get<00:00:45.480> rid<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.719> these<00:00:45.870> absolute

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
here now to get rid of these absolute

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.779 
here now to get rid of these absolute
values<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.010> what<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.190> tell<00:00:47.370> my<00:00:47.489> students

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
values this is what I tell my students

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.690 
values this is what I tell my students
device<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.899> doesn't<00:00:49.289> matter<00:00:49.530> what<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.430> sign

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
device it doesn't matter what the sign

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.119 
device it doesn't matter what the sign
of<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.390> value<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.079> here<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:52.590> because<00:00:53.010> if

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
of the value and here it's because if

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.729 
of the value and here it's because if
it's<00:00:53.280> positive<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:54.570> absolute<00:00:55.020> values<00:00:55.469> will

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
it's positive the absolute values will

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.520 
it's positive the absolute values will
make<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.100> positive<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.879> if<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.199> negative

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
make it positive and if this is negative

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.040 
make it positive and if this is negative
inside<00:00:59.100> here<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> absolute<00:00:59.879> value<00:01:00.180> bars<00:01:00.210> make

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
inside here the absolute value bars make

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.240 
inside here the absolute value bars make
it<00:01:01.320> positive<00:01:02.120> so<00:01:03.120> we<00:01:03.300> need<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.570> do<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.250> draw

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
it positive so we need to do is draw

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.030 
it positive so we need to do is draw
branches<00:01:05.909> down<00:01:06.060> here<00:01:06.270> I'd<00:01:06.390> say<00:01:07.290> positive

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
branches down here I'd say positive

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.700 
branches down here I'd say positive
branch<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.790> negative<00:01:09.210> branch<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.840> you

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
branch and a negative branch and you

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.190 
branch and a negative branch and you
keep<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:11.070> expression<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> same<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.689> go<00:01:12.810> 4a

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
keep this expression the same you go 4a

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.100 
keep this expression the same you go 4a
plus<00:01:13.770> 6<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.430> equal<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.900> word<00:01:16.080> is

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
plus 6 is equal to and the word is

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.990 
plus 6 is equal to and the word is
through<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> positive<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.610> side<00:01:17.970> right

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
through the positive of this side right

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.510 
through the positive of this side right
here<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:19.259> positive<00:01:19.470> doesn't<00:01:20.070> change<00:01:20.250> any

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
here and the positive doesn't change any

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.249 
here and the positive doesn't change any
signs<00:01:20.880> over<00:01:21.299> here<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:21.810> I'm<00:01:21.869> just<00:01:22.020> going<00:01:22.170> to

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
signs over here so I'm just going to

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.429 
signs over here so I'm just going to
rewrite<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.650> 4a<00:01:23.340> minus<00:01:23.970> 10<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.200> one

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
rewrite the 4a minus 10 so this is one

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.700 
rewrite the 4a minus 10 so this is one
equation<00:01:25.560> i'm<00:01:26.130> going<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.520> solve<00:01:26.729> for<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.180> and

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
equation i'm going to solve for a and

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.399 
equation i'm going to solve for a and
then<00:01:28.710> on<00:01:29.030> my<00:01:30.030> negative<00:01:30.479> branch<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.229> where

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
then on my negative branch this is where

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.810 
then on my negative branch this is where
things<00:01:31.650> get<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.100> little<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:34.369> little<00:01:35.369> bit<00:01:35.579> more

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
things get a little a little bit more

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.760 
things get a little a little bit more
difficult<00:01:35.970> not<00:01:36.360> too<00:01:36.540> difficult<00:01:36.750> as<00:01:37.110> i<00:01:37.500> have<00:01:37.619> to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
difficult not too difficult as i have to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.510 
difficult not too difficult as i have to
negate<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.460> whole<00:01:38.759> side<00:01:39.090> here<00:01:40.009> so<00:01:41.009> i<00:01:41.070> got<00:01:41.400> to

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
negate this whole side here so i got to

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.780 
negate this whole side here so i got to
negate<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:41.939> whole<00:01:42.390> expression<00:01:42.780> for<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.790> minus

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
negate that whole expression for a minus

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.069 
negate that whole expression for a minus
10<00:01:45.619> and<00:01:47.180> so<00:01:48.180> now<00:01:48.329> i'm<00:01:48.390> going<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.570> solve<00:01:48.810> for

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
10 and so now i'm going to solve for

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.990 
10 and so now i'm going to solve for
each<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.350> these<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:51.890> when<00:01:52.890> i<00:01:53.009> go<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.159> solve<00:01:53.579> for

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
each of these and when i go to solve for

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.149 
each of these and when i go to solve for
this<00:01:54.649> when<00:01:55.649> i<00:01:55.680> subtract<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.490> 4a<00:01:56.790> here<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:58.159> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
this when i subtract the 4a here in the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.760 
this when i subtract the 4a here in the
4a<00:01:59.490> here<00:02:00.000> kind<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.780> took<00:02:00.930> me<00:02:01.110> off<00:02:01.229> guard<00:02:01.259> there

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
4a here kind of took me off guard there

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.310 
4a here kind of took me off guard there
for<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.009> second<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:03.180> form<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.659> A's<00:02:03.810> cancel

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
for a second the form of the A's cancel

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.160 
for a second the form of the A's cancel
out<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.649> we<00:02:04.740> have<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:05.790> positive<00:02:06.420> 6<00:02:06.719> there<00:02:06.990> is

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
out and we have just positive 6 there is

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.109 
out and we have just positive 6 there is
equal<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.890> negative<00:02:07.920> 10<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:08.700> there's<00:02:08.879> no

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
equal to negative 10 so there's no

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.890 
equal to negative 10 so there's no
solution<00:02:09.479> on<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.649> side

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
solution on the side

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.319 
solution on the side
because<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.799> variables<00:02:13.189> are<00:02:13.370> out<00:02:13.970> of<00:02:14.239> there

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 
because the variables are out of there

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:16.630 
because the variables are out of there
we<00:02:14.420> have<00:02:14.540> nothing<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:14.930> solve<00:02:15.170> for<00:02:15.439> and<00:02:15.650> over

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
we have nothing to solve for and over

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.610 
we have nothing to solve for and over
here<00:02:17.090> hopefully<00:02:17.959> we<00:02:18.079> get<00:02:18.170> something<00:02:18.530> over

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
here hopefully we get something over

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.990 
here hopefully we get something over
here<00:02:20.110> bring<00:02:21.110> this<00:02:21.230> negative<00:02:21.739> through<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.459> it

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
here bring this negative through and it

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.770 
here bring this negative through and it
looks<00:02:23.180> like<00:02:23.269> we're<00:02:23.599> going<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:25.569> because<00:02:26.569> when

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
looks like we're going to because when

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.240 
looks like we're going to because when
we<00:02:26.989> add<00:02:27.849> 4<00:02:28.849> a<00:02:28.879> 2<00:02:29.090> here<00:02:29.629> and<00:02:29.810> add<00:02:30.560> for<00:02:30.890> a<00:02:30.920> here

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
we add 4 a 2 here and add for a here

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.979 
we add 4 a 2 here and add for a here
that's<00:02:31.519> not<00:02:31.640> going<00:02:31.970> to<00:02:32.060> cancel<00:02:32.269> out<00:02:32.569> on<00:02:32.720> this

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
that's not going to cancel out on this

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.520 
that's not going to cancel out on this
side<00:02:33.230> we're<00:02:33.920> going<00:02:34.069> to<00:02:34.159> have<00:02:34.250> eight<00:02:34.489> a<00:02:35.079> plus<00:02:36.079> 6

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
side we're going to have eight a plus 6

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.520 
side we're going to have eight a plus 6
is<00:02:36.920> equal<00:02:37.519> to<00:02:38.859> 10<00:02:39.859> and<00:02:41.109> then<00:02:42.109> we're<00:02:42.379> going<00:02:42.470> to

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
is equal to 10 and then we're going to

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.460 
is equal to 10 and then we're going to
subtract<00:02:42.950> 6<00:02:43.250> on<00:02:43.430> both<00:02:43.609> sides<00:02:43.989> so<00:02:44.989> we<00:02:45.019> got<00:02:45.230> eight

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
subtract 6 on both sides so we got eight

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.660 
subtract 6 on both sides so we got eight
a<00:02:45.799> is<00:02:46.099> equal<00:02:46.579> to<00:02:46.609> 4<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.959> divide<00:02:49.329> by<00:02:51.250> 8/8<00:02:52.250> there

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
a is equal to 4 and divide by 8/8 there

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.869 
a is equal to 4 and divide by 8/8 there
/<00:02:53.060> 8<00:02:53.420> there<00:02:53.720> we<00:02:54.349> have<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.530> is<00:02:54.859> equal<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.220> 4<00:02:55.670> over<00:02:55.849> 8

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
/ 8 there we have a is equal to 4 over 8

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.789 
/ 8 there we have a is equal to 4 over 8
is<00:02:56.150> one-half<00:02:59.049> so<00:03:00.049> the<00:03:00.200> only<00:03:00.349> other<00:03:00.439> thing<00:03:00.620> we

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
is one-half so the only other thing we

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.479 
is one-half so the only other thing we
need<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.040> do<00:03:01.340> here<00:03:01.639> is<00:03:01.790> just<00:03:02.709> go<00:03:03.709> and<00:03:03.950> check<00:03:04.250> our

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
need to do here is just go and check our

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.339 
need to do here is just go and check our
answer<00:03:04.849> we<00:03:04.970> have<00:03:05.060> this<00:03:05.239> one<00:03:05.629> half<00:03:05.870> we<00:03:06.139> should

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
answer we have this one half we should

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.559 
answer we have this one half we should
check<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:06.799> because<00:03:07.639> sometimes<00:03:08.030> absolute

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
check it because sometimes absolute

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.559 
check it because sometimes absolute
values<00:03:09.079> do<00:03:09.470> not<00:03:09.500> check<00:03:10.159> out<00:03:13.150> so<00:03:14.150> there's<00:03:14.329> my

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
values do not check out so there's my

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.020 
values do not check out so there's my
original<00:03:15.109> absolute<00:03:15.919> value<00:03:16.400> equation<00:03:16.849> that<00:03:16.970> I

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
original absolute value equation that I

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.970 
original absolute value equation that I
had<00:03:17.269> up<00:03:17.419> there<00:03:17.569> take<00:03:18.049> the<00:03:18.169> one-half<00:03:18.530> plug<00:03:18.859> it

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
had up there take the one-half plug it

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.569 
had up there take the one-half plug it
in<00:03:19.099> so<00:03:20.090> 4<00:03:20.419> times<00:03:20.500> one-half<00:03:22.299> plus<00:03:23.299> 6<00:03:24.069> minus<00:03:25.069> 4

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
in so 4 times one-half plus 6 minus 4

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.960 
in so 4 times one-half plus 6 minus 4
times<00:03:25.609> one-half<00:03:27.159> is<00:03:28.159> it<00:03:28.430> going<00:03:28.609> to<00:03:28.699> equal

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
times one-half is it going to equal

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.259 
times one-half is it going to equal
negative<00:03:29.209> 10<00:03:32.199> so<00:03:33.199> we<00:03:33.349> have<00:03:34.060> four<00:03:35.060> times

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
negative 10 so we have four times

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:41.890 
negative 10 so we have four times
one-half<00:03:35.659> and<00:03:35.930> that<00:03:36.109> is<00:03:36.319> 2<00:03:37.090> plus<00:03:38.090> 6<00:03:40.389> minus<00:03:41.389> 4

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
one-half and that is 2 plus 6 minus 4

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.930 
one-half and that is 2 plus 6 minus 4
times<00:03:41.930> when<00:03:42.799> a<00:03:42.829> half<00:03:43.069> that's<00:03:43.280> going<00:03:43.579> to<00:03:43.639> be<00:03:43.699> too

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
times when a half that's going to be too

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.349 
times when a half that's going to be too
and<00:03:45.370> so<00:03:46.370> we<00:03:46.459> have<00:03:46.549> the<00:03:46.669> absolute<00:03:46.790> value<00:03:47.060> of

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
and so we have the absolute value of

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.050 
and so we have the absolute value of
eight<00:03:47.629> minus<00:03:48.109> 2<00:03:48.590> this<00:03:48.859> is<00:03:48.919> equal<00:03:49.340> negative<00:03:49.519> 10

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
eight minus 2 this is equal negative 10

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.809 
eight minus 2 this is equal negative 10
and<00:03:50.269> the<00:03:50.870> absolute<00:03:51.319> value<00:03:51.769> of<00:03:51.799> 8<00:03:52.310> is<00:03:52.900> 8<00:03:54.459> minus<00:03:55.459> 2

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
and the absolute value of 8 is 8 minus 2

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.629 
and the absolute value of 8 is 8 minus 2
and<00:03:56.060> run<00:03:56.359> out<00:03:56.540> of<00:03:56.569> room<00:03:56.810> here<00:03:56.870> and<00:03:57.560> 8-2<00:03:58.220> is<00:03:58.370> six

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
and run out of room here and 8-2 is six

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.509 
and run out of room here and 8-2 is six
and<00:03:58.930> six<00:03:59.930> does<00:04:00.139> not<00:04:00.379> equal<00:04:00.769> negative<00:04:00.949> 10<00:04:01.340> so

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
and six does not equal negative 10 so

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.210 
and six does not equal negative 10 so
this<00:04:01.669> does<00:04:01.879> not<00:04:02.060> check<00:04:02.510> out<00:04:02.780> so<00:04:03.590> our<00:04:03.620> answer<00:04:04.190> is

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
this does not check out so our answer is

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.169 
this does not check out so our answer is
going<00:04:04.340> to<00:04:04.489> be<00:04:04.549> choice<00:04:05.169> one
