00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
so what we have here is we have the

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.400 
so what we have here is we have the
mission<00:00:12.870> called<00:00:13.519> out-of-court<00:00:14.519> settlement

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
mission called out-of-court settlement

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.870 
mission called out-of-court settlement
and<00:00:16.410> what<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.710> do<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.949> get<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:17.640> call

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
and what you do to get this is you call

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.029 
and what you do to get this is you call
up<00:00:18.060> Martin<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.720> he<00:00:18.900> will<00:00:19.050> eventually<00:00:19.650> send<00:00:19.859> it

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
up Martin and he will eventually send it

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.160 
up Martin and he will eventually send it
to<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.279> when<00:00:21.210> you're<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.390> lower<00:00:21.660> mission<00:00:22.020> it's

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
to you when you're a lower mission it's

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.599 
to you when you're a lower mission it's
easier<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.560> get<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.949> mean<00:00:23.220> when<00:00:23.340> you're<00:00:23.460> lower

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
easier to get I mean when you're lower

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.009 
easier to get I mean when you're lower

level it's easier to get when you're a

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.689 
level it's easier to get when you're a
higher<00:00:25.199> level<00:00:25.529> it's<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.830> bit<00:00:26.070> trickier<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.460> get

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
higher level it's a bit trickier to get

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.210 
higher level it's a bit trickier to get
but<00:00:26.939> after<00:00:27.660> one<00:00:27.840> or<00:00:27.869> two<00:00:28.050> time<00:00:28.349> or<00:00:28.650> after<00:00:28.920> two

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.039 
like this what happened this time it's a
lot<00:01:32.939> easier<00:01:33.270> when<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.450> have<00:01:33.540> another<00:01:33.810> person

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
lot easier when you have another person

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.350 
lot easier when you have another person
with<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.729> you<00:01:35.729> will<00:01:35.850> probably<00:01:36.030> kill<00:01:36.329> him

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
with you you will probably kill him

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.330 
with you you will probably kill him
right<00:01:36.630> then<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:36.960> there<00:01:37.020> but<00:01:37.710> if<00:01:37.829> he<00:01:37.920> gets<00:01:38.100> away

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
right then and there but if he gets away

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.890 
right then and there but if he gets away
no<00:01:38.520> big<00:01:38.700> deal<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:38.909> chase<00:01:39.299> him<00:01:39.479> down<00:01:39.630> you

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
no big deal just chase him down you

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.240 
no big deal just chase him down you
should<00:01:40.079> be<00:01:40.200> able<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.409> catch<00:01:40.650> them<00:01:40.860> as<00:01:40.950> long<00:01:41.130> as

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
should be able to catch them as long as

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.600 
should be able to catch them as long as
you're<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.490> decent<00:01:41.880> car<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.680> I<00:01:43.680> mean<00:01:44.070> it's<00:01:44.460> a

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
you're in a decent car and I mean it's a

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.600 
you're in a decent car and I mean it's a
little<00:01:44.880> hard<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.380> aim<00:01:46.380> while<00:01:46.890> driving<00:01:47.310> and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
little hard to aim while driving and

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.450 
little hard to aim while driving and
shoot<00:01:47.820> while<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.329> gta5<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:50.100> shouldn't<00:01:50.399> be

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
shoot while in gta5 but it shouldn't be

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.889 
shoot while in gta5 but it shouldn't be
too<00:01:50.640> bad<00:01:50.670> if<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.970> kind<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.240> stay<00:01:51.420> behind<00:01:51.600> them

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
too bad if you kind of stay behind them

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.020 
too bad if you kind of stay behind them
you<00:01:52.020> can<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.380> kind<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.710> do<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:53.670> with<00:01:53.880> your

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030

you can just kind of do this with your
gun<00:01:54.180> there<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.930> make<00:01:55.380> sure<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.619> have<00:01:55.710> an<00:01:55.860> auto

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
SMG equipped so you'll eventually you'll

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.350

take<00:01:59.549> them<00:01:59.640> out<00:01:59.759> like<00:01:59.880> that

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
take them out like that

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.539 
take them out like that

stoplights he will drop the briefcase

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.050 
stoplights he will drop the briefcase
right<00:02:03.930> on<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.500> car<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:05.369> you'll<00:02:05.579> have<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.850> enter

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
right on the car so you'll have to enter

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.639 
right on the car so you'll have to enter
the<00:02:06.180> car<00:02:06.360> through<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.630> passenger<00:02:07.200> side<00:02:07.380> door

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
the car through the passenger side door

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.320 
the car through the passenger side door
but<00:02:07.950> here<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.459> briefcase<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.149> need<00:02:09.270> to

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
pick up to complete the emission is a

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.470 
pick up to complete the emission is a
little<00:02:12.300> further<00:02:12.510> down<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.930> road

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
little further down the road

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.600 
little further down the road
so<00:02:14.349> once<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.620> have<00:02:14.709> this<00:02:14.920> car<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:15.370> will<00:02:15.459> get

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
to do is quickly lose the cops it

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.119 
to do is quickly lose the cops it
shouldn't<00:02:23.110> take<00:02:23.140> long<00:02:23.260> at<00:02:23.590> all<00:02:23.680> it's<00:02:23.860> only<00:02:23.950> a

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
shouldn't take long at all it's only a

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.390 
shouldn't take long at all it's only a
one-star<00:02:24.640> rating<00:02:24.970> as<00:02:25.239> you<00:02:25.420> can<00:02:25.599> see<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.470> I
