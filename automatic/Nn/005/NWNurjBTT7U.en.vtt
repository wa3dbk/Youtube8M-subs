 I imitate worse 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.010
 and at that time I remember 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.590
 riled up 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.590

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.080
 stayed three months away from home 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.080

 at 24 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.149
 he emerged 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:21.369
 the promoter of the idea 

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:22.939
 who has an eye 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.089
 that's how it came about 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:26.119
 before you even learn 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:30.569
 from this day on and makes it impossible to come here 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.769
 was playing 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.399
 saulo is the worst month 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:41.409
 this time in March 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.039
 suddenly 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:46.129
 It was a big braga step. 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:47.589
 so suddenly 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:50.589
 we find here the three 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:56.839
 many that change 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:58.249
 extreme type 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:00.949

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:03.949
 hehehe this room 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.079
 and go to work at that time 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.659
 the most 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:16.699
 There's bleak piano music. 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:18.879
 score music 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.879

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:24.189
 of staff 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:26.489
 It was very successful 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.699
 At that time 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:31.109
 atelier and also not 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.399
 carlos de carvalho was this 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:35.779
 the first time 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:37.539
 in search of Portuguese food 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:39.759
 the third question 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:40.989
 Certainly 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.429
 for personal savings 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:45.379
 a little told 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.319
 in block 5 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.369
 It's not that we're going to stop. 

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:52.659
 I was thinking now 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:55.659
 download new dress up ideas 

00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:59.449
 were preserved 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.449
 lm 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:06.439
 the incentive 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:08.029
 which was very serious 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:11.029
 Hehehe 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:18.599
 there is a lot more 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:22.049
 a master class 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.049
 I did not mention this to a classic disease. 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.729
 usually do not 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.729
 Look at the euros there. 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.840
 what the process 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.629
 it's laborious once 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:39.939
 this is usually good 

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:42.939
 a fitch master class 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:47.879
 it is the sum of the experiences 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:50.879
 the show brings so much more 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.210
 the amount of money 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.210
 six months later 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:03.879
 the teacher can 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:12.580
 A little better 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.919
 the teacher 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.110
 so he was not stuck here to order 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.999
 were several 

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:21.919
 shoulder weight 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.020
 work with this idea in the 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.400
 if you work 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.050
 a generation 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.050
 your Turkish team 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.379
 so that he wants 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:37.319
 misshapen 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:40.319
 This is not just here. 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:44.159
 The proof that I make 

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:47.960
 the bald port 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.960
 the landing with the saturation where I go 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.139
 and it's beautiful here we'll have peace 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:03.110
 until this week for the sector 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.439
 I do not know that those who already had 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:10.229
 pictures and that it enters the field soaked do thousand 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:13.949
 postgraduate studies 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:15.580
 tonello so the camera does what 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.809
 in valparaiso 

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:19.809
 or participatory 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:23.479
 sometimes they are things 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:27.539
 kaiserslautern 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:29.139
 until it's air 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:30.710
 I was calm 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.659
 often good things the idea 

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:36.810
 spent the week in search of work was something that happened like this 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:38.639
 a bit by chance 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:40.939
 and which then became established as the sea 

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:41.340
 an initiative
