00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.180
 the film is preparing you for the civil war 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.400
 President's visit this little video on demand today more than 5% 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:11.599
 Berlin 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:13.039
 the report to 2009 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.379
 ap before 2012 he stressed 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.369
 for example italy 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.539
 that your prepare olive 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.779
 the best 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.230
 yet the recipe for parmesan veal sauté 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.399
 we should already rather of course 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:28.789
 so for the person 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.789
 a kilo of two sautéed veal 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.600
 some juniper berries 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.440
 fresh bread 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.120
 from there they again a zucchini 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.270
 Parmesan cheese 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.510
 among regional youths from rouck 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.210
 thalassa it's very important because a text all the dish 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.550
 to his interest 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.260
 with frequent Parmesan cheese 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.720
 especially to mix at the last moment end of the month crushed at the last moment for 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.990
 customers all its taste because it is not a little fast parmesan 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.190
 and to bring a half we come we will use aces head and more I 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.620
 am 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.620
 so to start simply I cut 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.940
 brush - 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.940
 some of the let go too much of this board who are fed up 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.610
 marseille remains that the dynamics that better 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.630
 step dacourt 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.660
 he also plans he must now play the game in the direction of the length 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.479
 closed since 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.840
 it is the ransom of about 20 centimeters 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.660
 for those who respect it at the end of cooking if 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.730
 we take 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.730
 the oranje does not recover some zest 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.290
 I will cut my orange but we will squeeze the juice half an hour in a cat 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.070
 is enough because otherwise 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.179
 in fact too much to fix it would take too much time so if we also need 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:51.420
 that's where the fees are 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.370
 of mouth 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.850
 too expensive 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.390
 people like that 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.390
 you have to crush with a fork 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.069
 afp and so we will simmer in the same plane 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:08.279
 because of cold in Provence 

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:10.509
 a little dry and a little pinball 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.879
 so it's the maquis 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.949
 we have perfectly with this dish what 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:17.949
 so for the second step we will start to make many other dishes 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:22.909
 so we'll take a jumper we put about tells me it's a small one 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:23.859
 olive 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:26.859
 first and bring my euro zone 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:31.670
 so we make the onions come back
