squares and kind of turns in certain

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.679 
squares and kind of turns in certain
patterns<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.939> make<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.180> does<00:00:24.359> some<00:00:24.510> cool

stuff<00:00:24.930> I'll<00:00:25.619> explain<00:00:25.920> how<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.279> one<00:00:26.490> moves<00:00:26.730> in

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
stuff I'll explain how this one moves in

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.950 
stuff I'll explain how this one moves in
detail<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.330> hopefully<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.779> guys<00:00:27.900> will

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
detail and hopefully you guys will

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.380 
detail and hopefully you guys will
understand<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.619> but<00:00:28.970> Lincoln<00:00:29.970> Cent<00:00:30.210> was

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
understand it but Lincoln Cent was

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.510 
understand it but Lincoln Cent was
originally<00:00:30.990> made<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:31.380> two<00:00:31.859> dimensions<00:00:32.340> and

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
originally made in two dimensions and

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.299 
originally made in two dimensions and
I'm<00:00:32.850> sure<00:00:33.090> there's<00:00:33.300> 3d<00:00:33.600> versions<00:00:33.960> already<00:00:34.309> but

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
I'm sure there's 3d versions already but

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.850 
I'm sure there's 3d versions already but
as<00:00:35.489> long<00:00:35.850> as<00:00:35.880> mine<00:00:36.120> cross<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.510> 3d<00:00:36.809> game<00:00:37.020> kind

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
as long as mine cross the 3d game kind

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.170 
as long as mine cross the 3d game kind
of<00:00:37.950> thought<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.129> myself<00:00:38.219> why<00:00:38.640> not<00:00:38.670> try<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:38.969> make

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
of thought to myself why not try to make

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.410 
of thought to myself why not try to make
links<00:00:39.450> inside<00:00:39.690> 3d<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.790> well<00:00:41.790> that's<00:00:42.180> what

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
links inside 3d and the well that's what

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.139 
links inside 3d and the well that's what
I<00:00:42.450> got<00:00:42.600> for<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.870> today<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.140> let's<00:00:44.129> watch<00:00:47.149> and

there he goes so Lincoln's aunt is um
and<00:00:51.930> then<00:00:52.710> he<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.039> can't<00:00:53.250> see<00:00:53.399> him<00:00:53.489> right<00:00:53.610> now

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
I'm using a wither skull for the aunt of

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.540 
I'm using a wither skull for the aunt of
just<00:00:56.520> moving<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.879> around<00:00:57.800> but<00:00:58.800> what<00:00:59.219> happens

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
just moving it around but what happens

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.590 
just moving it around but what happens
is<00:00:59.730> I<00:01:00.109> assigned<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.410> value<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.879> each<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.420> six

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
is I assigned a value to each of the six

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.109 
is I assigned a value to each of the six
directions<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.500> by<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.369> six<00:01:05.610> directions<00:01:05.760> I

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
directions and by the six directions I

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.789 
directions and by the six directions I
just<00:01:06.299> mean<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:06.600> up<00:01:06.780> down<00:01:07.080> left<00:01:07.619> right

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
just mean like up down left right

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.140 
just mean like up down left right
forward<00:01:08.159> backwards<00:01:09.080> and<00:01:11.060> there's<00:01:12.060> a

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
forward backwards and there's a

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.840 
forward backwards and there's a
scoreboard<00:01:12.479> value<00:01:13.159> for<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> wither<00:01:14.549> skull

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
scoreboard value for the wither skull

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.120 
scoreboard value for the wither skull
that<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.259> contains<00:01:16.259> number<00:01:16.530> one<00:01:16.680> through<00:01:16.890> six

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
that can contains number one through six

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.670 
that can contains number one through six
and<00:01:17.659> each<00:01:18.659> one<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.229> those<00:01:19.320> numbers

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
and each one of those numbers

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.070 
and each one of those numbers
respectively<00:01:20.210> refers<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.240> one<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.659> those<00:01:21.810> six

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
respectively refers to one of those six

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.760 
respectively refers to one of those six
directions<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.090> what<00:01:24.090> happens<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.770> Lincoln's

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
directions and what happens is Lincoln's

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.090 
directions and what happens is Lincoln's
aunt<00:01:25.979> moves<00:01:26.400> will<00:01:26.909> move<00:01:27.090> forward<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.720> if<00:01:28.680> he's

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
aunt moves will move forward and if he's

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.609 
aunt moves will move forward and if he's
on<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:30.210> white<00:01:31.400> or<00:01:32.400> an<00:01:32.640> air<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.119> if<00:01:33.990> he's<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.470> an

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
on a white or an air and if he's in an

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.969 
on a white or an air and if he's in an
air<00:01:34.799> block<00:01:35.009> he'll<00:01:35.820> increment<00:01:36.570> his<00:01:36.979> Direction

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
air block he'll increment his Direction

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.859 
air block he'll increment his Direction
score<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.909> let's<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.360> say<00:01:39.450> he's<00:01:39.570> moving

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
score so let's just say he's moving

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.569 
score so let's just say he's moving
forward<00:01:40.170> let's<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:40.740> say<00:01:40.829> that's<00:01:40.950> like<00:01:41.220> has<00:01:41.549> a

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
forward let's just say that's like has a

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.490 
forward let's just say that's like has a
value<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.000> three<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.600> then<00:01:43.110> let's<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.380> say

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
value of three and then let's just say

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.960 
value of three and then let's just say
moving<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.979> right<00:01:44.070> has<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> value<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.670> four

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
moving to the right has a value of four

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.060 
moving to the right has a value of four
then<00:01:45.329> now<00:01:45.960> he'll<00:01:46.200> start<00:01:46.320> moving<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.920> right

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
then now he'll start moving to the right

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.639 
then now he'll start moving to the right
instead<00:01:47.659> but<00:01:48.659> if<00:01:48.750> he<00:01:48.840> lands<00:01:48.990> on<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.200> wool<00:01:49.439> block

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
instead but if he lands on a wool block

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.030 
instead but if he lands on a wool block
or<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.979> red<00:01:50.220> wool<00:01:50.399> block<00:01:50.930> instead<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.040> turning

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
or a red wool block instead of turning

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.170 
or a red wool block instead of turning
to<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.250> right<00:01:53.340> he'll<00:01:53.490> just<00:01:53.640> keep<00:01:53.850> moving

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
to the right he'll just keep moving

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.539 
to the right he'll just keep moving
forward<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.780> then<00:01:55.560> secondly<00:01:55.979> after<00:01:56.369> he

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
forward and then secondly after he

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.740 
forward and then secondly after he
leaves<00:01:56.729> each<00:01:57.740> Q<00:01:58.740> or<00:01:59.040> block<00:01:59.549> he'll<00:01:59.969> switch<00:02:00.509> it

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
leaves each Q or block he'll switch it

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.929 
leaves each Q or block he'll switch it
from<00:02:01.049> air<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.680> wool<00:02:01.890> or<00:02:02.130> wall<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.790> air

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
from air to wool or wall to air

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.270 
from air to wool or wall to air
depending<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.540> what<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.750> was<00:02:03.869> before<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.500> yeah

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
depending on what it was before so yeah

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.440 
depending on what it was before so yeah
there<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.520> go<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:05.850> he<00:02:05.939> just<00:02:06.090> kind<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.299> runs

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
there you go so he just kind of runs

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.740 
there you go so he just kind of runs
around<00:02:07.759> so<00:02:08.759> some<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.090> may<00:02:09.239> be<00:02:09.300> wondering

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
around so some you may be wondering

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.580 
around so some you may be wondering
what's

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
what's

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.770 
what's
the<00:02:10.950> point<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.310> really<00:02:11.569> LinkedIn<00:02:12.569> scent

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
the point of this really LinkedIn scent

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.390 
the point of this really LinkedIn scent
was<00:02:12.900> originally<00:02:13.380> made<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.590> prove<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.160> point

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
was originally made to prove the point

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.150 
was originally made to prove the point
that<00:02:14.550> complexity<00:02:15.330> can<00:02:15.630> come<00:02:16.410> from<00:02:16.620> simple

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
that complexity can come from simple

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.309 
that complexity can come from simple
rules<00:02:17.400> so<00:02:17.880> I<00:02:18.330> have<00:02:18.599> just<00:02:18.900> pretty<00:02:19.200> much

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
rules so I have just pretty much

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.550 
rules so I have just pretty much
described<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.860> rules<00:02:20.069> already<00:02:20.459> he<00:02:20.760> has<00:02:20.910> just

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
described the rules already he has just

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.870 
described the rules already he has just
value<00:02:22.560> storing<00:02:22.890> his<00:02:23.010> direction<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.730> gets

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
value storing his direction and it gets

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.059 
value storing his direction and it gets
incremented<00:02:24.150> when<00:02:24.599> he's<00:02:24.690> in<00:02:24.870> air<00:02:25.230> stays<00:02:25.920> the

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
incremented when he's in air stays the

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.440 
incremented when he's in air stays the
same<00:02:26.130> when<00:02:26.400> he's<00:02:26.550> on<00:02:26.700> wool<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.030> then<00:02:27.330> he

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
same when he's on wool and then he

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.670 
same when he's on wool and then he
switches<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.930> block<00:02:28.050> when<00:02:28.200> he<00:02:28.230> leaves<00:02:28.440> so

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
switches to the block when he leaves so

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.800 
switches to the block when he leaves so
I'll<00:02:29.610> come<00:02:29.760> back<00:02:29.880> in<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.120> bit<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.780> should

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
I'll come back in a bit and you should

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.930 
I'll come back in a bit and you should
be<00:02:31.080> able<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.260> see<00:02:31.440> some<00:02:31.650> pretty<00:02:32.310> neat<00:02:32.550> patterns

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
be able to see some pretty neat patterns

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.680 
be able to see some pretty neat patterns
that<00:02:33.120> arise<00:02:33.360> in<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.660> shape<00:02:33.870> he<00:02:34.019> makes<00:02:34.230> and

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
that arise in the shape he makes and

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.949 
that arise in the shape he makes and
there<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.810> go<00:02:36.989> so<00:02:37.819> it's<00:02:38.819> fin<00:02:39.060> it's<00:02:39.330> moved

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
there you go so it's fin it's moved

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.290 
there you go so it's fin it's moved
about<00:02:40.230> 3,000<00:02:40.980> times<00:02:41.190> now<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.760> there's<00:02:42.239> a

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
about 3,000 times now and there's a

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.440 
about 3,000 times now and there's a
pretty<00:02:42.720> obvious<00:02:42.900> pattern<00:02:43.530> forming<00:02:43.860> here<00:02:44.450> so

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
pretty obvious pattern forming here so

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.539 
pretty obvious pattern forming here so
this<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.690> called<00:02:45.870> high-wing<00:02:46.350> if<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:47.130> remember

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
this is called high-wing if you remember

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.630 
this is called high-wing if you remember
from<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.970> first<00:02:48.000> Lincoln<00:02:48.810> Cent<00:02:48.989> video<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.319> made

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
from the first Lincoln Cent video I made

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.789 
from the first Lincoln Cent video I made
it's<00:02:50.640> basically<00:02:51.209> we're<00:02:51.510> out<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:52.019> this<00:02:52.200> big

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
it's basically we're out of this big

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.460 
it's basically we're out of this big
random<00:02:53.160> clump<00:02:53.610> up<00:02:53.760> here<00:02:54.060> at<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.900> ant<00:02:55.049> manages

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
random clump up here at the ant manages

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.860 
random clump up here at the ant manages
to<00:02:55.590> get<00:02:55.680> into<00:02:55.860> a<00:02:55.890> pattern<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.870> infinite

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
to get into a pattern of infinite

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.559 
to get into a pattern of infinite
repetition<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.650> in<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.970> end<00:03:00.090> he<00:03:00.209> just<00:03:00.239> ends

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
repetition and in the end he just ends

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.050 
repetition and in the end he just ends
up<00:03:00.630> moving<00:03:01.019> off<00:03:01.170> in<00:03:01.380> one<00:03:01.530> direction<00:03:02.060> pretty

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
up moving off in one direction pretty

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.539 
up moving off in one direction pretty
much<00:03:03.209> forever<00:03:03.860> it's<00:03:04.860> kind<00:03:05.010> of<00:03:05.069> cool<00:03:05.220> that<00:03:05.370> he's

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
much forever it's kind of cool that he's

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.100 
much forever it's kind of cool that he's
actually<00:03:05.730> moving<00:03:06.060> in<00:03:06.299> all<00:03:06.480> three<00:03:06.930> directions

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
actually moving in all three directions

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.390 
actually moving in all three directions
to<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.690> site<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:10.019> both<00:03:10.170> sides<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:10.860> downwards

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
to the site to both sides and downwards

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.810 
to the site to both sides and downwards
diagonally<00:03:12.860> so<00:03:13.860> yeah<00:03:13.980> there<00:03:14.250> we<00:03:14.370> go<00:03:14.519> that's

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
diagonally so yeah there we go that's

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.849 
diagonally so yeah there we go that's
lengthens<00:03:15.780> in<00:03:15.900> 3d<00:03:17.780> then<00:03:18.780> I'll<00:03:19.140> just<00:03:19.350> give<00:03:19.829> a

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
lengthens in 3d then I'll just give a

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.430 
lengthens in 3d then I'll just give a
really<00:03:20.519> brief<00:03:20.880> run<00:03:21.690> through<00:03:21.720> all<00:03:22.049> these<00:03:22.230> so

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
really brief run through all these so

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.039 
really brief run through all these so
this<00:03:22.530> is<00:03:22.709> pretty<00:03:22.859> much<00:03:23.540> what<00:03:24.540> just<00:03:24.750> moves<00:03:24.959> the

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
this is pretty much what just moves the

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.259 
this is pretty much what just moves the
app<00:03:25.230> based<00:03:25.470> on<00:03:25.650> its<00:03:25.799> direction<00:03:26.310> yeah<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.060> can

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
app based on its direction yeah you can

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.840 
app based on its direction yeah you can
see<00:03:27.420> I<00:03:27.450> have<00:03:27.630> all<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:27.870> directions<00:03:28.140> here<00:03:28.850> this

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
see I have all the directions here this

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.000 
see I have all the directions here this
just<00:03:30.090> stops<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.930> score<00:03:31.380> from<00:03:31.530> going<00:03:31.829> to

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
just stops the score from going to

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.170 
just stops the score from going to
either<00:03:32.130> 7<00:03:32.579> or<00:03:32.609> 0

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
either 7 or 0

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.770 
either 7 or 0
keeps<00:03:33.420> it<00:03:33.600> 1<00:03:33.750> through<00:03:33.930> 6<00:03:35.269> here<00:03:36.269> we<00:03:36.390> have<00:03:36.540> what

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
keeps it 1 through 6 here we have what

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.620 
keeps it 1 through 6 here we have what
tests<00:03:37.260> for<00:03:37.500> just<00:03:38.100> for<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:38.850> wool<00:03:39.030> this<00:03:39.299> tests

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
tests for just for the wool this tests

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.009 
tests for just for the wool this tests
for<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.870> air<00:03:41.000> this<00:03:42.000> swaps<00:03:42.389> the<00:03:42.600> air<00:03:42.750> in<00:03:42.900> the

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
for the air this swaps the air in the

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.680 
for the air this swaps the air in the
wool<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.410> then<00:03:44.069> this<00:03:44.370> is<00:03:44.549> what<00:03:44.730> adds<00:03:44.940> one<00:03:45.480> to

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
wool and then this is what adds one to

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.699 
wool and then this is what adds one to
the<00:03:45.780> direction<00:03:46.260> if<00:03:46.470> it<00:03:47.310> is<00:03:47.730> on<00:03:48.329> it<00:03:49.290> fits<00:03:49.530> in

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
the direction if it is on it fits in

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.530 
the direction if it is on it fits in
here<00:03:49.859> so<00:03:50.489> yeah<00:03:50.639> there<00:03:51.000> you<00:03:51.060> go<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.359> then<00:03:51.450> the

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
here so yeah there you go and then the
