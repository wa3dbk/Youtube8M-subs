00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello and welcome tsum 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.990
 unboxing samsung galaxy alpha a very 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.750
 thankfully beautiful smartphone 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:14.309
 provided by cyberport de 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.410
 currently costs 539 euros 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.330
 and what you get for that experience 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.660
 you stay in the next few seconds 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.660
 tuned 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.660
 the internal name is smg 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.210
 850 it again the letters sm 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.100
 no idea what samsung tell me 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.690
 the packaging wants no new here 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.010
 bamboo design more but rather 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.530
 kept simpler 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.989
 of course, fully recyclable that means everyone 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.850
 materials are already somewhere else 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.160
 been used fortunately 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.840
 but not the smartphone 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.910
 galaxy alpha I put that first now 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.920
 here to the side and we throw one 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.300
 look in the packaging 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.620
 First of all there are diverse 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.539
 We also talked about short instructions 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.680
 can understand and even one 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.229
 Note that you can get from each other 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.739
 device will switch to samsung very fast 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.869
 can 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.140
 Next comes the battery 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.030
 with only 1860 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.000
 milliard hours that sounds like everyone 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.100
 fall first after very little further 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.720
 of course the charging data cable here too 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.700
 again in white exactly as you would by 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.189
 knows other Samsung devices 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.820
 of course with matching 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.320
 charger in white in ear headset with 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.409
 hookswitch button and above all 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.409
 loud soft key and of course 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.799
 still the matching plugs so that's her 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.170
 adjust the whole size to your ears 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.759
 So in the meantime, I have 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.860
 of course we cleaned up, we also see here 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.780
 again a screen protector with a lot 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.100
 expression but little sense because you can 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.990
 already recognize these is here too 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.149
 dyed black so that you get the device 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.630
 so of course do not use at all 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.520
 can 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.960
 this then applies in a similar form 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.030
 Of course, for the back too 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.820
 Here's a foil we remove it 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.740
 the precious battery cover on the spot 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.149
 In any case, no scratch airline 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.430
 we have to open it and above all 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.190
 things also insert the battery 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.140
 The battery itself is really great 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.660
 but thin rubberized for it lies well in 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.450
 But the hand should be thinner in it 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.860
 do not say otherwise you have 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.720
 namely the problem that soon no 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.310
 rubber is more there what you still in the 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.080
 finger can take advantage of that 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.030
 probably too fast then too 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.680
 Of course, the last one was sarcasm 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.330
 not that you misunderstand us 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.910
 see here see especially the opening 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.590
 we are also the inset for a nano 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.210
 very important here in the place nano 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.280
 sinks a micro-sim as in the galaxy 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.350
 note 4 and above all, no 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.110
 a push for a memory card her 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.620
 So you have with the internal memory 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.030
 take preference 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.490
 I just have that one now 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.940
 battery cover inserted and celebrate that 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.980
 On clicks of the acute lid one should 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.270
 Keep them solid at all times 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.230
 on it so that really no press 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.180
 column are left 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.130
 and that's the device already 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.230
 ready for use my little unboxing 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.460
 I want to with the technical details 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.750
 bn we have a display with a 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:04.580
 diagonal of 4.7 inches resolution 720 x 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.770
 Of course, 1280 pixels would be synonymous again 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.290
 the touch id sensor with which i use that 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.450
 device lock can be an optic place cpu 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.620
 from home samsung with 1 8 gigahertz 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:18.880
 maximum 2 gb ram 32 gb internal memory 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.630
 not expandable battery 1860 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.180
 milliampere already in one 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.860
 super shapely housing with a 12 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.630
 megapixel camera the 4k videos 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.000
 of course, record impulse again 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.650
 sensor and led and I think so 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.240
 a whole lot and if you are curious 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.920
 you have become like the want to test 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.230
 how the device struck in the test 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.150
 yes, you just have to have one 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.640
 wait a bit pictures and co there are 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.860
 on my website mobile - reviews de 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.090
 if you like the little unboxing 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.760
 Of course I am happy about that 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.440
 your thumbs up under likes otherwise 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.520
