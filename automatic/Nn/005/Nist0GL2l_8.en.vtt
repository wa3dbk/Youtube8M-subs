00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.530
 if imitate something better 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.269
 this principle was guided 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.160
 lifan designers creating their first 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.740
 x60 crossover 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.240
 profiles he reminds toyota rav4 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.900
 second generation with the only difference 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.340
 that the wheel arches have Chinese 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.740
 disproportionately huge from there 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.060
 the salon will be heard 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.099
 aerodynamic noise and regular 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.969
 the wheels look not quite in them 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.989
 organically most of the central 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.940
 massive front air intake 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.949
 bumper covered with plastic to 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.379
 avoid water ingress 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.089
 obstacles tail lights are made in 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.019
 rectangular trapezoid shape with 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:48.659
 LEDs 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:50.640
 tailgate massive open and 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.589
 it's not easy for a man to close 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.289
 gas stops do not give it quickly 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:57.929
 rise and to lower it you need 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.819
 properly press the salon light as 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:02.219
 like the Chinese people yes I am not an expensive skin 

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:04.710
 young dermantina gets very hot 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.149
 summer plastic hard fitting parts 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.090
 on four 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:11.340
 trunk volume is not impressive just 400 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.310
 5 liters due to installation under 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.960
 full size spare wheel front 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.149
 the chair lacks height adjustment 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.520
 but the geometry of the pillows and back 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.280
 did not disappoint in the long road back and 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.500
 legs almost never get tired rear backs 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.210
 seats folded in the proportion of 40 to 60 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.759
 and tilt adjustable 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.799
 this is an unconditional plus minus mechanism 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.570
 tilting the back of the right seat in 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.399
 As a result, the back did not fold out. 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.229
 flush with the back of the left seat 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.909
 dashboard pretty modern 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.060
 digital speedometer 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.710
 center console three-tier top 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.049
 there is a radio tape recorder which can 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.759
 play mp3 as from disk so from 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.429
 flash drives nice bonus 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.830
 gasoline unit volume of 1 8 liters 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:55.290
 132 horsepower 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.360
 he got the model they inherit from rav4 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.710
 despite the fact that the hood has noise 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.840
 insulation pad 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.060
 the roar of the engine reaches even into the salon 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.160
 low revs when driving in a straight line 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.380
 declared power is more than enough 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.869
 and the motor is not bad pulls already from low 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.850
 rpm but on long climbs and on 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.390
 easy off-road feels that 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.820
 horses 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.810
 Yes, and all-wheel drive car clearly 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.850
 is missing 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.620
 not enough clarity in switching 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.860
 gear boxes and the gears themselves 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.510
 especially 2 3 long brake pedal 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.770
 the crossover works with a small 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.560
 failure to start 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.330
 there are strangeness at the accelerator pedal 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.610
 already releasing her you may notice that 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.780
 the motor continues to roar for a few seconds 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.540
 gaining momentum 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.380
 18 cm ground clearance and suspension for 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.450
 our roads 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.610
 roll in corners of the car though 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.190
 impressive but rear multilever 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.380
 confidently swallows potholes steering 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.560
 control is not bad but strata and reverse 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.260
 there is not enough connection in city mode x60 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.300
 consumes about 10 11 liters per 100 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.590
 kilometers on the highway when driving with 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.980
 80 speed 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.019
 about eight whether the car is worth 17 s 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.209
 half a thousand dollars for her 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.820
 asking in Ukraine for this amount can not 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.310
 buy even naked not a star and even more 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.670
 chevrolet niva equipment poor 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.110
 more expensive whereas lifan x60 is offered 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.930
 in Ukraine with two airbags 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.360
 and systems and ps plus and bidet 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:23.060
 but chevrolet niva has all-wheel drive 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.060
 conclusion all depends on the need
