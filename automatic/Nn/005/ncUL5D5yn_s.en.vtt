with<00:00:09.059> this<00:00:09.420> little<00:00:09.559> plug<00:00:10.559> I'm<00:00:10.800> assuming<00:00:11.280> it's

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
with this little plug I'm assuming it's

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.520 
with this little plug I'm assuming it's
for<00:00:12.269> people<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:12.780> are<00:00:12.900> in<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.139> UK<00:00:13.500> or

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
for people that are in the UK or

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.680 
for people that are in the UK or
something<00:00:14.130> all<00:00:14.429> right<00:00:14.790> now<00:00:14.969> would<00:00:15.120> plug<00:00:15.540> this

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
something all right now would plug this

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.390 
something all right now would plug this
is<00:00:15.900> for<00:00:16.139> which<00:00:16.230> country<00:00:16.650> so<00:00:16.890> we'll<00:00:17.070> throw<00:00:17.220> that

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
is for which country so we'll throw that

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.090 
is for which country so we'll throw that
away<00:00:17.460> it<00:00:18.000> also<00:00:18.150> gives<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.690> car<00:00:19.199> charger<00:00:19.230> you

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
away it also gives you a car charger you

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.490 
away it also gives you a car charger you
just<00:00:20.250> plug<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.609> right<00:00:20.640> into<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.150> top<00:00:21.500> right

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
just plug it right into the top right

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.390 
just plug it right into the top right
there<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.310> then<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:25.140> got<00:00:25.350> your<00:00:25.590> wall<00:00:25.980> charger

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
there and then you got your wall charger

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.670 
there and then you got your wall charger
on<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.699> back<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.300> it's<00:00:28.170> just<00:00:28.349> your<00:00:28.470> standard

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
on the back and it's just your standard

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.070 
on the back and it's just your standard
wall<00:00:29.460> charger<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.150> mean<00:00:30.390> nothing<00:00:30.779> special

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
wall charger I mean nothing special

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.720 
wall charger I mean nothing special
really<00:00:31.759> but<00:00:32.780> when<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.809> do<00:00:34.140> plug<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.250> GoPro

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
really but when you do plug in the GoPro

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.630 
really but when you do plug in the GoPro
battery<00:00:36.149> into<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> bit<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.399> loose

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
battery into it it is a bit of a loose

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.360 
battery into it it is a bit of a loose
fit<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.210> mean<00:00:39.450> they<00:00:40.200> can<00:00:40.350> fall<00:00:40.620> out<00:00:40.649> if<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.129> tilt

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
fit I mean they can fall out if you tilt

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.630 
fit I mean they can fall out if you tilt
it<00:00:41.520> sideways<00:00:42.050> so<00:00:43.160> you<00:00:44.160> just<00:00:44.190> want<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.520> make

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
it sideways so you just want to make

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.069 
it sideways so you just want to make
sure<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:45.090> when<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.360> put<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.629> into<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.840> wall

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
sure that when you put it into the wall

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.440 
sure that when you put it into the wall
that<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.829> know<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.879> just<00:00:47.969> keep<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.329> up

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
that you know you just keep it up

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.939 
that you know you just keep it up
straight<00:00:48.860> but<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.960> wasabi<00:00:51.960> batteries<00:00:52.410> are

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
straight but the wasabi batteries are

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.639 
straight but the wasabi batteries are
much<00:00:53.280> better<00:00:53.520> fit<00:00:53.820> actually<00:00:54.329> click<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.780> they

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
much better fit actually click in they

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.400 
much better fit actually click in they
stay<00:00:55.949> there<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.360> so<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:58.020> like<00:00:58.170> with<00:00:58.289> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
stay there and so just like with the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.790 
stay there and so just like with the
charger<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.250> GoPro<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.910> going<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.930> GoPro

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
charger the GoPro is going to the GoPro

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.369 
charger the GoPro is going to the GoPro
battery<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.309> going<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.609> have<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:03.090> looser<00:01:04.080> fit

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
battery is going to have a looser fit

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.390 
battery is going to have a looser fit
and<00:01:05.270> the<00:01:06.350> GoPro<00:01:07.350> itself<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.189> Black

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
and the GoPro itself this the Black

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.440 
and the GoPro itself this the Black
Edition<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.890> put<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.189> there<00:01:11.430> goes<00:01:12.240> in

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
Edition and so you put in there goes in

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.870 
Edition and so you put in there goes in
there<00:01:12.600> smoothly<00:01:13.130> you<00:01:14.130> take<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.400> out<00:01:14.610> by<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
there smoothly you take it out by the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.190 
there smoothly you take it out by the
adhesive<00:01:15.420> strip<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.130> then<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:18.600> wasabi<00:01:18.840> power

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
adhesive strip and then the wasabi power

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.440 
adhesive strip and then the wasabi power
I<00:01:19.560> mean<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:20.520> definitely<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.780> tighter<00:01:21.990> fit<00:01:22.140> and

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
I mean it's definitely a tighter fit and

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.480 
I mean it's definitely a tighter fit and
when<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.570> pull<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.930> up<00:01:25.130> sometimes<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
when you pull it up sometimes the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.310 
when you pull it up sometimes the
adhesive<00:01:27.500> strip<00:01:28.500> right<00:01:28.710> here<00:01:29.060> sometimes<00:01:30.320> it

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
adhesive strip right here sometimes it

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.679 
adhesive strip right here sometimes it
will<00:01:31.380> do<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.070> you'll<00:01:32.970> get<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.180> little<00:01:33.479> gap

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
will do that and you'll get a little gap

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.719 
will do that and you'll get a little gap
I<00:01:34.020> mean<00:01:34.259> it's<00:01:34.470> pretty<00:01:34.710> much<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.860> same<00:01:35.280> build

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
I mean it's pretty much the same build

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.410 
I mean it's pretty much the same build
as<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.240> GoPro<00:01:36.659> battery<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.460> I<00:01:38.460> mean<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
as the GoPro battery and I mean the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.929 
as the GoPro battery and I mean the
specs<00:01:39.750> are<00:01:39.960> pretty<00:01:40.530> much<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.710> same<00:01:40.890> ones<00:01:41.640> not

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
specs are pretty much the same ones not

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.109 
specs are pretty much the same ones not
really<00:01:42.210> gonna<00:01:42.329> last<00:01:42.630> outlast<00:01:43.590> each<00:01:43.799> other

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
really gonna last outlast each other

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.639 
really gonna last outlast each other
based<00:01:45.119> on<00:01:45.299> my<00:01:45.420> initial<00:01:45.840> tests<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.409> they<00:01:46.500> both

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
based on my initial tests and they both

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.399 
based on my initial tests and they both
last<00:01:46.979> about<00:01:47.310> an<00:01:48.119> hour<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.570> 30<00:01:48.780> minutes<00:01:49.079> at

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
last about an hour and 30 minutes at

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.069 
last about an hour and 30 minutes at
1080p<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.670> mean<00:01:51.390> pretty<00:01:51.570> much<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.930> higher

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
1080p and I mean pretty much the higher

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.639 
1080p and I mean pretty much the higher
they<00:01:52.259> go<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:53.070> less<00:01:53.430> battery<00:01:53.700> you'll<00:01:54.060> get<00:01:54.270> and

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
they go the less battery you'll get and

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.539 
they go the less battery you'll get and
the<00:01:55.649> lower<00:01:55.860> they<00:01:56.100> get<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.549> go<00:01:56.759> like<00:01:57.270> 480<00:01:57.810> then

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
the lower they get you go like 480 then

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.830 
the lower they get you go like 480 then
the<00:01:59.549> more<00:01:59.850> battery<00:02:00.840> life<00:02:00.899> will<00:02:01.229> get<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:02.840> on

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
the more battery life will get and so on

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.660 
the more battery life will get and so on
the<00:02:04.170> batteries<00:02:04.649> are<00:02:04.890> generally<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.460> same

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
the batteries are generally the same

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.410 
the batteries are generally the same
build<00:02:06.060> wise<00:02:06.270> but<00:02:06.810> one<00:02:07.049> thing<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.259> did<00:02:07.469> notice<00:02:07.500> is

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
build wise but one thing I did notice is

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.510 
build wise but one thing I did notice is
see<00:02:09.420> these<00:02:09.569> little<00:02:09.720> adhesive<00:02:09.959> strips<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:11.430> was

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
see these little adhesive strips it was

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.370 
see these little adhesive strips it was
all<00:02:11.670> your<00:02:11.700> power<00:02:12.060> one<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.480> them<00:02:12.599> I<00:02:12.750> got

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
all your power one of them I got

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.350 
all your power one of them I got
the<00:02:13.650> little<00:02:14.040> thing<00:02:14.310> tends<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:15.000> go<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.210> the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
the little thing tends to go to the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.440 
the little thing tends to go to the
right<00:02:15.540> go<00:02:15.840> pros<00:02:16.620> gave<00:02:16.860> us<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.190> left<00:02:17.450> but

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
right go pros gave us to the left but

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.480 
right go pros gave us to the left but
then<00:02:18.630> when<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.200> pull<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:19.590> my<00:02:19.740> other<00:02:19.950> wasabi

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
then when I pull in my other wasabi

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.510 
then when I pull in my other wasabi
parowan<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.450> gives<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.750> left<00:02:21.960> also<00:02:22.520> so

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
parowan it gives the left also so

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.390 
parowan it gives the left also so
nothing<00:02:24.180> really<00:02:24.210> I<00:02:24.930> mean<00:02:25.500> super<00:02:25.950> important
