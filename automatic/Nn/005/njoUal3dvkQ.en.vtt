up its plant milling it now looking at

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.190 
up its plant milling it now looking at
the<00:01:37.799> current<00:01:38.060> support<00:01:39.060> we<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.240> loan<00:01:40.020> fire

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
the current support we have loan fire

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.960 
the current support we have loan fire
blossoms<00:01:40.650> going<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.920> be<00:01:41.009> good<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.729> can<00:01:41.880> also

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
blossoms going to be good and I can also

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.870 
blossoms going to be good and I can also
see<00:01:42.270> Giga<00:01:42.540> plant<00:01:42.810> being<00:01:43.470> good<00:01:43.950> because<00:01:44.790> you

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
see Giga plant being good because you

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.380 
see Giga plant being good because you
can<00:01:44.909> check<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.540> shave<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.930> off<00:01:46.130> now<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.399> do

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
can check it and shave it off now I do

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.289 
can check it and shave it off now I do
like<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.079> holy<00:01:49.409> tree<00:01:49.790> just<00:01:50.790> because<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
like the holy tree just because of the

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.819 
like the holy tree just because of the
fact<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.869> do<00:01:52.079> get<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.350> floating<00:01:52.649> draw

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
fact that you do get the floating draw

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.520 
fact that you do get the floating draw
card<00:01:53.070> but<00:01:53.700> looking<00:01:54.600> forward<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:55.200> seeing<00:01:55.380> one

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
card but looking forward to seeing one

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.420 
card but looking forward to seeing one
of<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.680> support<00:01:56.009> we<00:01:56.100> get<00:01:56.189> with<00:01:56.340> this

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
of the support we get with this

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.130 
of the support we get with this
hopefully<00:01:56.939> loan<00:01:57.119> fire<00:01:57.329> comes<00:01:57.540> back<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.020> to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
hopefully loan fire comes back to to to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.620 
hopefully loan fire comes back to to to
make<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.380> archetype<00:01:58.770> all<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.759> better<00:01:59.909> but

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
make the archetype all the better but

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.510 
make the archetype all the better but
for<00:02:00.840> now<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.140> think<00:02:01.170> these<00:02:01.619> two<00:02:01.829> cards<00:02:02.159> could<00:02:02.369> be

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
for now I think these two cards could be

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.280 
for now I think these two cards could be
dangerous<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.329> I'm<00:02:03.869> definitely<00:02:04.049> looking

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
dangerous and I'm definitely looking

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.590 
dangerous and I'm definitely looking
forward<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.740> seeing<00:02:04.920> on<00:02:05.100> how<00:02:05.250> future<00:02:06.149> stuff

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
forward to seeing on how future stuff

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.510 
forward to seeing on how future stuff
and<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.320> know<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.680> next<00:02:07.770> two<00:02:08.009> or<00:02:08.039> three<00:02:08.160> sets

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
and you know the next two or three sets

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.240 
and you know the next two or three sets
will<00:02:09.149> make<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.810> archetype<00:02:10.470> all<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.129> better

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
will make this archetype all the better

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.770 
will make this archetype all the better
because<00:02:11.340> I'm<00:02:11.670> looking<00:02:12.360> forward<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.660> seeing

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
because I'm looking forward to seeing

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.460 
because I'm looking forward to seeing
plants<00:02:13.080> come<00:02:13.200> back

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
plants come back

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.200 
plants come back
so<00:02:13.920> do<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.430> guys<00:02:14.640> think<00:02:14.790> about<00:02:14.910> these<00:02:15.060> two

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
so do you guys think about these two

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.490 
so do you guys think about these two
codes<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.600> comment<00:02:15.810> section<00:02:16.050> down<00:02:16.080> below<00:02:16.260> and

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
codes and comment section down below and

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:35.460 
codes and comment section down below and
I'll<00:02:17.040> talk<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.340> guys<00:02:17.370> later

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.530 

Oh
