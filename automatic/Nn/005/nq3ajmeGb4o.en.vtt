 The day my baby is born 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.259
 the first question which was to see that his 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.149
 baby was born 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.340
 Good people, the marina was born on the 14th of 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.030
 October 2011 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.890
 the second question was the toy 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.560
 which she liked best when she was born 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.640
 Good folks, this phone was her. 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.070

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.760
 interest that her favorite was the 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.760
 What is the best she is? 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.790

 It was the first baby food you gave is 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.480
 Good folks, it was a porridge. 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:27.250
 It's clear to her that it was lying. 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.379

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:35.290
