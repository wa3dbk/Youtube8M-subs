seconds and then go all the way to over

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.289 
seconds and then go all the way to over
here<00:01:11.430> which<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.850> 10<00:01:12.450> seconds<00:01:13.880> split<00:01:14.880> both<00:01:15.119> of

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
here which is 10 seconds split both of

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.090 
here which is 10 seconds split both of
those<00:01:16.369> two<00:01:17.369> things<00:01:17.400> split<00:01:18.330> like<00:01:18.479> that

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
those two things split like that

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.859 
those two things split like that
now<00:01:20.100> one<00:01:20.610> thing<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.939> can<00:01:21.090> do<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.420> if<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.600> have

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
now one thing you can do is if you have

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.469 
now one thing you can do is if you have
if<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.439> if<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.220> have<00:01:23.310> audio<00:01:23.880> playing<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.330> that

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
if it if you have audio playing to that

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.830 
if it if you have audio playing to that
but<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.810> want<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.049> keep<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.159> audio<00:01:26.570> zoom<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.720> a

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
but you want to keep the audio zoom in a

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.929 
but you want to keep the audio zoom in a
little<00:01:27.930> bit<00:01:28.080> with<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> mouse<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.829> drag<00:01:28.950> these

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
little bit with the mouse and drag these

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.760 
little bit with the mouse and drag these
fades<00:01:30.270> off<00:01:31.189> like<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.970> delete<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.420> fades<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.590> it

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
fades off like so delete the fades so it

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.670 
fades off like so delete the fades so it
doesn't<00:01:35.780> fade<00:01:36.780> through<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.110> audio<00:01:37.409> while

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
doesn't fade through the audio while

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.280 
doesn't fade through the audio while
it's<00:01:37.829> playing<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.310> then<00:01:38.579> weird<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:40.020> just<00:01:40.200> do

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
it's playing and then weird so just do

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.889 
it's playing and then weird so just do
that<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:41.009> now<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.250> have<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.880> isolated<00:01:42.570> clip

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
that so now you have this isolated clip

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.440 
that so now you have this isolated clip
that<00:01:43.829> you're<00:01:44.189> going<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.520> have<00:01:44.899> B<00:01:47.270> has<00:01:48.270> that

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.440 
that you're going to have B has that
effect<00:01:48.780> applied<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:50.640> go<00:01:50.909> down<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.210> video

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
effect applied so go down to video

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.569 
effect applied so go down to video
effects<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.979> it's<00:01:52.979> going<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.369> TV

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
effects and it's going to the TV

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.639 
effects and it's going to the TV

there's many options you can mess with

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.179 
there's many options you can mess with
like<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.420> details<00:02:33.780> ooh<00:02:34.019> like<00:02:34.769> how<00:02:34.890> much<00:02:35.040> it

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:35.189 
like the details ooh like how much it

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.110 
like the details ooh like how much it
zooms<00:02:35.489> in<00:02:35.730> when<00:02:36.090> uh<00:02:37.370> when<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.519> when<00:02:38.909> you<00:02:38.970> bring

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
zooms in when uh when you when you bring

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.259 
zooms in when uh when you when you bring
it<00:02:39.269> up<00:02:39.530> that's<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.829> more<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.280> zooms<00:02:41.640> in<00:02:41.819> on<00:02:42.030> to

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
it up that's the more it zooms in on to

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.680 
it up that's the more it zooms in on to
the<00:02:42.390> actual<00:02:43.549> thing<00:02:44.549> if<00:02:44.819> you<00:02:45.000> zoom<00:02:45.209> out<00:02:45.389> like

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
the actual thing if you zoom out like

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.979 
the actual thing if you zoom out like
just<00:02:45.989> to<00:02:46.530> one<00:02:46.769> it'll<00:02:47.489> keep<00:02:47.639> it<00:02:47.790> out<00:02:47.879> of<00:02:48.030> the

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
just to one it'll keep it out of the

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.530 
just to one it'll keep it out of the
scale<00:02:49.379> or<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.739> ratio<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.400> one<00:02:50.579> to<00:02:50.609> one<00:02:50.909> so

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
scale or the ratio of one to one so

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.890 
scale or the ratio of one to one so
it'll<00:02:51.750> leave<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.220> not<00:02:53.220> stretched<00:02:53.639> not<00:02:54.329> zoom

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
it'll leave the not stretched not zoom

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.210 
it'll leave the not stretched not zoom
did<00:02:55.519> you<00:02:56.519> know<00:02:56.670> that<00:02:57.560> of<00:02:58.560> your<00:02:58.709> effort<00:02:59.099> to

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
did you know that of your effort to

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.110 
did you know that of your effort to
grill<00:02:59.430> is<00:02:59.700> how<00:03:00.000> much<00:03:00.209> light<00:03:00.629> it'll<00:03:01.200> let<00:03:01.349> in<00:03:01.500> and

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
grill is how much light it'll let in and

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.330 
grill is how much light it'll let in and
how<00:03:03.120> much<00:03:03.299> see<00:03:04.049> see<00:03:04.409> how<00:03:04.530> if<00:03:04.709> you<00:03:04.859> make<00:03:05.220> the

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
how much see see how if you make the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.050 
how much see see how if you make the
higher<00:03:05.459> grill

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
higher grill

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.250 
higher grill
that's<00:03:06.329> how<00:03:06.510> visible<00:03:06.900> this<00:03:07.170> black<00:03:07.680> grill<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:08.579> I

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
that's how visible this black grill is I

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.890 
that's how visible this black grill is I
don't<00:03:10.260> I'm<00:03:10.769> not<00:03:10.799> saying<00:03:11.220> that<00:03:11.519> but<00:03:11.939> I<00:03:12.269> like<00:03:12.720> to

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
don't I'm not saying that but I like to

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.069 
don't I'm not saying that but I like to
keep<00:03:13.049> it<00:03:13.260> around<00:03:14.329> stock<00:03:15.329> I<00:03:15.599> think<00:03:15.629> which<00:03:16.049> is

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
keep it around stock I think which is

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.500 
keep it around stock I think which is
like<00:03:16.349> what<00:03:16.829> point<00:03:17.579> two<00:03:17.760> five<00:03:17.910> something<00:03:18.359> like

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
like what point two five something like

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.589 
like what point two five something like
that<00:03:19.340> until<00:03:20.340> a<00:03:20.459> city<00:03:20.730> is<00:03:20.910> how<00:03:21.209> much<00:03:21.389> it

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
that until a city is how much it

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.059 
that until a city is how much it
obviously<00:03:22.730> how<00:03:23.730> much<00:03:23.910> it's<00:03:24.090> interlaced<00:03:25.069> see

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
obviously how much it's interlaced see

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.879 
obviously how much it's interlaced see
like<00:03:26.519> less<00:03:26.849> the<00:03:27.510> clearer<00:03:27.780> it<00:03:27.810> is<00:03:28.199> the<00:03:28.650> more

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
like less the clearer it is the more

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.909 
like less the clearer it is the more
less<00:03:29.819> bearded<00:03:30.590> that's<00:03:31.590> kind<00:03:31.799> of<00:03:31.829> the

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
less bearded that's kind of the

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:35.809 
less bearded that's kind of the
horizontal<00:03:32.459> lines<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:34.500> line<00:03:34.739> sync<00:03:35.220> is<00:03:35.459> how

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
horizontal lines the line sync is how

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:36.949 
horizontal lines the line sync is how
much<00:03:36.060> in<00:03:36.359> sync

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
much in sync

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.039 
much in sync
the<00:03:37.889> lines<00:03:38.099> are<00:03:38.430> see<00:03:38.639> if<00:03:38.730> it's<00:03:38.879> at<00:03:39.090> one<00:03:39.419> I<00:03:39.690> mean

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
the lines are see if it's at one I mean

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.640 
the lines are see if it's at one I mean
this<00:03:40.139> completely<00:03:40.970> in<00:03:41.970> sync<00:03:42.389> so<00:03:42.659> like<00:03:43.319> it<00:03:43.530> would

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
this completely in sync so like it would

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.640 
this completely in sync so like it would
just<00:03:43.859> go<00:03:44.099> up<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:44.489> down<00:03:44.549> like<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.650> don't

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
just go up and down like that you don't

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.899 
just go up and down like that you don't
really<00:03:46.799> want<00:03:47.040> that<00:03:47.129> because<00:03:47.400> then<00:03:47.609> you<00:03:47.760> could

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
really want that because then you could

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:49.550 
really want that because then you could
actually<00:03:48.000> tell<00:03:48.299> what's<00:03:48.419> going<00:03:48.629> on<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:49.139> it

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
actually tell what's going on and it

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.530 
actually tell what's going on and it
looks<00:03:49.769> too<00:03:50.359> weird<00:03:51.359> so<00:03:51.949> about<00:03:52.949> four<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:54.030> five<00:03:54.060> is

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
looks too weird so about four to five is

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.619 
looks too weird so about four to five is
good<00:03:54.750> for<00:03:55.139> that<00:03:55.549> point<00:03:56.549> four<00:03:56.849> two<00:03:57.239> point<00:03:57.449> five

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
good for that point four two point five

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.189 
good for that point four two point five
is<00:03:57.900> good<00:03:58.079> for<00:03:58.229> that<00:03:59.359> vertical<00:04:00.359> sync<00:04:00.629> that's

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
is good for that vertical sync that's

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:05.719 
is good for that vertical sync that's
just<00:04:01.889> how<00:04:02.400> well<00:04:03.239> synced<00:04:03.659> the<00:04:03.900> actual<00:04:04.729> like

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:05.729 
just how well synced the actual like

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:08.240 
just how well synced the actual like
place<00:04:06.329> it<00:04:06.540> is<00:04:06.690> rather<00:04:07.470> than<00:04:07.709> going<00:04:07.889> up<00:04:08.040> and

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
place it is rather than going up and

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.399 
place it is rather than going up and
down<00:04:08.370> if<00:04:08.879> you<00:04:09.060> want<00:04:09.269> this<00:04:09.810> it'll<00:04:10.109> keep<00:04:10.199> just

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
down if you want this it'll keep just

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:14.710 
down if you want this it'll keep just
going<00:04:10.470> up<00:04:10.769> and<00:04:10.859> down<00:04:10.949> like<00:04:11.220> that<00:04:12.109> and<00:04:13.109> the<00:04:14.010> more

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
going up and down like that and the more

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.620 
going up and down like that and the more
value<00:04:15.720> you<00:04:15.750> add<00:04:15.989> to<00:04:16.109> it<00:04:16.229> the<00:04:16.349> less<00:04:16.560> it'll<00:04:17.449> go<00:04:18.449> up

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
value you add to it the less it'll go up

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.360 
value you add to it the less it'll go up
and<00:04:18.780> because<00:04:19.289> more<00:04:19.530> in<00:04:19.799> sync

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
and because more in sync

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.580 
and because more in sync
we'll<00:04:20.519> be<00:04:20.669> sought<00:04:21.479> one<00:04:21.780> it<00:04:21.959> will<00:04:22.019> be<00:04:22.169> perfectly

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
we'll be sought one it will be perfectly

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.050 
we'll be sought one it will be perfectly
in<00:04:22.740> sync<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:23.040> not<00:04:23.160> move<00:04:23.340> up<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:23.639> down<00:04:23.760> I<00:04:23.820> don't

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
in sync and not move up and down I don't

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.450 
in sync and not move up and down I don't
think<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:24.690> a<00:04:25.350> zero<00:04:25.650> it<00:04:25.860> will<00:04:25.979> move<00:04:26.070> quite<00:04:26.430> a

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
think and a zero it will move quite a

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.120 
think and a zero it will move quite a
lot<00:04:27.050> so<00:04:28.050> let's<00:04:28.199> keep<00:04:28.320> that<00:04:28.470> at<00:04:28.650> point<00:04:28.889> three

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
lot so let's keep that at point three

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.930 
lot so let's keep that at point three
eight<00:04:29.610> something<00:04:30.540> like<00:04:30.630> that<00:04:31.669> point<00:04:32.669> four

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
eight something like that point four

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.129 
eight something like that point four
yeah<00:04:34.130> scan<00:04:35.130> phasing<00:04:35.699> that's<00:04:35.970> see<00:04:36.570> that<00:04:36.720> bright

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
yeah scan phasing that's see that bright

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.500 
yeah scan phasing that's see that bright
thing<00:04:37.500> that's<00:04:38.130> how<00:04:38.280> much<00:04:38.460> how<00:04:39.000> often<00:04:39.240> it

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
thing that's how much how often it

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.830 
thing that's how much how often it
phases<00:04:39.930> and<00:04:40.139> how<00:04:40.199> bright<00:04:41.120> where<00:04:42.120> it's<00:04:42.570> going

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
phases and how bright where it's going

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.950 
phases and how bright where it's going
to<00:04:42.930> be<00:04:43.880> see<00:04:44.880> how<00:04:45.000> that<00:04:45.210> little<00:04:45.389> like<00:04:45.660> bright

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
to be see how that little like bright

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.700 
to be see how that little like bright
spot

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
spot

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.820 
spot
it<00:04:47.100> looks<00:04:47.310> good<00:04:47.639> up<00:04:47.820> there<00:04:48.030> so<00:04:48.830> then

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
it looks good up there so then

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.529 
it looks good up there so then
phosphorescence<00:04:50.790> is<00:04:52.100> basically<00:04:53.100> how<00:04:54.090> bright

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
phosphorescence is basically how bright

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:59.870 
phosphorescence is basically how bright
and<00:04:54.810> help<00:04:55.199> like<00:04:57.979> the<00:04:58.979> light<00:04:59.220> coming<00:04:59.669> off<00:04:59.820> of

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
and help like the light coming off of

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.770 
and help like the light coming off of
what<00:05:00.510> would<00:05:00.630> be<00:05:00.810> like<00:05:01.020> if<00:05:01.169> the<00:05:01.289> TV<00:05:01.620> is

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
what would be like if the TV is

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.080 
what would be like if the TV is
basically<00:05:03.780> what<00:05:04.050> this<00:05:04.199> is<00:05:04.260> so<00:05:05.250> one<00:05:05.550> would<00:05:05.880> mean

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
basically what this is so one would mean

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.270 
basically what this is so one would mean
it's<00:05:06.510> the<00:05:06.870> max<00:05:07.050> value<00:05:07.260> for<00:05:07.620> phosphorescence

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
it's the max value for phosphorescence

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.510 
it's the max value for phosphorescence
zero<00:05:09.180> would<00:05:09.360> make<00:05:09.510> zero<00:05:10.039> like<00:05:11.039> coming<00:05:11.400> from

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
zero would make zero like coming from

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.640 
zero would make zero like coming from
the<00:05:11.639> TV<00:05:11.760> like<00:05:12.060> that<00:05:12.240> so<00:05:13.020> it<00:05:13.110> would<00:05:13.169> be<00:05:13.320> clear

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
the TV like that so it would be clear

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.560 
the TV like that so it would be clear
but<00:05:13.889> it'd<00:05:14.010> still<00:05:14.039> be<00:05:14.280> half<00:05:14.550> and<00:05:15.150> still<00:05:15.449> have

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
but it'd still be half and still have

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.170 
but it'd still be half and still have
this<00:05:15.750> uh<00:05:15.810> that<00:05:16.350> sink<00:05:16.789> but<00:05:17.789> if<00:05:17.880> you<00:05:17.970> add<00:05:18.150> a

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
this uh that sink but if you add a

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.810 
this uh that sink but if you add a
little<00:05:18.510> bit<00:05:18.840> you<00:05:19.470> kind<00:05:19.800> of<00:05:19.919> tell<00:05:20.190> it<00:05:20.430> look

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
little bit you kind of tell it look

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.680 
little bit you kind of tell it look
looks<00:05:21.720> a<00:05:21.840> lot<00:05:22.020> better<00:05:23.030> for<00:05:24.030> is<00:05:24.240> good

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
looks a lot better for is good

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.710 
looks a lot better for is good
static<00:05:25.590> obviously<00:05:26.310> self-explanatory

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
static obviously self-explanatory

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.950 
static obviously self-explanatory
static<00:05:28.380> how'd<00:05:29.340> you<00:05:29.520> do<00:05:29.700> this<00:05:30.440> I<00:05:32.780> don't<00:05:33.780> like

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
static how'd you do this I don't like

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:42.469 
static how'd you do this I don't like
adding<00:05:34.380> static<00:05:35.330> hardly<00:05:40.970> but<00:05:41.970> yeah<00:05:42.240> that's

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
adding static hardly but yeah that's

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:49.300 
adding static hardly but yeah that's
what<00:05:42.630> you<00:05:42.750> do<00:05:42.870> the<00:05:44.240> the<00:05:45.320> effect<00:05:46.320> so<00:05:46.979> if<00:05:47.250> it<00:05:47.370> goes

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
what you do the the effect so if it goes

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.770 
what you do the the effect so if it goes
and<00:05:50.310> if<00:05:50.550> it<00:05:50.669> only<00:05:50.789> goes<00:05:51.060> for<00:05:51.270> just<00:05:51.479> a<00:05:51.630> little

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
and if it only goes for just a little

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.360 
and if it only goes for just a little
bit<00:05:51.930> let's<00:05:52.289> say<00:05:52.410> I've<00:05:52.650> just<00:05:52.830> wanted<00:05:53.070> it<00:05:53.220> from

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
bit let's say I've just wanted it from

00:05:53.370 --> 00:06:00.650 
bit let's say I've just wanted it from
here<00:05:54.919> to<00:05:56.180> here<00:05:58.400> sig<00:05:59.400> and<00:05:59.669> if<00:06:00.240> you<00:06:00.330> backed<00:06:00.510> at

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
here to here sig and if you backed at

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.480 
here to here sig and if you backed at
the<00:06:00.750> settings<00:06:01.139> and<00:06:01.289> stuff<00:06:01.500> you<00:06:01.710> just<00:06:01.740> typed<00:06:02.370> in
