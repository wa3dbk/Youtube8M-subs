00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
doing

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.630 
doing
I<00:00:03.120> put<00:00:03.780> together<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:04.410> little<00:00:04.859> video<00:00:05.040> here<00:00:05.220> that

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
I put together a little video here that

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.179 
I put together a little video here that
I<00:00:05.670> thought<00:00:05.850> would<00:00:06.060> help<00:00:06.240> us<00:00:06.620> dissect<00:00:07.620> the

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
I thought would help us dissect the

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.860 
I thought would help us dissect the
bench<00:00:08.400> press<00:00:08.610> almost<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.450> little<00:00:09.660> bit<00:00:09.750> better

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
bench press almost a little bit better

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.990 
bench press almost a little bit better
than<00:00:10.080> when<00:00:10.469> we're<00:00:10.710> doing<00:00:10.830> this<00:00:11.099> in<00:00:11.340> an<00:00:11.639> active

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
than when we're doing this in an active

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.450 
than when we're doing this in an active
video<00:00:12.150> so<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:12.929> put<00:00:13.500> this<00:00:13.590> together<00:00:13.769> from<00:00:14.070> photos

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
video so I put this together from photos

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.849 
video so I put this together from photos
that<00:00:14.580> we<00:00:14.700> took<00:00:14.730> at<00:00:15.120> steel<00:00:15.990> gym<00:00:16.289> in<00:00:16.500> New<00:00:16.680> York

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
that we took at steel gym in New York

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.680 
that we took at steel gym in New York
City<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.760> first<00:00:18.060> thing<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.420> keep<00:00:18.539> your

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
City so the first thing is to keep your

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.939 
City so the first thing is to keep your
hands<00:00:18.900> shoulder-width<00:00:19.410> apart

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
hands shoulder-width apart

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.920 
hands shoulder-width apart
and<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.279> see<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.939> my<00:00:21.300> hands<00:00:21.539> are<00:00:21.600> shoulder

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
and you see that my hands are shoulder

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.470 
and you see that my hands are shoulder
width<00:00:22.050> apart<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.650> there's<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.310> slight<00:00:23.760> arch<00:00:24.150> in

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
width apart and there's a slight arch in

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.960 
width apart and there's a slight arch in
my<00:00:24.600> back<00:00:24.869> now<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.320> arch<00:00:25.730> occurs<00:00:26.730> naturally

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
my back now the arch occurs naturally

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.240 
my back now the arch occurs naturally
when<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.599> put<00:00:27.960> my<00:00:28.140> shoulder<00:00:28.590> blades<00:00:28.890> together

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
when I put my shoulder blades together

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.439 
when I put my shoulder blades together
on<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.029> bench

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
on the bench

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.089 
on the bench
I'm<00:00:30.599> kind<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:30.960> scrunching<00:00:31.590> my<00:00:31.619> shoulder

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
I'm kind of scrunching my shoulder

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.180 
I'm kind of scrunching my shoulder
blades<00:00:32.369> together<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.719> there<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.290> small

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
blades together so that there is a small

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.610 
blades together so that there is a small
amount<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.940> my<00:00:36.239> back<00:00:36.480> if<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.840> will<00:00:37.110> on<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
amount of my back if you will on the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.650 
amount of my back if you will on the
bench<00:00:37.829> see<00:00:38.129> that's<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.550> goal<00:00:38.730> try<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.450> keep

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
bench see that's the goal try to keep

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.060 
bench see that's the goal try to keep
the<00:00:39.840> least<00:00:40.050> amount<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.500> your<00:00:40.649> back<00:00:40.829> as

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
the least amount of your back as

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
possible on the bench and when you do

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.090 
possible on the bench and when you do
this<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.350> put<00:00:43.500> your<00:00:43.620> shoulder<00:00:43.739> blades

this you put your shoulder blades

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.340 
this you put your shoulder blades
together<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.670> when<00:00:45.539> your<00:00:45.660> feet<00:00:45.899> are<00:00:46.050> planted

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
firmly on the floor and arch will occur

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.600 
firmly on the floor and arch will occur
in<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.110> back<00:00:49.289> automatically<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.460> can

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
in the back automatically and you can

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.850 
in the back automatically and you can
see<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.000> arch<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.360> my<00:00:51.510> back<00:00:51.690> it's<00:00:52.199> just<00:00:52.559> enough

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
see the arch in my back it's just enough

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.529 
see the arch in my back it's just enough
that<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.460> could<00:00:53.610> slide<00:00:53.820> your<00:00:54.180> hand

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
that you could slide your hand

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.660 
that you could slide your hand
underneath<00:00:55.170> my<00:00:55.500> back<00:00:55.710> not<00:00:56.070> much<00:00:56.309> more<00:00:56.489> than

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
underneath my back not much more than

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.540 
underneath my back not much more than
that<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:57.059> lot<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.930> folks<00:00:58.109> ask<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.530> an<00:00:59.160> arch<00:00:59.399> in

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
that a lot of folks ask is an arch in

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.459 
that a lot of folks ask is an arch in
the<00:00:59.579> back<00:00:59.670> dangerous<00:01:00.329> well<00:01:00.539> not<00:01:01.230> really

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
the back dangerous well not really

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.799 
the back dangerous well not really
because<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.309> see<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:03.270> weight<00:01:03.539> is

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
because you see the weight is

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.109 
because you see the weight is
distributed<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.530> my<00:01:04.890> chest<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> top<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:06.000> my

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
distributed on my chest on the top of my

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.580 
distributed on my chest on the top of my
body<00:01:06.360> if<00:01:06.600> something<00:01:06.900> were<00:01:06.990> resting<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.439> my

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
body if something were resting on my

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.590 
body if something were resting on my
abdomen<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.549> would<00:01:08.790> say<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.060> dangerous

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
abdomen that I would say is dangerous

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.700 
abdomen that I would say is dangerous
then<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.860> move<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.340> bar<00:01:11.549> very<00:01:12.119> slowly<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
then you move the bar very slowly to the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.320 
then you move the bar very slowly to the
part<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.040> chest<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.490> actually<00:01:14.760> want

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
part of the chest that you actually want

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.570 
part of the chest that you actually want
to<00:01:15.420> work<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:16.259> inhale<00:01:16.710> on<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.920> way<00:01:17.040> down<00:01:17.130> if

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
to work you inhale on the way down if

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.160 
to work you inhale on the way down if
you<00:01:17.729> want<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.939> work<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.210> upper<00:01:18.540> lower<00:01:18.990> in

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
you want to work the upper lower in

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.719 
you want to work the upper lower in
toward<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> upper<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.070> middle<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> middle

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
toward the upper the middle the middle

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.700 
toward the upper the middle the middle
and<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> lower<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.360> lower<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.080> then<00:01:22.560> you

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
and the lower the lower and then you

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.740 
and the lower the lower and then you
concentrate<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:23.430> pushing<00:01:23.700> up<00:01:24.000> from<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.390> part

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
concentrate on pushing up from that part

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.350 
concentrate on pushing up from that part
what<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.409> do<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.130> move<00:01:26.369> very<00:01:26.430> slowly<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
what I do is I move very slowly the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.819 
what I do is I move very slowly the
first<00:01:27.600> two<00:01:27.900> or<00:01:27.930> three<00:01:28.080> inches<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
first two or three inches of the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.609 
first two or three inches of the
exercise<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:30.060> exhale<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.079> keeps<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
exercise and I exhale and that keeps the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.670 
exercise and I exhale and that keeps the
weight<00:01:31.770> distributed<00:01:32.549> in<00:01:32.759> my<00:01:32.939> chest<00:01:33.270> now<00:01:33.960> as<00:01:34.290> I

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
weight distributed in my chest now as I

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.789 
weight distributed in my chest now as I
push<00:01:34.920> up<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.340> can<00:01:35.490> see<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.119> my<00:01:37.049> elbows<00:01:37.590> are

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
push up you can see that my elbows are

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.319 
push up you can see that my elbows are
not<00:01:37.829> locked<00:01:38.280> out<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.880> reason<00:01:39.030> for<00:01:39.270> that

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
not locked out and the reason for that

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.630 
not locked out and the reason for that
is<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.990> keeps<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.470> tension<00:01:40.680> on<00:01:41.040> my<00:01:41.310> chest

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
is this keeps the tension on my chest

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.060 
is this keeps the tension on my chest
throughout<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.479> entire<00:01:42.810> movement<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.470> move<00:01:43.920> up

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
throughout the entire movement I move up

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.249 
throughout the entire movement I move up
slowly<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.640> exhale<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.810> what<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
slowly I exhale and this is what the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.679 
slowly I exhale and this is what the
finishing<00:01:46.950> or<00:01:47.130> end<00:01:47.310> position<00:01:47.909> or<00:01:48.090> contraction

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
finishing or end position or contraction

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.620 
finishing or end position or contraction
looks<00:01:48.930> like<00:01:49.110> at<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.950> end<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.280> benchpress
