00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:57.258
 To convince the noblest man 

00:00:57.406 --> 00:01:04.306
 To overcome all selfishness 

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:11.966
 Who rips the face does not feel the pain It suffocates in the chest the pain of living 

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:18.800
 In the midst of anguish, contempt and rancor 

00:01:19.395 --> 00:01:24.611
 Lords of Discord 

00:01:25.364 --> 00:01:31.079
 Profane, selfish 

00:01:40.872 --> 00:01:51.100
 I need them unless they're dead 

00:01:51.297 --> 00:02:01.380
 I need them to see the bodies bleed 

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:09.400
 I will not be a coward 

00:02:12.487 --> 00:02:21.550
 You will not see my value 

00:02:23.344 --> 00:02:33.840
 Add the ashes 

00:02:45.324 --> 00:02:56.090
 You will not see 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:16.750
 You will not see my value 

00:03:23.445 --> 00:03:26.160
 Who, the warrior of us, is going to be? 

00:03:26.352 --> 00:03:29.040
 Who will be chosen among us? 

00:03:29.312 --> 00:03:31.950
 Who, the warrior of us, is going to be? 

00:03:32.205 --> 00:03:34.960
 Who will be chosen among us? 

00:03:35.118 --> 00:03:41.070
 Stop the war against vanity Envy kills every thought that 

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:47.690
 It goes beyond good intentions. Fists clenched, I hold out my hands. 

00:03:48.087 --> 00:03:56.370
 Against the prejudice The blood of men united in one 

00:04:15.517 --> 00:04:42.600
 And win, convince me Waiting for the world to improve without fear 

00:04:42.983 --> 00:04:47.550
 Without letting me fail
