we cut the foam in each fold and then

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.260 
we cut the foam in each fold and then
cut<00:05:23.289> it<00:05:23.319> to<00:05:23.500> fit<00:05:23.650> the<00:05:23.770> frame<00:05:23.979> we<00:05:24.819> discovered

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
cut it to fit the frame we discovered

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.879 
cut it to fit the frame we discovered
that<00:05:25.360> one<00:05:25.509> style<00:05:25.779> of<00:05:25.870> styrofoam<00:05:26.080> had<00:05:26.590> a<00:05:26.620> thin

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889 
that one style of styrofoam had a thin

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:28.800 
that one style of styrofoam had a thin
layer<00:05:27.039> of<00:05:27.099> plastic<00:05:27.580> on<00:05:27.759> it<00:05:27.909> I<00:05:28.090> assume<00:05:28.569> it<00:05:28.689> was

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
layer of plastic on it I assume it was

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.600 
layer of plastic on it I assume it was
there<00:05:28.960> to<00:05:28.990> act<00:05:29.229> as<00:05:29.349> a<00:05:29.379> vapor<00:05:29.650> barrier<00:05:29.770> since

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
there to act as a vapor barrier since

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.969 
there to act as a vapor barrier since
this<00:05:30.729> was<00:05:30.969> an<00:05:31.090> insulating<00:05:31.539> foam<00:05:31.659> product<00:05:32.199> that

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
this was an insulating foam product that

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:34.200 
this was an insulating foam product that
side<00:05:33.250> of<00:05:33.310> the<00:05:33.370> product<00:05:33.729> should<00:05:33.819> be<00:05:33.879> placed

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
side of the product should be placed

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.360 
side of the product should be placed
against<00:05:34.779> the<00:05:34.870> furring<00:05:35.139> strips<00:05:35.440> if<00:05:36.279> you

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
against the furring strips if you

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.519 
against the furring strips if you
fiberglass<00:05:37.000> over<00:05:37.300> the<00:05:37.419> plastic<00:05:37.870> there<00:05:38.319> would

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:38.529 
fiberglass over the plastic there would

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:39.990 
fiberglass over the plastic there would
be<00:05:38.560> the<00:05:38.770> possibility<00:05:39.400> that<00:05:39.430> the<00:05:39.610> plastic

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
be the possibility that the plastic

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.640 
be the possibility that the plastic
couldn't<00:05:40.300> pull<00:05:40.449> away<00:05:40.539> from<00:05:40.690> the<00:05:40.960> foam<00:05:41.199> that's

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
couldn't pull away from the foam that's

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.709 
couldn't pull away from the foam that's
called<00:05:41.949> delaminating<00:05:42.699> and<00:05:42.849> weaken<00:05:43.690> the

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:43.719 
called delaminating and weaken the

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:46.200 
called delaminating and weaken the
structure<00:05:44.169> make<00:05:45.129> sure<00:05:45.400> you<00:05:45.610> sand<00:05:45.849> the<00:05:45.969> top

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
structure make sure you sand the top

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.029 
structure make sure you sand the top
layer<00:05:46.479> so<00:05:46.719> the<00:05:47.139> fiberglass<00:05:47.589> will<00:05:47.770> achieve<00:05:47.860> a

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 
layer so the fiberglass will achieve a

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:50.939 
layer so the fiberglass will achieve a
good<00:05:48.310> bond<00:05:48.550> also<00:05:48.849> I<00:05:49.509> suggest<00:05:50.020> you<00:05:50.199> hand<00:05:50.589> sand

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
good bond also I suggest you hand sand

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:52.800 
good bond also I suggest you hand sand
the<00:05:51.129> edges<00:05:51.639> before<00:05:51.819> you<00:05:52.060> fit<00:05:52.240> the<00:05:52.360> styrofoam

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810

the edges before you fit the styrofoam
to<00:05:52.990> ribs<00:05:53.199> this<00:05:53.620> will<00:05:53.830> remove<00:05:54.009> any<00:05:54.250> rough<00:05:54.639> spots
