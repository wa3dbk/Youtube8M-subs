00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Tell you guys, take a video back here. 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.290
 because they are asking you to make video and 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.120
 a video yesterday its legacy was yesterday me 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.410
 I do not remember if the second no, I'm not. 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.750
 remembering I think second as well but it was 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.969
 a short one and I did not do it yesterday because I 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.470
 I arrived late here at home I was without 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.050
 internet at work fixed to the internet 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.939
 today that the whole day 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.340
 the problem of the company that provides 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.930
 internet and there is only one that takes 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.460
 there in that boat because I do not know 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.830
 because I do not really know why 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.119
 other companies do not pick up that building 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.529
 I think in the region where the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.630
 office picks up another one but that 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.090
 building has no other already 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.500
 tried to see us as the one who lives giving 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.210
 problem at last 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.590
 and then a physicist I stayed there trying 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.800
 solve the problems is what I could 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.539
 do without internet and then came running 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.239
 home tried and other problems then 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.020
 video I had to make a video there 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.610
 of a game and it was basically that I had 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.570
 What to do but at the end of the day I had 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.829
 to sit and play an online rpg that is 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.070
 not to mention the name that the video will come out in 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.539
 tgs you will see what the game is and I think 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.949
 that income then afterward say what 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.510
 opinion on the game 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.310
 by the way, crazy, who leonardo 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.930
 two cups if someone gives you another 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.939
 face 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.710
 I know the team is going crazy 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.560
 that there are things that are insane and everything 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.850
 but the fight was very good having 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.780
 It's okay that there's something that we 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.420
 does not agree 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.130
 how it happened here but it's the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.159
 guy who're creating a do nothing leaves 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.320
 to create but does not deny is a guy 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.119
 of history in the good but what they did 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.520
 today a combination of expensive scams has been 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.590
 a kind thing so nobody thought 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.409
 Like, guys, what are you doing? 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.259
 outside the interest combination of the fourth 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.649
 with the second what the fuck 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.119
 always been kind of a top type and in my 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.189
 through my head of a seminar 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.689
 had really lived and hitachi 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.310
 I was with him 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.140
 like the two would lead to the whole war 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.329
 that the people need needs 40 thousand 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.860

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.719
 hitachi they take everything because the guys 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.450
 they are so sinister and does everything he's 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.360
 life and death said that he will do 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.399

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.039
 everything everything they did with other 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.830
 with the cable would be type out all 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.170
 understood 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.750
 This is how a minute and a half of the mandate 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.090
 You do not have to argue better to finish. 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.400
 Whatever happens you mix that 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.260

 that organism understands is to speak 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.960
 In that case , a news story does not tell 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.300
