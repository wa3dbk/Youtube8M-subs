anyone has the advantage here the one
match<00:00:43.860> would<00:00:44.190> because<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.610> batteries<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.930> lot

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
match would because the batteries a lot

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.470 
match would because the batteries a lot
fresher<00:00:46.920> or<00:00:47.370> right<00:00:47.730> now<00:00:47.910> let's<00:00:48.149> go<00:00:48.270> ahead<00:00:48.360> and

fresher or right now let's go ahead and
run<00:00:48.930> quadrant<00:00:50.000> both<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.180> these<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.329> glass

screen protectors they're from different

manufacturers<00:00:53.809> I've<00:00:54.809> turned<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:56.840> camera

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
manufacturers I've turned the camera

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.860 
manufacturers I've turned the camera
down<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.050> few<00:00:58.379> steps<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.370> brightness<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.719> that

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
down a few steps in brightness so that

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.450 
down a few steps in brightness so that
you<00:01:00.960> could<00:01:01.109> actually<00:01:01.140> focus<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.039> screens

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
you could actually focus on the screens

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.149 
you could actually focus on the screens
more<00:01:02.850> than<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.300> overall<00:01:03.480> look<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
more than the overall look of the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.539 
more than the overall look of the
devices<00:01:06.619> so<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:08.070> see<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.369> color

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
devices so you can see the color

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.899 
devices so you can see the color
representation<00:01:09.060> here<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.740> note<00:01:11.070> 3<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.670> a

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
representation here the note 3 is a

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.719 
representation here the note 3 is a
little<00:01:12.270> bit<00:01:12.420> warmer<00:01:13.369> sometimes<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.580> makes

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
little bit warmer sometimes that makes

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.880 
little bit warmer sometimes that makes
the<00:01:14.909> colors<00:01:15.060> look<00:01:15.299> nicer<00:01:15.780> sometimes<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.710> just

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
the colors look nicer sometimes it just

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.609 
the colors look nicer sometimes it just
gives<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> false<00:01:17.970> representation<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
gives you a false representation of the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.670 
gives you a false representation of the
color<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.610> blacks<00:01:20.850> on<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.360> HTC<00:01:21.930> One<00:01:22.409> max

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.179 
color on the blacks on the HTC One max
you<00:01:23.280> can<00:01:23.460> tell<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.030> an<00:01:24.210> LCD<00:01:24.570> because

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
you can tell that it's an LCD because

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.039 
you can tell that it's an LCD because
the<00:01:26.189> blacks<00:01:26.430> have<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.880> white<00:01:27.299> backlighting

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
the blacks have that white backlighting

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.090 
the blacks have that white backlighting
to<00:01:28.829> them<00:01:29.070> whereas<00:01:29.549> on<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.560> AMOLED<00:01:31.560> display<00:01:31.950> of

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
let's run it one more time this is

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.139 
let's run it one more time this is
download<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.460> see<00:01:59.700> in<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.939> upper

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
download that you see in the upper

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.010 
download that you see in the upper
corner<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:01.590> can't<00:02:02.040> even<00:02:02.340> go<00:02:02.549> because<00:02:03.000> like<00:02:03.899> I

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
corner it can't even go because like I

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.210 
corner it can't even go because like I
said<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.829> is

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
said this is

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.550 
said this is
in<00:02:06.910> airplane<00:02:07.330> mode<00:02:07.360> right<00:02:07.750> now<00:02:07.810> I've<00:02:08.200> gotten

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
in airplane mode right now I've gotten

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.710 
in airplane mode right now I've gotten
higher<00:02:08.740> scores<00:02:09.220> on<00:02:09.430> it<00:02:09.580> before<00:02:09.970> so<00:02:10.330> that's<00:02:10.600> why

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
higher scores on it before so that's why

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.030 
higher scores on it before so that's why
I<00:02:10.780> want<00:02:10.990> to<00:02:11.050> run<00:02:11.170> it<00:02:11.320> one<00:02:11.470> more<00:02:11.590> time<00:02:14.040> overall

both<00:02:15.280> these<00:02:15.430> devices<00:02:15.820> are<00:02:16.180> really<00:02:16.570> nice<00:02:16.750> I<00:02:16.990> can

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
both these devices are really nice I can

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.260 
both these devices are really nice I can
tell<00:02:17.740> that<00:02:18.010> there's<00:02:18.160> extra<00:02:18.490> processing<00:02:18.670> power

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
tell that there's extra processing power

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.720 
tell that there's extra processing power
with<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.570> note<00:02:19.720> 3<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:20.920> does<00:02:21.310> run<00:02:22.530> faster<00:02:23.730> when

Adreno<00:04:32.840> 320<00:04:36.009> so<00:04:37.009> resolution<00:04:37.610> wise<00:04:37.759> this<00:04:38.030> is<00:04:38.270> a

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
Adreno 320 so resolution wise this is a

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.990 
Adreno 320 so resolution wise this is a
fair<00:04:38.660> fight<00:04:39.190> both<00:04:40.190> of<00:04:40.340> them<00:04:40.460> are<00:04:40.520> having<00:04:40.880> to

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
fair fight both of them are having to

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.610 
fair fight both of them are having to
render<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:43.490> same<00:04:44.320> amount<00:04:45.320> of<00:04:45.410> pixels

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
render the same amount of pixels

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:52.089 
render the same amount of pixels
basically<00:04:49.630> screen<00:04:50.630> size<00:04:50.840> does<00:04:51.199> not<00:04:51.410> factor

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
basically screen size does not factor

00:04:52.099 --> 00:05:01.330 
basically screen size does not factor
into<00:04:52.340> this<00:04:52.639> it's<00:04:52.910> really<00:04:53.210> just<00:04:53.419> resolution

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.510 

you<00:05:02.340> know<00:05:02.490> that<00:05:02.669> we<00:05:02.760> can<00:05:03.030> go<00:05:03.240> brighter<00:05:04.040> in<00:05:05.040> auto

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
you know that we can go brighter in auto

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.510 
you know that we can go brighter in auto
mode<00:05:05.870> with<00:05:06.870> a<00:05:06.900> really<00:05:07.260> bright<00:05:07.710> light<00:05:07.770> on<00:05:08.340> it

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
mode with a really bright light on it

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.110 
mode with a really bright light on it
than<00:05:09.000> it<00:05:09.210> is<00:05:09.389> in<00:05:09.660> manual<00:05:10.440> full<00:05:10.950> mode<00:05:11.160> so<00:05:11.820> both

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
than it is in manual full mode so both

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.090 
than it is in manual full mode so both
of<00:05:12.150> them<00:05:12.419> rendered<00:05:13.370> 60.5<00:05:14.370> frames<00:05:15.300> per<00:05:15.570> second

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
of them rendered 60.5 frames per second

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:23.180 
of them rendered 60.5 frames per second
we<00:05:17.100> can<00:05:17.220> run<00:05:17.370> it<00:05:17.460> one<00:05:17.610> more<00:05:17.760> time<00:05:18.000> that<00:05:22.190> errors

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
we can run it one more time that errors

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.710 
we can run it one more time that errors
just<00:05:23.220> because<00:05:23.669> both<00:05:23.850> these<00:05:24.030> are<00:05:24.240> in<00:05:24.360> airplane

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
just because both these are in airplane

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:36.170 
just because both these are in airplane
mode
