00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.349
 as a rich 93 I leave you with the canèl infobox 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.300

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.010

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.489
 as why elected by the title these the 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.320
 video plate on the lips products there 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.299
 they liked those that just didn't 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.879
 liked them etc. 

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:53.619
 then let's start right away, it's eight questions 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.780
 let's start with the first question he asks 

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:56.979
 what is the balm the treatment 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.170
 favorite for lips 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:01.510
 then if you have already seen my video 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.570
 suite of duty sunrise 6 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.220
 you have seen that I already know it 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.689
 I'm a fan of sink products in 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.030
 particular that I show the 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.860
 top product for lips lip balm 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.680
 exactly a bravin hours is the ring 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.400
 classic blue one nothing more banal 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.770
 it is very comfortable super moisturizing 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.200
 it costs very little is actually is 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.120
 the only one that moisturizes and lips very well 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.150
 I will not elaborate any further because 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.120
 I already told you about it as an alternative 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.980
 I use this here so close and always of 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.200
 sink have the moment of day though 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.150
 I want to give a little more light to a tone 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.190
 a little more rosy on my lips then i 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.670
 sink products I lestra advice 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:46.450
 always the second question to everyone 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.850
 asks what is the red that captures it 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.150
 look I am at my red par excellence 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.580
 top and I want to show 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.420
 this then pupa that arrives on the rouge 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.390
 and it's a beautiful deep red like a 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.850
 red bit par excellence is obviously a 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.130
 very very intense color that I do not wear 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.320
 never during the day during the day while 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.540
 always for life very much while 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.490
 this as while perhaps in the evening for the 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.570
 special occasions really like it 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.490
 a lot then third question asks the 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.800
 best product for luxury lips e 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.650
 I would find them at low cost and then I don't 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.840
 many luxury lip products 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.350
 because they never spend too much 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.209
 money, in short, for lip products though 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.550
 I'll show you one that had been 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:40.060
 given cell for over a year now 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:41.620
 is the chanel number 47 and skate and how 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.990
 You see practically finished because they do not 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.850
 they are so many it is very valuable 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.180
 particular because it is as if it were the 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.980
 my most intense lip color more 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.000
 towards the strawberry color a thousand jumps 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.290
 very much and makes it stand out and the thing 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.030
 beautiful of this lipstick that lasts 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.130
 very much indeed with the piece that 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.920
 he would miss us anything but short-lived 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.180
 and therefore yes in this accomplice 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.950
 lot 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.580
 and while regarding the products 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.170
 and for grocery lips one's own 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.650
 that I'm really enjoying it I want to own 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.110
 see these ecm crosses 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.680
 then I fell in love when there 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.360
 I took some packaging I took from in 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.580
 san babila in milan of the cinemas 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.380
 and there is always a lot with the wings 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.440
 speakers if you notice in the neighbour's cinemas 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.630
 at the cash desks they always bring products that 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.030
 they cost 12 euros to attract people 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.540
 to buy live you as a clever clever there 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.070
 I fell and took this lip 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.250
 gloss actually came out three 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.470
 colors this news this fishing this 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.880
 and another of a beautiful intense fuchsia that 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.830
 I do not have here with me because he has it 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:52.330
 left Milan I am now at the home of 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:54.010
 my parents and I was amazed in 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.830
 in a positive way in the sense that 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.600
 besides being very nice to the packaging 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.880
 they are very beautiful on the lips and they are not 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.380
 the classic sticky lip glosses that 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.720
 which are very annoying 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.550
 comfortable and colors are very beautiful and 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.970
 truly decorated nothing maybe even 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:12.190
 less than a euro is such a thing 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.580
 then question number 4 best lipstick 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.959
 mat 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.760
 then I don't have so many macro lipsticks 1 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.980
 and by the way I also took it from 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.510
 I recently took a few weeks ago I 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.520
 I am given a gift to celebrate the 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.200
 end of my summer session 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.880
 cut at the university de toma via here 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.370
 takes a lipstick from the brand 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.870
 yes because it is not my custom to go 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.390
 the machine in the sense that the prices are 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.990
 very tall and heroes and they cost you at least 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:41.740
 these here cost 18 euros 65 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.870
 it seems so and indeed I can tell you the 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.669
 my opinion about this one 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.790
 concept mark that I have and I am enjoying it 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.620
 very 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.270
 I was watched a lot of 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.680
 reviews before buying it for 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.000
 see what color I could have 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.470
 please more 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.440
 I have taken this here that will also go t 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.330
 and from an amp file to a beautiful news 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.400
 they know rosé and it is very comfortable 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.170
 and it looks very good on the lips is not 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.390
 the classic news that you see but you see 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.120
 it was what time it is on the lips remains 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.670
 many hours so I like them a lot 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.890
 then question number 5 the product for 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.960
 lips more disappointing then for how much 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.510
 for the most disappointing I'll show you 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.820
 this we passed protective lips and 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.100
 nourishing the logo wax of cupra 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:27.510
 taken difficulty and fortunately worked 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:29.730
 however it is really terrible it is super 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.860
 super annoying super sticky 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.300
 when I said that if he would n't have it 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.610
 moments I remain glued to ho 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.560
 also tried putting a little on the hand and 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.180
 to dab it in the lips but still 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.100
 worse blacks but they were super 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.710
 sticky even after washing 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.300
 Romans stay with flavors so if you have 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.850
 an appropriate buy it ie 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.010
 freely I had a great time 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:53.640
 then question number 6 lip pencil 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.810
 yes or no, that is, in the sense that I am 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.630
 pencils for lips those to make 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.129
 outline not grandparents really even one 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.279
 I never took them not 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:05.459
 I have never been so useful not it 

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:07.589
 I know, however, rather I take so much i 

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:11.760
 Pencil amber and think about mine 

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:14.010
 a bit of various daddy brands 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.540
 I can't mix wiphone I like them 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.520
 very much because I always feel gods 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.650
 very beautiful colors are very moisturizing 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.340
 very easy to spread and apply 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.000
 then 7 best pro best gloss for 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.540
 lips 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.510
 I want you to see this lip gloss by 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:33.000
 wight with and it is precisely this line 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.800
 similar ethics that always costs precisely 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.530
 little economic and I liked it 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.940
 very much this line because I am 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.890
 always found good with their products 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:45.180
 and questori pilot a color that I like 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:47.580
 very much a super shiny pink and is not 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.620
 cited art and much remains on 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.090
 lips and it's comfortable so you know 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.660
 that there is a lot of use for this 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:56.670
 period and then question number 8 something 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.740
 more and for something more wants 

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.660
 come back but titles lip and in particular 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:04.020
 way to show this pencil of ny 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:07.650
 extra knicks 713 and it's a color that is 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:10.470
 super super particular because it is a 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:13.230
 red a little metallic bear with a 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:15.240
 texture with a very particular finish 

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.010
 I don't know if the Scotch in the room discusses 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.530
 too orange but I assure you it is 

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.940
 a really beautiful red especially for 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:23.310
 summer with a tan in my opinion 

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.560
 he is very well and therefore this was nothing 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.660
