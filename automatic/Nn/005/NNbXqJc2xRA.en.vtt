00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
over it so we really need to wash it

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.920 
over it so we really need to wash it
again<00:02:14.139> but<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.579> cats<00:02:15.819> love<00:02:16.209> it<00:02:16.389> so<00:02:16.749> i'm<00:02:16.900> making

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
again but the cats love it so i'm making

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.910 
again but the cats love it so i'm making
them<00:02:17.379> a<00:02:17.560> fleece<00:02:17.920> one<00:02:18.159> this<00:02:18.310> time

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
them a fleece one this time

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.220 
them a fleece one this time
this<00:02:19.220> one's<00:02:19.400> like<00:02:19.580> a<00:02:19.640> flannel<00:02:20.120> material<00:02:20.990> and

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
this one's like a flannel material and

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.830 
this one's like a flannel material and
so<00:02:22.010> I<00:02:22.040> thought<00:02:22.220> fleece<00:02:22.550> would<00:02:22.819> be<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.000> nice<00:02:23.510> warm

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
so I thought fleece would be a nice warm

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.800 
so I thought fleece would be a nice warm
material<00:02:24.319> for<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.590> winter<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:26.000> it's<00:02:26.510> cool

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
material for the winter and it's cool

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.380 
material for the winter and it's cool
colors<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.349> stuff<00:02:27.530> so<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.670> fleece<00:02:28.849> was<00:02:29.060> two

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
colors and stuff so the fleece was two

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.930 
colors and stuff so the fleece was two
dollars<00:02:29.690> each<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.430> yeah<00:02:31.430> they<00:02:31.700> were<00:02:31.760> just

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
dollars each and yeah they were just

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.460 
dollars each and yeah they were just
remanent<00:02:32.480> so<00:02:32.810> that's<00:02:32.989> why<00:02:33.140> they<00:02:33.319> were<00:02:33.380> so

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470
