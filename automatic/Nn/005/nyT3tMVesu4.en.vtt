00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.379
 Hatsukai I'm good-it was good 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:09.620
 Nescafe's Specialty Tea House Machine 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:13.190
 All the action machines are bought and coffee 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:17.420
 Like instant gold blends, instant coffee is just as delicious 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:20.039
 There is no way to put delicious instant in Kocha house in 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.220
 Should I have to stick to the machine for tea? 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:27.480
 I thought so and bought it Specialty 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:33.449
 This is big except the body Let's drink from now on 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:39.210
 It had been 0 for Fukusasa have now been Ne softening compared to the movement coffee maker and movement 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:40.030
 If you think that you first extracted the village or little by little 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.180
 Extract 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.710
 It does not start 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.710
 It was quite elaborate movement 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:54.840
 Also sooo smell good I am feeling even started something 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:01:00.000
 It smells good compared to being put in a tea bag and something now- 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:04.860
 I think I never I think intently to chat honest cafe tax 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:10.320
 So it's also a good thing to know that you don't know the authentic taste 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:12.159
 Not an accurate comparison because I do not know authentic taste 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.909
 It is delicious 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.909

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.920
 Mr Parker 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:41.170
 Furthermore each floor pump is easy to maintain 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:45.430
 I want to enjoy the taste of real tea many times at home 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:49.450
 That's why I recommend it, and it feels more calm than coffee 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:55.770
 It may simply be that I like tea more than coffee but 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.770
 After There are many flavors this is it is want reviews seat one by one 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.630
