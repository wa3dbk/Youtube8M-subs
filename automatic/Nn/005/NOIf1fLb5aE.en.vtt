00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.580
 classicism is associated with the pagan 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:35.580
 earthly sensual and the exquisiteness of 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.610
 musical forms one of the exponents

 the heart before wealth and being frivolous

 in its creation 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.710
 his concerts were highlighted by the 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.840
 dramatic contrasts in the 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.930
 solo instruments like the piano that

 appeared in this century and the orchestra 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.670
 in his works we find operas and 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.500
 church music where you create a 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.420
 new unit of the vocal part and the 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.360

 slow and alive movements united 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:22.820
 thematically some musical forms 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.740
 of this century were the suite that 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.170
 equals to game and consists of several 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:30.340
 numbers all the same tone but 

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.340
 different characters

 i 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.210
 the leak is a form of composition 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.190
 vocal or instrumental that is made up of 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.350
 several parts and on the principle of 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.360
 imitation in which correspondence 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:53.110
 between the different parts takes 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.110
 until the end 

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:04.400
 another prominent exponent was that libren 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.670
 he began to compose masses and great 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:10.940

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.920
 composers spent hours writing

 last coming out of classicism and 

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:28.710

 the aerostatic balloon appears as 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.870
