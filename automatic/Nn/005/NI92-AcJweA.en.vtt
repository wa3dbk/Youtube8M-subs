top right where it says my name and then

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:50.719 
top right where it says my name and then
there<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.479> home<00:00:48.920> link<00:00:49.920> there's<00:00:50.489> this

there is the home link there's this

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:52.729 
there is the home link there's this
little<00:00:50.969> link<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.629> looks<00:00:51.930> like<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.440> lock

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
little link that looks like a lock

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.700 
little link that looks like a lock
symbol<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.549> if<00:00:54.359> you<00:00:54.449> click<00:00:54.659> on<00:00:54.839> that<00:00:54.899> you'll

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
symbol and if you click on that you'll

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.920 
symbol and if you click on that you'll
notice<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.159> up<00:00:56.280> at<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.460> top<00:00:56.670> here<00:00:56.969> it's<00:00:57.449> called

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
notice it up at the top here it's called

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.959 
notice it up at the top here it's called
privacy<00:00:58.530> shortcuts<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.489> think<00:00:59.729> this<00:00:59.850> is

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
privacy shortcuts and I think this is

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.880 
privacy shortcuts and I think this is
great<00:01:00.119> because<00:01:00.239> if<00:01:00.719> you've<00:01:01.229> watched<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:01.769> my

it and it just gets kind of convoluted
and<00:01:14.520> difficult<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:15.090> do<00:01:15.240> however<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.409> feature

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
and difficult to do however this feature

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.520 
and difficult to do however this feature
makes<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.369> lot<00:01:17.520> easier<00:01:17.580> especially<00:01:17.970> for<00:01:18.810> new

however if I wanted to look at it as a

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.390 
however if I wanted to look at it as a
specific<00:04:01.229> person<00:04:01.799> I<00:04:01.889> could<00:04:02.010> click<00:04:02.159> on<00:04:02.250> this

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
specific person I could click on this

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.520 
specific person I could click on this

view a specific person link and I can go

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.110 
view a specific person link and I can go
ahead<00:04:04.680> and<00:04:04.859> type<00:04:05.010> one<00:04:05.159> of<00:04:05.250> my<00:04:05.310> friends<00:04:05.669> name<00:04:05.879> so

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
ahead and type one of my friends name so

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.729

I<00:04:06.180> could<00:04:06.359> see<00:04:06.569> maybe<00:04:06.720> I<00:04:06.840> posted<00:04:07.290> something<00:04:07.500> and

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
I could see maybe I posted something and

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.500 
I could see maybe I posted something and
I<00:04:07.769> didn't<00:04:07.949> want<00:04:08.129> a<00:04:08.340> certain<00:04:08.849> someone<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:09.329> see

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
I didn't want a certain someone to see

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.089 
I didn't want a certain someone to see
it<00:04:09.629> I<00:04:09.780> could<00:04:10.169> go<00:04:10.290> in<00:04:10.409> here<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:10.680> confirm<00:04:11.069> that

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
it I could go in here and confirm that

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.219 
it I could go in here and confirm that
they<00:04:11.370> cannot<00:04:11.639> see<00:04:11.819> that<00:04:11.970> post<00:04:12.269> so<00:04:13.019> that's

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:13.229 
they cannot see that post so that's

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:14.839 
they cannot see that post so that's
definitely<00:04:13.680> an<00:04:13.739> easier<00:04:14.099> way<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.280> access<00:04:14.819> that

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
definitely an easier way to access that

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.599 
definitely an easier way to access that
setting<00:04:15.419> just<00:04:16.049> going<00:04:16.229> to<00:04:16.289> close<00:04:16.470> that<00:04:16.500> out<00:04:16.829> go

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
setting just going to close that out go

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:18.979 
setting just going to close that out go
back<00:04:17.639> over<00:04:18.030> here<00:04:18.060> to<00:04:18.209> my<00:04:18.359> privacy<00:04:18.720> shortcuts
