00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 Hello everyone, this time I bring you 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.649
 The hello custom edition is the version 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.300
 portable and this one patched by me to 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.490
 that can enter the servers without 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.590
 no problem this link had 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.359
 uploaded in another video where with the help of 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.279
 a patch allowed us to enter the 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.020
 online games 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.529
 Well the link can be found in the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.529
 description 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.110
 once they have downloaded what 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.830
 we are going to do is give you right click and in 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.830
 extract here 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.620
 we wait a few minutes to what 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.620
 decompress 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.080
 while pausing the video 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.520
 We will remain a folder where 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.520
 find the whole game 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.640
 and you should not do anything anymore 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.770
 run and thread point x since as they 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.580
 I had previously commented it is already 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.580
 patched by me 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.490
 how can you see if you upload to the list 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.490
 of the servers 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.910
 just choose the server of your 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.910
 preference 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.820
 I choose this 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.430
 capture the Flag 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.760
 Online games work 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.760
 perfectly 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.230
 excuse me for elda but I'm occupying 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.230
 all the bandwidth 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.770
 here it looks like they're going to take me out of the 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.770
 departure 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.520
 well in this game I put some 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.520
 maps 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.190
 an example of letters 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.400
 capture the Flag 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.400
 why 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.600
 as you can see the whole scenario is 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.600
 similar to minecraft 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.790
 there are other maps it's just a matter of which 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.790
 you see them 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.510
 Well that was it any 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.670
 doubt or problem do not forget to comment and 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.670
 subscribe thanks
