00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 a warm welcome at a time 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.890
 renew christel gameplay this is real 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.960
 old this is really an old video me 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.630
 I found on my computer and me 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.280
 just have to show you alone how 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.529
 above this Santa Claus about it 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.880
 flies and distributes his gifts 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.050
 bit nostalgic must be now 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.600
 somehow just when I am this 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.210
 have seen time and have seen how 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.180
 many damn resources are themselves 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.990
 easy in the first ten seconds only 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.969
 from the mines and collectors picks and there 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.540
 I wonder why is this today? 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.690
 no more 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.980
 I also want to find that again 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.500
 is actually the only reason why 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.200
 I'm uploading this fight now 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.570
 technically not really fighting 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.760
 challenging but it just works 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.719
 down like oil when you see how much 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.860
 Gold comes out of such a mine and 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.690
 that still against the council of tens 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.829
 thinks yes I would have an advice 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.390
 the new attacked 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.809
 let alone anyone 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.000
 Freighter attacked I would have peeked 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.799
 the shit how much we like it 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.290
 many resources came out of it 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.740
 be that I hardly dare to 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.869
 doubt 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.360
 he has half a million in one 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.960
 minute what else I would like in 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.369
 every case every day then i will 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.590
 quickly finished with my walls there 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.909
 you can not watch but would 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.140
 get bored somehow too 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.159
 if you had only ever attack so 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.479
 but nonetheless it's a cool one 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.460
 jagger at least really good luck 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.049
 had so much gold to find and me 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.250
 You just have to be alone because of that 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.530
 Santa Claus at the beginning again 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.119
 I can hardly remember this 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.560
 Remember that this time I looked like that 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.350
 Let's see if we are this year 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.960
 halloween again great gourds get 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.590
 become 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.140
 and I think it's a pity 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.610
 that in summer not so horny 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.869
 any cool you know what 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.399
 I mean well that was actually 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.689
 simply only so short video about you 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.890
 to show it again like it 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.850
 Some people actually looked like that back then 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.890
 I found I might not 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.820
 well know in any case thank you 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.710
 for the attention can be a 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:08.420
 thank you for watching and this loaded 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:12.590
 this one lags there even remains 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:17.440

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.440
