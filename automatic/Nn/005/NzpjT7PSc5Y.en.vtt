00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.840
 very good to everyone from the channel lp I am 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.790
 mad and we are in a new episode of 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.770
 top gear for all that six new 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.720
 If you do not know what a top 10 is, it's the 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.970
 set of champions that stronger 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.290
 are at a certain moment and in a 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.790
 certain position 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.580
 concretely we will talk about the 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:56.990
 top champions have the yard and 5.9 and in 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:58.760
 the position of the mid lane we begin 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.769
 Burgos 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.089
 then zoom champion that is being 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:06.049
 playing to the extent that in really 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:07.729
 that meat and in fact I think that 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.439
 I should have appeared on the top 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.210
 tier champions of meat has not 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.100
 appeared surely because most 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.720
 of top lists you have to consulted to 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.759
 do these top has to do in 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.470
 North America and North America do not 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.600
 finish playing at all in the bold 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.290
 line but rather in the mille and it 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.750
 has become very fashionable think 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.030
 how to highlight from burgos that is a 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.040
 champion who is very bully on the line that 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.380
 is perfectly adapted to the current 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.040
 goal of tanks that do a lot 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:39.400
 damage and especially that you can create from 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.220
 absurd distances and more for all this 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.880
 Burgos is a champion who occupies a 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:50.080
 position in our top 10 champions of 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.140
 half of the patch 5.9 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.370
 ari is a champion ap that is played in the 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.800
 medium and that the truth is that it is 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.390
 very complete and that is why it is very strong 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.460
 in the goal apart from having a few 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.760
 pretty high ratios is a champion that 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.570
 has poke or true damage has a cc 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.700
 great with his charme in the in the e and 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.850
 also with his last one and he has a lot 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.770
 mobility which allows you to run away from those 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.290
 scams that try to focus 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.770
 even dodge them for tele will make you 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.520
 a carry and leave the team fight 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.960
 practically with an amazing ease 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.910
 He is also a champion who scales 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.320
 relatively well compared to others 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.790
 champions who have a line phase 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:37.300
 similar and that is very very very fashionable and 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.650
 very strong in the goal for all this ari 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:46.350
 occupies a position in our top tier 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:48.250
 champions of the 1020 the patch 5.9 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.230
 to me 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.060
 an is an ap champion that is played in the 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.200
 medium even of support and that stands out 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.260
 for having a girls phase 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.790
 relatively easy to play in which 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.210
 you can not get ahead much because 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.610
 you have a lot of mobility let's say that farm 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.700
 It's really good with your skins that 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.310
 contributes cc and a lot of damage bus what 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.950
 which makes it a gun receiver that 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.630
 of your own amazing jungle besides there's 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.190
 have to say that he is one of the champions in 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.200
 the milan that currently have 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.540
 better team fight since annie is a 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.140
 super champion so much to start them 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.320
 how to make an age design has 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.940
 kept eager besides I already say it appears 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.470
 in this list not because it's in the 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.420
 Today a mid leiner really 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.880
 competitive but because in just that in 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.660
 the news is the mid liner as more 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:40.780
 win ratio of all the länder of all 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:44.790
 the regions and that's why and not because 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:50.340
 competitive appears in our top 10 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.340
 champions of the mid line of the patch 5.9 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.540
 A) Yes 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.640
 this is a champion that is Juan Lavín and 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.590
 which is quite curious because it is a 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.930
 combination between a champion who 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.300
 moves a lot for its basic attacks and 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.950
 for his skills is also one of the 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.450
 few very nice you know what I'm going to do 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.640
 a kind of inssec and take out of 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.770
 position not only to an objective but 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.390
 even several advisory that is a 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.550
 kind of wall that pushes the 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.769
 opposites and is also highlighting in 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.470
 currently for being the champion ap 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.620
 the mid link that in lady game can do 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.770
 more damage to champions in 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.080
 a game for all this is like this 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.300
 champion who occupies a position in 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.550
 our top tier champions of the mid 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.700
 lane of the patch 5.9 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.020
 leblanc owes to that he is a champion ap is 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.150
 water in the middle and that carries 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.030
 starring the top 10 of the mld in 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.290
 many patches despite everything in 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.120
 mouth of most professionals 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.590
 consider is gradually 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.660
 leaving the doctor and leaving 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.240
 even the goal because it is not 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.210
 the best when it comes to spelling tanks 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.550
 in games lasting more than 35 minutes 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.590
 that are now the immense 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.990
 Most, on the other hand, means 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.550
 that in the hands of skilled players 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.620
 has a brutal line phase and a 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.570
 incredible snowball ability and for 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.270
 that players like fake air can 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:13.300
 get a tremendous match to this 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.550
 champion on the other hand his line phase 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.020
 it's getting a little worse in 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.210
 view of which champions like ur goto 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.800
 Cassiopeia that can with her in the 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.800
 phase of lines and that are also scaled 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.750
 much better are very strong in this 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.790
 goal despite everything 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.550
 leblanc continues to be one of the 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:33.270
 champions who occupy our top tier 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.900
 champions of the mls line in the patch 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.750
 5.9 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.009
 cassiopeia cassiopeia is a champion ap 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.360
 that is played in the medium that suffers a 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:43.389
 rival who does not too long and who 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.229
 he got tremendously ope to the point 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:49.419
 to be peak or go in all the games 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.289
 competitive the river decided to put a 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:52.300
 er ugly 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:54.070
 and despite everything almost obvious follows 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.930
 being very strong and still in the 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.400
 top 10 considering that he is a champion that 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.310
 has a phase of lines with a drug 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.960
 brutal with a lot burst even 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.750
 besides burst thing that is little 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.759
 frequent busti continued damage has 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.520
 sustain of mana and life on the line and 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:11.860
 a ultimate that is capable of giving the 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.810
 return to a tim fain if you also 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.720
 we add that he is a champion ap who can 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:19.720
 remove with skills as if it were one of 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.880
 meat and using its course all this 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.130
 turns Cassiopeia into an authentic 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.600
 killing machine that is very strong in 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.449
 this goal and that occupies a position 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:32.680
 privileged in our top 10 champions 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:34.990
 from the mls line the patch 5.9 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.669
 and nothing more guys this is all with the 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.960
 patch 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:39.310
 yes that is true what some people 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.710
 you have commented on some comments 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.150
 that some champions are missing and others are 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.639
 in changing positions I have given 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:48.009
 realize that it's because the lists in the 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:49.990
 most of them actually consulted 

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:51.729
 four pages three of them are from 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.800
 North America and for example as I have 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:56.350
 commented on the case of burgos burgos is 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.880
 a champion who plays America 

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.240
 more in the middle than meat day and for 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:03.160
 that does not appear on the list of adeca riis 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.320
 then there are rare cases like annie's 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:09.009
 which refers in sole and exclusively 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.150
 to the victories that he has in only one club and 

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:11.770
 what I'm going to do from now on 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:15.099
 the top you want is to comment on these 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.690
 otherwise smaller cases often 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:18.310
 you tell me that x champion is more 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:20.199
 strong in the one against one think that 

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:23.440
 these top you have are made based on 

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:25.479
 the wing ratio and in the victories over 

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.699
 everything in competitive what is played what 

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:29.800
 that is not played and so on, they are not worth 

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:32.620
 one champion is better than another in the one 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:35.650
 against one and nothing else to lay it out video 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:37.449
 You have of course liked to subscribe 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.939
 to the channel if you are not subscribed 

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:41.559
 What helps me the most is that I publish 

00:07:39.939 --> 00:07:43.900
 this on your social networks so that 

00:07:41.559 --> 00:07:46.419
 people can see it many thanks 

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:49.259
 I am more of the pro academic we see ourselves in 

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:49.259
 the next video
