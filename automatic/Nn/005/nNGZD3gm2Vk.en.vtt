00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
motorola droid razr maxx the problem was

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.189 
motorola droid razr maxx the problem was
that<00:00:24.930> since<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.830> max<00:00:26.220> version<00:00:26.820> um<00:00:27.199> i

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
that since this is the max version um i

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.310 
that since this is the max version um i
guess<00:00:28.410> there's<00:00:28.769> not<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:28.949> many<00:00:29.250> out<00:00:29.640> yet<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.320> i

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
guess there's not that many out yet so i

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.650 
guess there's not that many out yet so i
was<00:00:31.529> looking<00:00:31.769> on<00:00:31.890> amazon<00:00:32.070> on<00:00:32.520> ebay<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:32.969> you

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
was looking on amazon on ebay and you

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.380 
was looking on amazon on ebay and you
know<00:00:34.010> these<00:00:35.010> are<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.280> only<00:00:35.460> two<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:35.940> i<00:00:36.000> found

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.950 
know these are the only two that i found
and<00:00:36.860> i<00:00:37.860> bought<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.309> one<00:00:38.520> first<00:00:38.960> originally

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
and i bought this one first originally

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.510 
and i bought this one first originally
because<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.290> was<00:00:40.410> cheaper<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.770> ebay<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.340> it

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
because it was cheaper on ebay and it

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.069 
because it was cheaper on ebay and it
didn't<00:00:41.790> look<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:41.910> bad<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.510> picture<00:00:42.899> but

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
didn't look that bad in the picture but

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.779 
didn't look that bad in the picture but
now<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.559> i<00:00:43.710> see<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:44.309> cuff<00:00:45.090> lindsey<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.840> and

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
now that i see it cuff lindsey it is and

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:53.630 
now that i see it cuff lindsey it is and
once<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.910> put<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:49.370> you<00:00:50.370> know<00:00:51.110> it's<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.640> if

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
once you put it on you know it's like if

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.779 
once you put it on you know it's like if
you<00:00:53.820> can<00:00:53.969> see<00:00:54.270> how<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.840> dips<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.949> creates<00:00:56.579> this

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
you can see how it dips it creates this

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.020 
you can see how it dips it creates this
like<00:00:57.140> concave<00:00:58.140> arc<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:59.340> doesn't<00:00:59.760> really

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
like concave arc that doesn't really

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.240 
like concave arc that doesn't really
protect<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.629> side<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.079> phone<00:01:01.289> like<00:01:02.100> you

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
protect the side of the phone like you

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.690 
protect the side of the phone like you
can<00:01:02.399> try<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.609> make<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.539> snap<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.320> there<00:01:04.589> but<00:01:05.250> you

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
can try to make it snap on there but you

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.179 
can try to make it snap on there but you
let<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.000> go<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.420> just<00:01:06.950> drooped<00:01:07.950> soap

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
let it go and it just drooped soap

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.000 
let it go and it just drooped soap
droops<00:01:08.610> down<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.030> side<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.450> phone<00:01:10.010> so

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
droops down the side of the phone so

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.719 
droops down the side of the phone so
that<00:01:11.040> probably<00:01:11.970> wouldn't<00:01:12.240> protect<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.780> um

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
that probably wouldn't protect it um

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.850 
that probably wouldn't protect it um
doesn't<00:01:14.729> look<00:01:14.909> very<00:01:15.030> nice<00:01:15.479> like<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.080> hold<00:01:16.590> it

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
doesn't look very nice like you hold it

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.070 
doesn't look very nice like you hold it
like<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.759> i<00:01:17.850> were<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.240> put<00:01:18.299> my<00:01:18.600> finger<00:01:19.049> right

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
like if i were to put my finger right

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.840 
like if i were to put my finger right
here<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.680> know<00:01:19.740> well<00:01:20.159> I'm<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.400> my<00:01:20.549> phone<00:01:20.820> or

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
here you know well I'm on my phone or

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.109 
here you know well I'm on my phone or
something<00:01:21.150> it'll<00:01:21.540> just<00:01:21.780> bend<00:01:22.880> it's<00:01:23.880> just

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
something it'll just bend it's just

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.260 
something it'll just bend it's just
really<00:01:24.360> flimsy<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:26.009> not<00:01:26.130> very<00:01:26.189> large<00:01:26.549> one

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
really flimsy this is not very large one

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.630 
really flimsy this is not very large one
thing<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.750> if<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.619> have<00:01:28.650> an<00:01:28.829> auxiliary<00:01:29.250> cable

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
thing is if you have an auxiliary cable

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.210 
thing is if you have an auxiliary cable
you<00:01:29.759> try<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.000> plug<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.829> it<00:01:31.829> kind<00:01:32.159> of

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
you try to plug it in and it kind of

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.450 
you try to plug it in and it kind of
blocks<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:33.509> way<00:01:33.750> for<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.110> auxiliary<00:01:34.619> cable

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
blocks the way for the auxiliary cable

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.380 
blocks the way for the auxiliary cable
um<00:01:36.020> this<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.200> kind<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.470> too<00:01:38.250> big<00:01:38.460> for<00:01:39.030> me<00:01:39.150> I

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
um this is kind of too big for me I

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.060 
um this is kind of too big for me I
don't<00:01:39.869> like<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.439> leaves<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.740> lot<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.920> the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
don't like it it leaves a lot of the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.990 
don't like it it leaves a lot of the
phone<00:01:41.250> unprotected<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.920> I<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:44.729> don't<00:01:44.850> like

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
the overall finish it has to it looks

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.920 
the overall finish it has to it looks
really<00:01:48.479> rubbery<00:01:49.110> really<00:01:49.649> ugly<00:01:50.750> it's<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.810> nice

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
is ugly so then let's go over here to

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.959 
is ugly so then let's go over here to
the<00:01:58.610> to<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.960> verizon<00:02:00.960> one<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:02.579> could<00:02:02.759> tell

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
the to the verizon one you could tell

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.209 
the to the verizon one you could tell
that<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.570> know<00:02:03.780> it's<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.049> lot<00:02:04.229> stiffer<00:02:04.619> than

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
that you know it's a lot stiffer than

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.940 
that you know it's a lot stiffer than
this<00:02:05.399> one<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:06.420> snaps<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:07.140> well<00:02:07.409> once<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.740> put

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
this one it snaps on well once you put

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.990
