00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.140
 3200 port killed during the Christmas season 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.230
 milka brands are big 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.459
 lovers of this meat slaughter 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.460
 traditional is less and less 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:19.980
 widespread like many breeders 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.910
 nadine la martinière chose to use 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.190
 services of the departmental slaughterhouse 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.670
 report is ready is shot after 180 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:33.120
 days of feeding ie six 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.530
 month once past this stage there we go 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.990
 say that losing money because 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.950
 should already after 180 days have 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:45.050
 to have reached its weight ie 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.100
 between 90 and 100 kg live weight 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.410
 because you have to know that when the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.630
 port arrives at the slaughterhouse us at the level 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.470
 of our cooperative we are paid weight 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.630
 carcass and not live weight 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.989
 so we have more interest in sending 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.180
 wolf pigs that pigs the jdl to 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.479
 transport level 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.249
 So as bridge breeder as I 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.359
 am brought times to carry me 

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:12.569
 even my animals at the slaughterhouse 

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:15.780
 I do animal welfare training 

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:18.719
 so it is necessary that at the level of the vehicle 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:24.889
 so they're anti slippery they 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:28.319
 are waterproof and that it is a ramp 

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:30.030
 so access to the car and once 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:32.450

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.060
