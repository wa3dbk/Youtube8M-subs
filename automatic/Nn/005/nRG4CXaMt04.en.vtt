any chemical fertilizers the beautiful
thing<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.700> that<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.299> can<00:00:15.330> produce<00:00:15.660> it<00:00:16.430> with

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
thing is that you can produce it with

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.849 
thing is that you can produce it with
whatever<00:00:18.930> nature<00:00:19.410> gives<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:21.230> if<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.410> use<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
proper methods then you can even have a

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.859 
proper methods then you can even have a
yield<00:00:26.279> which<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.699> absolutely<00:00:26.970> comparable<00:00:27.840> and

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
yield which is absolutely comparable and

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.630 
yield which is absolutely comparable and
the<00:00:30.869> value<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.439> particular<00:00:32.040> for<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.369> small

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
the value is in particular for the small

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.430 
the value is in particular for the small
farmers<00:00:33.180> because<00:00:33.600> they<00:00:33.780> don't<00:00:33.930> have<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.230> spend

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
farmers because they don't have to spend

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.990 
farmers because they don't have to spend
money<00:00:34.680> on<00:00:34.800> chemicals<00:00:36.590> but<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.739> requires<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.610> bit

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
money on chemicals but it requires a bit

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.319 
money on chemicals but it requires a bit
more<00:00:39.030> work<00:00:40.129> but<00:00:41.129> it's<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.610> holistic<00:00:42.180> approach

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
more work but it's a holistic approach

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.250 
more work but it's a holistic approach
meaning<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:44.030> the<00:00:45.030> whole<00:00:45.239> world<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.780> treated

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
meaning that the whole world is treated

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.029 
meaning that the whole world is treated
as<00:00:46.379> an<00:00:46.559> organism<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:49.070> instead<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.449> say<00:00:51.449> having

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
as an organism and instead of say having

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.430 
as an organism and instead of say having
monocultures<00:00:53.420> you<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:55.640> smaller<00:00:56.640> places

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
monocultures you have smaller places

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.260 
monocultures you have smaller places
where<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.710> expose<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.399> cotton<00:00:59.760> not<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.090> much

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
where you expose the cotton not so much

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.619 
where you expose the cotton not so much
to<00:01:00.510> insects<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.680> chemicals<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.449> it's<00:01:03.570> a

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
to insects and chemicals so it's a

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:26.110 
to insects and chemicals so it's a
beautiful<00:01:04.080> thing

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.020 

still<00:01:27.120> organic<00:01:27.659> cotton<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.610> it's<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.850> very
