00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
lazer sharp and it's a great hook for

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.370 
lazer sharp and it's a great hook for
weeding<00:01:00.950> out<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:01.370> smaller<00:01:01.700> calicoes<00:01:02.360> lots<00:01:03.290> of

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
weeding out the smaller calicoes lots of

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.719 
weeding out the smaller calicoes lots of
times<00:01:03.560> when<00:01:03.710> we're<00:01:03.800> calico<00:01:04.189> fishing<00:01:04.549> you

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
times when we're calico fishing you

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.160 
times when we're calico fishing you
catch<00:01:04.939> a<00:01:05.059> lot<00:01:05.239> of<00:01:05.269> shorts<00:01:05.689> you<00:01:05.810> don't<00:01:05.960> want<00:01:06.110> to

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
catch a lot of shorts you don't want to

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.050 
catch a lot of shorts you don't want to
hurt<00:01:06.259> those<00:01:06.439> fish<00:01:06.740> and<00:01:07.310> what<00:01:07.430> a<00:01:07.460> circle<00:01:07.880> hook

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
hurt those fish and what a circle hook

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.359 
hurt those fish and what a circle hook
does<00:01:08.329> is<00:01:08.900> it<00:01:09.229> allows<00:01:09.530> you<00:01:09.740> to<00:01:09.860> hook<00:01:10.040> the<00:01:10.189> fish

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
does is it allows you to hook the fish

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.160 
does is it allows you to hook the fish
around<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.640> corner<00:01:11.000> of<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.150> jaw<00:01:11.390> and<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:12.140> eye

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
around the corner of the jaw and the eye

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.990 
around the corner of the jaw and the eye
of<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.650> hook<00:01:12.829> is<00:01:13.070> outside<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:13.640> fish's<00:01:13.970> mouth

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
of the hook is outside the fish's mouth

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.180 
of the hook is outside the fish's mouth
so<00:01:14.780> it<00:01:14.900> never<00:01:15.230> hurts<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:15.680> fish<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.130> other

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
so it never hurts the fish the other

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.610 
so it never hurts the fish the other
advantage<00:01:16.760> to<00:01:16.790> this<00:01:17.090> is<00:01:17.300> that<00:01:17.780> Barracuda<00:01:18.230> swim

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
advantage to this is that Barracuda swim

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.890 
advantage to this is that Barracuda swim
by<00:01:18.890> lots<00:01:19.610> of<00:01:19.700> times<00:01:19.940> we<00:01:20.090> lose<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.390> Barracuda

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
by lots of times we lose the Barracuda

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.330 
by lots of times we lose the Barracuda
because<00:01:21.080> they'll<00:01:21.260> swallow<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:21.920> whole<00:01:22.070> hook

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
because they'll swallow the whole hook

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.100 
because they'll swallow the whole hook
in<00:01:22.520> line<00:01:22.730> and<00:01:23.030> their<00:01:23.480> teeth<00:01:23.720> are<00:01:23.900> so<00:01:24.080> sharp

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
in line and their teeth are so sharp

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.590 
in line and their teeth are so sharp
they'll<00:01:24.860> bite<00:01:25.100> right<00:01:25.310> through<00:01:25.670> it<00:01:25.850> but<00:01:26.450> with

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
they'll bite right through it but with

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.660 
they'll bite right through it but with
the<00:01:26.720> circle<00:01:27.110> hook<00:01:27.290> again<00:01:27.950> that<00:01:28.159> hook<00:01:28.370> is<00:01:28.490> gonna

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
the circle hook again that hook is gonna

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.250 
the circle hook again that hook is gonna
be<00:01:28.729> right<00:01:28.909> in<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.030> corner<00:01:29.300> of<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:29.479> jaw<00:01:29.690> the

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
be right in the corner of the jaw the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.660 
be right in the corner of the jaw the
eye<00:01:30.290> of<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.680> hook<00:01:30.800> is<00:01:30.950> going<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.190> be<00:01:31.280> outside

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
eye of the hook is going to be outside

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.760 
eye of the hook is going to be outside
their<00:01:31.909> mouth<00:01:32.060> so<00:01:32.659> the<00:01:32.780> fish's<00:01:33.260> teeth<00:01:33.530> will

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
their mouth so the fish's teeth will

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.680 
their mouth so the fish's teeth will
never<00:01:34.070> touch<00:01:34.370> the<00:01:34.550> monofilament<00:01:34.970> your

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
never touch the monofilament your

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.270

swim freely when it's in the water
that's

that's

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.900 
that's
I<00:02:24.050> have<00:02:24.260> that<00:02:24.440> loop<00:02:24.650> when<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:25.400> tie<00:02:25.610> it<00:02:25.670> when

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
I have that loop when you tie it when

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.340 
I have that loop when you tie it when
you're<00:02:26.030> actually<00:02:26.420> fishing<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.930> loop<00:02:27.080> will<00:02:27.230> be

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
you're actually fishing the loop will be

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.260 
you're actually fishing the loop will be
a<00:02:27.380> little<00:02:27.590> bit<00:02:27.680> smaller<00:02:28.040> but<00:02:28.820> I<00:02:28.880> just<00:02:29.090> have<00:02:29.240> a

a little bit smaller but I just have a
little<00:02:29.720> bit<00:02:29.840> bigger<00:02:29.960> one<00:02:30.200> here<00:02:30.290> so<00:02:30.440> you<00:02:30.530> can

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
little bit bigger one here so you can

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.370 
little bit bigger one here so you can
see<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:31.010> now<00:02:31.730> when<00:02:32.660> we<00:02:32.750> start<00:02:32.990> fishing<00:02:33.170> the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
Calico the fish would be a little bit

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.730 
Calico the fish would be a little bit
deeper<00:02:35.120> in<00:02:35.210> the<00:02:35.300> kelp<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.780> today<00:02:36.470> we<00:02:36.590> have<00:02:36.710> a

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.620 
deeper in the kelp and today we have a
little<00:02:36.920> bit<00:02:37.130> more<00:02:37.250> current<00:02:37.730> so<00:02:38.180> you<00:02:38.210> want<00:02:38.510> to
