00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
with and like I said your icing needs to

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.510 
with and like I said your icing needs to
be<00:01:44.630> hard<00:01:44.959> in<00:01:45.259> order<00:01:45.470> to<00:01:45.619> do<00:01:45.830> this<00:01:45.979> I<00:01:46.159> usually

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
be hard in order to do this I usually

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.249 
be hard in order to do this I usually
let<00:01:46.670> it<00:01:46.819> dry<00:01:46.970> overnight<00:01:47.149> before<00:01:47.479> I<00:01:47.659> try<00:01:47.899> it<00:01:47.959> but

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
let it dry overnight before I try it but

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.440 
let it dry overnight before I try it but
we're<00:01:48.440> gonna<00:01:48.590> try<00:01:48.770> it<00:01:48.830> anyway<00:01:49.209> for<00:01:50.209> the<00:01:50.270> sake

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
we're gonna try it anyway for the sake

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.289 
we're gonna try it anyway for the sake
of<00:01:50.509> this<00:01:50.750> video<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:52.340> you<00:01:52.399> just<00:01:52.670> dip<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.149> tip

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
of this video and you just dip the tip

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.109 
of this video and you just dip the tip
of<00:01:53.479> your<00:01:53.539> toothpick<00:01:54.170> in<00:01:54.590> that<00:01:55.399> food<00:01:55.640> coloring

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
of your toothpick in that food coloring

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.300 
of your toothpick in that food coloring
and<00:01:56.720> you<00:01:57.159> use<00:01:58.159> that<00:01:59.259> and<00:02:00.259> just<00:02:00.530> draw<00:02:00.859> very

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
and you use that and just draw very

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.870 
and you use that and just draw very
softly<00:02:02.439> because<00:02:03.439> even<00:02:04.219> though<00:02:04.369> this<00:02:04.490> icing

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
softly because even though this icing

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.590 
softly because even though this icing
does<00:02:05.180> harden<00:02:05.840> pretty<00:02:06.229> hard<00:02:07.030> it's<00:02:08.030> only<00:02:08.390> the

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
does harden pretty hard it's only the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.660 
does harden pretty hard it's only the
top<00:02:08.869> that<00:02:09.109> hardens<00:02:09.590> underneath<00:02:10.100> it<00:02:10.310> stays

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
top that hardens underneath it stays

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.729 
top that hardens underneath it stays
fairly<00:02:11.030> soft<00:02:12.190> so<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:14.090> can<00:02:14.140> dent<00:02:15.140> into<00:02:15.500> your
