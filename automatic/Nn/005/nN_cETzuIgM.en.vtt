00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:12.769
 I do not understand 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.959
 hello very good to all how are you 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.930
 today mister if I have a new video 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:20.119
 we are here in a new combat one 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.820
 new simulation is the combat of this 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.789
 same night they are going to face 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.150
 game 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.699
 in the big red monster against said 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.250
 rolling in a one-on-one match 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.710
 level crime and why I do this 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.410
 good 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.530
 I take the opportunity to inform you that 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.059
 this channel is only going to have more going to 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.590
 keep doing wrestling I'm going to 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.989
 finish the slides workflow of 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.430
 enable I'm going to terminal of rachid and 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.579
 I'm not going to upload other games or I'm going 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.890
 to go up wrestling and good guess what 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.739
 in a secondary channel would start to climb 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.260
 what would be we speak 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.449
 with combat as you already know what to imitate 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.690
 the bryant are going to face each other in a 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.580
 combat that nor also against me 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.039
 if the now if I explained wrong but 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.420
 fight two against two for the titles 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:10.580
 by couples say that it will be 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.100
 represented by romÃ¡n reid and set 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.890
 bowling and they will face in a 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.160
 tornado texting match in extreme rules 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.530
 a very interesting combat and of 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.649
 big bros seems like it's going to be like 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.780
 up there because it seems everything points 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.810
 that will win the title of the us in 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.890
 Russian management to butt and kingston 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.350
 something for which I vote well this 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.740
 I think it's a good idea it was time to 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.399
 give something important to say because no 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.350
 had nothing with respect to others 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.780
 they had won a lot they had said damage to 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.179
 the fighters but they had not got 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.450
 nothing and now if they get the titles 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.909
 per couple and the US title could 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.259
 get to do much more damage and with this 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:03.080
 that there may be a room or a room 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.000
 Fourth member of the sil that good as it is 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.640
 quite interesting as series could 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.340
 put a fourth member pretty big 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.440
 quite high to aim for a title 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.290
 larger as the heavy weight or the 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.019
 of video is and could do to say 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.730
 much more interesting but good and 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.440
 we will see what happens in extreme 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.420
 rules 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.580
 with this well then possibly 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:31.700
 make more main event videos of 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.710
 smackdown and of these things because I 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.270
 I want in marketing to get more into the 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.970
 mundillo the rest impose this channel that 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.400
 really the way on the west side 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.740
 so it seems to me it seems good 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.450
 idea to dedicate myself to this in this channel and in 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.450
 another more like a little more hobby 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.200
 let's continue with the fight that I'm leaving 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:59.590
 by other sides 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.420
 what was going to be tonight the 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.519
 relationships on Tuesdays remember it 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.920
 so I hope so good all the 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.450
 Wednesday bring a combat in combat 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.440
 taxi what 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:16.090
 but already at a good level I do not have much 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:19.959
 more so we see each other more tomorrow I hope 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.490
 tomorrow to be able to go up 22 combats of stein 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.370
 rules 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.720
 and nothing we see in the next I hope 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.930
