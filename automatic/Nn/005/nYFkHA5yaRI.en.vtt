today<00:00:00.900> we're<00:00:01.170> going<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.439> show<00:00:01.680> how<00:00:01.920> to

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
today we're going to show how to

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.550 
today we're going to show how to
refinish<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.700> plastic<00:00:03.300> picture<00:00:03.629> frame<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:04.410> look

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
refinish a plastic picture frame to look

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.000 
refinish a plastic picture frame to look
like<00:00:04.770> it's<00:00:04.950> made<00:00:05.190> of<00:00:05.250> rusted<00:00:06.000> sheet<00:00:06.299> metal<00:00:07.010> now

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
like it's made of rusted sheet metal now

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.820 
like it's made of rusted sheet metal now
we've<00:00:08.189> covered<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.820> rust<00:00:09.290> technique<00:00:10.290> before

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
we've covered the rust technique before

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.530 
we've covered the rust technique before
but<00:00:11.490> in<00:00:11.610> this<00:00:11.700> video<00:00:11.880> we're<00:00:12.179> going<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.420> show

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
but in this video we're going to show

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.270 
but in this video we're going to show
some<00:00:12.900> additional<00:00:13.320> techniques<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.980> really

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
some additional techniques to really

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.660 
some additional techniques to really
punch<00:00:14.610> up<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.910> realism<00:00:15.299> on<00:00:16.130> props<00:00:17.130> like<00:00:17.400> this

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
punch up the realism on props like this

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.130 
punch up the realism on props like this
and<00:00:18.029> parts<00:00:18.359> like<00:00:18.539> this<00:00:18.720> where<00:00:18.900> you're

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
and parts like this where you're

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.390 
and parts like this where you're
simulating<00:00:20.060> rusted<00:00:21.060> iron<00:00:21.300> or<00:00:21.630> steel<00:00:22.220> now<00:00:23.220> one

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
simulating rusted iron or steel now one

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.590 
simulating rusted iron or steel now one
of<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.550> first<00:00:23.699> little<00:00:24.029> tricks<00:00:24.180> we're<00:00:24.359> going

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
of the first little tricks we're going

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.230 
of the first little tricks we're going
to<00:00:24.689> do<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.560> make<00:00:25.740> this<00:00:25.890> look<00:00:26.130> like<00:00:26.189> it's<00:00:26.609> welded

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
to do to make this look like it's welded

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.410 
to do to make this look like it's welded
steel<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.930> create<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.560> welds<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:30.060> almost

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
steel is create the welds and I almost

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.200 
steel is create the welds and I almost
hate<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.810> give<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.230> away<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.920> use<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.820> hot<00:00:33.180> glue

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
hate to give this away I use a hot glue

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.020 
hate to give this away I use a hot glue
gun<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.930> create<00:00:34.410> welds<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.579> you'd<00:00:35.910> be

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
gun to create welds and you'd be

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.260 
gun to create welds and you'd be
surprised<00:00:36.600> how<00:00:36.870> convincing<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:38.030> now<00:00:39.030> in

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
surprised how convincing this is now in

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.229 
surprised how convincing this is now in
addition<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.989> our<00:00:40.020> our<00:00:40.620> faux<00:00:41.370> welds<00:00:42.000> here

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
addition to our our faux welds here

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.299 
addition to our our faux welds here
we're<00:00:42.480> creating<00:00:42.629> we<00:00:43.500> also<00:00:43.680> want<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.129> add<00:00:44.280> some

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
we're creating we also want to add some

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.000 
we're creating we also want to add some
hardware<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.780> appears<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.890> be

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
hardware that that appears to to be

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.029 
hardware that that appears to to be
sheet<00:00:47.309> metal<00:00:47.640> screws<00:00:48.030> which<00:00:48.899> for<00:00:49.739> some

gluing in place here but keep in mind

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.960 
gluing in place here but keep in mind
you<00:01:07.049> could<00:01:07.200> actually<00:01:07.350> use<00:01:07.920> real<00:01:08.040> sheet<00:01:08.700> metal

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
you could actually use real sheet metal

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.750 
you could actually use real sheet metal
screws<00:01:09.299> just<00:01:09.659> cut<00:01:09.930> off<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.860> again<00:01:11.250> either<00:01:11.400> hot

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
screws just cut off and again either hot

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.050 
screws just cut off and again either hot
glued<00:01:12.119> or<00:01:12.420> use<00:01:13.380> some<00:01:13.560> epoxy<00:01:14.220> or<00:01:14.250> superglue<00:01:15.030> to

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
glued or use some epoxy or superglue to

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.010 
glued or use some epoxy or superglue to
anchor<00:01:15.540> those<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.869> place<00:01:16.140> but<00:01:17.100> again<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:18.060> for

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
anchor those in place but again I for

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.890 
anchor those in place but again I for
some<00:01:19.320> reason<00:01:19.799> people<00:01:20.549> associate<00:01:21.270> bolts<00:01:21.750> and

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
some reason people associate bolts and

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.320 
some reason people associate bolts and
screws<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.439> such<00:01:22.619> with<00:01:22.860> steel<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.820> adding

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
screws and such with steel so adding

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.149 
screws and such with steel so adding
this<00:01:24.479> little<00:01:24.540> touch<00:01:25.049> here<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:25.590> really<00:01:25.979> adds

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
this little touch here just really adds

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.830 
this little touch here just really adds
a<00:01:26.310> lot<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.640> realism<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.479> piece<00:01:27.659> like

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
a lot to the realism of a piece like

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.890 
a lot to the realism of a piece like
this<00:01:28.340> now<00:01:29.340> once<00:01:29.640> our<00:01:29.790> screw<00:01:30.299> heads<00:01:30.600> are<00:01:30.780> in

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
this now once our screw heads are in

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.109 
this now once our screw heads are in
place<00:01:31.170> we're<00:01:31.530> ready<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:32.009> start<00:01:32.430> applying<00:01:32.880> our

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
place we're ready to start applying our

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.840 
place we're ready to start applying our
primer<00:01:33.570> now<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> primate<00:01:35.490> primer

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
primer now this is the primate primer

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.109 
primer now this is the primate primer
and<00:01:36.180> keep<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:36.990> mind<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.369> very

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
and keep in mind that this is a very

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.969 
and keep in mind that this is a very
crucial<00:01:39.509> stage<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.290> don't<00:01:40.470> want<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.770> skip

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
crucial stage you don't want to skip

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.670 
crucial stage you don't want to skip
this<00:01:41.159> because<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:42.150> primate<00:01:42.780> primer<00:01:43.079> bonds

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
this because the primate primer bonds

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.490 
this because the primate primer bonds
incredibly<00:01:44.490> well<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:45.090> plastic<00:01:45.689> surfaces<00:01:46.290> like

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
incredibly well to plastic surfaces like

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.520 
incredibly well to plastic surfaces like
this<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.369> when<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:47.939> doubt<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.540> good<00:01:49.259> coat<00:01:49.500> of

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
this so when in doubt a good coat of

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.980 
this so when in doubt a good coat of
this<00:01:49.829> or<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.280> couple<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.759> coats<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.360> over

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
this or a couple of coats of this over

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.050 
this or a couple of coats of this over
your<00:01:52.110> plastic<00:01:52.649> surface<00:01:53.130> will<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:53.790> give<00:01:53.970> you

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
your plastic surface will just give you

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.120 
your plastic surface will just give you
that<00:01:54.540> much<00:01:54.750> more<00:01:54.990> insurance<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.649> your<00:01:55.799> metal

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
that much more insurance that your metal

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.370 
that much more insurance that your metal
coating<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.700> going<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.329> stay<00:01:57.540> put<00:01:57.810> where<00:01:58.140> you

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
coating is going to stay put where you

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.039

applying this with a brush but to keep
in<00:02:03.270> mind<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:03.750> also<00:02:03.840> spray<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.710> on<00:02:04.950> using

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
in mind you can also spray this on using

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.109 
in mind you can also spray this on using
an<00:02:05.490> HVLP<00:02:05.939> gun<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.860> usually<00:02:07.860> prefer<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.759> use<00:02:08.970> an

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
an HVLP gun I usually prefer to use an

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.029 
an HVLP gun I usually prefer to use an
HVLP<00:02:09.509> sprayer<00:02:09.989> for<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:10.800> kind<00:02:10.979> of

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
HVLP sprayer for this kind of

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.150 
HVLP sprayer for this kind of
application<00:02:11.220> but<00:02:11.879> here

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
application but here

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.800 
application but here
on<00:02:13.250> something<00:02:13.640> this<00:02:13.790> small<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.450> just<00:02:14.630> makes

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
on something this small it just makes

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.080 
on something this small it just makes
much<00:02:15.050> more<00:02:15.080> sense<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.710> brush<00:02:16.010> this<00:02:16.250> on<00:02:16.490> but

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
much more sense to brush this on but

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.730 
much more sense to brush this on but
keep<00:02:17.300> in<00:02:17.450> mind<00:02:17.630> as<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:17.900> see<00:02:18.110> here<00:02:18.530> it<00:02:18.680> does

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
keep in mind as you see here it does

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.950 
keep in mind as you see here it does
leave<00:02:19.220> some<00:02:19.430> brushstrokes<00:02:20.090> when<00:02:20.810> you're

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
leave some brushstrokes when you're

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.600 
leave some brushstrokes when you're
applying<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.440> with<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.620> cheap<00:02:21.890> brush<00:02:22.130> like<00:02:22.400> this

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
applying it with a cheap brush like this

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.090 
applying it with a cheap brush like this
so<00:02:23.030> what<00:02:23.240> I<00:02:23.270> do<00:02:23.390> is<00:02:23.660> I<00:02:23.810> apply<00:02:23.840> that<00:02:24.440> prime<00:02:24.890> it

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
so what I do is I apply that prime it

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.100 
so what I do is I apply that prime it
all<00:02:25.250> over<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.760> service<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.390> then<00:02:26.810> I<00:02:26.870> go<00:02:27.080> back

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
all over the service and then I go back

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.260 
all over the service and then I go back
and<00:02:27.290> stipple<00:02:27.980> out<00:02:28.130> those<00:02:28.370> brushstrokes<00:02:29.060> and

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
and stipple out those brushstrokes and

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.330 
and stipple out those brushstrokes and
to<00:02:29.810> do<00:02:29.930> this<00:02:30.110> you<00:02:30.260> want<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:30.500> move<00:02:30.650> fast<00:02:30.950> because

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
to do this you want to move fast because

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.800 
to do this you want to move fast because
you<00:02:31.430> don't<00:02:31.640> want<00:02:31.820> to<00:02:31.880> wind<00:02:32.060> up<00:02:32.210> having<00:02:32.570> some<00:02:32.720> of

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
you don't want to wind up having some of

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.690 
you don't want to wind up having some of
that<00:02:32.870> dry<00:02:33.260> on<00:02:33.500> you<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:33.800> be<00:02:33.860> unable<00:02:34.130> to<00:02:34.400> remove

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
that dry on you and be unable to remove

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.180 
that dry on you and be unable to remove
those<00:02:34.910> brushstrokes<00:02:35.540> but<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.320> also<00:02:36.800> force

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
those brushstrokes but that also force

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.040 
those brushstrokes but that also force
it<00:02:37.370> into<00:02:37.520> those<00:02:37.790> detailed<00:02:38.240> areas<00:02:38.630> like<00:02:38.810> around

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
it into those detailed areas like around

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.870 
it into those detailed areas like around
those<00:02:39.290> screw<00:02:39.710> heads<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.340> places<00:02:40.730> like<00:02:40.850> that

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
those screw heads and places like that

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.930 
those screw heads and places like that
so<00:02:41.090> just<00:02:41.570> stippling<00:02:42.560> that<00:02:42.770> out<00:02:43.010> will<00:02:43.520> remove

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
so just stippling that out will remove

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.270 
so just stippling that out will remove
those<00:02:44.270> brush<00:02:44.570> strokes<00:02:44.600> and<00:02:45.200> any<00:02:45.350> lines<00:02:45.860> in

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
those brush strokes and any lines in

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.480 
those brush strokes and any lines in
your<00:02:46.580> primer<00:02:47.470> now<00:02:48.470> keep<00:02:48.710> in<00:02:48.860> mind<00:02:48.890> that<00:02:49.220> once

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
your primer now keep in mind that once

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.790 
your primer now keep in mind that once
your<00:02:49.700> primate<00:02:50.300> primary<00:02:50.870> is<00:02:50.960> applied<00:02:51.350> you<00:02:51.620> want

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
your primate primary is applied you want

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.320 
your primate primary is applied you want
to<00:02:51.860> give<00:02:51.980> that<00:02:52.160> a<00:02:52.430> couple<00:02:52.670> of<00:02:52.850> hours<00:02:53.150> to

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
to give that a couple of hours to

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.170 
to give that a couple of hours to
completely<00:02:53.780> dry<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.500> cure<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.700> allow<00:02:55.940> for

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
completely dry and cure to allow for

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.030 
completely dry and cure to allow for
that<00:02:56.270> metal<00:02:56.600> coating<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:57.050> really<00:02:57.380> bond<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.890> it

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
that metal coating to really bond to it

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.700 
that metal coating to really bond to it
well<00:02:58.250> so<00:02:59.120> once<00:02:59.510> you've<00:02:59.690> finished<00:03:00.020> brushing

because<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:18.800> does<00:03:19.040> contain<00:03:19.220> real<00:03:19.700> iron

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
because it does contain real iron

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.940 
because it does contain real iron
particles<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.930> those<00:03:21.080> need<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.320> be<00:03:21.440> properly

once<00:03:41.900> you<00:03:42.020> oxidized<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:42.920> second<00:03:43.400> coating<00:03:43.820> you

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
once you oxidized the second coating you

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.690 
once you oxidized the second coating you
don't<00:03:44.510> want<00:03:44.720> any<00:03:44.959> bare<00:03:45.620> plastic<00:03:46.310> showing

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
don't want any bare plastic showing

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.550 
don't want any bare plastic showing
through<00:03:47.000> so<00:03:47.540> you<00:03:47.630> want<00:03:47.780> to<00:03:47.840> make<00:03:47.959> sure<00:03:47.989> you<00:03:48.380> get

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
through so you want to make sure you get

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.979 
through so you want to make sure you get
good<00:03:49.190> even<00:03:49.640> coverage<00:03:50.060> with<00:03:50.270> this<00:03:50.390> first<00:03:50.690> coat

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
good even coverage with this first coat

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.590 
good even coverage with this first coat
and<00:03:51.200> allow<00:03:51.800> that<00:03:51.860> to<00:03:52.250> completely<00:03:52.700> dry<00:03:53.150> before

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
and allow that to completely dry before

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.530 
and allow that to completely dry before
moving<00:03:53.660> on<00:03:54.110> to<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.320> second<00:03:54.770> coat<00:03:55.330> now<00:03:56.330> on

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
moving on to the second coat now on

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.270 
moving on to the second coat now on
average<00:03:56.750> it's<00:03:57.200> a<00:03:57.260> good<00:03:57.410> idea<00:03:57.530> to<00:03:57.739> allow<00:03:58.220> the

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
average it's a good idea to allow the

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.979 
average it's a good idea to allow the
metal<00:03:58.730> coating<00:03:59.030> to<00:03:59.150> dry<00:03:59.390> for<00:03:59.450> about<00:03:59.750> an<00:03:59.870> hour

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989

metal coating to dry for about an hour
before<00:04:00.530> you<00:04:00.830> apply<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:01.160> second<00:04:01.700> coat<00:04:01.850> and

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
before you apply the second coat and

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.660 
before you apply the second coat and
keep<00:04:02.750> in<00:04:02.870> mind<00:04:02.900> there's<00:04:03.350> no<00:04:03.620> hard<00:04:03.980> fast<00:04:04.310> rule

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
keep in mind there's no hard fast rule

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.150 
keep in mind there's no hard fast rule
about<00:04:04.700> two<00:04:05.209> coats<00:04:05.540> you<00:04:05.810> could<00:04:05.959> apply<00:04:06.290> more

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
about two coats you could apply more

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.790 
about two coats you could apply more
than<00:04:07.190> that<00:04:07.580> but<00:04:08.420> less<00:04:09.020> than<00:04:09.050> that<00:04:09.440> would<00:04:09.680> be

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
than that but less than that would be

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.740 
than that but less than that would be
difficult<00:04:10.040> to<00:04:10.310> do<00:04:10.520> and<00:04:10.820> still<00:04:11.360> achieve<00:04:11.510> a

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
difficult to do and still achieve a

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
realistic effect now you'll notice on

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.210 
realistic effect now you'll notice on
our<00:04:14.450> second<00:04:14.930> coat<00:04:15.080> we're<00:04:15.320> stippling<00:04:15.800> this<00:04:15.980> on

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
our second coat we're stippling this on

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.159 
our second coat we're stippling this on
and<00:04:16.520> we<00:04:16.940> also<00:04:17.090> stippled<00:04:17.660> out<00:04:17.780> the<00:04:17.930> brush

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
and we also stippled out the brush

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.650 
and we also stippled out the brush
strokes<00:04:18.470> on<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:18.739> first<00:04:18.980> the<00:04:19.880> first<00:04:20.090> coat<00:04:20.419> but

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
strokes on the first the first coat but

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.930 
strokes on the first the first coat but
that's<00:04:21.320> crucial<00:04:21.950> on<00:04:22.100> the<00:04:22.220> second<00:04:22.610> coat<00:04:22.729> that

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
that's crucial on the second coat that

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.730 
that's crucial on the second coat that
you<00:04:22.970> stipple<00:04:23.419> that<00:04:23.660> surface<00:04:24.140> to<00:04:24.289> remove<00:04:24.410> any

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
you stipple that surface to remove any

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.040 
you stipple that surface to remove any
brush<00:04:25.070> marks<00:04:25.490> so<00:04:26.030> that<00:04:26.060> you<00:04:26.270> get<00:04:26.390> a<00:04:26.419> high

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
brush marks so that you get a high

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.680 
brush marks so that you get a high
textured<00:04:27.680> surface<00:04:28.220> that<00:04:28.729> gives<00:04:28.940> more<00:04:29.150> surface

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
textured surface that gives more surface

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.499 
textured surface that gives more surface
area<00:04:30.020> for<00:04:30.379> the<00:04:30.409> patina<00:04:31.400> to<00:04:31.639> react<00:04:31.940> with<00:04:32.180> and

area for the patina to react with and
speaking<00:04:33.470> of<00:04:33.590> patina<00:04:33.889> it's<00:04:34.250> crucial<00:04:35.060> that<00:04:35.090> you

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
speaking of patina it's crucial that you

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.360 
speaking of patina it's crucial that you
apply<00:04:35.690> your<00:04:35.870> patina<00:04:36.259> while<00:04:36.740> your<00:04:37.099> metal

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
apply your patina while your metal

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.850 
apply your patina while your metal
coating<00:04:37.729> is<00:04:37.879> still<00:04:38.180> wet<00:04:38.449> you'll<00:04:39.440> find<00:04:39.740> that

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
coating is still wet you'll find that

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.279 
coating is still wet you'll find that
once<00:04:40.129> the<00:04:40.430> what's<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.419> metal<00:04:41.659> coating<00:04:41.960> dries

once the what's the metal coating dries

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.589 
once the what's the metal coating dries
it<00:04:42.650> seals<00:04:43.129> in<00:04:43.370> those<00:04:43.520> metal<00:04:43.879> particles<00:04:44.389> and

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
it seals in those metal particles and

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.809 
it seals in those metal particles and
will<00:04:45.590> make<00:04:45.800> it<00:04:45.919> impossible<00:04:46.009> for<00:04:46.550> those

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:46.819 
will make it impossible for those

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:50.230 
will make it impossible for those
particles<00:04:47.300> to<00:04:47.599> react<00:04:47.960> with<00:04:48.259> the<00:04:48.500> patina<00:04:49.240> now

and you know any exposed hardware that

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.430 
and you know any exposed hardware that
would<00:05:37.340> naturally<00:05:37.969> abrade<00:05:38.419> and<00:05:38.810> scuff<00:05:39.169> with

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:41.779 
use and what that does is just gives

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:45.879 
use and what that does is just gives
that<00:05:41.870> appearance<00:05:42.110> of<00:05:42.770> iron<00:05:43.759> or<00:05:44.419> the<00:05:45.110> steel

that appearance of iron or the steel
abraded<00:05:46.669> and<00:05:46.849> showing<00:05:47.270> through<00:05:47.569> that<00:05:47.810> rust

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
abraded and showing through that rust

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:51.370 
abraded and showing through that rust
and<00:05:48.819> you'll<00:05:49.819> find<00:05:50.150> that<00:05:50.360> that<00:05:50.479> little<00:05:50.870> extra

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
and you'll find that that little extra

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.320 
and you'll find that that little extra
touch<00:05:51.500> there<00:05:52.039> especially<00:05:52.550> on<00:05:52.669> those<00:05:52.819> welds

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
touch there especially on those welds

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.570 
touch there especially on those welds
just<00:05:53.779> adds<00:05:53.990> a<00:05:54.169> lot<00:05:54.469> more<00:05:54.529> realism<00:05:55.219> to<00:05:55.370> the

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
just adds a lot more realism to the

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.269 
just adds a lot more realism to the
piece<00:05:55.789> and<00:05:56.449> it<00:05:57.349> just<00:05:57.529> takes<00:05:57.710> a<00:05:57.860> small<00:05:58.069> amount

00:05:58.269 --> 00:05:58.279 
piece and it just takes a small amount

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:01.209 
piece and it just takes a small amount
of<00:05:58.849> the<00:05:59.150> silver<00:05:59.719> B<00:06:00.080> to<00:06:00.590> achieve<00:06:00.860> that<00:06:01.009> effect

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:01.219 
of the silver B to achieve that effect

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:03.369 
of the silver B to achieve that effect
so<00:06:01.669> you<00:06:01.699> want<00:06:02.000> to<00:06:02.090> make<00:06:02.509> sure<00:06:02.539> when<00:06:03.020> you're<00:06:03.139> dry

00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:03.379
