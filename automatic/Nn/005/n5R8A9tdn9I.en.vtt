00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
college for three of them which is a lot

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.030 
college for three of them which is a lot
by<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.840> way<00:02:01.020> considering<00:02:01.500> my<00:02:01.649> school<00:02:01.920> only

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
by the way considering my school only

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.800 
by the way considering my school only
has<00:02:02.310> like<00:02:02.869> 450<00:02:03.869> people<00:02:04.079> go

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
so what happened today was I went to six

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.449 
so what happened today was I went to six
flags<00:02:07.780> instead<00:02:08.410> of<00:02:08.500> classes<00:02:08.950> because<00:02:09.099> we<00:02:09.280> had

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
flags instead of classes because we had

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.820

a<00:02:09.489> field<00:02:09.759> trip<00:02:09.849> for<00:02:10.209> physics<00:02:10.869> and<00:02:11.410> that<00:02:11.680> was

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
a field trip for physics and that was

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.650 
a field trip for physics and that was
awesome<00:02:11.980> so<00:02:12.880> at<00:02:13.260> six<00:02:14.260> flags<00:02:14.530> we<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:16.090> know<00:02:16.150> we

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
awesome so at six flags we you know we

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.040 
awesome so at six flags we you know we
had<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.349> go<00:02:17.530> do<00:02:17.709> this<00:02:18.209> problem<00:02:19.209> I<00:02:19.569> guess<00:02:19.780> we<00:02:19.959> had

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
to like do a physics problem and then we

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.270 
to like do a physics problem and then we
got<00:02:22.239> to<00:02:22.450> go<00:02:22.630> around<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.140> do<00:02:23.230> whatever<00:02:23.440> so<00:02:24.160> we

decided to take an hour and a half to

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
decided to take an hour and a half to
get<00:03:44.380> to<00:03:44.590> six<00:03:44.829> flags<00:03:45.100> so<00:03:45.370> it's<00:03:45.870> 1115<00:03:46.870> now<00:03:47.139> I<00:03:47.440> know

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
throughout the whole thing but seriously

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.160 
throughout the whole thing but seriously
like<00:05:03.700> there's<00:05:03.940> a<00:05:04.000> chicken<00:05:04.060> and<00:05:04.480> waffle<00:05:04.840> stand

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
like there's a chicken and waffle stand

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.590 
like there's a chicken and waffle stand
and<00:05:05.590> it<00:05:05.860> we<00:05:06.250> couldn't<00:05:06.550> get<00:05:06.730> food<00:05:07.060> there<00:05:07.300> for

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
and it we couldn't get food there for

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.850 
and it we couldn't get food there for
the<00:05:07.780> main<00:05:07.990> reason<00:05:08.320> that<00:05:08.350> there<00:05:08.590> were<00:05:08.650> too<00:05:08.800> many

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
the main reason that there were too many

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.290 
the main reason that there were too many
people<00:05:09.010> standing<00:05:09.580> at<00:05:09.700> me<00:05:09.760> i'll<00:05:10.000> let<00:05:10.240> you

now the funny thing is that on top of
this<00:05:16.480> we<00:05:17.050> had<00:05:17.290> to<00:05:17.470> do<00:05:17.590> this<00:05:17.740> worksheet<00:05:18.220> so<00:05:18.460> i

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
this we had to do this worksheet so i

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.670 
this we had to do this worksheet so i
got<00:05:18.850> assigned<00:05:19.210> to<00:05:19.419> discuss<00:05:19.930> the<00:05:20.140> physics<00:05:20.350> and

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
got assigned to discuss the physics and

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.120 
got assigned to discuss the physics and
the<00:05:20.770> gravity<00:05:21.610> the<00:05:21.910> g-force<00:05:22.419> of<00:05:22.980> which<00:05:23.980> is

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
the gravity the g-force of which is

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.940 
the gravity the g-force of which is
gravity<00:05:24.520> force<00:05:24.760> of<00:05:24.940> the<00:05:25.480> superman<00:05:26.230> ride<00:05:26.740> of

steel which is if you don't know what it
is<00:05:28.660> it's<00:05:28.960> a<00:05:29.080> hundred<00:05:29.410> and<00:05:29.500> eighty<00:05:29.650> foot<00:05:29.919> drop

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
is it's a hundred and eighty foot drop

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.340 
is it's a hundred and eighty foot drop
roller<00:05:30.550> coaster<00:05:30.970> it's<00:05:31.090> pretty<00:05:31.300> legit<00:05:31.419> so<00:05:32.200> we

had to go on it now my partner didn't
want<00:05:34.090> to<00:05:34.180> go<00:05:34.270> on<00:05:34.300> at<00:05:34.600> Katie<00:05:34.870> so<00:05:35.530> I<00:05:35.560> was<00:05:35.740> like

roller coaster so we told her it was a

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.950 
roller coaster so we told her it was a
different<00:05:38.860> one<00:05:39.010> mean<00:05:39.610> like<00:05:40.090> long<00:05:40.360> story<00:05:40.660> short

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
different one mean like long story short

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.620 
different one mean like long story short
she<00:05:41.169> got<00:05:41.350> on<00:05:41.590> and<00:05:41.890> we<00:05:42.490> wrote<00:05:42.700> it<00:05:42.730> was<00:05:43.120> awesome

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
she got on and we wrote it was awesome

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.500 
she got on and we wrote it was awesome
so<00:05:44.500> there<00:05:45.100> weren't<00:05:45.280> any<00:05:45.550> lines<00:05:45.970> really<00:05:46.360> for

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
so there weren't any lines really for

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.760 
so there weren't any lines really for
any<00:05:46.630> of<00:05:46.720> the<00:05:46.780> roller<00:05:46.960> coasters<00:05:47.350> just<00:05:47.560> to<00:05:47.620> get

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
any of the roller coasters just to get

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.470 
any of the roller coasters just to get
into<00:05:48.190> the<00:05:48.310> park<00:05:48.550> which<00:05:48.700> didn't<00:05:48.970> make<00:05:49.030> sense<00:05:49.300> to

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:49.480 
into the park which didn't make sense to

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.600 
into the park which didn't make sense to
me<00:05:49.690> so<00:05:50.320> now<00:05:50.440> we're<00:05:50.650> down<00:05:50.770> to<00:05:50.980> about<00:05:51.070> I<00:05:51.430> don't

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610

know an hour and a half

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.750 
know an hour and a half
because<00:05:54.720> we<00:05:54.870> basically<00:05:55.440> wrote<00:05:56.070> around<00:05:56.400> for<00:05:56.730> a

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
because we basically wrote around for a

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.760 
because we basically wrote around for a
while<00:05:56.940> and<00:05:57.360> after<00:05:57.540> doing<00:05:57.990> that<00:05:58.140> we<00:05:58.470> went<00:05:58.650> on

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
while and after doing that we went on

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.320 
while and after doing that we went on
like<00:05:58.950> the<00:05:59.130> Joker's<00:05:59.580> repent<00:05:59.850> we<00:05:59.970> went<00:06:00.150> on<00:06:00.240> to

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
like the Joker's repent we went on to

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.000 
like the Joker's repent we went on to
some<00:06:00.480> cool<00:06:00.690> things<00:06:00.960> so<00:06:01.440> we<00:06:01.560> were<00:06:01.680> all<00:06:01.770> hungry

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
some cool things so we were all hungry

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.340 
some cool things so we were all hungry
so<00:06:02.280> we<00:06:02.310> went<00:06:02.490> to<00:06:02.640> go<00:06:02.730> eat<00:06:02.970> I<00:06:03.270> want<00:06:03.990> to<00:06:04.110> go<00:06:04.230> get
