00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
fit to our budget it has to do what is

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.849 
fit to our budget it has to do what is
physically<00:02:59.510> possible<00:02:59.720> whereas<00:03:00.500> a<00:03:00.530> book<00:03:00.709> can

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
physically possible whereas a book can

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:02.649 
physically possible whereas a book can
transcend<00:03:01.220> all<00:03:01.459> these<00:03:01.609> boundaries<00:03:01.939> it<00:03:02.389> always

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659 
transcend all these boundaries it always

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:03.940 
transcend all these boundaries it always
seems<00:03:02.810> kind<00:03:02.989> of<00:03:03.019> ludicrous<00:03:03.200> to<00:03:03.620> me<00:03:03.650> that

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
seems kind of ludicrous to me that

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.530 
seems kind of ludicrous to me that
people<00:03:04.099> think<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.579> natural<00:03:05.000> thing<00:03:05.180> for<00:03:05.239> a

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
people think the natural thing for a

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.149 
people think the natural thing for a
book<00:03:05.750> when<00:03:06.019> it<00:03:06.109> does<00:03:06.290> well<00:03:06.500> is<00:03:06.739> then<00:03:06.919> to<00:03:07.069> be

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
book when it does well is then to be

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
more than I did I think this was because

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.529 
more than I did I think this was because
it<00:05:16.159> was<00:05:16.190> their<00:05:16.520> first<00:05:16.669> interaction<00:05:17.300> with<00:05:17.419> the

it was their first interaction with the

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:19.899 
it was their first interaction with the
story<00:05:17.810> because<00:05:18.289> hey<00:05:19.009> no<00:05:19.370> matter<00:05:19.580> what<00:05:19.759> medium

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:19.909 
story because hey no matter what medium

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:21.999 
story because hey no matter what medium
it's<00:05:20.360> a<00:05:20.449> good<00:05:20.599> story<00:05:20.840> my<00:05:21.199> disappointment<00:05:21.889> was

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:22.009 
it's a good story my disappointment was

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.070 
it's a good story my disappointment was
that<00:05:22.340> I<00:05:22.370> felt<00:05:22.729> the<00:05:22.849> book<00:05:23.000> told<00:05:23.240> that<00:05:23.449> story<00:05:23.750> and

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
that I felt the book told that story and

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.379 
that I felt the book told that story and
did<00:05:24.349> so<00:05:24.530> much<00:05:24.740> more<00:05:25.099> told<00:05:25.699> it<00:05:25.849> so<00:05:26.000> much<00:05:26.150> better

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
did so much more told it so much better

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:28.120 
did so much more told it so much better
I<00:05:26.690> felt<00:05:26.960> the<00:05:27.050> book<00:05:27.199> was<00:05:27.409> really<00:05:27.740> able<00:05:27.860> to

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
I felt the book was really able to

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.769 
I felt the book was really able to
capture<00:05:28.340> a<00:05:28.520> brilliant<00:05:28.969> mix<00:05:29.180> of<00:05:29.389> fear<00:05:29.630> and

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:29.779 
capture a brilliant mix of fear and

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:31.600 
capture a brilliant mix of fear and
excitement<00:05:29.870> for<00:05:30.440> every<00:05:30.650> moment<00:05:31.039> Katniss<00:05:31.430> was

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
excitement for every moment Katniss was

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.100 
excitement for every moment Katniss was
in<00:05:31.729> the<00:05:31.819> arena<00:05:32.120> I<00:05:32.330> thought<00:05:32.539> it<00:05:32.659> portrayed<00:05:32.900> an

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
in the arena I thought it portrayed an

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.890 
in the arena I thought it portrayed an
amazing<00:05:33.710> twisted<00:05:34.310> emotional<00:05:35.240> relationship

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
amazing twisted emotional relationship

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.540 
amazing twisted emotional relationship
between<00:05:36.199> Katniss<00:05:36.560> and<00:05:36.590> Peeta<00:05:36.740> based<00:05:37.340> on

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
between Katniss and Peeta based on

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.790 
between Katniss and Peeta based on
various<00:05:38.029> different<00:05:38.479> motivations<00:05:39.080> I<00:05:39.409> don't

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
various different motivations I don't

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.110 
various different motivations I don't
think<00:05:39.949> the<00:05:40.039> film<00:05:40.219> managed<00:05:40.580> to<00:05:40.669> capture<00:05:40.819> either

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
think the film managed to capture either

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.019 
think the film managed to capture either
of<00:05:41.360> these<00:05:41.509> in<00:05:42.199> fact<00:05:42.680> I<00:05:42.889> would<00:05:43.039> say<00:05:43.069> that<00:05:43.580> the

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:44.029 
of these in fact I would say that the

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:45.399 
of these in fact I would say that the
relationship<00:05:44.449> in<00:05:44.659> the<00:05:44.719> film<00:05:44.900> didn't<00:05:45.289> make

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:45.409 
relationship in the film didn't make

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:47.260 
relationship in the film didn't make
sense<00:05:45.590> at<00:05:45.800> all<00:05:45.919> I<00:05:46.099> fear<00:05:46.370> is<00:05:46.490> that<00:05:46.669> even<00:05:47.000> if

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
sense at all I fear is that even if

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.999 
sense at all I fear is that even if
these<00:05:47.419> friends<00:05:47.750> of<00:05:47.810> mine<00:05:48.020> then<00:05:48.319> go<00:05:48.529> on<00:05:48.680> to<00:05:48.800> read

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.279 
characters in their minds will
ultimately<00:05:59.029> detract<00:05:59.569> from<00:05:59.690> what<00:05:59.900> could<00:06:00.199> have

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
ultimately detract from what could have

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:01.719 
ultimately detract from what could have
been<00:06:00.409> a<00:06:00.469> better<00:06:00.620> representation<00:06:01.129> of<00:06:01.610> the

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 
been a better representation of the

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:04.029 
been a better representation of the
story<00:06:01.969> with<00:06:02.599> book<00:06:02.779> to<00:06:02.900> film<00:06:03.050> adaptations<00:06:03.710> one

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
story with book to film adaptations one

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:05.740 
story with book to film adaptations one
is<00:06:04.190> inevitably<00:06:04.789> going<00:06:04.879> to<00:06:05.150> spoil<00:06:05.479> the<00:06:05.569> other

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
is inevitably going to spoil the other

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.570 
is inevitably going to spoil the other
and<00:06:06.020> I<00:06:06.440> definitely<00:06:06.620> fall<00:06:06.979> into<00:06:07.190> the<00:06:07.250> camp<00:06:07.460> of

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
and I definitely fall into the camp of

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.189 
and I definitely fall into the camp of
thinking<00:06:07.940> the<00:06:08.090> book<00:06:08.240> should<00:06:08.449> spoil<00:06:08.750> the<00:06:08.930> film

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 
thinking the book should spoil the film

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:11.019 
thinking the book should spoil the film
I<00:06:09.409> think<00:06:09.860> the<00:06:09.949> book<00:06:10.069> is<00:06:10.190> able<00:06:10.490> to<00:06:10.580> tell<00:06:10.789> a<00:06:10.819> much

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:11.029 
I think the book is able to tell a much

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:13.779 
I think the book is able to tell a much
more<00:06:11.270> intimate<00:06:11.509> story<00:06:11.960> it's<00:06:12.889> allowing<00:06:13.400> you<00:06:13.639> to

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789 
more intimate story it's allowing you to

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:15.640 
more intimate story it's allowing you to
create<00:06:13.969> your<00:06:14.180> own<00:06:14.360> story<00:06:14.900> think<00:06:15.379> if<00:06:15.529> you've

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
create your own story think if you've

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.110 
create your own story think if you've
watched<00:06:15.889> the<00:06:16.069> film<00:06:16.279> before<00:06:16.460> approaching<00:06:16.849> the

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
watched the film before approaching the

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.820 
watched the film before approaching the
book<00:06:17.300> it<00:06:17.509> will<00:06:17.599> be<00:06:17.750> a<00:06:17.779> lot<00:06:17.990> harder<00:06:18.139> to<00:06:18.469> do<00:06:18.650> this

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
book it will be a lot harder to do this

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.360 
book it will be a lot harder to do this
