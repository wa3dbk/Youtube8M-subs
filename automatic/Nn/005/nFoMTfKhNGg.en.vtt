you've ever read tarot cards and a court

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.999 
you've ever read tarot cards and a court
card<00:00:21.320> has<00:00:21.439> come<00:00:21.500> up

you sort of know it's a problem but I
think<00:00:24.650> it's<00:00:24.980> not<00:00:25.310> that<00:00:26.240> necessary<00:00:26.840> so<00:00:27.619> we<00:00:27.740> know

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
think it's not that necessary so we know

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.730 
think it's not that necessary so we know
there<00:00:28.010> are<00:00:28.039> four<00:00:28.279> suits<00:00:28.930> I'm<00:00:29.930> you<00:00:30.410> know<00:00:30.560> that

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
people behave in a certain way so the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.189 
people behave in a certain way so the
difference<00:00:50.210> is<00:00:50.299> between<00:00:50.420> them<00:00:50.839> the<00:00:50.989> queen<00:00:51.170> of

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:57.619 
swords for instance they look different

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:59.500 
swords for instance they look different
and<00:00:57.710> they<00:00:57.799> behave<00:00:58.070> in<00:00:58.339> a<00:00:58.729> certain<00:00:58.909> kind<00:00:59.239> of<00:00:59.420> a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.280 
and they behave in a certain kind of a
way<00:01:00.010> so<00:01:01.010> we<00:01:01.610> also<00:01:01.790> know<00:01:02.000> that<00:01:02.030> court<00:01:02.449> cards<00:01:02.809> can

questioner<00:01:12.260> for<00:01:12.500> a<00:01:12.530> while<00:01:13.240> so<00:01:14.240> we've<00:01:14.390> got<00:01:14.510> to

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
questioner for a while so we've got to

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.600 
questioner for a while so we've got to
spread<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.200> let's<00:01:15.620> say<00:01:15.860> we<00:01:16.010> turn<00:01:16.160> over<00:01:16.220> some

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.589 
it's going to be both and at the same
time<00:02:13.069> why<00:02:13.370> not<00:02:13.400> just<00:02:13.700> let<00:02:13.879> the<00:02:14.030> questioner

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
time why not just let the questioner

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.900 
time why not just let the questioner
have<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.290> experience<00:02:15.980> send<00:02:16.670> them<00:02:16.790> away

have the experience send them away

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.940 
have the experience send them away

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
attention to court cards from that point

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.210 
attention to court cards from that point
of<00:02:49.160> view<00:02:49.190> thing<00:02:50.090> is<00:02:50.270> we<00:02:51.170> need<00:02:51.320> other<00:02:51.530> people<00:02:52.040> in

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
of view thing is we need other people in

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.300 
of view thing is we need other people in
our<00:02:52.640> lives<00:02:52.910> because<00:02:53.420> they<00:02:53.750> teach<00:02:54.080> us<00:02:54.350> about<00:02:55.010> us

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
our lives because they teach us about us

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.360 
our lives because they teach us about us
if<00:02:55.670> we<00:02:56.270> can<00:02:56.420> handle<00:02:56.600> it

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
if we can handle it

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.780 
if we can handle it
so<00:02:58.370> we<00:02:58.940> we<00:02:59.450> have<00:02:59.600> an<00:02:59.840> idea<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:00.580> ourselves<00:03:01.580> and

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
so we we have an idea of ourselves and

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.090 
so we we have an idea of ourselves and
it<00:03:02.450> may<00:03:02.570> be<00:03:02.630> a<00:03:02.690> correct<00:03:03.110> idea<00:03:03.320> or<00:03:03.770> it<00:03:03.920> can<00:03:04.040> be

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
it may be a correct idea or it can be

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.580 
it may be a correct idea or it can be
very<00:03:04.130> inaccurate<00:03:04.790> because<00:03:05.780> it's<00:03:06.200> a<00:03:06.320> bit<00:03:06.440> like

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
very inaccurate because it's a bit like

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.190 
very inaccurate because it's a bit like
somebody<00:03:07.010> who's<00:03:07.160> very<00:03:07.370> messy<00:03:07.880> who<00:03:08.750> thinks<00:03:09.080> of

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
somebody who's very messy who thinks of

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.770 
somebody who's very messy who thinks of
their<00:03:09.350> neat<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:09.830> tidy<00:03:10.390> you<00:03:11.390> know<00:03:11.480> and<00:03:11.720> I'm

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
their neat and tidy you know and I'm

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.180 
their neat and tidy you know and I'm
sure<00:03:11.810> we<00:03:12.080> know<00:03:12.230> people<00:03:12.440> who<00:03:12.740> were<00:03:12.860> kind<00:03:13.070> of

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
sure we know people who were kind of

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.890 
sure we know people who were kind of
contradictions<00:03:13.880> they've<00:03:14.450> got<00:03:14.630> a<00:03:14.660> certain

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
contradictions they've got a certain

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.810 
contradictions they've got a certain
opinion<00:03:15.410> about<00:03:15.590> themselves<00:03:16.190> but<00:03:16.280> everybody

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
opinion about themselves but everybody

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.150 
opinion about themselves but everybody
else<00:03:17.000> knows<00:03:17.300> that<00:03:17.440> they're<00:03:18.440> not<00:03:18.530> actually<00:03:19.070> too

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
else knows that they're not actually too

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.630 
else knows that they're not actually too
like<00:03:19.370> that<00:03:20.440> so<00:03:23.440> that<00:03:24.440> we<00:03:24.620> sometimes<00:03:25.310> get<00:03:25.580> very

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
like that so that we sometimes get very

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.210 
like that so that we sometimes get very
angry<00:03:26.330> are<00:03:26.690> very<00:03:26.989> upset<00:03:27.440> by<00:03:27.680> something<00:03:27.739> that

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
angry are very upset by something that

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.610 
angry are very upset by something that
somebody<00:03:28.550> else<00:03:28.610> does<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:30.050> we<00:03:30.170> can<00:03:30.200> just<00:03:30.410> stay

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
somebody else does and we can just stay

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.960 
somebody else does and we can just stay
angry<00:03:30.860> or<00:03:32.110> if<00:03:33.110> we<00:03:33.500> stay<00:03:33.680> angry<00:03:34.070> then<00:03:34.310> we<00:03:34.760> sort

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
angry or if we stay angry then we sort

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.850 
angry or if we stay angry then we sort
of<00:03:35.030> array<00:03:35.480> is<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.870> understanding<00:03:36.620> that<00:03:36.650> we

of array is the understanding that we

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:45.880 
of array is the understanding that we
have<00:03:37.070> but<00:03:37.970> if<00:03:38.870> we<00:03:39.440> can<00:03:42.400> realize<00:03:43.400> that<00:03:44.890> being

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
angry that somebody else is telling us

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.720 
angry that somebody else is telling us
something<00:03:49.340> about<00:03:49.550> us<00:03:51.040> it's<00:03:52.040> telling<00:03:52.400> us<00:03:52.489> that

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
something about us it's telling us that

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.390 
something about us it's telling us that
the<00:03:52.850> picture<00:03:53.150> we<00:03:53.270> have<00:03:53.450> about<00:03:53.870> ourselves

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
the picture we have about ourselves

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.100 
the picture we have about ourselves
needs<00:03:55.400> to<00:03:55.610> be<00:03:55.730> adjusted<00:03:56.030> and<00:03:56.570> this<00:03:56.750> is<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:56.900> good

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
needs to be adjusted and this is a good

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.640 
needs to be adjusted and this is a good
thing

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
thing

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.060 
thing
so<00:03:58.310> let's<00:03:58.700> it<00:03:58.989> if<00:03:59.989> you<00:04:00.380> imagine<00:04:00.500> that<00:04:00.709> people

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
so let's it if you imagine that people

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.160 
so let's it if you imagine that people
are<00:04:01.160> driving<00:04:01.370> and<00:04:01.850> let's<00:04:02.300> say<00:04:02.450> you<00:04:02.570> drive<00:04:02.870> and

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
are driving and let's say you drive and

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.150 
are driving and let's say you drive and
and<00:04:03.970> you<00:04:04.970> see<00:04:05.150> somebody<00:04:05.420> who<00:04:05.600> comes<00:04:05.780> through

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
and you see somebody who comes through

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.710 
and you see somebody who comes through
doesn't<00:04:07.160> come<00:04:07.520> to<00:04:07.700> a<00:04:07.760> complete<00:04:08.120> stop<00:04:08.480> at<00:04:08.690> a

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
doesn't come to a complete stop at a

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.410 
doesn't come to a complete stop at a
stop<00:04:09.050> sign<00:04:09.320> or<00:04:09.620> they<00:04:10.430> don't<00:04:10.550> signal<00:04:11.150> before

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
stop sign or they don't signal before

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.140 
stop sign or they don't signal before
the<00:04:11.540> changed<00:04:11.930> lanes<00:04:12.200> and<00:04:13.070> we've<00:04:13.700> all<00:04:13.850> seen

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
the changed lanes and we've all seen

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.990 
the changed lanes and we've all seen
this<00:04:14.330> all<00:04:14.600> the<00:04:14.720> time<00:04:14.959> and<00:04:15.459> we<00:04:16.459> probably<00:04:16.669> do<00:04:16.880> it

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
this all the time and we probably do it

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.750 
this all the time and we probably do it
all<00:04:17.120> the<00:04:17.270> time<00:04:17.450> but<00:04:17.840> it's<00:04:18.019> when<00:04:18.200> you<00:04:18.350> get

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
all the time but it's when you get

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.450 
all the time but it's when you get
really<00:04:19.760> angry<00:04:19.970> about<00:04:20.450> somebody<00:04:21.320> else<00:04:21.560> that's

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
really angry about somebody else that's

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.480 
really angry about somebody else that's

for the questioner if they look below

00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:31.359 
for the questioner if they look below
the<00:05:30.169> surface<00:05:30.409> when<00:05:30.829> it<00:05:30.919> comes<00:05:31.099> to<00:05:31.249> other

what the other person is trying to teach

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:45.459 
what the other person is trying to teach
you<00:05:39.019> if<00:05:39.709> you're<00:05:40.189> the<00:05:40.309> questioner<00:05:40.879> and<00:05:41.439> so<00:05:44.469> it

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:47.179 
may be that people have difficulties

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:48.879 
may be that people have difficulties
with<00:05:47.269> court<00:05:47.599> cards<00:05:48.019> because<00:05:48.589> they're<00:05:48.769> not

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:48.889 
with court cards because they're not

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:51.279 
with court cards because they're not
quite<00:05:49.429> sure<00:05:49.459> what<00:05:50.089> rule<00:05:50.419> other<00:05:50.779> people<00:05:51.139> play

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
quite sure what rule other people play

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:57.759 
quite sure what rule other people play
in<00:05:51.409> the<00:05:51.499> life<00:05:52.539> so<00:05:55.809> that's<00:05:56.809> something<00:05:57.110> general

00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:57.769 
in the life so that's something general

00:05:57.769 --> 00:06:00.100 
in the life so that's something general
just<00:05:58.009> as<00:05:58.129> a<00:05:58.159> background<00:05:58.399> to<00:05:58.779> looking<00:05:59.779> at<00:05:59.839> court

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
just as a background to looking at court

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.709 
just as a background to looking at court
cards<00:06:00.439> and<00:06:00.589> so<00:06:01.129> we<00:06:01.249> know<00:06:01.429> we<00:06:02.059> could<00:06:02.209> for<00:06:02.449> court

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:02.719 
cards and so we know we could for court

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:04.149 
cards and so we know we could for court
cards<00:06:02.989> to<00:06:03.079> page<00:06:03.289> the<00:06:03.529> Queen<00:06:03.800> the<00:06:03.949> knight<00:06:04.129> and

cards to page the Queen the knight and
the<00:06:04.339> King<00:06:04.639> I<00:06:04.879> mean<00:06:05.689> of<00:06:05.809> the<00:06:05.899> pages<00:06:06.289> are<00:06:06.379> young

00:06:06.549 --> 00:06:06.559 
the King I mean of the pages are young

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:07.899 
the King I mean of the pages are young
people<00:06:06.769> and<00:06:07.099> Knights<00:06:07.429> are<00:06:07.669> younger

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:07.909 
people and Knights are younger

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.029 
people and Knights are younger
individuals<00:06:08.659> as<00:06:08.749> well<00:06:08.959> so<00:06:09.499> you<00:06:09.589> can't<00:06:09.829> get<00:06:09.949> an

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 
individuals as well so you can't get an

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:12.549 
individuals as well so you can't get an
idea<00:06:10.279> of<00:06:10.369> age<00:06:10.749> from<00:06:11.749> the<00:06:11.899> weather<00:06:12.289> that's<00:06:12.439> a

00:06:12.549 --> 00:06:12.559 
idea of age from the weather that's a

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:13.989 
idea of age from the weather that's a
page<00:06:12.800> or<00:06:12.979> a<00:06:13.039> knight<00:06:13.219> or<00:06:13.459> a<00:06:13.489> queen<00:06:13.789> or<00:06:13.819> a<00:06:13.969> king

page or a knight or a queen or a king

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:16.579 
because queens and kings are obviously

00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:19.719 
because queens and kings are obviously
older<00:06:17.209> people<00:06:17.599> but<00:06:18.499> instead<00:06:18.649> of<00:06:18.979> old<00:06:19.459> and

older people but instead of old and
young<00:06:19.819> we<00:06:20.239> might<00:06:20.449> want<00:06:20.659> to<00:06:20.719> say<00:06:20.929> youthful<00:06:21.529> for

and<00:06:25.699> kings<00:06:25.959> so<00:06:26.959> you<00:06:27.019> expect<00:06:27.909> pages<00:06:28.909> and<00:06:29.089> warns

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479 
and kings so you expect pages and warns

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:31.809 
and kings so you expect pages and warns
because<00:06:30.379> are<00:06:30.559> not<00:06:30.739> that<00:06:30.889> experienced<00:06:31.519> because

00:06:31.809 --> 00:06:31.819 
because are not that experienced because

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:33.639 
because are not that experienced because
are<00:06:31.969> not<00:06:31.999> that<00:06:32.329> mature<00:06:32.539> they're<00:06:33.439> going<00:06:33.589> to

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:33.649 
are not that mature they're going to

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:35.919 
are not that mature they're going to
make<00:06:33.769> mistakes<00:06:33.889> that<00:06:34.550> older<00:06:34.999> people<00:06:35.179> queens

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:35.929 
make mistakes that older people queens

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:38.379 
make mistakes that older people queens
and<00:06:36.139> kings<00:06:36.199> are<00:06:36.649> not<00:06:36.800> going<00:06:36.979> to<00:06:37.039> make<00:06:37.189> and<00:06:37.550> in

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:38.389 
and kings are not going to make and in

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:39.449 
and kings are not going to make and in
the<00:06:38.479> same<00:06:38.719> way

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:39.459 
the same way

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:41.619 
the same way
maybe<00:06:40.459> queens<00:06:40.759> are<00:06:40.909> kings<00:06:41.119> because<00:06:41.269> they

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:41.629 
maybe queens are kings because they

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:44.259 
maybe queens are kings because they
mature<00:06:42.050> they're<00:06:42.319> more<00:06:42.499> set<00:06:42.829> in<00:06:43.009> their<00:06:43.129> ways<00:06:43.269> so

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:44.269 
mature they're more set in their ways so

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:48.519 
mature they're more set in their ways so
you<00:06:44.329> would<00:06:44.539> expect<00:06:45.279> for<00:06:46.279> a<00:06:46.659> versatility<00:06:47.659> and

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:48.529 
you would expect for a versatility and

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:50.739 
you would expect for a versatility and
adaptability<00:06:49.039> from<00:06:49.489> pages<00:06:49.729> and<00:06:49.999> nights<00:06:50.209> that

00:06:50.739 --> 00:06:50.749 
adaptability from pages and nights that

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:52.719 
adaptability from pages and nights that
you<00:06:50.899> might<00:06:51.199> not<00:06:51.409> expect<00:06:51.859> from<00:06:52.069> queens<00:06:52.429> and

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:52.729 
you might not expect from queens and

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:56.109 
you might not expect from queens and
kings<00:06:52.899> because<00:06:53.899> they're<00:06:54.109> older<00:06:55.119> presumably

00:06:56.109 --> 00:06:56.119 
kings because they're older presumably

00:06:56.119 --> 00:06:57.669 
kings because they're older presumably
they're<00:06:56.329> wiser<00:06:56.569> as<00:06:56.899> well<00:06:57.139> but<00:06:57.379> they're<00:06:57.529> more

00:06:57.669 --> 00:06:57.679 
they're wiser as well but they're more

00:06:57.679 --> 00:06:59.289 
they're wiser as well but they're more
that<00:06:58.069> they're<00:06:58.219> probably<00:06:58.759> going<00:06:58.999> to<00:06:59.059> be<00:06:59.119> more

00:06:59.289 --> 00:06:59.299 
that they're probably going to be more

00:06:59.299 --> 00:07:02.439 
that they're probably going to be more
set<00:06:59.689> in<00:06:59.899> their<00:07:00.049> ways<00:07:00.219> because<00:07:01.329> just<00:07:02.329> because

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:02.449 
set in their ways because just because

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:04.859 
set in their ways because just because
of<00:07:02.719> the<00:07:02.809> fact<00:07:02.959> that<00:07:03.109> they're<00:07:03.349> that<00:07:03.769> much<00:07:03.949> older

00:07:04.859 --> 00:07:04.869 
of the fact that they're that much older

00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:07.869 
of the fact that they're that much older
so
