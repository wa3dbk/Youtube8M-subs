to<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.110> crafting<00:02:42.500> table<00:02:42.560> is<00:02:42.950> quicker<00:02:43.250> to<00:02:43.489> jump

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
to the crafting table is quicker to jump

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.250 
to the crafting table is quicker to jump
on<00:02:43.970> a<00:02:44.000> car<00:02:44.360> and<00:02:45.430> take<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.610> cart<00:02:46.910> over<00:02:47.360> here<00:02:47.390> and

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.320 

anyway<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:54.290> idea<00:02:54.320> of<00:02:54.950> taking<00:02:55.670> a<00:02:55.910> car<00:02:56.150> over

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
anyway the idea of taking a car over

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.509 
anyway the idea of taking a car over
here<00:02:56.630> is<00:02:56.900> also<00:02:57.650> ridiculous<00:03:00.040> so<00:03:01.040> yeah<00:03:01.250> it's

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
here is also ridiculous so yeah it's

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.030 
here is also ridiculous so yeah it's
always<00:03:01.670> good<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:01.970> have<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:02.150> crafting<00:03:02.690> bench<00:03:03.040> you

always good to have a crafting bench you
know<00:03:04.510> you<00:03:05.510> end<00:03:05.660> up<00:03:05.810> going<00:03:06.019> through<00:03:06.320> a<00:03:06.350> lot<00:03:06.530> of

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
know you end up going through a lot of

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.970 
know you end up going through a lot of
those<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:08.049> again<00:03:09.049> for<00:03:09.260> speed<00:03:09.530> is<00:03:09.560> another

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
those and again for speed is another

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.819 
those and again for speed is another

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
you know I thought this was just

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.470 
you know I thought this was just
obviously<00:05:39.560> ridiculous<00:05:39.860> and<00:05:40.610> I<00:05:40.850> think<00:05:41.120> the

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.480 
obviously ridiculous and I think the

another<00:05:47.400> comment<00:05:47.910> was<00:05:48.530> why<00:05:49.530> is<00:05:49.590> the<00:05:50.070> spawn

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
another comment was why is the spawn

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.360 
another comment was why is the spawn
pads<00:05:50.790> only<00:05:51.180> one<00:05:51.420> block<00:05:51.720> square<00:05:53.210> but<00:05:54.210> I'm

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370

but<00:06:03.069> that<00:06:03.219> was<00:06:03.369> that<00:06:03.519> now<00:06:03.699> I<00:06:03.729> can<00:06:03.819> delete<00:06:04.179> this

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:04.359 
but that was that now I can delete this

00:06:04.359 --> 00:06:07.129
