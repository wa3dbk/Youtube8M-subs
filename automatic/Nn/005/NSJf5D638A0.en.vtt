methods<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.740> can<00:00:25.949> do<00:00:26.130> for<00:00:26.609> tapping<00:00:27.150> it

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
methods that you can do for tapping it

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.189 
methods that you can do for tapping it
in<00:00:28.519> both<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.730> which<00:00:29.820> are<00:00:30.029> not<00:00:30.179> exactly<00:00:30.300> easy<00:00:31.019> to

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
in both of which are not exactly easy to

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.100 
in both of which are not exactly easy to
do<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.890> live<00:00:32.099> setting<00:00:32.399> but<00:00:32.880> when<00:00:33.809> playing

along<00:00:34.350> with<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.530> CD<00:00:34.920> or<00:00:35.130> an<00:00:35.250> audio<00:00:35.489> track<00:00:35.730> they

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
are not that hard to figure out and then

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.540 
are not that hard to figure out and then
eventually<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:40.590> might<00:00:40.770> be<00:00:40.920> able<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.190> actually

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
eventually you might be able to actually

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.130 
eventually you might be able to actually
just<00:00:41.760> do<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.870> spontaneously<00:00:44.840> when<00:00:45.840> I'm<00:00:45.930> going

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
just do it spontaneously when I'm going

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.479 
just do it spontaneously when I'm going
to<00:00:46.230> show<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.440> right<00:00:46.680> now<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:48.680> a<00:00:49.680> little<00:00:50.129> bit<00:00:50.340> of

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
to show you right now is a little bit of

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.930 
to show you right now is a little bit of
a<00:00:50.930> theory<00:00:51.930> lesson<00:00:52.410> with<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.980> dotted<00:00:53.309> 8th<00:00:53.520> to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
a theory lesson with the dotted 8th to

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.200 
a theory lesson with the dotted 8th to
let<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.239> know<00:00:54.390> exactly<00:00:55.610> how<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.670> repeats

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
let you know exactly how the repeats

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.189 
let you know exactly how the repeats
line<00:00:57.660> up<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.890> 4/4<00:00:59.520> meter<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.989> more

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
line up in a 4/4 meter so this is more

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.250 
line up in a 4/4 meter so this is more
of<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.350> dotted<00:01:01.710> quarter<00:01:02.160> note<00:01:02.399> example<00:01:03.229> what<00:01:04.229> a

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
of a dotted quarter note example what a

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:12.469 
of a dotted quarter note example what a
dotted<00:01:04.680> note<00:01:06.560> signifies<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:08.930> a<00:01:11.330> quarter<00:01:12.330> note

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
dotted note signifies is a quarter note

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.210 
dotted note signifies is a quarter note
plus<00:01:12.869> an<00:01:13.049> eighth<00:01:13.260> note<00:01:14.509> the<00:01:15.509> dot<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.590> extra

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
plus an eighth note the dot is the extra

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.330 
plus an eighth note the dot is the extra
eighth<00:01:17.400> note<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.470> when<00:01:19.470> you're<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.950> meter

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
eighth note so when you're in a meter

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.880 
eighth note so when you're in a meter
say<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.119> hundred<00:01:21.450> beats<00:01:21.720> per<00:01:22.020> minute<00:01:22.320> for<00:01:22.560> four

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
say a hundred beats per minute for four

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.380 
say a hundred beats per minute for four
this<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.250> what<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.640> sounds<00:01:24.000> like<00:01:26.060> there's<00:01:27.060> four

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
this is what it sounds like there's four

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.480 
this is what it sounds like there's four
notes<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:27.930> one<00:01:28.140> two<00:01:28.470> three<00:01:28.500> four<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:31.490> that

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
notes so one two three four and that

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.510 
notes so one two three four and that
happens<00:01:32.850> with<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.170> I'll<00:01:34.170> put<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.619> shine

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
happens with that I'll put the shine

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.859 
happens with that I'll put the shine
function<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.840> can<00:01:36.990> hear<00:01:37.259> where<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
function on so you can hear where the

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.889 
function on so you can hear where the
new<00:01:39.869> measure<00:01:40.110> comes<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.829> I'll<00:01:41.520> give<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.790> a

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
new measure comes in I'll give you a

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.580 
new measure comes in I'll give you a
audible<00:01:42.899> example<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:44.299> listen<00:01:45.299> for<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.990> click

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
audible example and listen for the click

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.060 
audible example and listen for the click
of<00:01:46.740> my<00:01:46.920> ring<00:01:47.250> on<00:01:47.930> the<00:01:48.930> desk<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.500> you'll<00:01:49.890> be

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
of my ring on the desk and you'll be

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.740 
of my ring on the desk and you'll be
able<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.369> hear<00:01:50.520> where<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.759> repeats<00:01:51.240> come<00:01:51.540> in

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
able to hear where the repeats come in

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.020 
able to hear where the repeats come in
when<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.649> tap<00:01:52.920> them<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.820> what<00:01:53.939> you

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
when you tap them in this is what you

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.819 
when you tap them in this is what you
want<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.270> tap<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:54.810> your<00:01:54.960> deal<00:01:55.079> for<00:01:55.560> if

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
want to tap in on your deal for if

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.539 
want to tap in on your deal for if
you're<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:57.469> straight<00:01:58.469> quarter<00:01:59.100> note<00:01:59.280> eighth

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
you're in a straight quarter note eighth

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.969 
you're in a straight quarter note eighth
note<00:01:59.579> repeat<00:02:00.479> mode<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.290> not<00:02:01.500> in<00:02:01.680> the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
note repeat mode this is not in the

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.090 
note repeat mode this is not in the
rhythmic<00:02:02.189> mode<00:02:03.259> I'll<00:02:04.259> do<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.619> one<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.860> little

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
rhythmic mode I'll do that one a little

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.050 
rhythmic mode I'll do that one a little
bit<00:02:05.250> but<00:02:05.579> say<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.570> have<00:02:06.780> your<00:02:07.879> metronome<00:02:08.879> or

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
bit but say you have your metronome or

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:21.420 
bit but say you have your metronome or
say<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.020> pace<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.590> song

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.540 

so<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:22.550> notice<00:02:22.910> that<00:02:23.150> after<00:02:23.270> four<00:02:23.750> measures

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
so you notice that after four measures

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.830 
so you notice that after four measures
the<00:02:25.550> repeats<00:02:26.030> actually<00:02:26.690> line<00:02:26.990> back<00:02:27.320> up<00:02:27.350> with

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
the repeats actually line back up with

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.320 
the repeats actually line back up with
the<00:02:29.840> 4/4<00:02:30.290> meter<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:33.580> when<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:34.670> tap<00:02:34.880> that<00:02:35.090> in

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
the 4/4 meter so when you tap that in

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.160 
the 4/4 meter so when you tap that in
you're<00:02:36.200> actually<00:02:36.470> tapping<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:37.010> right<00:02:37.310> before

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
you're actually tapping it right before

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.850 
you're actually tapping it right before
the<00:02:39.170> end<00:02:39.380> of<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.709> meter<00:02:39.950> so<00:02:41.110> it's<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.290> eighth

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
the end of the meter so it's a eighth

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.540 
the end of the meter so it's a eighth
note<00:02:43.220> value<00:02:44.470> that<00:02:45.470> comes<00:02:45.739> in<00:02:46.010> right<00:02:46.310> before

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
note value that comes in right before

note value that comes in right before
beat<00:02:47.000> four<00:02:47.680> so<00:02:48.680> if<00:02:48.800> you<00:02:48.920> can<00:02:49.070> see<00:02:49.280> my<00:02:49.480> foot

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
beat four so if you can see my foot

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.729 
beat four so if you can see my foot
right<00:02:52.610> now<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:52.790> have<00:02:53.060> it<00:02:53.180> on<00:02:53.300> a<00:02:53.390> sweep<00:02:54.230> echo

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
right now I have it on a sweep echo

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.100 
right now I have it on a sweep echo
function<00:02:55.300> delay<00:02:56.300> time<00:02:56.600> doesn't<00:02:57.020> matter

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
function delay time doesn't matter

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.150 
function delay time doesn't matter
that'll<00:02:57.500> change<00:02:57.709> as<00:02:57.920> I<00:02:58.040> tap<00:02:58.280> it<00:02:58.430> in<00:02:58.580> repeats

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
that'll change as I tap it in repeats

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.340 
that'll change as I tap it in repeats
this<00:03:01.160> is<00:03:01.400> whatever<00:03:02.239> preference<00:03:02.840> you<00:03:02.989> have<00:03:03.170> I

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
this is whatever preference you have I

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.580 
this is whatever preference you have I
have<00:03:03.500> it<00:03:03.620> at<00:03:03.739> about<00:03:03.830> 11<00:03:04.250> o'clock<00:03:05.380> tweak<00:03:06.380> and

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
have it at about 11 o'clock tweak and

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.920 
have it at about 11 o'clock tweak and
tweeze<00:03:07.000> don't<00:03:08.000> really<00:03:08.239> matter<00:03:08.420> at<00:03:08.630> this<00:03:08.780> point

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
tweeze don't really matter at this point

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.880 
tweeze don't really matter at this point
that's<00:03:09.350> just<00:03:09.410> for<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:11.120> swell<00:03:11.620> effect<00:03:12.620> and

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
that's just for the the swell effect and

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.979 
that's just for the the swell effect and
the<00:03:13.670> mix<00:03:13.910> is<00:03:14.090> about<00:03:14.540> one<00:03:14.900> o'clock<00:03:15.310> but<00:03:16.989> let's

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
the mix is about one o'clock but let's

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.100 
the mix is about one o'clock but let's
go<00:03:18.200> again<00:03:18.500> with<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:19.870> I'll<00:03:20.870> have<00:03:20.989> the

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
go again with the I'll have the

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:31.570 
go again with the I'll have the
metronome<00:03:21.560> going<00:03:24.760> alright<00:03:25.760> so<00:03:29.500> that's<00:03:30.580> just

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
metronome going alright so that's just

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
metronome going alright so that's just
straight<00:03:32.440> repeat<00:03:33.940> just<00:03:34.940> right<00:03:35.180> on<00:03:35.299> the<00:03:35.330> beat

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
straight repeat just right on the beat

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.970 
straight repeat just right on the beat
now<00:03:36.500> if<00:03:36.620> you<00:03:36.739> want<00:03:36.920> to<00:03:36.980> do<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:38.630> dotted<00:03:39.049> quarter

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
now if you want to do the dotted quarter

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.680 
now if you want to do the dotted quarter
note<00:03:40.190> or<00:03:40.370> data<00:03:40.610> dates<00:03:40.880> depending<00:03:41.360> what<00:03:41.450> meter

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
note or data dates depending what meter

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.380 
note or data dates depending what meter
you're<00:03:41.930> in<00:03:42.430> just<00:03:43.430> listen<00:03:43.790> for<00:03:43.910> that<00:03:44.060> quarter

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
you're in just listen for that quarter

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.030 
you're in just listen for that quarter
note<00:03:44.570> and<00:03:44.780> hit<00:03:44.930> it<00:03:45.049> right<00:03:45.260> on<00:03:45.320> the<00:03:45.470> eighth<00:03:45.709> note

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
note and hit it right on the eighth note

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.390 
note and hit it right on the eighth note
before<00:03:46.250> beat<00:03:46.700> four<00:03:47.440> so<00:03:48.440> you<00:03:48.500> would<00:03:48.920> tap<00:03:49.130> it<00:03:49.280> in

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
before beat four so you would tap it in

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.500 
before beat four so you would tap it in
something<00:03:50.140> like<00:03:51.140> the<00:03:51.290> following<00:03:55.329> you<00:03:56.329> heard

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
something like the following you heard

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.030 
something like the following you heard
that<00:03:56.540> my<00:03:56.840> foot<00:03:57.110> hit<00:03:57.290> it<00:03:57.410> right<00:03:57.620> before<00:03:57.829> the

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
that my foot hit it right before the

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.479 
that my foot hit it right before the
right<00:03:58.760> before<00:03:58.880> beat<00:03:59.269> four<00:04:00.100> and<00:04:01.100> I'll<00:04:01.250> let<00:04:01.400> me

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
right before beat four and I'll let me

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.610 
right before beat four and I'll let me
pick<00:04:01.700> up<00:04:01.790> my<00:04:01.880> guitar<00:04:02.150> and<00:04:02.690> you'll<00:04:03.290> hear<00:04:03.500> the

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
pick up my guitar and you'll hear the

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.910 
pick up my guitar and you'll hear the
effect<00:04:03.980> that<00:04:04.070> it<00:04:04.280> actually<00:04:04.459> has<00:04:05.650> as<00:04:06.650> you're

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
effect that it actually has as you're

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:13.300 
effect that it actually has as you're
playing<00:04:07.160> along

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.210 

I'm<00:04:14.310> gonna<00:04:14.490> turn<00:04:14.700> off<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.930> bell<00:04:16.190> on<00:04:17.190> the

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
I'm gonna turn off the the bell on the

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.550 
I'm gonna turn off the the bell on the
metronome<00:04:18.180> as<00:04:18.480> well<00:04:20.420> so<00:04:21.420> again<00:04:21.540> if<00:04:22.230> you<00:04:22.410> can

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
metronome as well so again if you can

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.280 
metronome as well so again if you can
hear<00:04:22.770> it<00:04:23.300> that's<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.510> straight<00:04:24.780> quarter<00:04:25.110> note

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
hear it that's the straight quarter note

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.530 
hear it that's the straight quarter note
and<00:04:25.560> then<00:04:25.710> as<00:04:25.830> you<00:04:25.980> tap<00:04:26.160> it<00:04:26.370> in<00:04:29.300> you<00:04:30.300> hit<00:04:30.420> it

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
and then as you tap it in you hit it

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.830 
and then as you tap it in you hit it
right<00:04:30.750> before<00:04:30.960> beat<00:04:31.350> four<00:04:32.630> and<00:04:33.630> then<00:04:33.720> the

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
right before beat four and then the

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.940 
right before beat four and then the
effect<00:04:34.140> you<00:04:34.260> get<00:04:34.670> sound<00:04:35.670> something<00:04:36.390> like<00:04:36.950> the

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
effect you get sound something like the

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:55.250 
effect you get sound something like the
 all<00:04:53.400> right<00:04:53.610> so<00:04:53.940> that's<00:04:54.150> an<00:04:54.540> example<00:04:54.900> of

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
 all right so that's an example of

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:03.860 
 all right so that's an example of
using<00:04:58.730> the<00:04:59.730> tap<00:05:00.030> tempo<00:05:00.390> function<00:05:01.110> with<00:05:02.690> not<00:05:03.690> in

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
using the tap tempo function with not in

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.890 
using the tap tempo function with not in
the<00:05:03.990> rhythmic<00:05:04.200> delay<00:05:04.620> mode<00:05:04.860> on<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:06.060> the<00:05:06.600> DL

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
the rhythmic delay mode on the the DL

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.160 
the rhythmic delay mode on the the DL
for<00:05:07.170> if<00:05:08.010> you<00:05:08.940> want<00:05:09.120> to<00:05:09.240> use<00:05:09.450> the<00:05:09.720> rhythmic

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
for if you want to use the rhythmic

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.890 
for if you want to use the rhythmic
delay<00:05:10.470> this<00:05:10.680> is<00:05:10.860> method<00:05:11.280> to<00:05:11.490> method<00:05:12.420> one<00:05:12.750> is<00:05:12.780> a

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
delay this is method to method one is a

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.100 
delay this is method to method one is a
little<00:05:13.140> bit<00:05:13.260> harder<00:05:14.060> method<00:05:15.060> to<00:05:15.270> I<00:05:15.300> also<00:05:15.690> don't

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
little bit harder method to I also don't

little bit harder method to I also don't
find<00:05:16.410> to<00:05:16.530> be<00:05:16.680> that<00:05:16.890> easy<00:05:17.220> but<00:05:17.850> anyway<00:05:19.220> go<00:05:20.220> to
