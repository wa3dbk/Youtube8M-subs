scope this is the bigger end of the
scope<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> objective<00:00:43.530> lens<00:00:44.010> they

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
scope this is the objective lens they

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.000 
scope this is the objective lens they

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
call it the illuminator lens system this

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.650 
call it the illuminator lens system this
is<00:00:47.190> important<00:00:47.640> during<00:00:47.760> low-light<00:00:48.149> periods

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
is important during low-light periods

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.900 
is important during low-light periods
when<00:00:48.870> animals<00:00:49.530> are<00:00:49.680> most<00:00:49.800> active<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.489> this

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
when animals are most active and this

scope I'm telling you look at this in

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.299 
scope I'm telling you look at this in
low-light<00:00:52.739> situations

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
low-light situations

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.979 
low-light situations
it<00:00:53.430> looks<00:00:53.640> like<00:00:53.760> broad<00:00:54.000> daylight<00:00:54.269> we'll<00:00:54.870> move

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
it looks like broad daylight we'll move

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.029 
it looks like broad daylight we'll move
back<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.379> back<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.680> scope<00:00:55.829> with

the a curette achill instead of just
crosshairs<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.510> some<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.780> these<00:01:00.840> models<00:01:01.289> they

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
crosshairs on some of these models they

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.040 
crosshairs on some of these models they
have<00:01:01.410> actual<00:01:01.769> precise<00:01:02.519> aiming<00:01:02.879> points<00:01:03.480> what
