 error in the tank tires very small water 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.789
 sooner or later ends and we 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.890

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.750
 feature over the game world here also 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.789
 have worked at the glory level very

 varied you are not just stupid to drive and 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.720
 put out fire on locations thriller we 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.399
 placed a lot of items with 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.649
 which need to interact 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.090
 drive far away various ice 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.960
 or boulders to 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.210
 drive on 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.309
 lock them with some passages so that the water 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.500
 went in a certain direction to play 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.059
 really interesting add here and 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.059
 fantastic water physics 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.730
 before you the continuation of one of the most 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.250
 beautiful android key racing 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.170
 change 3 first appeared online 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.090
 regret mode in it for some reason can 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.550
 participate in a maximum of two people 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.170
 second there was a system of tricks without 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.449
 The last win will be difficult 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.830
 After all, for the tricks you get the subway 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.810
 but without panic 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.640
 here you are not mashed any tricks 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.840
 just somewhere around the strongest run 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.520
 they are easier than simple 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.729
 third specifically increased the number 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.290
 trails and their qualities especially we would 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.570
 celebrated the race taking place in 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.530
 all kinds of glaciers here naturally 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.050
 breathtaking 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.090
 and as for water, the first part 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.610
 for these beauties you could safely give 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.890
 left hand for water prep type 2 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.479
 give well we don't know shorter the water here 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.479
 prettier than in the real world 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.940
 toy with a bright logo and powerful 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.130
 screenshots that are sure to lure 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.530
 their networks are far from inexperienced 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.690
 user google play download and so 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.210
 more buying this game we strongly 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.860
 We do not recommend the fact that get to the bottom 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.140
 can be to any item that 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.360
 developers presented as dignity 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.120
 games take at least control with 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.040
 Gyro you will really feel 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.260
 that you are sitting in a trench and on you from all 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.570
 sides pond germans waving their tablet 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.970
 you will sho leper first 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.280
 uncomfortable secondly neighbor metro on the right 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.470
 all your teeth will come out quickly and the graphics 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.080
 Well, you yourself see the picture here 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.510
 crap level in general 1 task 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.020
 no play boring absolutely passed 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.020
 played 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.220
 perhaps the best skateboarding simulator 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.230
 on android fingerboard is more accurate because 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.660
 the game is not a skater and you are 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.140
 manage it directly for her 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.540
 fingers 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.910
 in fact it is here that the main and lies 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.430
 the secret of the game she is incredibly intuitive 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.560
 like this we push off like this 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.510
 do olga like this you can spin 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.180
 skype is sharp on one side like this 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.460
 turn it over the air well you are not alone 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.890
 from those tutorial games that 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.740
 it is not necessary to run and vsky park 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.990
 everything will come by itself the game is also the price 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.060
 so that everything is represented here 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.640
 existing tricks in the world that will 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.140
 helpful novice traders and weak 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.650
 parties can be noted only one 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.450
 skype 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.430
 however, the developers promise to add 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.430
 a couple soon 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.420
 game based on your favorite series 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.280
 the walking dead however maybe it's not 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.270
 quite what you expected in front of you 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.130
 top-down arcade 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.530
 if you want plot twists and turns and 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.140
 experiences for the characters you are not here 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.239
 although of course there is someone familiar to you 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.940
 locations like hi in with tank first 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.890
 series and key characters and so in front 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.900
 each round you make yourself a team 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.950
 each member of which has unique 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.050
 opportunities and 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.239
 go to perform simple missions like 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.489
 collecting loot on the map as opposed to 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.950
 TV series of zombies in this game is very 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.290
 able to run so it will have to run 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.180
 its developers fortunately maximum 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.130
 simplified management of the entire squad can 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.290
 control one tap and shoot 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.660
 happens automatically and we still 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.660
 recommend this game to fans of the original
