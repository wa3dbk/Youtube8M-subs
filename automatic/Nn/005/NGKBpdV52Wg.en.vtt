video I used a pastry bag to fill the
shells<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.480> time<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:51.750> just<00:02:51.870> used<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.350> spoon<00:02:52.650> to

it's fine
and<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:56.280> recommend<00:02:56.790> under<00:02:57.090> cooking<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.600> shells

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
and I recommend under cooking the shells

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.510 
and I recommend under cooking the shells
about<00:02:58.260> three<00:02:58.620> minutes<00:02:58.800> so<00:02:59.130> they're<00:02:59.280> nice<00:02:59.490> and

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
about three minutes so they're nice and

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.970 
about three minutes so they're nice and
firm<00:02:59.970> if<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.600> overcook<00:03:01.140> them<00:03:01.350> they<00:03:01.680> will<00:03:01.830> be

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
firm if you overcook them they will be

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.250 
firm if you overcook them they will be
soft<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.640> can<00:03:02.760> break<00:03:03.030> Plus<00:03:03.720> these<00:03:03.959> are<00:03:04.110> going

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
soft and can break Plus these are going

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.570 
soft and can break Plus these are going

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
to go in the oven so they'll finish
