heard<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.340> kind<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.669> pace<00:00:32.880> but<00:00:33.420> we'll<00:00:33.600> just

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
heard this kind of pace but we'll just

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.530 
heard this kind of pace but we'll just
create<00:00:33.960> our<00:00:34.140> own<00:00:34.170> version<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.980> reason<00:00:35.540> so

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
create our own version in reason so

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.760

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.120 
all the way bring up the resolution all
the<00:01:44.280> way<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.610> set<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.329> rate<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.990> about<00:01:46.259> sixty

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
the way and set the rate to about sixty

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.520 
the way and set the rate to about sixty
four<00:01:47.369> engine<00:01:48.270> then<00:01:48.869> just<00:01:49.110> bring<00:01:49.229> up<00:01:49.409> the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
four engine then just bring up the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.100 
four engine then just bring up the
master<00:01:49.970> because<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.149> just<00:01:51.180> really<00:01:51.570> brings

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
master because that just really brings

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.149 
master because that just really brings
down<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.350> signal

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
down the signal

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.779 
down the signal
yeah<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.810> we<00:01:55.990> got<00:01:56.140> our<00:01:56.170> nice<00:01:56.380> ya<00:01:56.710> going<00:01:57.219> now

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
yeah so we got our nice ya going now

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.120 
yeah so we got our nice ya going now
just<00:01:58.030> turn<00:01:58.240> on<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.509> cut<00:01:58.719> and<00:01:58.899> boost<00:01:59.859> some

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
just turn on the cut and boost some

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.649 
just turn on the cut and boost some
highs<00:02:00.310> with<00:02:00.609> the<00:02:00.700> value<00:02:00.939> of<00:02:00.999> about<00:02:01.090> thirty<00:02:01.450> one

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
highs with the value of about thirty one

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.080 
highs with the value of about thirty one
take<00:02:02.049> out<00:02:02.200> some<00:02:02.469> it's<00:02:02.649> just<00:02:03.130> minus<00:02:03.609> eleven<00:02:03.939> and

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
take out some it's just minus eleven and

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.559 
take out some it's just minus eleven and
bring<00:02:04.689> up<00:02:04.929> some<00:02:05.170> of<00:02:05.229> those<00:02:05.319> just<00:02:05.649> 11<00:02:06.450> but<00:02:07.450> we

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
bring up some of those just 11 but we

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.320 
bring up some of those just 11 but we
run<00:02:07.689> it<00:02:07.810> through<00:02:07.959> an<00:02:08.049> equalizer<00:02:08.410> now<00:02:08.619> anyway

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
run it through an equalizer now anyway

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.690 
run it through an equalizer now anyway
so<00:02:10.330> just<00:02:10.569> check<00:02:10.810> that<00:02:10.989> in<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:11.459> boost<00:02:12.459> some

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
so just check that in and boost some

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.470 
so just check that in and boost some
wallows<00:02:13.030> just<00:02:13.810> with<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.080> value<00:02:14.319> of<00:02:14.379> about<00:02:15.480> 90

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
wallows just with the value of about 90

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.030 
wallows just with the value of about 90
be<00:02:16.920> yeah<00:02:17.920> that's<00:02:18.459> okay<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.330> no<00:02:19.900> sorry<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:20.830> now

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
be yeah that's okay and no sorry and now

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.910 
be yeah that's okay and no sorry and now
just<00:02:21.310> in<00:02:21.519> select<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.090> pariah<00:02:22.269> and<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:23.379> set<00:02:23.830> the

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
just in select a pariah and and set the

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.970 
just in select a pariah and and set the
frequency<00:02:24.069> to<00:02:24.459> about<00:02:24.670> two<00:02:25.209> kilohertz<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:26.200> dig

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
frequency to about two kilohertz and dig

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.699 
frequency to about two kilohertz and dig
a<00:02:27.069> hole<00:02:27.190> in<00:02:27.400> there<00:02:28.019> so<00:02:29.019> we<00:02:29.200> just<00:02:29.349> get<00:02:29.530> rid<00:02:29.650> of

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
a hole in there so we just get rid of

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.350 
a hole in there so we just get rid of
some<00:02:29.829> sounds<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.489> way<00:02:30.849> that<00:02:31.030> we<00:02:31.150> don't

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
some sounds that way that we don't

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.550 
some sounds that way that we don't
really<00:02:31.629> want<00:02:32.879> night<00:02:33.879> night<00:02:34.209> that<00:02:35.140> sounds<00:02:35.410> nice

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
really want night night that sounds nice

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.080 
really want night night that sounds nice
but<00:02:35.769> we<00:02:35.980> got<00:02:36.129> a<00:02:36.160> little<00:02:36.400> bit<00:02:36.610> too<00:02:36.730> much<00:02:36.849> low

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
but we got a little bit too much low

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.580 
but we got a little bit too much low
such<00:02:37.360> as<00:02:37.540> being<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.870> frequency<00:02:38.290> down<00:02:38.440> to

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
such as being the frequency down to

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.479 
such as being the frequency down to
about<00:02:38.709> 80<00:02:39.459> hurts<00:02:39.819> to<00:02:40.209> get<00:02:40.329> into<00:02:40.510> about<00:02:41.220> 89<00:02:42.220> 90

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
about 80 hurts to get into about 89 90

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.390 
about 80 hurts to get into about 89 90
that's<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.209> sweet<00:02:43.739> now<00:02:44.739> we<00:02:44.799> run<00:02:45.069> it<00:02:45.220> through<00:02:45.370> a

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
that's a sweet now we run it through a

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.819 
that's a sweet now we run it through a
compressor<00:02:47.970> bring<00:02:48.970> up<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.209> input<00:02:49.480> gain<00:02:49.829> bring

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
compressor bring up the input gain bring

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.440 
compressor bring up the input gain bring
down<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.220> threshold<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:51.879> bring<00:02:52.120> up<00:02:52.299> the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
down the threshold and bring up the

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.920 
down the threshold and bring up the
ratio<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.609> then<00:02:54.609> just<00:02:54.819> adjust<00:02:55.420> you<00:02:55.510> up<00:02:55.629> again

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
ratio and then just adjust you up again

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.110 
ratio and then just adjust you up again
yeah<00:02:56.489> yeah<00:02:57.489> yeah<00:02:57.790> yeah<00:02:58.090> yeah<00:02:58.560> sweet<00:03:00.120> yeah

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
that's okay and now just to buying it up

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.059 
that's okay and now just to buying it up
a<00:03:04.329> bit<00:03:04.420> we<00:03:04.720> run<00:03:04.900> it<00:03:05.019> through<00:03:05.139> a<00:03:05.200> unison<00:03:05.620> as<00:03:05.799> i

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
the decay to about 36 and you drive it

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.789 
the decay to about 36 and you drive it
to<00:03:24.880> about<00:03:25.060> 24<00:03:25.569> and<00:03:25.900> just<00:03:26.109> bring<00:03:26.380> up<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.620> dam<00:03:26.769> to

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
to about 24 and just bring up the dam to

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.129 
to about 24 and just bring up the dam to
about<00:03:27.099> 62<00:03:27.579> yah<00:03:28.120> yah<00:03:28.599> yah<00:03:28.900> yah<00:03:29.380> yah<00:03:29.680> yah<00:03:30.250> yah<00:03:30.700> yah
