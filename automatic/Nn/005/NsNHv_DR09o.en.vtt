the tsuroz for PvP is very very viable

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.370

head kill and the only thing that really

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.999 
head kill and the only thing that really
competes<00:01:19.830> with<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:21.030> vex<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:22.500> last

online<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:11.340> one<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.480> reasons<00:02:12.840> why<00:02:13.050> I

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.120 
this game so golden gun is really good
in<00:02:59.690> my<00:03:00.690> opinion<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.050> best<00:03:01.260> super<00:03:01.830> in<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:01.950> game

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
in my opinion the best super in the game

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.710 
in my opinion the best super in the game
because<00:03:02.490> you<00:03:02.640> don't<00:03:02.880> have<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.120> be<00:03:03.330> up<00:03:03.420> close<00:03:03.450> to

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
because you don't have to be up close to

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.810 
because you don't have to be up close to
your<00:03:03.990> opponent<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.530> kill<00:03:04.800> them<00:03:04.980> it's<00:03:05.460> a<00:03:05.610> one

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
your opponent to kill them it's a one

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.600 
your opponent to kill them it's a one
shot<00:03:06.090> from<00:03:06.450> distance<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.980> don't<00:03:08.490> even

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
shot from distance and you don't even

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.250 
shot from distance and you don't even
have<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:08.880> take<00:03:09.150> any<00:03:09.330> health<00:03:09.600> damage<00:03:09.840> if<00:03:10.230> you

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
have to take any health damage if you

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.470 
have to take any health damage if you
shoot<00:03:11.070> them<00:03:11.280> before<00:03:11.670> they<00:03:11.790> look<00:03:12.000> at<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.270> and

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
shoot them before they look at you and

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.870 
shoot them before they look at you and
it's<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.290> one<00:03:13.470> shot<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:13.740> you<00:03:14.100> can<00:03:14.370> do<00:03:14.490> that<00:03:14.640> most

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
it's a one shot so you can do that most

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.330 
it's a one shot so you can do that most
of<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.180> time<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.660> it<00:03:16.260> charges<00:03:16.530> very<00:03:17.040> very

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
of the time and it charges very very

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.130 
of the time and it charges very very
quickly<00:03:17.670> if<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.030> have<00:03:18.180> it<00:03:18.360> fully<00:03:18.510> upgraded

quickly if you have it fully upgraded

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.870 
quickly if you have it fully upgraded
and<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.770> have<00:03:19.980> your<00:03:20.130> intellect<00:03:20.580> on<00:03:20.730> your

streak<00:03:37.290> in<00:03:37.440> crucible<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:37.980> think<00:03:38.220> that<00:03:38.340> was<00:03:38.490> the

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
streak in crucible I think that was the

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.080 
streak in crucible I think that was the
most<00:03:39.390> I<00:03:39.600> got<00:03:39.810> in<00:03:40.020> a<00:03:40.260> in<00:03:40.710> a<00:03:41.100> five<00:03:41.310> second<00:03:41.790> or<00:03:41.910> 10

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
most I got in a in a five second or 10

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.390 
most I got in a in a five second or 10
seconds<00:03:42.510> ban<00:03:42.720> like<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.500> most<00:03:43.740> I've<00:03:44.010> stacked

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
seconds ban like the most I've stacked

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.700 
seconds ban like the most I've stacked
on<00:03:44.580> top<00:03:44.610> of<00:03:44.820> each<00:03:45.030> other<00:03:45.210> to<00:03:46.170> show<00:03:46.350> up<00:03:46.470> on<00:03:46.620> the

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
on top of each other to show up on the

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.450 
screen at a time so that was plus 1000
and<00:03:50.810> not<00:03:51.810> too<00:03:52.200> many<00:03:52.410> classes<00:03:52.950> will<00:03:53.100> let<00:03:53.220> you<00:03:53.340> do

kudos to buns you for putting an

kudos to buns you for putting an
overpowered<00:03:58.860> super<00:03:59.280> in<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.490> game<00:03:59.640> like<00:03:59.880> this

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
overpowered super in the game like this

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.590 
overpowered super in the game like this
it<00:04:00.330> is<00:04:00.960> pretty<00:04:01.350> broken<00:04:01.740> but<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:02.910> think<00:04:03.330> that<00:04:03.480> is

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
it is pretty broken but I think that is

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.090 
it is pretty broken but I think that is
part<00:04:03.810> of<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:03.990> reason<00:04:04.230> why<00:04:04.260> bungee<00:04:04.740> said<00:04:04.950> that

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
part of the reason why bungee said that

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.700 
part of the reason why bungee said that
they<00:04:05.250> are<00:04:05.370> possibly<00:04:05.880> making<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.480> no<00:04:07.200> super

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
they are possibly making a no super

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.950 
they are possibly making a no super
playlist<00:04:08.190> also<00:04:08.610> so<00:04:09.060> you<00:04:09.150> can<00:04:09.300> run<00:04:09.480> around<00:04:09.600> with

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
playlist also so you can run around with

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.780 
playlist also so you can run around with
guns<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:10.530> not<00:04:10.800> worry<00:04:10.980> about<00:04:11.040> supers<00:04:11.580> but

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
guns and not worry about supers but

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:12.680 
guns and not worry about supers but
you're<00:04:11.910> still<00:04:12.030> gonna<00:04:12.210> have<00:04:12.270> to<00:04:12.420> worry<00:04:12.570> about

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
you're still gonna have to worry about

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.920 
you're still gonna have to worry about
melees<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:13.440> it<00:04:14.010> sometimes<00:04:14.510> some<00:04:15.510> points<00:04:15.840> in

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
melees and it sometimes some points in

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.470 
melees and it sometimes some points in
the<00:04:16.020> game<00:04:16.049> supers<00:04:16.770> feel<00:04:17.730> like<00:04:17.940> they're<00:04:18.270> being

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
the game supers feel like they're being

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.330 
the game supers feel like they're being
done<00:04:18.720> but<00:04:18.900> it's<00:04:19.049> only<00:04:19.230> a<00:04:19.350> melee<00:04:19.710> when<00:04:20.220> you're

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
done but it's only a melee when you're

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.130 
done but it's only a melee when you're
going<00:04:20.520> up<00:04:20.700> against<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.150> titan<00:04:21.479> because<00:04:21.960> they

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
going up against the titan because they

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.600 
going up against the titan because they
have<00:04:22.229> the<00:04:22.290> shoulder<00:04:22.740> charge<00:04:22.919> that<00:04:23.220> one<00:04:23.400> hits

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
have the shoulder charge that one hits

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.460 
have the shoulder charge that one hits
anything<00:04:23.820> which<00:04:24.660> i've<00:04:24.900> been<00:04:25.080> getting<00:04:25.200> hit<00:04:25.440> by

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
anything which i've been getting hit by

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
a lot in crucible

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.100 
a lot in crucible
which<00:04:26.940> is<00:04:27.120> crazy<00:04:27.620> but<00:04:28.970> I<00:04:29.970> still<00:04:30.450> think<00:04:30.720> super

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
which is crazy but I still think super

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.620 
which is crazy but I still think super
on<00:04:31.350> hunter<00:04:32.160> is<00:04:32.340> worth<00:04:32.520> playing<00:04:32.820> even<00:04:33.510> though

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630

and<00:05:10.190> the<00:05:11.190> range<00:05:11.610> is<00:05:11.910> so<00:05:12.660> much<00:05:12.840> better<00:05:13.050> when<00:05:13.890> you

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
and the range is so much better when you

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.970 
and the range is so much better when you
upgraded<00:05:15.750> I<00:05:15.900> know<00:05:16.170> I<00:05:16.350> said<00:05:16.650> in<00:05:16.740> a<00:05:16.830> previous

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
upgraded I know I said in a previous

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.640 
upgraded I know I said in a previous
video<00:05:17.310> do<00:05:17.730> not<00:05:17.910> upgrade<00:05:18.090> the<00:05:18.420> tsuroz<00:05:18.750> because

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
video do not upgrade the tsuroz because

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.760 
video do not upgrade the tsuroz because
it<00:05:20.070> will<00:05:20.790> have<00:05:20.970> less<00:05:21.180> damage<00:05:21.570> because<00:05:22.560> it<00:05:22.680> will

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
it will have less damage because it will

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.530 
it will have less damage because it will
fire<00:05:22.980> slower<00:05:23.310> but<00:05:23.970> it<00:05:24.120> actually<00:05:24.300> increases

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
fire slower but it actually increases

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.200 
fire slower but it actually increases
the<00:05:25.200> damage<00:05:25.380> Empire<00:05:26.010> slower<00:05:26.400> when<00:05:26.970> you<00:05:27.000> get

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
the damage Empire slower when you get

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.540 
the damage Empire slower when you get
the<00:05:27.300> upgrade<00:05:27.420> sort<00:05:27.900> which<00:05:28.770> I<00:05:29.100> thought<00:05:29.400> would

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
the upgrade sort which I thought would

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.880 
the upgrade sort which I thought would
be<00:05:29.610> bad<00:05:29.940> but<00:05:30.270> at<00:05:30.420> the<00:05:30.510> same<00:05:30.720> time<00:05:30.930> it<00:05:31.170> it<00:05:31.470> does

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
be bad but at the same time it it does

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.190 
be bad but at the same time it it does
kill<00:05:32.400> a<00:05:32.430> lot<00:05:32.850> quicker<00:05:33.120> because<00:05:33.660> the<00:05:34.020> head

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
kill a lot quicker because the head

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.310 
kill a lot quicker because the head
shots<00:05:34.470> go<00:05:34.710> from<00:05:34.740> 28<00:05:35.520> /<00:05:35.790> had<00:05:35.940> shot<00:05:36.240> firing<00:05:36.870> fast

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
shots go from 28 / had shot firing fast

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.220 
shots go from 28 / had shot firing fast
with<00:05:37.590> no<00:05:37.620> upgrades<00:05:38.190> to<00:05:38.820> 36<00:05:39.600> per<00:05:39.810> head<00:05:39.990> shot

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
with no upgrades to 36 per head shot

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.610 
with no upgrades to 36 per head shot
firing<00:05:40.950> slow<00:05:41.310> with<00:05:41.730> the<00:05:41.880> upgrades<00:05:42.240> and<00:05:42.480> I<00:05:43.410> also
