permaculture<00:00:06.390> is<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.930> design<00:00:07.259> science

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.030 
permaculture is the design science

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.720 
permaculture is the design science
integrating<00:00:09.030> natural<00:00:09.360> resources<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.320> human

integrating natural resources and human

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:21.340 
integrating natural resources and human
design<00:00:11.809> we<00:00:12.809> talked<00:00:13.019> about<00:00:13.110> sustainability

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.990 

our<00:00:22.350> acceptance<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.189> understanding<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.880> that

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
our acceptance and understanding of that

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.820 
our acceptance and understanding of that
is<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.420> bring<00:00:24.720> significance<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.590> how<00:00:25.769> we

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
is going to bring significance to how we

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.310 
is going to bring significance to how we
interact<00:00:26.189> with<00:00:26.640> our<00:00:26.880> lives<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.960> design

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320

within<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:28.949> system<00:00:30.050> permaculture<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.109> great

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
within that system permaculture is great

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.530 
within that system permaculture is great
because<00:00:31.590> all<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.880> synthesis<00:00:33.420> of

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
because all it is is the synthesis of

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.450

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.330 
and mechanisms that produce more energy
than<00:00:48.840> they<00:00:48.989> consume<00:00:49.110> over<00:00:49.559> their<00:00:49.860> lifetime<00:00:50.309> or

all<00:01:09.689> we<00:01:09.869> need<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.049> do<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.290> really<00:01:10.439> fasten<00:01:10.950> it

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
all we need to do is really fasten it

finite resources getting people involved

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.520 
finite resources getting people involved
is<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> challenging<00:01:33.509> concept<00:01:34.110> because<00:01:34.350> we've

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
is a challenging concept because we've

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.120 
is a challenging concept because we've
moved<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.340> far<00:01:35.640> from<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.329> cooperative<00:01:37.229> culture

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
moved so far from a cooperative culture

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.010 
moved so far from a cooperative culture
you<00:01:38.880> know<00:01:39.000> there's<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.270> very<00:01:39.509> competitive

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
you know there's a very competitive

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.410 
you know there's a very competitive
approach<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.979> how<00:01:41.340> humans<00:01:41.790> have<00:01:41.909> evolved<00:01:42.329> on

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
so prevailing westerlies are always

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.309 
so prevailing westerlies are always
flowing<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.790> east<00:02:35.970> but<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.900> depends<00:02:37.230> of

collapse and this whole concept and
climate<00:04:08.010> change<00:04:08.250> all<00:04:08.670> different

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
climate change all different

climate change all different
walks<00:04:09.780> of<00:04:09.989> life<00:04:10.170> are<00:04:10.799> drawn<00:04:11.129> to<00:04:11.700> permaculture

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
walks of life are drawn to permaculture

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.270 
walks of life are drawn to permaculture
it's<00:04:12.629> for<00:04:12.870> one<00:04:13.079> reason<00:04:13.109> or<00:04:13.499> another<00:04:13.560> and

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
it's for one reason or another and

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.430 
it's for one reason or another and
that's<00:04:14.609> an<00:04:14.879> exciting<00:04:15.359> thing<00:04:15.569> and<00:04:15.989> they<00:04:16.259> can

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
that's an exciting thing and they can

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.740 
that's an exciting thing and they can
come<00:04:16.650> here<00:04:16.919> they<00:04:17.280> can<00:04:17.489> pursue<00:04:18.090> that<00:04:18.120> knowledge

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
come here they can pursue that knowledge

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.990 
come here they can pursue that knowledge
and<00:04:19.019> then<00:04:19.259> synthesize<00:04:19.530> it<00:04:20.100> into<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.459> field<00:04:20.789> that

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
and then synthesize it into a field that

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.180 
and then synthesize it into a field that
they<00:04:21.120> may<00:04:21.299> already<00:04:22.019> have<00:04:22.199> experience<00:04:22.949> in

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
they may already have experience in

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.839 
they may already have experience in
that's<00:04:23.639> really<00:04:23.850> inspiring<00:04:25.550> so<00:04:26.550> you<00:04:26.639> have<00:04:26.759> to

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:26.849 
that's really inspiring so you have to

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:27.770 
that's really inspiring so you have to
cut<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.090> leaves<00:04:27.300> off<00:04:27.479> so<00:04:27.660> it<00:04:27.720> doesn't

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
cut the leaves off so it doesn't

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.779 
cut the leaves off so it doesn't
evaporate<00:04:28.380> all<00:04:28.800> of<00:04:28.919> this<00:04:29.009> energy<00:04:29.400> you're

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
evaporate all of this energy you're

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:30.890 
evaporate all of this energy you're
gonna<00:04:29.880> harvest<00:04:30.120> that<00:04:30.360> one<00:04:30.479> in<00:04:30.570> like<00:04:30.690> three

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
gonna harvest that one in like three

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.960 
gonna harvest that one in like three
weeks
