00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.129
 Hi, welcome to the board in this class. 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.750
 let's talk about the cube the cube is a 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:19.710
 special parallelepiped whose edges 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.510
 They are all congruent ie all 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.590
 cube edges have the same size 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:30.300
 thus all the faces of a cube 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.940
 are square 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.950
 We will learn in this class to calculate the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:41.130
 area and the cube diagonal these volume 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.610
 three measures are based on the calculations 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:47.550
 which we have already seen for the parallelepiped 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:51.390
 the hub being a special parallelepiped 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.800
 the total area is equal to the sum of the areas of 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.270
 all faces 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.410
 we have twice the daily basis to 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.510
 square 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:08.009
 but four side faces also daily 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:12.659
 squared ie the total area is equal to 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:16.049
 to six times the value of the edges 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.150
 square to the diagonal of the 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.500
 parallelepipeds we feel that the 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.430
 diagonal is equal to the sum of squares 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.479
 of the edges 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:31.350
 here we have air squared 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:36.900
 but squared being these edges 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:41.159
 air base this is the height that 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:48.079
 is also squared or is equal to 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:55.170
 to three times the square of is equal to 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:59.710
 volume volume is equal to the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:03.560
 area of ​​base times height 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:09.890
 in the base we have a square of area a 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:14.360
 square the height which is also 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.970
 volume is then equal to the value of 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.640
 to the cube 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.860
 let's see this now in an example with 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.040
 numbers 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:29.120
 we have here a cube of five edges 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:35.090
 centimeters and its diagonal 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:41.450
 the total surface area will then be s 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:49.209
 equal to six times 5 squared is this 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:51.250
 will then be equal to 150 centimeters 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.080
 squares 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.640
 already the diagonal 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:01.880
 simply replace the value of the edge in the 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:06.019
 then the diagonal will be equal to 5 reais of 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:09.500
 3 centimeters never forget the unit 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:13.900
 is personal and the volume is also only 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.900
 replace the value 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:23.599
 from to we know that at five centimeters 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:26.360
 then the volume will be equal to 125 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:30.200
 cubic centimeters 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:34.489
 ok in this next example we have a 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:38.180
 cube-shaped reservoir of volume 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:41.420
 equal to 216 cubic meters and this 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.580
 reservoir does not have a cap 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.849
 Let's imagine that we need 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.329
 collect the entire internal part of this 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:53.510
 reservoir as mass 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:56.390
 waterproofing which is the total area 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:00.470
 it will be covered to answer this question 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:03.140
 we need to calculate the area and to 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.599
 calculate the area we need to know the 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.790
 size of areas of this cube 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:11.660
 the only information he gave us is that 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:15.590
 the volume equals 216 cubic meters 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:18.979
 from this information we can 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:22.370
 find the size of the edges because 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:27.580
 we know that the volume of a cube is 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:34.520
 equal to its edges raised to cube 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:41.260
 so the cube is equal to 216 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:47.120
 cubic meters equal to the cube root of 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:50.120
 216 a is equal to six meters 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.460
 now that I know the size of the edge I 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.820
 I can calculate the value of the area 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:05:01.520
 surface area to be covered 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:06.110
 total of one cube is equal to six times the 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.070
 Air squares but like I said 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.490
 for you guys 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:14.120
 this tank has no cover or 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:17.660
 be we will not calculate one of the 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.720
 faces then the area that I want 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:24.680
 the total area to be covered will be 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.940
 equal to 5 a squared because I only 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.270
 I have the area of 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:33.170
 base and the four side walls for 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:37.220
 to cover 5 only makes the area 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:40.130
 total that will be covered will be equal to 5 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:46.100
 times 6 squared 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:51.340
 the total area will be equal to 180 meters 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.340
 square the area to be covered
