00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.049
 jacqueline sportgala at the start below 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.550
 there is such a small point again 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.630
 to criticize that maybe me 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.849
 I say interrupt 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.440
 and I get the last time 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.360
 more and more messages to one 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.600
 specific product and the product is called 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.650
 like how or wmv wma and 2 what 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.400
 is it in the project that is one 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.070
 product of the brand the most of all 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.590
 produces energy drinks food supplement 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.680
 i think program knows where to go 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.390
 especially on mineral micronutrients 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.910
 it is worth it, so to speak 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.079
 the advertising message we have healthy 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.940
 Energydrinks we have more 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.840
 micronutrients have more minerals in it 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.399
 and so on and one point you have to 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.570
 know when to products how these 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.430
 You can not just do it in the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.260
 Supermarket buy so usually 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.180
 not and not in a normal 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.640
 online shop but the whole one kind 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.780
 structure distribution and so what you can 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.219
 introduce yourself as for example 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.699
 Insurance You may know her 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.589
 hamburg mannheimer to ergo 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.840
 insurance there it is so you 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.490
 always something is recommended and you often 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.860
 usually something is sold what 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.360
 Not really needed and here 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.710
 Structural distribution means that a few 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.960
 person above have ne giant 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.630
 reach yes it could be tried right away 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.460
 youtube probably relate that 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.439
 people the long reach the hollow 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.880
 few people and always recommend that 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.229
 this is what Chancellor is called 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.299
 Structure distribution is similar to a 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.340
 snowball principle the people the above 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.020
 stand to recommend this, so to speak 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.060
 good creator as well as earned right 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.890
 golden shot and couple of people below 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.420
 are underneath are, so to speak 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.119
 Jumping Jacks we recruit a bit 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.920
 and this wiemer is a product of what 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.899
 half so familiar yes is expelled 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.210
 can one say displaced yes how one 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.890
 is driven out and that much 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.079
 successful especially in america in usa 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.030
 and in austria so now that spills 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.229
 whole thing to Germany of course 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.640
 slowly over and yes that's up 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.460
 any case the reason that can only say 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.110
 why for some time some people 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.030
 very many videos over 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.710
 minerals and micronutrients 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.409
 strangely make and tell you 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.600
 how they are so important and 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.030
 as they suddenly so much 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.890
 I need it from here 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.960
 appeal to your own wisdom 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.660
 informed you have the internet as 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.570
 a lot of micro and macro and minerals 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.980
 usually needs for you alone 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.660
 and especially with the minerals and 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.570
 Micronutrients you will notice that 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.660
 are often just a daily requirement of 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.360
 milligrams of 100 milligrams stated that 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.160
 means so much what I want to say 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.860
 minerals micronutrients you take 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.630
 with the food more than enough on it 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.500
 you are just eating properly 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.660
 that means they are a bit too 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.310
 fruit calls for a bit of vegetables then 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.050
 you need about the minerals 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.590
 and the micronutrients no thoughts 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.300
 do 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.950
 Now there are a few people telling her 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.480
 may need more and more 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.280
 possibly the course also both 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.020
 products and that's why it will be soon 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.310
 probably to get that 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.820
 maybe one way or the other 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.240
 youtube channel at once these cans 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.550
 build these products in the background 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.710
 and of course it will be told as well 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.540
 these products are and how much you like them 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.100
 needed and if so easy now 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.890
 think about what's behind a lot 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.450
 very large field commission program where 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.030
 certainly has people that the then to 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.200
 warm up a golden nose deserve 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.440
 maybe not already 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.120
 rather have and in the sense considered 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.240
 Just if you really like these products 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.980
 if you need these people or 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.140
 The victims will somebody give you a sacrifice 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.490
 that's how she 'll really need it 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.170
 the quality can not say much 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.210
 may be good that these energy drinks are so 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.370
 taste good that are also healthier 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.010
 as red bull or co or that is protein 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.990
 Powder no bad and right 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.000
 Amino acid profile is but I believe 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.860
 and that can simply fail this 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.300
 products do not reinvent the wheel 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.160
 are already good products 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.630
 it just will just be that way 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.280
 and through this structure distribution 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.230
 Once a lot of people are ready for you 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.170
 to recommend such to you 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.550
 and whether you want to buy now or not 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.990
 Of course it's up to you I wanted 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.000
 Just give me my opinion on this 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.720
 how can tell where many already over it 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.810
 to discuss 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.550
 in my eyes you can just 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.840
 continue or should you just 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.460
 reasonable because then you need the 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.750
 Products do not matter if you have the purchase order 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.950
 I do not give a shit, I thought 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.540
 have in my opinion out because me 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.160
 always or more and more people 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.140
 ask about the topic and of course 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.370
 more and more videos of certain people 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.900
 turn up to the topic 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.280
 to buy you a little bit 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.229
 what, of course, to prepare 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.750
 but obviously you have to be in 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.970
 At the end we seem to decide if we will 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.890
 buy the product or not and mine 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.110
 opinion does not do what you do 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.490
 but wants the gc again the critic 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.229
 probably makes him less and less 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.510
 friendly on youtube I have that 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:41.030
 feeling but i'm just trying to 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.830
 say what I know what I can and me 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.570
 have also no great but I 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.940
 Just want to share my opinion 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.440
 Tell your questions here that I 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.090
 say you do not need that and we do 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.860
 just make a very big deal 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.570
 behind it but I hope 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.190
 switched easily to their wisdom 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.990
 Just take a look for what you need 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.820
 I really smaller at the minerals 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:04.030
 tip and little memo to how 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.030
 minerals and co 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.000
 the letter became
