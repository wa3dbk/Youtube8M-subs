when I did some research on these by the

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.969 
when I did some research on these by the
way<00:01:30.649> it's<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.789> Salomon<00:01:33.909> synapses<00:01:34.909> Nile<00:01:35.719> I<00:01:36.170> got

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
way it's the Salomon synapses Nile I got

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.840 
way it's the Salomon synapses Nile I got
it<00:01:37.100> written<00:01:37.249> down<00:01:37.990> it<00:01:38.990> says<00:01:39.770> Solomon<00:01:40.189> here<00:01:40.700> on

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
it written down it says Solomon here on

rubberized I don't know what but it's it

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.130 
rubberized I don't know what but it's it
feels<00:04:16.310> kind<00:04:16.609> of<00:04:16.640> like<00:04:16.700> a<00:04:16.790> rubber<00:04:17.090> and<00:04:17.359> then<00:04:17.930> in

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
feels kind of like a rubber and then in

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.750 
feels kind of like a rubber and then in
between<00:04:18.290> there<00:04:18.799> maybe<00:04:19.130> that's<00:04:19.370> not<00:04:19.520> the<00:04:19.580> best

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
between there maybe that's not the best

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.330 
between there maybe that's not the best
lighting<00:04:20.480> there<00:04:21.080> we<00:04:21.200> go<00:04:21.320> and<00:04:21.530> then<00:04:22.010> between

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
lighting there we go and then between

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.730 
lighting there we go and then between
there<00:04:22.700> right<00:04:23.060> here<00:04:23.450> and<00:04:23.660> up<00:04:23.750> here<00:04:23.780> is<00:04:24.169> that

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
there right here and up here is that

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.550 
there right here and up here is that
mesh

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
mesh

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.490 
mesh
it<00:04:26.310> says<00:04:26.580> a<00:04:26.610> a<00:04:26.910> mudguard<00:04:27.450> so<00:04:28.169> it's<00:04:28.320> got<00:04:28.470> a

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
it says a a mudguard so it's got a
