grind it if like I think five runs in a
row<00:00:31.230> almost<00:00:31.679> as<00:00:31.890> terrace<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.489> those<00:00:32.610> two<00:00:32.730> and

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
row almost as terrace and those two and

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.880 
row almost as terrace and those two and
we<00:00:33.540> just<00:00:33.750> took<00:00:33.930> like<00:00:34.110> we<00:00:34.230> just<00:00:34.350> took<00:00:34.500> one<00:00:34.680> round

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
we just took like we just took one round

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.620 
we just took like we just took one round
at<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.010> time<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:35.610> just<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.300> won<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.540> round

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
at a time and we just we won the round

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.630 
at a time and we just we won the round
so<00:00:36.809> we<00:00:36.840> should<00:00:37.079> so<00:00:37.260> we<00:00:37.410> like<00:00:38.010> we<00:00:38.280> didn't<00:00:38.520> really

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
so we should so we like we didn't really

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.880 
so we should so we like we didn't really
get<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.210> patrols<00:00:39.629> economy<00:00:40.440> wise<00:00:40.559> we<00:00:40.770> had

they<00:02:58.920> don't<00:02:59.069> really<00:02:59.280> like<00:02:59.489> think<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.330> much

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
they don't really like think that much

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.000 
they don't really like think that much
of<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.660> data<00:03:00.870> limon<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.410> perform<00:03:01.709> that<00:03:01.830> just

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
of the data limon to perform that just

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.259 
of the data limon to perform that just
taken<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.310> new<00:03:02.430> turn<00:03:02.459> him<00:03:02.760> at<00:03:02.819> a<00:03:02.880> time<00:03:03.030> like<00:03:03.120> it's

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
taken a new turn him at a time like it's

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.880 
taken a new turn him at a time like it's
like<00:03:03.360> a<00:03:03.390> new<00:03:03.540> getting<00:03:03.810> new<00:03:03.900> chance<00:03:04.140> so<00:03:04.680> I<00:03:04.709> don't

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
like a new getting new chance so I don't

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.610 
like a new getting new chance so I don't
think<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.250> like<00:03:06.019> for<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.110> most<00:03:07.140> of<00:03:07.410> them<00:03:07.530> I

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
think that like for the most of them I

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.050 
think that like for the most of them I
think<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.980> doesn't<00:03:08.250> really<00:03:08.430> bother<00:03:08.519> them<00:03:08.910> that

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
think it doesn't really bother them that

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.430 
think it doesn't really bother them that
much<00:03:09.209> obviously<00:03:09.690> it<00:03:09.780> might<00:03:09.930> be<00:03:10.140> in<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.319> back

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
much obviously it might be in the back

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.290 
much obviously it might be in the back
of<00:03:10.560> their<00:03:10.680> head<00:03:10.830> if<00:03:11.220> they<00:03:11.400> start<00:03:11.610> losing<00:03:11.760> but<00:03:12.090> I

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
of their head if they start losing but I

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.330 
of their head if they start losing but I
know<00:03:12.360> that<00:03:12.690> they<00:03:12.840> go<00:03:12.989> into<00:03:13.170> every<00:03:13.380> every<00:03:14.040> new

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
know that they go into every every new

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.100 
know that they go into every every new
map<00:03:14.579> like<00:03:14.880> hey<00:03:15.150> this<00:03:15.390> is<00:03:15.570> still<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:15.840> winnable

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
map like hey this is still a winnable

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.970 
map like hey this is still a winnable
because<00:03:16.320> everyone<00:03:16.560> can<00:03:16.650> beat<00:03:16.799> each<00:03:16.890> other

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
because everyone can beat each other

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.460 
because everyone can beat each other
this<00:03:17.220> demand<00:03:17.640> so<00:03:17.790> it's<00:03:18.420> nice<00:03:18.959> no<00:03:19.140> point<00:03:19.380> in

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
this demand so it's nice no point in

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.960 
this demand so it's nice no point in
thinking<00:03:19.620> oh<00:03:19.860> we<00:03:20.190> played<00:03:20.400> bad<00:03:20.579> last<00:03:20.820> when

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
thinking oh we played bad last when

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.759 
thinking oh we played bad last when
though<00:03:21.120> we<00:03:21.450> were<00:03:21.570> played<00:03:22.079> by<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.290> first<00:03:22.410> maybe

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
though we were played by the first maybe

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.500 
though we were played by the first maybe
just<00:03:22.920> gotta<00:03:23.190> reach<00:03:23.760> at<00:03:23.880> your<00:03:24.000> brain<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.329> just

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
just gotta reach at your brain and just

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.030 
just gotta reach at your brain and just
keep<00:03:24.810> going<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.079> that's<00:03:25.170> what<00:03:25.440> we<00:03:25.560> usually

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
keep going and that's what we usually

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.550 
keep going and that's what we usually
try<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:27.000> but<00:03:27.329> not<00:03:27.450> always<00:03:27.600> have<00:03:28.019> managed<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.440> do

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
try to but not always have managed to do

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.400 
try to but not always have managed to do
so<00:03:28.739> but<00:03:29.250> yeah<00:03:29.459> I<00:03:30.030> think<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.870> level<00:03:31.049> right<00:03:31.380> now

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
so but yeah I think the level right now

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.259 
so but yeah I think the level right now
is<00:03:31.829> pretty<00:03:32.250> even<00:03:32.610> actually<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:32.970> don't<00:03:33.060> think

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
is pretty even actually I don't think

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.520 
is pretty even actually I don't think
there's<00:03:33.390> one<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.630> stands<00:03:33.840> out<00:03:33.959> like<00:03:34.110> super

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
there's one that stands out like super

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.410 
there's one that stands out like super
much<00:03:34.680> as<00:03:34.860> fanatic<00:03:35.220> has<00:03:35.310> done<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.700> any<00:03:36.090> us<00:03:36.299> at

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
much as fanatic has done and any us at

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.750 
much as fanatic has done and any us at
some<00:03:36.540> point<00:03:36.720> but<00:03:36.870> i<00:03:37.049> might<00:03:37.739> go<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.400> say<00:03:38.519> that<00:03:38.700> I

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
some point but i might go and say that I

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.340 
some point but i might go and say that I
think<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:39.239> IP<00:03:39.329> might<00:03:39.989> be<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.230> one

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
think that and IP might be the one

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.580 
think that and IP might be the one
that's<00:03:40.380> most<00:03:40.739> prepared<00:03:41.070> and<00:03:41.310> most<00:03:41.579> like

that in a piece stronger team right now
but<00:04:15.690> and<00:04:15.959> also<00:04:16.650> because<00:04:16.799> I<00:04:16.829> think<00:04:16.950> that<00:04:17.039> we<00:04:17.789> to

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
but and also because I think that we to

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.779 
but and also because I think that we to
some<00:04:18.539> point<00:04:19.530> has<00:04:19.680> like<00:04:19.919> a<00:04:19.950> mental<00:04:20.370> problem

with<00:04:21.060> an<00:04:21.209> IP<00:04:21.359> I<00:04:21.450> don't<00:04:21.659> know<00:04:21.720> what<00:04:21.870> it<00:04:21.959> is<00:04:21.989> but<00:04:22.109> I

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
with an IP I don't know what it is but I

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.930 
with an IP I don't know what it is but I
know<00:04:22.950> we<00:04:23.250> almost<00:04:23.640> be

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
know we almost be

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.160 
know we almost be
them<00:04:24.060> at<00:04:24.180> catalyst<00:04:24.480> is<00:04:24.600> just<00:04:24.750> like<00:04:24.870> we<00:04:25.020> just

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
them at catalyst is just like we just

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.570 
them at catalyst is just like we just
lost<00:04:25.410> our<00:04:25.590> corp<00:04:25.830> and<00:04:25.950> it<00:04:26.040> was<00:04:26.160> like<00:04:26.340> we<00:04:26.490> lost

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
lost our corp and it was like we lost

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.170 
lost our corp and it was like we lost
last<00:04:27.060> maps<00:04:27.600> old<00:04:27.840> stupid<00:04:28.260> but<00:04:28.560> I<00:04:29.310> still<00:04:29.940> think

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
last maps old stupid but I still think

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.550 
last maps old stupid but I still think
that<00:04:30.210> envious<00:04:30.540> is<00:04:30.630> a<00:04:30.660> better<00:04:30.840> match<00:04:31.050> for<00:04:31.080> us<00:04:31.290> in

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
that envious is a better match for us in

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.560 
that envious is a better match for us in
terms<00:04:31.620> of<00:04:31.890> how<00:04:31.980> they<00:04:32.010> play<00:04:32.460> and<00:04:33.420> I<00:04:33.510> think

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
terms of how they play and I think

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.900 
terms of how they play and I think
that's<00:04:33.840> how<00:04:34.040> we<00:04:35.040> have<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.430> bigger<00:04:35.610> chance<00:04:35.790> of

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
that's how we have the bigger chance of

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.240 
that's how we have the bigger chance of
advancing<00:04:36.540> to<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:36.750> final<00:04:36.990> but<00:04:37.830> it<00:04:37.950> doesn't

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
advancing to the final but it doesn't

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.320 
advancing to the final but it doesn't
really<00:04:38.370> matter<00:04:38.550> who<00:04:38.700> we<00:04:38.790> play<00:04:38.940> both<00:04:39.090> are<00:04:39.300> a
