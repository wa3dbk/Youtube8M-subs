00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.640 

I<00:00:15.230> felt<00:00:16.230> at<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.410> time<00:00:17.960> the<00:00:18.960> early<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.380> mid

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
I felt at the time the early to mid

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.179 
I felt at the time the early to mid
seventies<00:00:21.380> conceptualism<00:00:22.380> as<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.740> kind<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.070> a

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
seventies conceptualism as a kind of a

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.509 
seventies conceptualism as a kind of a
strategy<00:00:23.820> was<00:00:24.000> exhausted<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.890> priority

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
strategy was exhausted and the priority

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.939 
strategy was exhausted and the priority
of<00:00:26.960> concept<00:00:27.960> over<00:00:28.230> image<00:00:28.880> seemed<00:00:29.880> somehow<00:00:30.949> the

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
of concept over image seemed somehow the

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.630 
of concept over image seemed somehow the
cul-de-sac<00:00:32.610> for<00:00:32.850> art<00:00:34.100> and<00:00:35.100> his<00:00:35.250> sense

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
cul-de-sac for art and his sense

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.430 
cul-de-sac for art and his sense
I<00:00:35.760> jumped<00:00:36.210> boats<00:00:36.480> really<00:00:36.840> at<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:36.960> point<00:00:37.110> I

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
I jumped boats really at that point I

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.459 
I jumped boats really at that point I
just<00:00:37.469> felt<00:00:38.510> the<00:00:39.510> image<00:00:39.750> was<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.260> thing<00:00:40.440> to

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
just felt the image was the thing to

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:48.340 
just felt the image was the thing to
follow<00:00:45.860> in<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.980> way<00:00:47.190> obsolescence<00:00:48.030> and

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
follow in a way obsolescence and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.189 
follow in a way obsolescence and
fragmentation<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:50.100> what<00:00:50.370> happens<00:00:50.730> with<00:00:50.850> time

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
fragmentation and what happens with time

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.340 
fragmentation and what happens with time
the<00:00:52.199> forgetting<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:53.039> faces<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.000> on

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
the forgetting of faces and so on

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.110 
the forgetting of faces and so on
allows<00:00:55.350> an<00:00:55.590> image<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.399> become<00:00:56.699> more<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.030> an

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
allows an image to become more of an

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.420 
allows an image to become more of an

emphasis on the frame on the scene is

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.910 
emphasis on the frame on the scene is
there<00:01:56.340> as<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> kind<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.500> perversity<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.679> this

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
there as a kind of perversity in this

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.100 
there as a kind of perversity in this

culture which is so seamless it's a

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.089 
culture which is so seamless it's a

was<00:03:45.280> going<00:03:45.519> on<00:03:45.639> so<00:03:46.290> but<00:03:47.290> interestingly

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
was going on so but interestingly

years<00:03:54.069> on<00:03:55.019> it's<00:03:56.019> that<00:03:56.709> they<00:03:56.859> seemed<00:03:57.190> somehow
