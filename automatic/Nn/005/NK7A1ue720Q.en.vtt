bit different to towing the trailer that
I<00:00:10.679> had<00:00:10.830> on<00:00:10.950> my<00:00:11.070> lesson<00:00:11.490> but<00:00:12.450> yeah<00:00:12.809> if<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:13.110> feels

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
I had on my lesson but yeah if it feels

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.770 
I had on my lesson but yeah if it feels
it<00:00:13.620> feels<00:00:13.650> really<00:00:14.040> good<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.849> know<00:00:15.120> I'm<00:00:15.480> being<00:00:15.690> a

it feels really good I know I'm being a
little<00:00:16.080> bit<00:00:16.199> overly<00:00:16.560> cautious<00:00:16.590> when<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:17.640> when

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
little bit overly cautious when it when

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.929 
little bit overly cautious when it when
it<00:00:18.420> comes<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.960> like<00:00:19.140> roundabouts<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.100> getting

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
it comes to like roundabouts and getting

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.490 
it comes to like roundabouts and getting
through<00:00:21.150> spaces<00:00:21.480> even<00:00:22.050> though<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.170> know<00:00:22.289> that

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
through spaces even though I know that

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.859 
through spaces even though I know that
the<00:00:22.980> van<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.730> very<00:00:24.210> similar<00:00:24.449> kind<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.750> width

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
the van is a very similar kind of width

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.830 
the van is a very similar kind of width
to<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.199> car<00:00:25.410> it's<00:00:25.590> only<00:00:25.710> small<00:00:26.720> looking<00:00:27.720> at

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
to the car it's only small looking at

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.179 
to the car it's only small looking at
the<00:00:27.930> mirrors<00:00:28.199> it's<00:00:28.320> quite<00:00:28.529> disconcerting

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
the mirrors it's quite disconcerting

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.820 
the mirrors it's quite disconcerting
because<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.490> looks<00:00:29.910> wider<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:31.080> I'm<00:00:31.439> giving

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
because it looks wider so I'm giving

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.319 
because it looks wider so I'm giving
loads<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.340> loads<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.579> space<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.090> I'm<00:00:33.149> sure

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
loads and loads of space and I'm sure

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.819 
loads and loads of space and I'm sure
that<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.570> will<00:00:33.780> maybe<00:00:33.960> change<00:00:34.380> when<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.680> have

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
that that will maybe change when I have

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.880 
that that will maybe change when I have
a<00:00:34.860> bit<00:00:35.040> more<00:00:35.070> experience<00:00:35.420> of<00:00:36.420> driving<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.989> one

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
a bit more experience of driving it one

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.400 
a bit more experience of driving it one
thing<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.129> have<00:00:38.280> noticed<00:00:38.460> ik<00:00:38.910> it's<00:00:39.750> taken<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.230> lot

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
thing I have noticed ik it's taken a lot

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.549 
thing I have noticed ik it's taken a lot
of<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> power<00:00:40.860> out<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.280> car<00:00:42.290> it's<00:00:43.290> meant

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
of the power out of the car it's meant

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.380 
of the power out of the car it's meant
to<00:00:43.649> be<00:00:43.739> quite<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:44.040> talky<00:00:44.579> car<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.000> certainly

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
to be quite a talky car and it certainly

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.639 
to be quite a talky car and it certainly
was<00:00:45.719> before<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.969> hitched<00:00:47.969> up<00:00:48.210> but<00:00:49.200> all<00:00:49.440> that

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
was before I hitched up but all that

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.040 
was before I hitched up but all that
talk<00:00:49.920> seems<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.370> have<00:00:50.489> disappeared<00:00:51.059> luckily

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
talk seems to have disappeared luckily

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.720 
talk seems to have disappeared luckily
there<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.379> something<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.770> can<00:00:52.920> do<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.520> your

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
there is something you can do to your

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.170 
there is something you can do to your
car

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
car

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:02.060 
car

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
to give it a bit of a boost well I'm

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.039 
to give it a bit of a boost well I'm
here<00:01:02.219> at<00:01:02.309> phantom<00:01:02.760> near<00:01:03.090> Manchester<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.899> they

here at phantom near Manchester and they

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.500 
here at phantom near Manchester and they
do<00:01:04.110> remapping<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.979> vehicles<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.670> will<00:01:06.270> it's

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
do remapping of vehicles and will it's

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.140 
do remapping of vehicles and will it's
working<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.020> cure<00:01:07.200> at<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.470> moment<00:01:07.770> will

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
working on the cure at the moment will

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.179 
working on the cure at the moment will
what<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.360> having<00:01:09.689> my<00:01:09.930> engine<00:01:10.320> remaps<00:01:10.740> gonna<00:01:10.979> do

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
what is having my engine remaps gonna do

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.289 
what is having my engine remaps gonna do
for<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.460> kick<00:01:11.640> because<00:01:11.700> I've<00:01:11.880> been<00:01:12.060> really

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
for the kick because I've been really

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.450 
for the kick because I've been really
struggling<00:01:12.720> with<00:01:13.049> fuel<00:01:13.350> economy<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:14.010> power

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
struggling with fuel economy and power

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.950 
struggling with fuel economy and power
is<00:01:14.670> definitely<00:01:15.060> down<00:01:15.240> from<00:01:15.509> towing<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
is definitely down from towing the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.420 
is definitely down from towing the
caravan<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.590> what's<00:01:16.770> going<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:16.979> be<00:01:17.130> happening

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
caravan so what's going to be happening

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.859 
caravan so what's going to be happening
when<00:01:17.820> you're<00:01:18.030> doing<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.420> remapping

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
when you're doing the remapping

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.210 
when you're doing the remapping
basically<00:01:19.500> what<00:01:19.619> we're<00:01:19.710> going<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.860> do<00:01:20.009> with

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
basically what we're going to do with

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.340 
basically what we're going to do with
the<00:01:20.340> remapping<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.390> we're<00:01:21.659> going<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.900> plug

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
the remapping is we're going to plug

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.550 
the remapping is we're going to plug
into<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.740> engines<00:01:23.040> diagnostic<00:01:23.970> SOT<00:01:24.180> kit<00:01:24.560> talk

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
into the engines diagnostic SOT kit talk

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.679 
into the engines diagnostic SOT kit talk
to<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.830> ECU<00:01:26.189> get<00:01:26.850> all<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> information<00:01:27.360> we

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
to the ECU get all the information we

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.080 
to the ECU get all the information we
come<00:01:27.930> from<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:29.310> that's<00:01:29.549> what<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:29.880> can<00:01:30.000> do

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
come from that and that's what we can do

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.060 
come from that and that's what we can do
then<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.299> change<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.259> mapping<00:01:31.470> that's<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:31.950> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
then is change the mapping that's on the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.370 
then is change the mapping that's on the
vehicle<00:01:32.390> increasing<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> torque<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
vehicle increasing the torque and the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.010 
vehicle increasing the torque and the
bhp<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.340> vehicle<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.360> can<00:01:36.509> change<00:01:36.689> when

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
bhp on the vehicle so we can change when

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.289 
bhp on the vehicle so we can change when
the<00:01:37.200> torque<00:01:37.439> comes<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.040> bhp<00:01:38.299> produces

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
the torque comes in and the bhp produces

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.600 
the torque comes in and the bhp produces
itself<00:01:39.600> making<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.470> vehicle<00:01:40.650> perform<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.490> lot

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
itself making the vehicle perform a lot

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.120 
itself making the vehicle perform a lot
better<00:01:41.640> while<00:01:42.060> towing<00:01:42.560> do<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.710> do<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.860> lot<00:01:44.009> of

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
better while towing do it do a lot of

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.889 
better while towing do it do a lot of
people<00:01:44.490> when<00:01:44.759> when<00:01:45.030> they're<00:01:45.210> towing<00:01:45.360> caravans

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
people when when they're towing caravans

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.600

Sorento do you think I'm going to get

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.200 
Sorento do you think I'm going to get
cuz<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.290> know<00:02:01.409> it's<00:02:01.500> 138<00:02:02.250> break<00:02:02.520> at<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.820> moment

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
cuz I know it's 138 break at the moment

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.300 
cuz I know it's 138 break at the moment
with<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.450> two<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.719> half<00:02:03.840> litre<00:02:04.229> diesel<00:02:07.310> the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
with the two and a half litre diesel the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.830 
with the two and a half litre diesel the
specs<00:02:08.610> tell<00:02:08.940> me<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.209> should<00:02:09.479> be<00:02:09.509> getting

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
specs tell me that I should be getting

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.140 
specs tell me that I should be getting
at<00:02:09.929> about<00:02:10.170> kind<00:02:10.470> of

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
at about kind of

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.089 
at about kind of
maximum<00:02:11.720> 40<00:02:12.170> miles<00:02:12.379> to<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.560> gallon<00:02:12.799> but<00:02:13.069> I

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
maximum 40 miles to the gallon but I

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.800 
maximum 40 miles to the gallon but I
think<00:02:13.459> I've<00:02:13.579> been<00:02:13.730> getting<00:02:14.000> closer<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.659> about

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
think I've been getting closer to about

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.100 
think I've been getting closer to about
30<00:02:15.079> for<00:02:15.409> what<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:16.129> reckon<00:02:16.430> this<00:02:16.579> will<00:02:16.640> do

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
30 for what you reckon this will do

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.089 
30 for what you reckon this will do
obviously<00:02:18.110> we're<00:02:18.230> talking<00:02:18.409> the<00:02:18.680> caravan

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
obviously we're talking the caravan

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.520 
obviously we're talking the caravan
behind<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.970> vehicle<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.870> are<00:02:20.900> going<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.349> lose

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
behind the vehicle you are going to lose

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.679 
behind the vehicle you are going to lose
miles<00:02:22.010> per<00:02:22.189> gallon<00:02:22.489> therefore<00:02:23.299> if<00:02:23.390> we<00:02:23.510> can

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:23.689 
miles per gallon therefore if we can

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.720 
miles per gallon therefore if we can
give<00:02:23.840> your<00:02:23.959> vehicle<00:02:24.349> more<00:02:24.560> power<00:02:24.829> so<00:02:25.459> it's<00:02:25.640> not

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
give your vehicle more power so it's not

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.089 
give your vehicle more power so it's not
struggling<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.329> move<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.659> caravan<00:02:27.110> then

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
struggling to move the caravan then

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.740 
struggling to move the caravan then
obviously<00:02:28.250> you're<00:02:28.519> going<00:02:28.609> to<00:02:28.790> save<00:02:28.970> on<00:02:29.209> fuel

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
obviously you're going to save on fuel

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.429 
obviously you're going to save on fuel
by<00:02:30.109> doing<00:02:30.379> that<00:02:30.500> and<00:02:31.540> can<00:02:32.540> anybody<00:02:32.900> do<00:02:33.109> this<00:02:33.319> I

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:33.439 
by doing that and can anybody do this I

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
buying a piece of equipment off the

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.940 
buying a piece of equipment off the
internet<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.030> what<00:02:50.720> have<00:02:50.840> you<00:02:51.019> plug<00:02:51.680> it<00:02:51.829> into

internet so what have you plug it into
you<00:02:52.129> ECU<00:02:52.579> but<00:02:52.819> what<00:02:53.000> happens<00:02:53.329> when<00:02:53.420> it<00:02:53.540> goes

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
you ECU but what happens when it goes

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.770 
you ECU but what happens when it goes
wrong<00:02:53.989> so<00:02:54.739> do<00:02:55.010> a<00:02:55.040> lot<00:02:55.280> of<00:02:55.340> caravanners<00:02:55.909> decide

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
wrong so do a lot of caravanners decide

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.599 
wrong so do a lot of caravanners decide
they<00:02:56.900> want<00:02:57.079> an<00:02:57.170> engine<00:02:57.319> remap<00:02:57.829> yeah<00:02:58.459> we're

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
they want an engine remap yeah we're

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.339 
they want an engine remap yeah we're
finding<00:02:58.939> an<00:02:59.060> increasing<00:02:59.569> number<00:02:59.689> of<00:02:59.870> caravan

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
finding an increasing number of caravan

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:01.690 
finding an increasing number of caravan
is<00:03:00.470> coming<00:03:00.709> to<00:03:00.799> get<00:03:00.920> their<00:03:01.040> injures<00:03:01.310> remapped

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
is coming to get their injures remapped

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.129 
is coming to get their injures remapped
and<00:03:02.060> I<00:03:02.150> think<00:03:02.329> it's<00:03:02.480> just<00:03:02.599> because<00:03:02.810> of<00:03:02.989> the

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:03.139 
and I think it's just because of the

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:05.199 
and I think it's just because of the
rising<00:03:03.560> cost<00:03:03.769> of<00:03:03.889> fuel<00:03:04.129> and<00:03:04.310> they<00:03:04.879> just<00:03:05.030> want

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
rising cost of fuel and they just want

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.629 
rising cost of fuel and they just want
better<00:03:05.329> drivability<00:03:06.170> of<00:03:06.319> the<00:03:06.560> vehicles<00:03:07.010> all

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:07.639 
better drivability of the vehicles all

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:09.399 
better drivability of the vehicles all
right<00:03:07.849> well<00:03:08.120> walls<00:03:08.599> going<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:08.840> crack<00:03:09.079> on<00:03:09.260> with

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
right well walls going to crack on with

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:10.720 
right well walls going to crack on with
the<00:03:09.500> care<00:03:09.739> and<00:03:09.769> we'll<00:03:10.340> find<00:03:10.549> out<00:03:10.700> shortly

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
the care and we'll find out shortly

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:30.450 
the care and we'll find out shortly
whether<00:03:11.299> it's<00:03:11.480> made<00:03:11.629> any<00:03:11.780> difference

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.160 

so<00:03:31.460> I've<00:03:31.790> had<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.240> engine-room<00:03:32.540> map<00:03:32.900> and<00:03:33.080> I

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
so I've had the engine-room map and I

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.810 
so I've had the engine-room map and I
got<00:03:33.320> to<00:03:33.440> say<00:03:33.590> I<00:03:33.740> can<00:03:34.130> actually<00:03:34.340> feel<00:03:34.790> a

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
got to say I can actually feel a

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.150 
got to say I can actually feel a
difference<00:03:35.300> especially<00:03:35.960> at<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.500> lower<00:03:36.830> end

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
difference especially at the lower end
