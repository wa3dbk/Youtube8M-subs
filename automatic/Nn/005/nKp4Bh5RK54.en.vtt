00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
what things are system requirements

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.400 
what things are system requirements

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.710 
languages and probably the key puller
and<00:02:51.140> extra<00:02:52.140> keys<00:02:52.850> so<00:02:53.850> we<00:02:53.970> have<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.150> key<00:02:54.420> polar

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
and extra keys so we have a key polar

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.289 
and extra keys so we have a key polar
here<00:02:55.200> pulling<00:02:55.890> keys<00:02:56.220> probably<00:02:56.760> show<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.090> that

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
here pulling keys probably show you that

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:03.680 
here pulling keys probably show you that
in<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.480> little<00:02:57.569> bit<00:02:57.799> then<00:02:58.799> we<00:02:59.069> have<00:03:01.730> WASD<00:03:02.730> escape

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
in a little bit then we have WASD escape

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.250 
in a little bit then we have WASD escape
and<00:03:04.459> what<00:03:05.459> else<00:03:06.560> oh<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:09.079> arrow<00:03:10.079> keys

and what else oh and the arrow keys

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.099 
and what else oh and the arrow keys
right<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.880> get<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.150> that<00:03:12.299> in<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.870> little<00:03:12.900> bit

plugged in alright so there we have the

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.150 
plugged in alright so there we have the
keyboard<00:04:48.870> is<00:04:49.110> illuminated<00:04:49.800> it's<00:04:49.919> pretty

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
keyboard is illuminated it's pretty

right as I'm looking at my computer over
here<00:05:23.790> because<00:05:23.970> that's<00:05:24.150> why<00:05:24.330> I<00:05:24.360> just<00:05:24.600> plug<00:05:24.780> this

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
here because that's why I just plug this

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.090 
here because that's why I just plug this
thing<00:05:24.990> in<00:05:25.380> so<00:05:26.340> let's<00:05:27.030> try<00:05:27.330> it<00:05:27.390> with<00:05:27.750> all<00:05:28.590> the

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
thing in so let's try it with all the

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.440 
thing in so let's try it with all the
lights<00:05:29.250> off<00:05:29.870> look<00:05:30.870> at<00:05:30.930> that<00:05:31.190> now<00:05:32.270> you<00:05:33.270> might

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
lights off look at that now you might

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.659 
lights off look at that now you might
see<00:05:33.780> it<00:05:33.900> flickering<00:05:34.229> that's<00:05:34.740> the<00:05:34.919> camera<00:05:35.370> not

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
see it flickering that's the camera not

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.930 
see it flickering that's the camera not
being<00:05:36.000> able<00:05:36.210> to<00:05:36.390> keep<00:05:37.020> up<00:05:37.260> with<00:05:37.320> the<00:05:37.919> the<00:05:38.700> rate

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
being able to keep up with the the rate

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.409 
being able to keep up with the the rate
in<00:05:39.120> which<00:05:39.150> the<00:05:39.660> LEDs<00:05:40.320> flash<00:05:40.890> at<00:05:41.190> right<00:05:41.940> i<00:05:41.970> think

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
in which the LEDs flash at right i think

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.090 
in which the LEDs flash at right i think
i'm<00:05:42.510> recording<00:05:42.870> at<00:05:43.020> 30<00:05:43.260> frames<00:05:43.530> and<00:05:43.979> these

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
i'm recording at 30 frames and these

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.240 
i'm recording at 30 frames and these
things<00:05:44.370> might<00:05:44.669> be<00:05:45.110> running<00:05:46.110> at<00:05:46.350> 60<00:05:46.770> Hertz<00:05:46.979> or

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
things might be running at 60 Hertz or

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.129 
things might be running at 60 Hertz or
something<00:05:47.610> or

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 
something or

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.939 
something or
another<00:05:48.469> 24<00:05:49.400> hurts<00:05:49.669> or<00:05:49.909> something<00:05:50.210> out<00:05:50.949> but

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:51.949 
another 24 hurts or something out but

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.670 
another 24 hurts or something out but
it's<00:05:52.129> blue<00:05:52.599> hopefully<00:05:53.599> it<00:05:53.810> shows<00:05:54.020> up<00:05:54.229> blue<00:05:54.469> on

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
it's blue hopefully it shows up blue on

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.610 
it's blue hopefully it shows up blue on
there<00:05:54.889> and<00:05:55.069> so<00:05:55.729> let's<00:05:55.939> see<00:05:56.240> the<00:05:57.050> various<00:05:58.539> and

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
there and so let's see the various and

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.499 
there and so let's see the various and
you<00:06:00.620> know<00:06:00.710> what<00:06:00.860> I<00:06:00.889> like<00:06:01.099> about<00:06:01.159> this<00:06:01.430> is<00:06:01.849> that

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:02.509 
you know what I like about this is that

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:04.420 
you know what I like about this is that
you<00:06:02.930> can<00:06:02.960> just<00:06:03.439> keep<00:06:03.620> pressing<00:06:03.949> and<00:06:04.279> it

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
you can just keep pressing and it

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.929 
you can just keep pressing and it
doesn't<00:06:04.789> cycle<00:06:05.300> through<00:06:05.689> right<00:06:06.560> where<00:06:07.370> if<00:06:07.819> you

00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:07.939 
doesn't cycle through right where if you

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:10.209 
doesn't cycle through right where if you
just<00:06:08.150> like<00:06:08.300> went<00:06:08.629> too<00:06:08.900> far<00:06:09.169> it<00:06:09.800> would<00:06:09.949> just<00:06:09.979> go

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:10.219 
just like went too far it would just go

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:13.360 
just like went too far it would just go
back<00:06:10.430> down<00:06:10.699> to<00:06:10.999> zero<00:06:11.419> or<00:06:11.779> off<00:06:12.349> and<00:06:12.710> then<00:06:13.249> you

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
back down to zero or off and then you

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.649 
back down to zero or off and then you
have<00:06:13.490> to<00:06:13.610> kind<00:06:13.789> of<00:06:13.849> just<00:06:14.029> go<00:06:14.180> through<00:06:14.449> it<00:06:14.569> again

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:14.659 
have to kind of just go through it again

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:17.950 
have to kind of just go through it again
I<00:06:15.020> like<00:06:15.560> that<00:06:16.210> no<00:06:17.210> matter<00:06:17.389> how<00:06:17.539> many<00:06:17.629> times<00:06:17.870> you

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
I like that no matter how many times you

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.540 
I like that no matter how many times you
press<00:06:18.139> it<00:06:18.169> stops<00:06:18.590> at<00:06:18.800> the<00:06:18.830> end<00:06:19.069> and<00:06:19.370> then<00:06:19.460> when

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
press it stops at the end and then when

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.029 
press it stops at the end and then when
you<00:06:19.639> go<00:06:19.729> back<00:06:19.879> down<00:06:20.120> to<00:06:20.300> it<00:06:21.289> shuts<00:06:21.560> off<00:06:21.740> and<00:06:21.979> it

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:22.039 
you go back down to it shuts off and it

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:24.580 
you go back down to it shuts off and it
stops<00:06:22.340> there<00:06:22.669> right<00:06:23.120> I<00:06:23.360> really<00:06:24.229> like<00:06:24.379> that

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590
