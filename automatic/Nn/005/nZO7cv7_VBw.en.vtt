00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
them so and by the way these have been

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.299 
them so and by the way these have been
in<00:00:54.480> some<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.840> my<00:00:55.020> ear<00:00:55.199> but<00:00:55.379> compares<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.980> videos

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
in some of my ear but compares to videos

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.830 
in some of my ear but compares to videos
if<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.730> guys<00:00:56.850> wanna<00:00:57.090> check<00:00:57.120> those<00:00:57.420> out

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
if you guys wanna check those out

I've<00:01:24.780> used<00:01:25.229> or<00:01:25.530> reviewed<00:01:25.979> have<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.970> 16<00:01:27.860> ohm

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
I've used or reviewed have a 16 ohm

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.800 
I've used or reviewed have a 16 ohm
impedance<00:01:29.189> which<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.000> pretty<00:01:30.240> standard<00:01:30.329> like

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
impedance which is pretty standard like

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.380 
impedance which is pretty standard like
I<00:01:30.930> said<00:01:31.140> 48<00:01:31.530> bucks<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:32.549> frequency<00:01:32.939> response

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
I said 48 bucks it's frequency response

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.630 
I said 48 bucks it's frequency response
is<00:01:33.960> 22<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.740> 20,000<00:01:35.670> Hertz<00:01:35.810> which<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:36.840> uh

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
is 22 to 20,000 Hertz which is uh

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.830 
is 22 to 20,000 Hertz which is uh
usually<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.790> average<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.329> 20<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.990> 20,000<00:01:40.860> um

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
usually the average is 20 to 20,000 um

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.190 
usually the average is 20 to 20,000 um
but<00:01:42.840> Sennheiser<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.619> very<00:01:44.070> good<00:01:44.430> at<00:01:45.200> making

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
but Sennheiser is very good at making

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.440 
but Sennheiser is very good at making
the<00:01:46.829> right<00:01:47.040> frequency<00:01:47.610> response<00:01:47.970> depending

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
the right frequency response depending

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.740 
the right frequency response depending
upon<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.810> product<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.880> they<00:01:50.880> definitely

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
upon the product and they definitely

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.410 
upon the product and they definitely
know<00:01:52.200> what<00:01:52.350> they<00:01:52.530> are<00:01:52.829> doing<00:01:53.070> when<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.149> comes

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
know what they are doing when it comes

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.660 
know what they are doing when it comes
to<00:01:54.659> sound<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.619> have<00:01:55.799> no<00:01:56.070> problems<00:01:56.579> with

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
to sound so that I have no problems with

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.389 
to sound so that I have no problems with
that<00:01:57.140> I'm<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.200> gonna<00:01:58.439> tell<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.829> guys<00:01:59.009> about

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
that I'm just gonna tell you guys about

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.480 
that I'm just gonna tell you guys about
some<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.119> unique<00:02:00.570> features<00:02:01.159> about<00:02:02.159> this

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
some of the unique features about this

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.429 
some of the unique features about this
really<00:02:02.759> fast<00:02:04.009> so<00:02:05.009> obviously<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.790> might<00:02:06.090> have

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
really fast so obviously you might have

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.690 
really fast so obviously you might have
not<00:02:07.439> been<00:02:07.500> able<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.829> tell<00:02:07.979> actually<00:02:08.459> but<00:02:08.610> if

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
not been able to tell actually but if

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.270 
not been able to tell actually but if
you<00:02:08.789> look<00:02:08.940> closely<00:02:09.259> you<00:02:10.259> can<00:02:10.440> kind<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.860> see<00:02:11.129> it

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
you look closely you can kind of see it

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.940 
you look closely you can kind of see it
has<00:02:11.459> this<00:02:11.700> weird

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
has this weird

see just like so and you can see it says

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.800 
see just like so and you can see it says
L<00:02:31.379> for<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:31.980> left<00:02:32.250> right<00:02:32.489> there<00:02:32.660> there<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:33.750> go

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
L for a left right there there you go

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.880 
L for a left right there there you go
there's<00:02:33.989> a<00:02:34.049> pretty<00:02:34.200> good<00:02:34.379> image<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.739> the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
there's a pretty good image and the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.890 
there's a pretty good image and the
right<00:02:35.010> there<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:35.250> can<00:02:35.400> see<00:02:35.640> has<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.450> weird

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
right there you can see has a weird

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.530 
right there you can see has a weird
design<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:37.560> is<00:02:37.650> actually<00:02:37.980> meant<00:02:38.190> for

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
design and that is actually meant for

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.610 
design and that is actually meant for
grabbing<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.629> with<00:02:39.750> your<00:02:39.870> fingers<00:02:40.230> when<00:02:40.530> you

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
grabbing it with your fingers when you

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.640 
grabbing it with your fingers when you
were<00:02:40.709> pointing<00:02:41.099> it<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.280> actually<00:02:41.700> in<00:02:41.849> the<00:02:42.000> air

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
were pointing it is actually in the air

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.830 
were pointing it is actually in the air
too<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:44.069> basically<00:02:44.549> imagine<00:02:44.760> if<00:02:45.209> it's<00:02:45.360> in<00:02:45.480> in

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
too so basically imagine if it's in in

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.430 
too so basically imagine if it's in in
my<00:02:46.049> ear<00:02:46.260> right<00:02:46.380> now<00:02:47.780> you<00:02:48.780> would<00:02:48.959> kind<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.319> use

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
my ear right now you would kind of use

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.580 
my ear right now you would kind of use
your<00:02:49.980> fingers<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.870> adjust<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:52.049> to<00:02:52.079> get<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.440> that

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
your fingers to adjust it to get it that

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.949 
your fingers to adjust it to get it that
perfect<00:02:52.860> snug<00:02:53.400> fit<00:02:53.700> because<00:02:54.390> getting<00:02:54.810> that

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
perfect snug fit because getting that

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.860 
perfect snug fit because getting that
snug<00:02:55.290> fit<00:02:55.560> is<00:02:55.709> quite<00:02:56.130> important<00:02:56.730> for<00:02:56.870> noise

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
snug fit is quite important for noise

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.720 
snug fit is quite important for noise
isolation<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:58.620> forgetting<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.430> sound

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
isolation and forgetting that sound

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.520 
isolation and forgetting that sound
quality<00:03:00.120> that<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.870> want<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.170> get<00:03:01.290> them<00:03:01.410> at

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
quality that you want to get them at

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.250 
quality that you want to get them at
Sennheiser<00:03:01.950> also<00:03:02.430> wants<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:02.819> to<00:03:02.879> get<00:03:03.260> that's

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
Sennheiser also wants you to get that's

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.059 
Sennheiser also wants you to get that's
a<00:03:04.319> cool<00:03:04.470> little<00:03:04.590> thing<00:03:05.750> obviously<00:03:07.069> sometimes

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
a cool little thing obviously sometimes

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.910 
a cool little thing obviously sometimes
it<00:03:08.310> has<00:03:08.430> very<00:03:08.760> nice<00:03:08.910> quality<00:03:09.530> these<00:03:10.530> claims

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
it has very nice quality these claims

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.100 
it has very nice quality these claims
have<00:03:11.069> a<00:03:11.160> powerful<00:03:11.700> bass<00:03:11.910> driven<00:03:12.209> stereo<00:03:12.840> sound

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
have a powerful bass driven stereo sound

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.680 
have a powerful bass driven stereo sound
I<00:03:13.410> found<00:03:14.220> used<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.459> have<00:03:14.579> decent<00:03:15.329> bass<00:03:15.480> it

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
I found used to have decent bass it

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.840 
I found used to have decent bass it
wasn't<00:03:15.900> anything<00:03:16.079> crazy<00:03:16.769> but<00:03:17.579> it<00:03:17.730> was

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
wasn't anything crazy but it was

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.580 
wasn't anything crazy but it was
definitely<00:03:18.060> solid<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:21.750> these<00:03:22.139> also<00:03:22.410> have<00:03:22.560> a

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
definitely solid and these also have a

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.729 
definitely solid and these also have a
high<00:03:22.920> passive<00:03:24.109> attenuation<00:03:25.109> of<00:03:25.230> ambient

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
high passive attenuation of ambient

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.470 
high passive attenuation of ambient
noise<00:03:25.769> so<00:03:26.250> basically<00:03:26.579> these<00:03:26.850> will<00:03:27.090> block<00:03:27.299> out

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
noise so basically these will block out

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.039 
noise so basically these will block out
most<00:03:27.690> ambient<00:03:28.260> noise<00:03:29.209> because<00:03:30.209> they<00:03:30.480> are<00:03:30.660> you

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
most ambient noise because they are you

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.979 
most ambient noise because they are you
know<00:03:31.170> in<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.500> ear<00:03:31.739> so<00:03:32.239> and<00:03:33.239> also<00:03:33.480> that<00:03:33.630> snug

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
know in the ear so and also that snug

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.870 
know in the ear so and also that snug
fit<00:03:34.230> that<00:03:34.349> they<00:03:34.500> wanted<00:03:34.889> to<00:03:35.010> get<00:03:35.310> with<00:03:35.579> these

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
fit that they wanted to get with these

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.900 
fit that they wanted to get with these
especially<00:03:36.359> with<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.980> finger<00:03:37.980> contouring<00:03:38.730> is

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
especially with the finger contouring is

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.259 
especially with the finger contouring is
very<00:03:39.209> highly<00:03:40.190> important<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.370> Sennheiser<00:03:41.970> and

the middle but these are really good I
actually<00:05:00.340> the<00:05:00.909> biggest<00:05:01.240> thing<00:05:01.509> is<00:05:01.689> just

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
actually the biggest thing is just

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.230 
actually the biggest thing is just
recently<00:05:03.870> one<00:05:04.870> of<00:05:04.900> the<00:05:05.139> gear<00:05:05.919> tips<00:05:06.189> has<00:05:06.460> one<00:05:07.150> of

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
recently one of the gear tips has one of

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.809 
recently one of the gear tips has one of
the<00:05:07.300> earbuds<00:05:08.199> has<00:05:08.409> talked<00:05:08.710> playing<00:05:09.520> sound

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:09.819 
the earbuds has talked playing sound

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:11.969 
the earbuds has talked playing sound
it's<00:05:10.539> really<00:05:10.839> quiet<00:05:11.139> so<00:05:11.439> one<00:05:11.560> of<00:05:11.589> them<00:05:11.740> is<00:05:11.770> much

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
it's really quiet so one of them is much

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.129 
it's really quiet so one of them is much
larger<00:05:12.310> than<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.490> other<00:05:12.669> one<00:05:13.020> which<00:05:14.020> is

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
larger than the other one which is

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:15.689 
larger than the other one which is
definitely<00:05:14.289> a<00:05:14.529> problem<00:05:14.740> so<00:05:15.009> I'm<00:05:15.099> going<00:05:15.339> to<00:05:15.370> try

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
definitely a problem so I'm going to try

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:16.800 
definitely a problem so I'm going to try

keep that in mind even though these are

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.929 
keep that in mind even though these are
probably<00:05:22.029> completed<00:05:22.870> durable<00:05:23.529> overall<00:05:23.949> my

00:05:24.929 --> 00:05:24.939

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
real quickly taking a look at the cable

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:33.119 
real quickly taking a look at the cable
you<00:05:30.969> can<00:05:31.000> see<00:05:31.270> right<00:05:31.419> here<00:05:31.659> does<00:05:31.870> say<00:05:32.050> CX<00:05:32.469> -<00:05:32.710> 15

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:33.129 
you can see right here does say CX - 15

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:35.730 
you can see right here does say CX - 15
and<00:05:33.509> they<00:05:34.509> cable<00:05:34.870> is<00:05:34.990> split<00:05:35.349> in<00:05:35.439> the<00:05:35.560> two

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
and they cable is split in the two

and they cable is split in the two
there's<00:05:36.250> the<00:05:37.620> little<00:05:38.620> place<00:05:38.919> to<00:05:39.370> this<00:05:39.580> little

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:39.909 
there's the little place to this little

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:41.909 
there's the little place to this little
Ridge<00:05:40.060> you<00:05:40.240> can<00:05:40.360> actually<00:05:40.659> put<00:05:41.349> the<00:05:41.469> cable<00:05:41.800> in

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:21.969 
that is a good thing in some ways and

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:24.570 
that is a good thing in some ways and
maybe<00:06:22.089> not<00:06:22.330> you<00:06:23.259> can<00:06:23.409> see<00:06:23.589> it<00:06:23.740> is<00:06:23.860> pretty<00:06:24.159> solid

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
maybe not you can see it is pretty solid

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.429 
maybe not you can see it is pretty solid
so<00:06:25.120> it's<00:06:25.300> not<00:06:25.449> gonna<00:06:25.599> break<00:06:25.870> but<00:06:26.169> at<00:06:26.229> the<00:06:26.289> same

00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:26.439 
so it's not gonna break but at the same

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:29.070 
so it's not gonna break but at the same
time<00:06:26.680> it's<00:06:27.459> not<00:06:27.580> the<00:06:27.759> longest<00:06:28.060> I<00:06:28.509> typically

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
time it's not the longest I typically

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.829 
time it's not the longest I typically
prefer<00:06:29.709> straight<00:06:30.099> ones<00:06:30.430> just<00:06:31.149> so<00:06:31.360> that<00:06:31.509> if<00:06:31.659> I

00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:31.839 
prefer straight ones just so that if I

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:33.300 
prefer straight ones just so that if I
have<00:06:31.930> a<00:06:31.990> phone<00:06:32.199> case<00:06:32.529> on

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
have a phone case on

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.310 
have a phone case on
I've<00:06:33.370> trouble<00:06:33.820> reaching<00:06:34.570> the<00:06:34.840> audio<00:06:35.080> track

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
I've trouble reaching the audio track

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.410 
I've trouble reaching the audio track
this<00:06:35.530> makes<00:06:35.830> it<00:06:35.980> possible<00:06:36.150> no<00:06:37.150> matter<00:06:37.210> what

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:37.420 
this makes it possible no matter what

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.660 
this makes it possible no matter what
but<00:06:37.840> with<00:06:37.990> the<00:06:38.220> 90-degree<00:06:39.220> one<00:06:39.370> it<00:06:39.460> can<00:06:39.610> be

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:39.670 
but with the 90-degree one it can be

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.700 
but with the 90-degree one it can be
challenging<00:06:40.000> it's<00:06:40.870> not<00:06:41.020> the<00:06:41.110> longest<00:06:41.320> Jack

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
challenging it's not the longest Jack

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.190 
challenging it's not the longest Jack
but<00:06:41.950> it<00:06:42.040> should<00:06:42.190> get<00:06:42.250> the<00:06:42.340> job<00:06:42.550> done<00:06:42.760> so<00:06:43.200> that's

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.200 
but it should get the job done so that's

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.660 
but it should get the job done so that's
I<00:06:44.350> think<00:06:44.380> that<00:06:44.650> awful<00:06:45.040> all<00:06:45.220> for<00:06:45.430> this<00:06:45.490> video
