00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
what we've done here on the wall is

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.499 
what we've done here on the wall is
stuck<00:00:08.910> six<00:00:10.130> carpet<00:00:11.130> tiles<00:00:11.400> onto<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.330> wall<00:00:12.480> I

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
stuck six carpet tiles onto the wall I

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.480 
stuck six carpet tiles onto the wall I
think<00:00:12.780> they're<00:00:12.929> stuck<00:00:13.110> with<00:00:13.490> some

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
think they're stuck with some

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.090 
think they're stuck with some
double-sided<00:00:14.910> tape<00:00:15.350> okay<00:00:16.350> so<00:00:16.410> this<00:00:16.650> carpet

double-sided tape okay so this carpet

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.269 
double-sided tape okay so this carpet
tiles<00:00:17.340> are<00:00:17.730> stuff<00:00:18.300> stuck<00:00:18.779> onto<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.140> wall<00:00:19.350> with

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
some double-sided tape or fair bit of

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.130 
some double-sided tape or fair bit of
double-sided<00:00:23.400> tape<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.000> I'm<00:00:24.810> not<00:00:24.900> sure

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
double-sided tape and I'm not sure

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.990 
double-sided tape and I'm not sure
what's<00:00:25.800> gonna<00:00:25.980> happen<00:00:26.310> when<00:00:26.430> we<00:00:26.460> decide<00:00:26.849> to

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
what's gonna happen when we decide to

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.820 
what's gonna happen when we decide to
remove<00:00:27.269> these<00:00:27.510> carpet<00:00:28.080> tiles<00:00:28.289> from<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.560> wall

remove these carpet tiles from the wall

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.339 
remove these carpet tiles from the wall
but<00:00:29.760> I'm<00:00:29.910> guessing<00:00:30.300> it's<00:00:30.869> probably<00:00:30.960> going<00:00:31.289> to

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
but I'm guessing it's probably going to

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.749 
but I'm guessing it's probably going to
make<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.560> little<00:00:31.769> bit<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.040> mess<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.430> all
