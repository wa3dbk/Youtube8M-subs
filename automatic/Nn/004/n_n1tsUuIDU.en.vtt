00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
you draw one up business pretty much you

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.000

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
the backside and then then you think of

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.240 
the backside and then then you think of
being<00:02:34.290> here<00:02:34.439> in<00:02:34.530> front<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:34.799> grandson<00:02:35.159> you

the<00:02:36.599> other<00:02:36.689> side<00:02:36.959> it<00:02:37.709> blows<00:02:37.920> pretty<00:02:38.159> good<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:38.549> I

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
the other side it blows pretty good so I

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.890 
the other side it blows pretty good so I
was<00:02:38.970> proud<00:02:39.150> of<00:02:39.209> her<00:02:39.329> she<00:02:39.359> got<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.659> job<00:02:39.689> done

was proud of her she got the job done
and<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.319> was<00:02:40.439> it<00:02:40.620> was<00:02:40.739> good<00:02:40.890> enough<00:02:41.040> when<00:02:41.700> you

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
and it was it was good enough when you

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.660 
and it was it was good enough when you
have<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.150> horse<00:02:42.480> on<00:02:42.689> the<00:02:42.870> lead<00:02:43.079> like<00:02:43.409> that<00:02:43.709> would

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
have a horse on the lead like that would

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.879 
have a horse on the lead like that would
you<00:02:44.790> rather<00:02:44.939> see<00:02:45.389> a<00:02:45.689> head<00:02:45.989> wind<00:02:46.230> down<00:02:46.709> the

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
you rather see a head wind down the

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.129 
you rather see a head wind down the
backstretch<00:02:47.310> or<00:02:47.730> front<00:02:48.269> stretch<00:02:48.510> rather<00:02:48.959> I'd

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
backstretch or front stretch rather I'd

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:50.869 
backstretch or front stretch rather I'd
not<00:02:49.319> see<00:02:49.470> one<00:02:49.650> period<00:02:49.920> honest<00:02:50.519> with<00:02:50.609> you<00:02:50.670> Tom

but<00:02:51.030> uh<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.450> guess<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.170> backside<00:02:52.590> wouldn't<00:02:52.980> you

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
but uh I guess the backside wouldn't you

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.069 
but uh I guess the backside wouldn't you
know<00:02:53.519> it<00:02:53.609> depends<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.359> know<00:02:54.389> it<00:02:54.569> depends<00:02:54.900> at

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
know it depends you know it depends at

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.110 
know it depends you know it depends at

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
least once we got out of it it kind of

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.520 
least once we got out of it it kind of
pushes<00:02:57.329> you<00:02:57.540> know<00:02:57.780> towards<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.079> wire<00:02:58.319> which
