00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:22.939
 hello people , how are you? What's up? 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.619
 people to give life to health and 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.230
 For this I will prepare a juice that is 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.580
 pure vitamin c is this even looks the 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.450
 taste or I will not even say it's not to 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:37.489
 create a lot of expectation and the stars of 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.770
 today they will treat cac and orange 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.320
 that's right, look, did you know that? 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.410
 is responsible for the decrease in 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.990
 up to 90% of cell damage 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.960
 This is because, for example, we have never 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.480
 we have a very important carotene piece 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.480
 For us, it removes any kind of 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.550
 cardiovascular problem also reinforces the 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.860
 immune system and also from another 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.250
 It improves vision thing if you have jo 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.409
 in the writer but will now try with me and 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.420
 Orange is a very 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.759
 vitamin c and what you find in 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.130
 any season of the year in any 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.649
 market check then we will also 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.320
 I'm already here with all the 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.030
 my oranges peeled and with all 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.179
 the stars also washed 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.639
 In fact, always wash all the fruits before 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:27.289
 putting them in the refrigerator and of course 

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:29.389
 I'm going to use a centrifuge because I 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.189
 I 'm not in the business of cutting and 

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:34.249
 then clear the juices 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.049
 no one deserves let's start then it looks 

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:38.149
 I'll need the centrifuge only 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.190
 speed a mac at faster speed 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:45.710
 slow because the fruits are very soft 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:49.010
 well now our juice is ready 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.800
 It smells wonderful and it really is 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.640
 a temptation to the palate we will see 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.830
 only 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.000
