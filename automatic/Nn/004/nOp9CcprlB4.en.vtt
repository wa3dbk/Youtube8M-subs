00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.390
 in 2013 we talk a lot about this 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.010
 new category a2 of this new 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.879
 permit and two of his new motorcycles 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.460
 who arrive on the market 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.230
 then with less than 48 horses you can 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.329
 imagine that we will have the right to 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.550
 motorcycles not very nice to drive 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.540
 Well think again right here was 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.420
 reunited honda cb 500 f and ktm duke 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:57.059
 390 two representatives of the category 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.149
 a2 easy to access for beginners 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.079
 but frankly fun to drive 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.539
 so here we did a whole battery 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.940
 tests to be able to demonstrate their 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.500
 dynamic potential or even to 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.970
 what a pleasure we can take behind 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.970
 their handlebars go it's gone 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.650
 it is 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.689
 well here we go our two motorcycles the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.520
 ktm duke city 390 develops 46.9 horses 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.399
 we see it here and so to compete 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.920
 really with the honda cb 500 f which 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:47.250
 develops m 47 the sight of a hair with 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.689
 a linearity and a regularity really 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.380
 usual at honda 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.530
 So here pleasant surprise of the KTM and 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.850
 rivals a little with lambda especially 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.860
 so after the bench measurement 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.590
 power we also checked the weight 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:07.259
 all full of these motorcycle honda 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:09.569
 weighs 100 to 93 kg and the ktm duke 390 a little 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.049
 more than 151 kg so that we have a 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.440
 gap of more than 40 kilos between these two 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.870
 machinery 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.160
 then is this gap is felt 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.290
 a lot to driving well we're going to 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.290
 check this on a school motorcycle track 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.110
 the honda cb 500 f it's a good 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.790
 surprise it's really a bike very 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.409
 adapted to pass the permit 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.250
 why because it is so easy 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:47.689
 the controls are soft braking 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.849
 accelerator clutch gearbox 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:51.260
 everything responds perfectly and that's 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.720
 really easy to dose 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.299
 so it's a very handy bike and 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.290
 always very exploitable good news 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.780
 turning radius 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.700
 it is higher than that of the ktm and we 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.409
 can easily exploit the maximum of 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.590
 to the turning radius of the manda so 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.730
 it's really good ktm 390 duke 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.440
 normally you will not see it on 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.670
 the school motorcycle tracks why because 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.099
 that she is too light to be 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.139
 approved as a good school bike 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.760
 obviously she is very small hall 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:19.670
 and low it is light so it's a 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.739
 sacred tool on school motorcycle tracks 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.349
 certainly the turning radius is less 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.459
 good that the one of the honda the the bs is 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.090
 triggers a little earlier it is less 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:26.900
 progressive 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.519
 so that's still a small 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.170
 problem and then come on a trip 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.940
 is firmer so his night a little to 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.340
 the approval good despite all that remains a 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.519
 sacred tool slow pace as a pace 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.519
 quick 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.580
 then side practical aspects on the ktm 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.680
 we find an ultra dashboard 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.600
 complete the engine temperature the gauge 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.030
 is the committed ratio indicator that 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.310
 do not have the honda the commodos are 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.840
 backlit really nice at night the 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.070
 tank cap is mounted on 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.110
 hinges on the other hand all the dressing 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.660
 is plastic so we can not put 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.300
 magnetic bags under the seat is 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.380
 found a very small space of 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.270
 storing there really is not a lot of 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.140
 place but the ktm toolkit is 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.400
 rather complete and then to stow a 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.590
 bag on the saddle it will be quite difficult 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.420
 because the decks are full 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.660
 if the dressing is not anchoring point 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.850
 upside down of the honda that she has 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.710
 little hooks and patinas dig so 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.290
 it will be easier to stow a bag 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.740
 on the stage and under this scene we 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:49.340
 discovers a slot for a theft lock 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:52.220
 catalog honda the dashboard there 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.610
 is sufficiently complete and there is the 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.520
 precise case warning command both the 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.860
 urban small flat finally on our two 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.720
 entry-level motorcycles the levers do not 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.010
 are not adjustable in spacing and 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.010
 unfortunately they are too far apart 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.040
 so at the end of all our battery 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.020
 tests and bass that we remember is that 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.540
 the ktm 390 nuke 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:04.110
 it's pure phone here is the spirit ktm and 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.400
 the weight / power weight ratio that 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.500
 whether in town or on the course of 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.250
 motorcycle school or to make fun 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.900
 on the rear wheel 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.850
 she is really present it is 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.100
 really her thing against it vibrates 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.560
 the more they heat the more she 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.300
 braque less well the passenger is less 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.770
 well received brief it's really a 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.260
 motorcycle - versatile 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.780
 the honda cb 500 f she knows how to do everything 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.600
 we have a super security thanks to its abs 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.040
 his honda the mastery has long 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.930
 motorcycle is comfortable and at the same time 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.640
 she's great scene so he's hiding well 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.320
 his game behind his pace 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.210
 of utilities actually went pretty 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.880
 powerful and quite exciting to 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.920
 driving in rhythm and sporting use 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.650
 so it's really a very, very good 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.540
 bike side tariffs these two motorcycles get 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:48.030
 hold in a handkerchief to 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.850
 worth 500 euros difference here if you 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.800
 want to learn more about the test 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.400
 full of these bikes and the final note 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.540
 of each 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.050
 Well, I invite you to read the test 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:00.260
 full online on moto station.com at 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.260
 soon 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.370
 in 2013 you will not miss ruin eric the 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:20.900
 allowed two and the full of his motorcycles 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.900
 it's not even worth forty euros
