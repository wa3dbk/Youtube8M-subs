00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.949
 ayotte to the world therefore reserves between 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.929
 today for a brand new 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.910
 video the cases it will be for a video 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.069
 prediction of cards for fifa 16 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.750
 ultimate team with new players 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.370
 I thank for the previous episodes 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.019
 guys always a max of garlic 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.160
 always a max of proposals of 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.540
 players in the comments sorry 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.990
 for everything that already puts me that I can 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.850
 still do it 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.930
 but do not hesitate always to 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.279
 look they may be 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.750
 probably in the next episodes 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.250
 there anyway I changed a little bit 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.109
 the method you will not see the notes anymore 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.090
 on the miniature like that at least that 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.470
 will give people want to click and 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.240
 watch the video and see pretty much 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.949
 our little by little we will start with 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.660
 the first player who will be the Brazilian 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.760
 which leads signed on the side of bayern munich 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.800
 it's douglas costa the former player of 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.750
 shakhtar who was transferred for I 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.930
 believe about 25 30 million euros 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.010
 is in any case he always has five 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.329
 stars technical gestures and the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.280
 ears is still so technical 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.140
 it will not change three bad stars 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.670
 foot I put him a little plus one so 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.260
 I think he'll have 81 I hesitated to 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.020
 put 82 but already what will change 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.160
 is that I think he will be on the side of 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.420
 of post have right just go 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.770
 maybe there will be and lashed but in any case 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.629
 case he plays a lot of times on the 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.550
 causse the right pillar post 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.159
 we will continue with the second player 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.200
 who will be so wallial jason who had 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.479
 have a good season on the pomegranate side 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.090
 a good copa america too with the 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.790
 columbia and he was transferred through 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.860
 that on the side of Nimes ending this 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.930
 Colombian who I think will be a beautiful 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.920
 small because that's a small 77 but 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.990
 really one of the rooms in less than 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.030
 interesting for a central defender 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.950
 and well here's his card will give maybe 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.540
 want to a lot of people me I 'm 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.680
 why not to introduce more 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.979
 this is a new kind of nÃ®mes 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.979
 earth then there is antoine griezmann 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.970
 the french of atletico madrid with 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.670
 his four stars technical gestures 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.829
 always who will have 85 for me I loved 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.720
 85 but I have long hesitated to 2086 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.079
 but now I think that their friends 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.280
 86 he had a good season of 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.570
 side of the league champions because 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.460
 that he was very very good league to my 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.030
 desires of the champions it was a small 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.979
 little less good 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.750
 even though voice the season he did 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.399
 was exceptional but here I am 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.930
 loved him 85 because he did not have 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.899
 does not make as good a season as 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.180
 diego costa who had 86 in the past the 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.460
 giorgino shirt yes I was not going to doom 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.890
 as you can see the player who 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.569
 leads signed on the side of newcastle very 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.380
 very good season on the side of the psv 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.850
 eindhoven 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.870
 it's a little disappointed with his choice of 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.040
 sign in newcastle goes a little bit 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.780
 bury yourself in a club 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.850
 here we are questioning it's still 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.560
 less well than siwa care or 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.570
 stoke city so it's a little hot 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.340
 but hey that's how it will be 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.770
 a nice card there is rap I think a 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.020
 true good 80 of generali on average 40 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.780
 years very very very interesting 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.570
 and to conclude we will have javier pastore 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.980
 here is the Argentinian from Paris Saint-Germain 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.170
 that I always left four floors 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.880
 and technical and a bad foot 3 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.530
 sorry but I did not spend enough 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.300
 worried like I was trying because that's it 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.440
 I do not think he made gestures that 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.120
 ask to have 5 and hodge and 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.560
 even equip themselves it's really a player 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.340
 really that makes a lot of 2 g of these 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.110
 techniques on the ground and that's 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.000
 really good kids what it is or 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.490
 but here I left them at 4 I think 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.660
 and that because I am but still 1 83 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.760
 so he will take anyway maybe 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.590
 plus 3 outright that it's our 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.030
 had before but I hesitated to the 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.200
 put at 81.2 but good since the girl 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.070
 a good copa america I thought 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.750
 Ok, we'll buy him back 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.530
 still powerful individuals and good me that 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.120
 fra 83 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.680
 so here I hope that these 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.850
 players there have made you happy 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.410
