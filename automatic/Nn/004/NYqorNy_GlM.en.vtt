00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
the villain side is simply just to even

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.390 
the villain side is simply just to even
out<00:02:51.690> each<00:02:51.960> side<00:02:52.260> because<00:02:52.800> it<00:02:52.980> was<00:02:53.070> kind<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.310> it

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
out each side because it was kind of it

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.100 
out each side because it was kind of it
would<00:02:53.520> kind<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:53.760> look<00:02:53.820> kind<00:02:54.210> of<00:02:54.300> awkward<00:02:54.630> kind

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
would kind of look kind of awkward kind

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.600 
would kind of look kind of awkward kind
of<00:02:55.260> kind<00:02:55.410> of<00:02:55.470> kind<00:02:55.530> of<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:55.980> would<00:02:56.130> kind<00:02:56.430> of<00:02:56.550> look

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
of kind of kind of it would kind of look

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.020 
of kind of kind of it would kind of look
awkward<00:02:57.420> if<00:02:57.660> she<00:02:58.560> was<00:02:58.830> on<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.220> hero<00:02:59.460> side<00:02:59.790> and

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
awkward if she was on the hero side and

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.060 
awkward if she was on the hero side and
that<00:03:00.180> whole<00:03:00.450> side<00:03:00.690> was<00:03:00.720> completed<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.590> then

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
that whole side was completed and then

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.800 
that whole side was completed and then
on<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.430> villain<00:03:02.970> side<00:03:03.000> there's<00:03:03.420> like<00:03:03.600> two

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
on the villain side there's like two

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.720 
on the villain side there's like two
missing<00:03:04.140> spaces<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.650> know<00:03:04.770> it's<00:03:04.950> just<00:03:05.070> it's

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
missing spaces you know it's just it's

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.340 
missing spaces you know it's just it's
just<00:03:05.820> to<00:03:06.060> even<00:03:06.240> out<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.540> sides<00:03:06.750> it's<00:03:06.990> just<00:03:07.140> odd

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
just to even out the sides it's just odd

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.190 
just to even out the sides it's just odd
enough<00:03:07.590> but<00:03:08.010> yeah<00:03:08.490> so<00:03:09.180> that's<00:03:09.300> my<00:03:09.570> next<00:03:09.900> point

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
enough but yeah so that's my next point

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.900 
enough but yeah so that's my next point
as<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:10.890> fact<00:03:11.100> that<00:03:11.250> there<00:03:11.430> is<00:03:11.550> two<00:03:11.760> more

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
as to the fact that there is two more

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.980 
as to the fact that there is two more
villain<00:03:12.270> spot<00:03:12.540> spots<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.740> Red<00:03:14.340> Hood<00:03:14.610> is

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
villain spot spots and Red Hood is

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.420 
villain spot spots and Red Hood is
technically<00:03:15.990> a<00:03:16.080> villain<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:17.280> know<00:03:18.470> he's<00:03:19.470> more

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
technically a villain you know he's more

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.660 
technically a villain you know he's more
in<00:03:20.850> an<00:03:21.030> antihero<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:22.200> some<00:03:22.650> people<00:03:22.920> but<00:03:23.520> that

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
in an antihero to some people but that

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.610 
in an antihero to some people but that
can<00:03:23.820> also<00:03:23.970> fit<00:03:24.480> on<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.810> villain<00:03:25.080> side<00:03:25.260> because

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
can also fit on the villain side because

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.950 
can also fit on the villain side because
Catwoman<00:03:26.100> is<00:03:26.220> not<00:03:26.400> 100%<00:03:27.000> really<00:03:27.570> a<00:03:27.600> villain

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
Catwoman is not 100% really a villain

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.860 
Catwoman is not 100% really a villain
more<00:03:28.680> than<00:03:28.860> she<00:03:29.100> is<00:03:29.250> an<00:03:29.490> antihero<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.210> she<00:03:30.750> is

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
more than she is an antihero and she is

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.560 
more than she is an antihero and she is
on<00:03:31.020> the<00:03:31.050> villain<00:03:31.380> side<00:03:31.530> so<00:03:31.860> I<00:03:31.890> think<00:03:32.240> that<00:03:33.240> Red

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
on the villain side so I think that Red

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.970 
on the villain side so I think that Red
Hood<00:03:33.840> could<00:03:34.230> perfectly<00:03:35.220> fit<00:03:35.580> on<00:03:36.080> the<00:03:37.080> villain

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
Hood could perfectly fit on the villain

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.320 
Hood could perfectly fit on the villain
side<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:39.510> now<00:03:39.930> on<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.070> next<00:03:41.460> topic<00:03:42.150> which

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
side and now on to the next topic which

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.590 
side and now on to the next topic which
is<00:03:42.510> about<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:43.020> free<00:03:43.590> Robin<00:03:44.280> skinned<00:03:44.790> this<00:03:45.390> would

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
is about a free Robin skinned this would

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.500 
is about a free Robin skinned this would
only<00:03:45.870> make<00:03:46.320> sense<00:03:46.380> because<00:03:47.130> Jason<00:03:48.060> Todd<00:03:48.270> is

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
only make sense because Jason Todd is

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.930 
only make sense because Jason Todd is
Red<00:03:48.750> Hood<00:03:48.990> and<00:03:49.260> Jason<00:03:49.650> Todd<00:03:49.830> used<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.370> be<00:03:50.490> Robin

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
Red Hood and Jason Todd used to be Robin

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.260 
Red Hood and Jason Todd used to be Robin
so<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.840> would<00:03:51.930> only<00:03:52.140> be<00:03:52.890> cool<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.820> have<00:03:53.850> that

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
so it would only be cool to have that

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.680 
so it would only be cool to have that
same<00:03:54.750> type<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.320> deal<00:03:55.590> going<00:03:55.980> on<00:03:56.100> where<00:03:56.570> you<00:03:57.570> get

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
same type of deal going on where you get

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.340 
same type of deal going on where you get
a<00:03:57.750> Robin<00:03:58.140> skin<00:03:58.440> for<00:03:58.680> Nightwing<00:03:59.070> and<00:04:00.260> it'll<00:04:01.260> be

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
a Robin skin for Nightwing and it'll be

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.630 
a Robin skin for Nightwing and it'll be
