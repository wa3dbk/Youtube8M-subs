00:00:06.515 --> 00:00:09.914
 Welcome to the intensive WoW course for the Arcane magician. 

00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:13.913
 Here, we will give you a brief summary of what you will need to do to start 

00:00:14.163 --> 00:00:17.331
 to play with an Arcane wizard in level 90. 

00:00:19.107 --> 00:00:22.638
 The Arcanum revolves around the collection and use of accumulations 

00:00:22.927 --> 00:00:27.154
 of a benefit called Arcane Charge. You can have up to 4 accumulations 

00:00:27.622 --> 00:00:31.146
 and each one will increase the damage of your Arcane spells to a target 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.138
 but they will increase the mana you need to spend 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.505
 to keep your Arcane Charges active. 

00:00:36.826 --> 00:00:41.179
 You will need balance between great damage and high mana cost to play with it. 

00:00:42.406 --> 00:00:45.133
 Before fighting, cast Arcane Luminosity 

00:00:45.513 --> 00:00:49.263
 that increases your power with spells and the possibility of a critical hit. 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.396
 In combat, your most important spell is Arcane Explosion. 

00:00:54.026 --> 00:00:57.781
 Deals damage and generates an Arcane Charge, but quickly 

00:00:57.976 --> 00:00:59.882
 It will cost too much mana to maintain it. 

00:01:00.243 --> 00:01:06.193
 Next comes Arcane Missiles, which can only be used if activated by another spell 

00:01:06.598 --> 00:01:11.035
 but it will accumulate up to 3 launches. You will see a visual effect on your screen 

00:01:11.228 --> 00:01:14.018
 When available, show how many launches you have. 

00:01:14.636 --> 00:01:17.839
 It generates an Arcane Charge, but unlike Arcane Explosion 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.191
 Arcane missiles do not cost mana, so it's better to save your Arcane Missiles 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.316
 for when you have enough accumulations of Arcane Charge. 

00:01:26.488 --> 00:01:28.088
 Finally there is Arcana Tromba 

00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:32.567
 which consumes your active Arcane Charges to inflict a large amount of damage. 

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:36.789
 Use Arcana Tromba when you have saved 4 Arcane Charges 

00:01:37.023 --> 00:01:40.312
 but you can not launch Arcane Missiles, to reset the mana cost 

00:01:40.516 --> 00:01:43.289
 of your Arcane Explosion and that it starts accumulating again. 

00:01:43.724 --> 00:01:47.125
 There is much more to learn if you want to perfect your magician 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.559
 but we hope that the introduction will serve you 

00:01:49.786 --> 00:01:51.583
 to go in the right direction. 

00:01:52.106 --> 00:01:54.582
 Once you control the basics, it's a good idea 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.738
 spend time reading your book of spells, talents and glyphs 

00:01:59.098 --> 00:02:01.882
 to know the other faculties that we did not mention here. 

00:02:02.476 --> 00:02:05.710
 We hope you enjoyed, see you in Draenor!
