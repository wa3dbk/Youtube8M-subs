now<00:00:20.380> this<00:00:20.619> is<00:00:20.890> phase<00:00:21.310> five<00:00:21.610> of<00:00:21.910> the<00:00:22.090> chisel

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
now this is phase five of the chisel

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.150 
now this is phase five of the chisel
trainer<00:00:22.630> program<00:00:23.080> the<00:00:23.560> maintenance<00:00:24.009> phase

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
trainer program the maintenance phase

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.070 
trainer program the maintenance phase
now<00:00:24.730> this<00:00:25.029> phase<00:00:25.270> is<00:00:25.509> not<00:00:25.660> necessarily

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
now this phase is not necessarily

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.960 
now this phase is not necessarily
designed<00:00:26.500> for<00:00:26.680> you<00:00:26.800> to<00:00:26.860> burn<00:00:27.040> fat<00:00:27.340> but<00:00:27.700> to<00:00:27.820> help

designed for you to burn fat but to help

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.280 
designed for you to burn fat but to help
you<00:00:28.060> maintain<00:00:28.240> everything<00:00:28.900> that<00:00:29.169> you've

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
you maintain everything that you've

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:41.900 
you maintain everything that you've
achieved<00:00:29.380> for<00:00:30.189> the<00:00:30.220> first<00:00:30.490> four<00:00:30.820> phases

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.820 

so<00:00:42.540> what<00:00:42.720> you're<00:00:42.840> gonna<00:00:42.900> be<00:00:43.110> able<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.380> do<00:00:43.620> in

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
so what you're gonna be able to do in

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.560 
so what you're gonna be able to do in
this<00:00:44.040> phase<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.460> repeat<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.060> for<00:00:45.240> as<00:00:45.330> long<00:00:45.420> as

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
this phase is repeat it for as long as

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.750 
this phase is repeat it for as long as
you<00:00:45.660> need<00:00:45.840> until<00:00:46.050> you're<00:00:46.530> ready<00:00:46.830> to<00:00:47.310> start<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
you need until you're ready to start the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.080 
you need until you're ready to start the
program<00:00:48.030> again<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.510> get<00:00:48.870> better<00:00:49.080> results

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
program again and get better results

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.280 
program again and get better results
that's<00:00:51.090> pretty<00:00:51.270> much<00:00:51.360> what<00:00:51.540> I<00:00:51.570> do<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.810> mean<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.140> go

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
that's pretty much what I do I mean I go

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.810 
that's pretty much what I do I mean I go
hard<00:00:52.530> for<00:00:52.620> six<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:52.980> seven<00:00:53.250> weeks<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.640> then<00:00:53.760> I

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
hard for six to seven weeks and then I

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.880 
hard for six to seven weeks and then I
give<00:00:54.000> my<00:00:54.150> body<00:00:54.330> one<00:00:54.960> maintenance<00:00:55.470> week<00:00:55.680> when

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
give my body one maintenance week when

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.290 
give my body one maintenance week when
I'm<00:00:55.980> maintaining<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.520> same<00:00:56.730> level<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.090> body

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
I'm maintaining that same level of body

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.330 
I'm maintaining that same level of body
fat<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.960> then<00:00:58.200> I<00:00:58.230> start<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.560> program<00:00:58.890> again<00:00:59.160> I

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
fat and then I start the program again I

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.160 
fat and then I start the program again I
don't<00:00:59.580> want<00:00:59.790> to<00:00:59.820> overwhelm<00:01:00.360> myself<00:01:00.630> with

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
don't want to overwhelm myself with

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.860 
don't want to overwhelm myself with
workouts<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.040> and<00:01:02.340> diet<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.300> train<00:01:03.630> in<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
workouts and and diet and train in the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.230 
workouts and and diet and train in the
cardio<00:01:04.230> so<00:01:04.620> I<00:01:04.680> designed<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.370> phase<00:01:05.700> to

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
cardio so I designed this phase to

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.460 
cardio so I designed this phase to
actually<00:01:06.540> help<00:01:06.690> me<00:01:06.750> achieve<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.320> without

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
actually help me achieve that without

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:17.500 
actually help me achieve that without
stressing<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.460> overloading<00:01:09.060> my<00:01:09.360> system<00:01:09.750> so

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.480 

at<00:01:18.510> phase<00:01:18.750> five<00:01:19.050> what<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.650> did<00:01:19.979> was<00:01:20.160> I<00:01:20.250> didn't

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
at phase five what I did was I didn't

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.859 
at phase five what I did was I didn't
lay<00:01:20.640> out<00:01:20.790> specifically<00:01:21.360> what<00:01:21.630> you're<00:01:21.780> gonna

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
lay out specifically what you're gonna

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.530 
lay out specifically what you're gonna
work<00:01:22.080> out<00:01:22.229> every<00:01:22.500> single<00:01:22.530> day<00:01:23.090> but<00:01:24.090> instead<00:01:24.479> I

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
work out every single day but instead I

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.030 
work out every single day but instead I
wrote<00:01:24.810> an<00:01:24.960> entire<00:01:25.080> workout<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.890> targets

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
wrote an entire workout that targets

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.700 
wrote an entire workout that targets
every<00:01:26.940> single<00:01:27.330> muscle<00:01:27.479> group<00:01:27.660> and<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.440> choose

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
every single muscle group and you choose

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.100 
every single muscle group and you choose
how<00:01:29.130> many<00:01:29.190> days<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:30.030> want<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.300> train<00:01:30.509> but<00:01:30.990> you

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
how many days you want to train but you

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.780 
how many days you want to train but you
must<00:01:31.290> be<00:01:31.380> trained<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.680> at<00:01:31.800> least<00:01:32.040> three<00:01:32.550> times

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
must be trained in at least three times

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.870 
must be trained in at least three times
a<00:01:32.940> week

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
a week

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.940 
a week
so<00:01:35.630> this<00:01:35.750> is<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:35.869> outline<00:01:36.290> of<00:01:36.320> what<00:01:36.560> the

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
so this is the outline of what the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.140 
so this is the outline of what the
workouts<00:01:37.280> are<00:01:37.369> gonna<00:01:37.520> look<00:01:37.670> like<00:01:37.820> in<00:01:38.030> this

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
workouts are gonna look like in this

something like this we're gonna be doing
four<00:01:53.060> sets<00:01:53.390> of<00:01:53.630> ten<00:01:53.930> reps<00:01:54.009> resting<00:01:55.009> for<00:01:55.250> about

four sets of ten reps resting for about
45<00:01:55.970> seconds<00:01:56.509> each<00:01:56.630> when<00:01:57.409> it<00:01:57.500> comes<00:01:57.710> to<00:01:57.830> the

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
45 seconds each when it comes to the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.980 
45 seconds each when it comes to the
body<00:01:58.130> weight<00:01:58.340> exercises<00:01:58.759> like<00:01:59.030> push-ups<00:01:59.360> or
