00:00:01.235 --> 00:00:04.604
So, here's my latest project.

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:06.305
It's a table.

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:09.806
But, looks like a regular table
but, it's actually

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:13.813
it's a kid's table.
But, the way it goes together

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:16.048
is just like a regular table, so

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.618
if you want to know how to
build a table or a kid's table

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.486
watch this video.

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:23.987
I start by ripping a piece twice as long
as the legs off of the end of a 2 by 8.

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:27.193
I then rip that down the middle.

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:30.263
And flatten those pieces
on the jointer.

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:33.132
Next, I glue those pieces
together face to face.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.234
I start with lot's of glue.
Spread that out.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:38.735
Then put the pieces together. And
put quite a few clamps on there.

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:42.406
And then leave that drying
for about an hour.

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:48.281
While I'm waiting for the glue to dry,
I'm just ripping a few more pieces

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:51.782
to make the apron rails
out of a 2 by 4.

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:54.720
With the glue dried on the
two pieces I glued together

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:58.221
I can now square it up
on the jointer.

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.797
I'm also ripping a piece thick
enough for one apron rail

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:07.466
off the side of the piece
I glued together.

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:10.403
That'll leave enough
thickness for the legs.

00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:13.039
Now I'm marking the outline of the
legs on the piece that I just

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.540
ripped the apron rails off of.

00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:20.277
And now I cut out the shape
of the legs on the band saw.

00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:24.083
Because the band saw leaves a bit
of a rough cut I'm smoothing out

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:27.584
the edges of the legs on my jointer.

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:31.955
Now I mark the other taper on the legs.

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:35.661
And cut that on the band saw again.

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:38.798
And smooth that side too
on the jointer.

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.300
The top of the legs
is not actually tapered so

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:44.801
I'm cutting that part
straight on the table saw.

00:01:46.173 --> 00:01:49.673
The apron rails get joined to the
legs with a mortise and tenon joint.

00:01:50.244 --> 00:01:53.744
I'm using my homemade slot mortising
machine to cut the mortises.

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:05.889
Next, I cut my apron rails
to the exact length that I need.

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:12.462
And trim them to the desired width.

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:15.801
Next, I need to work out
the thickness of my tenon.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:19.302
I used the 5/16th inch router bit, which
works out to three hundred twelve thou.

00:02:20.174 --> 00:02:23.674
Plus I need to add another hundred thou
for the thickness of the saw blade.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:28.645
Now, let's just cut out a quick test
tenon to make sure it's all good.

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:35.218
And a quick trim of that tenon on
the band saw so I can try it out.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.461
Ok, it fits so all good to go.

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:45.665
Now I have to check all my boards so
that I'll be sure that the good side

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:49.166
is facing outwards. I'm marking a big I
on the side that'll be facing inwards.

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:55.238
Now I'm cutting the tenons
on both sides of my apron rails.

00:03:13.227 --> 00:03:16.727
I'm cutting the shoulders of the
tenons on just the table saw sled.

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:25.168
I'm also using my table saw sled
to cut the ends of the tenons.

00:03:27.274 --> 00:03:30.774
And finish that off with the band saw.

00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:37.283
Now, I'm rounding the corners of the
tenons so that they'll fit into the

00:03:37.284 --> 00:03:40.784
round end of the mortises.

00:03:41.088 --> 00:03:43.389
But before I can put my mortise
and tenon joints together

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.892
I have to do a few other things
to my pieces.

00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:49.393
So, here I'm marking the cut-out
that's gonna be on the bottom edge

00:03:49.563 --> 00:03:53.063
of the apron rails.

00:03:54.868 --> 00:03:58.368
Now to cut out the shape of
that cut-out with the band saw.

00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:07.747
I only actually marked up one of
my pieces so I'm now using that

00:04:07.748 --> 00:04:10.383
as a template to mark
the other three pieces.

00:04:10.384 --> 00:04:13.884
Which I'll then cut out
with the band saw, as well.

00:04:19.893 --> 00:04:21.894
Now, to clean up that
rough band saw cut

00:04:21.895 --> 00:04:25.395
I'm using my belt sander.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:30.436
I'm also cutting some
slots into the rails which the

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:33.937
hooks that hold the table
top will attach onto.

00:04:35.142 --> 00:04:37.376
Now I'm routing the bottom
edges of my apron rails

00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:40.877
with a quarter inch
round-over router bit.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.450
And also routing the
edges of the legs.

00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:54.291
Now I can finally glue my mortise
and tenon joints all together.

00:05:08.242 --> 00:05:11.742
I'm gonna let these two sub-assemblies dry
before I glue the rest of it together.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.826
To make the top, I'm recycling
an old Ikea shelf.

00:05:26.827 --> 00:05:28.694
It's a bit longer than
I need it to be so

00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:32.195
I'm cutting it to length.

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:36.302
The recycled Ikea shelf
wasn't quite wide enough so

00:05:36.303 --> 00:05:39.803
I'm gluing another board onto the edge
to bring it up to the desired width.

00:05:51.618 --> 00:05:55.118
After I let the glue dry I'm smoothing
my joints with a hand plane.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.990
And then finishing it off
with a belt sander.

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:05.665
Now to round the corners I'm using
the bottom of a can or WD-40

00:06:05.666 --> 00:06:09.135
to mark the arcs.

00:06:09.136 --> 00:06:12.636
Which I then cut off
with a band saw.

00:06:16.844 --> 00:06:20.344
And then I round the top and bottom
edges of the table top with a

00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:24.581
quarter inch round-over
router bit.

00:06:29.656 --> 00:06:33.156
Next, I'm cutting a whole bunch of little
blocks that have a sort of a hook on them.

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:36.893
Those hooks will hook into the slots
that I cut into my apron rail.

00:06:37.598 --> 00:06:39.599
They allow the table to be attached

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.100
and still allow it some amount
of wood movement.

00:07:08.028 --> 00:07:11.528
I hope you've enjoyed this video about
building this children's table.

00:07:11.732 --> 00:07:15.168
It goes together actually
exactly like a full-sized table

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:18.669
except all the components are
about two-thirds the real size.

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:22.539
If you want to build a kitchen
table that looks a lot like that

00:07:22.543 --> 00:07:24.477
all you have to do is
scale up the plans.

00:07:24.478 --> 00:07:27.180
So, I'll post the plans for
this table on my website.

00:07:27.181 --> 00:07:29.048
Woodgears. ca

00:07:29.049 --> 00:07:32.549
And, I'll also post a CLF
full-sized version of this table

00:07:32.686 --> 00:07:35.188
So that you can build that
kitchen table from those plans.

00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:38.689
