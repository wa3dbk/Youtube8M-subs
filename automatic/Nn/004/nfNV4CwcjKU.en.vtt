fears about range anxiety and that's
when<00:00:20.850> people<00:00:21.539> are<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.080> nervous<00:00:22.470> about<00:00:22.859> the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
when people are so nervous about the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.730 
when people are so nervous about the
thought<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:24.300> driving<00:00:24.570> electric<00:00:25.109> car<00:00:25.289> for<00:00:25.529> fear

of<00:00:25.769> really<00:00:26.220> not<00:00:26.340> have<00:00:26.460> juice<00:00:26.730> if<00:00:26.970> they<00:00:27.090> end<00:00:27.240> up

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
of really not have juice if they end up

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.730 
being stranded up on the hard shoulder
it's<00:00:30.240> one<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.510> main<00:00:30.660> reasons<00:00:31.050> why<00:00:31.199> the

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
it's one of the main reasons why the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.250 
it's one of the main reasons why the
adoption<00:00:32.219> rate<00:00:32.369> in<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.640> UK<00:00:32.870> hasn't<00:00:33.870> probably

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
adoption rate in the UK hasn't probably

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.799 
adoption rate in the UK hasn't probably
been<00:00:34.440> as<00:00:34.620> as<00:00:34.950> quick<00:00:35.280> or<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:35.640> successful<00:00:36.210> as<00:00:36.420> it

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
been as as quick or as successful as it

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.260 
been as as quick or as successful as it
could<00:00:37.110> have<00:00:37.140> been<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.370> very<00:00:38.820> flaky

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
could have been that and very flaky

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.090 
could have been that and very flaky
municipal<00:00:40.140> charging<00:00:40.590> points<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.010> are

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
municipal charging points that are

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.940 
municipal charging points that are
peppered<00:00:41.399> around<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:42.300> UK<00:00:42.829> London<00:00:43.829> to

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
peppered around the UK London to

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.490 
peppered around the UK London to
Birmingham<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.820> not<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.539> short<00:00:45.870> distance<00:00:46.110> you

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
Birmingham is not a short distance you

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.310 
Birmingham is not a short distance you
know<00:00:46.649> it's<00:00:46.829> probably<00:00:46.980> 120<00:00:47.850> miles<00:00:48.110> easily<00:00:49.110> two

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
know it's probably 120 miles easily two

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.410 
know it's probably 120 miles easily two
hours<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.800> car<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.879> probably<00:00:51.059> takes

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
hours in the car so it probably takes

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.630 
hours in the car so it probably takes
care<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.140> majority<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.739> most<00:00:53.190> people's

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
care of the majority of most people's

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.340 
care of the majority of most people's
commute<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.300> it'll<00:00:54.480> be<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> really<00:00:54.780> good<00:00:54.930> test

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
commute so it'll be a really good test

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.740 
commute so it'll be a really good test
to<00:00:55.530> see<00:00:55.559> what<00:00:56.160> if<00:00:56.280> we<00:00:56.370> can<00:00:56.489> get<00:00:56.699> us<00:00:56.820> there<00:00:57.030> until

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
to see what if we can get us there until

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.630 
to see what if we can get us there until
you<00:00:57.809> can<00:00:57.989> get<00:00:58.109> us<00:00:58.260> there<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.649> refinement<00:00:59.520> and

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
you can get us there in refinement and

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.209 
you can get us there in refinement and
comfort<00:01:00.320> the<00:01:01.320> second<00:01:01.739> reason<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.160> because

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
comfort the second reason is because

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.609 
comfort the second reason is because
London<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.149> Birmingham<00:01:03.300> represents<00:01:04.080> quite<00:01:04.589> a

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
London to Birmingham represents quite a

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:20.990 
slowed down quite a lot and it's
becoming<00:03:19.409> frustrating<00:03:20.400> it's<00:03:20.849> not

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
becoming frustrating it's not

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.699 
becoming frustrating it's not
necessarily<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:21.480> problem<00:03:21.599> with<00:03:21.870> Tesla<00:03:22.260> it's

more<00:03:22.889> a<00:03:22.920> problem<00:03:23.099> with<00:03:23.340> our<00:03:23.489> infrastructure

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
more a problem with our infrastructure

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.879 
more a problem with our infrastructure
it<00:03:24.450> needs<00:03:24.599> a<00:03:24.659> bit<00:03:24.780> of<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:24.930> kick<00:03:25.470> up<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.739> arse

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
it needs a bit of a kick up the arse

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:29.359 
it needs a bit of a kick up the arse
