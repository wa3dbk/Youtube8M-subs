00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
that'll be cool and i'll definitely

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.450

YouTube Reddit and Twitter so honestly I

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.500 
YouTube Reddit and Twitter so honestly I
don't<00:05:05.160> think<00:05:05.340> we<00:05:05.550> can<00:05:05.699> do<00:05:05.850> much<00:05:06.060> about<00:05:06.210> it<00:05:06.330> at

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
don't think we can do much about it at
