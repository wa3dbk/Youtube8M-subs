the auto brightness the built-in feature
on<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:17.640> I'm<00:00:18.090> coming<00:00:18.390> from<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.690> lg<00:00:19.109> optimus<00:00:19.140> G

pro which I have on the left one of the
things<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.619> like<00:00:22.830> about<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:23.220> device<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.939> the

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
things I like about this device is the

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.529 
things I like about this device is the
auto<00:00:25.380> brightness<00:00:25.650> setting<00:00:26.609> unless<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:27.210> kind

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
auto brightness setting unless you kind

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.689 
auto brightness setting unless you kind
of<00:00:27.599> set<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> baseline<00:00:28.500> for<00:00:29.340> your<00:00:29.519> auto

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
of set a baseline for your auto

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.640 
of set a baseline for your auto
brightness<00:00:29.970> as<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.449> can<00:00:30.570> see<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.750> have<00:00:30.990> auto<00:00:31.289> on

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
brightness as you can see I have auto on

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.650 
brightness as you can see I have auto on
but<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:31.949> can<00:00:32.130> adjust<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.880> where<00:00:33.329> it's<00:00:33.540> just

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
but I can adjust it to where it's just

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.310 
but I can adjust it to where it's just
perfect<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.920> when<00:00:35.670> I'm<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:36.030> really<00:00:36.480> dark

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
perfect so when I'm in a really dark

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.150 
perfect so when I'm in a really dark
room

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
room

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.630 
room
it'll<00:00:38.550> just<00:00:39.210> down<00:00:39.390> basically<00:00:39.809> accordingly

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
it'll just down basically accordingly

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.790 
it'll just down basically accordingly
and<00:00:41.640> get<00:00:41.940> brighter<00:00:42.500> automatically<00:00:43.500> but<00:00:43.739> you

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
and get brighter automatically but you

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
and get brighter automatically but you
still<00:00:44.280> get<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.520> set<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.530> baseline<00:00:46.579> often<00:00:47.579> I

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
still get to set that baseline often I

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.389 
still get to set that baseline often I
have<00:00:48.420> woken<00:00:49.170> up<00:00:49.289> at<00:00:49.410> night<00:00:49.590> grabbed<00:00:49.950> my<00:00:50.129> phone

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
have woken up at night grabbed my phone

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.389 
have woken up at night grabbed my phone
of<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:51.059> six<00:00:51.600> month<00:00:51.809> old<00:00:51.989> daughter<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.800> wakes

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
of a six month old daughter that wakes

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.000 
of a six month old daughter that wakes
us<00:00:53.579> up<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.940> middle<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.270> night<00:00:54.449> and

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
us up in the middle of the night and

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.549 
us up in the middle of the night and
I've<00:00:56.010> noticed<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:57.000> phone<00:00:57.210> is

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
I've noticed that the the phone is

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.099 
I've noticed that the the phone is
entirely<00:00:58.579> too<00:00:59.579> bright<00:00:59.820> even<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.300> auto

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
entirely too bright even on auto

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.969 
entirely too bright even on auto
brightness<00:01:01.440> I've<00:01:01.920> gone<00:01:02.219> out<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:03.559> to<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> bright

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
brightness I've gone out in to a bright

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.450 
brightness I've gone out in to a bright
area<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.610> had<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.330> entirely<00:01:06.990> too<00:01:07.320> dim<00:01:07.590> as<00:01:07.770> well

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
area and had it entirely too dim as well

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.820 
area and had it entirely too dim as well
so<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.850> went<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.479> market<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:10.049> download<00:01:10.590> a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
so I went on the market I download a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.850 
so I went on the market I download a
program<00:01:11.130> called<00:01:11.369> auto<00:01:11.970> brightness<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:13.770> as

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
program called auto brightness and as

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.160 
program called auto brightness and as
you<00:01:13.979> see<00:01:14.130> right<00:01:14.310> here<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.640> can<00:01:14.760> kind<00:01:14.970> of

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
you see right here you can kind of

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.649 
you see right here you can kind of
adjust<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.770> graph<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.430> scale<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.479> way

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
adjust the graph and scale it the way

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.499 
adjust the graph and scale it the way
you<00:01:18.720> want<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.530> course<00:01:20.100> there<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> sensor

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
you want to of course there is a sensor

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.270 
you want to of course there is a sensor
on<00:01:21.869> your<00:01:22.140> device<00:01:22.409> that's<00:01:22.710> going<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.950> detect

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
on your device that's going to detect

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.670 
on your device that's going to detect
the<00:01:23.549> amount<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.150> white<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.659> that's<00:01:24.780> how<00:01:25.110> it

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
the amount of white and that's how it

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.030 
the amount of white and that's how it
just<00:01:26.490> even<00:01:27.119> from<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.479> factory<00:01:27.900> was<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.920> turn

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
just even from the factory was to turn

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.510 
just even from the factory was to turn
the<00:01:29.159> light<00:01:29.310> off<00:01:29.340> here<00:01:29.960> and<00:01:31.100> you'll<00:01:32.100> see<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.400> go

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
the light off here and you'll see it go

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.550 
the light off here and you'll see it go
down<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.000> graph<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.990> light<00:01:34.110> back<00:01:34.320> on

down on the graph to the light back on

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.700 
down on the graph to the light back on
and<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.579> goes<00:01:35.729> up<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.170> accept<00:01:37.560> the
