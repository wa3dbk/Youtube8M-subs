2.49 be camera positioning tutorial
positioning<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.820> camera<00:00:09.269> is<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.480> vital<00:00:09.929> part

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
positioning the camera is a vital part

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.280 
positioning the camera is a vital part
of<00:00:10.410> rendering<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.190> scene<00:00:11.460> in<00:00:11.700> this<00:00:12.509> tutorial<00:00:12.750> I

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
of rendering a scene in this tutorial I

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.749 
of rendering a scene in this tutorial I
will<00:00:13.320> show<00:00:13.440> you<00:00:13.679> how<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.920> position<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.549> camera

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
will show you how to position the camera

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.340 
will show you how to position the camera
so<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.389> can<00:00:15.570> focus<00:00:15.599> on<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.170> particular

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
so that you can focus on a particular

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.340 
so that you can focus on a particular
object<00:00:17.279> as<00:00:17.940> well<00:00:18.240> as<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.600> move<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.869> around<00:00:18.930> so

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
object as well as to move it around so

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.840 
object as well as to move it around so
you<00:00:19.380> can<00:00:19.470> render<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.070> scene<00:00:20.100> from<00:00:20.520> close<00:00:20.820> up

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
you can render the scene from close up

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.009 
you can render the scene from close up
from<00:00:21.750> far<00:00:21.990> away<00:00:22.020> or<00:00:22.619> at<00:00:22.800> any<00:00:22.920> angle<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:24.019> will

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
from far away or at any angle I will

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.310 
from far away or at any angle I will
also<00:00:25.199> show<00:00:25.380> how<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.949> do<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> fly<00:00:26.550> around

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
objects in the scene let's see how the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.630 
objects in the scene let's see how the
lamp<00:01:38.250> works<00:01:39.170> use<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.380> shaded<00:01:40.829> mode<00:01:40.979> draw<00:01:41.340> type

lamp the child of the camera so that the
lamp<00:02:04.710> will<00:02:04.890> follow<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.399> camera<00:02:06.170> this<00:02:07.170> will

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
lamp will follow the camera this will

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.320 
lamp will follow the camera this will
ensure<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.680> no<00:02:08.340> matter<00:02:08.550> where<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.940> camera

and<00:08:05.890> we<00:08:06.890> have<00:08:07.010> animated<00:08:07.400> the<00:08:07.610> camera<00:08:08.030> around

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:08.210 
and we have animated the camera around

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.110 
and we have animated the camera around
the<00:08:08.630> path<00:08:08.870> similar<00:08:09.470> to<00:08:09.860> flying<00:08:10.190> over<00:08:10.760> a<00:08:10.790> scene
