00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello and welcome to razer 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.649
 here at gamescom 2015 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.690
 we'll show you the new things 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.700
 we have brought quite fresh 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.480
 announced first of all the new place 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.789
 about kromer who has that very much 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.570
 Economically or ergonomically designed 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.510
 it is a mechanical speak 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.019
 uses the razer switches fully rgb 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.420
 Of course, very or analogous to the black 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.920
 was there too 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.370
 say every single button completely 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.930
 adjustable 60 8 million colors 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.270
 you have the possibility of size 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.820
 change and also to your hand directly 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.820
 be it only in the angle of inclination 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.190
 the palm rest in addition to it 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.039
 there is also a joystick eight here 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.800
 way joystick for the thumb modifier 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.170
 gravel over racers you can every taste 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.030
 as well as the wood and the 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.520
 for example, play the lotto easily 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.109
 move the map and thus the joystick 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.300
 with the mouse easy in the action 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.559
 stay and then have to edge and 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.150
 therefore easy you a 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.860
 gain speed advantage 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.150
 from the color variants or from the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.590
 from that of the of a lighting 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.610
 option we have exactly the same 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.130
 things that also became black 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.420
 that means everything you can do as chrome 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.970
 sync with each other 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.830
 and you can see it here, too 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.100
 very bright and exciting colors 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.930
 So you can also stop for example for 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.270
 define your own colors and so on 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.490
 on and on 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.799
 the whole thing is about us 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.460
 razer website racer store distributed 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.869
 become 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.850
 price 449 euros over the next few weeks 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.890
 be available 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.750
 that means you can always be there too 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.850
 with us for example in facebook on the 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.290
 keep me up to date 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.310
 we also introduced the new 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.549
 the stalker kromer on membranes keyboard 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.250
 with chiquita buttons 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.689
 We know that he is a lot of gamer 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.560
 Mechanical gravel likes it very much 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.390
 Of course there are people too 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.430
 actually put a lot of value on it 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.590
 very quiet to have that 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.810
 Of course , membrane offers a lot 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.270
 scope 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.010
 she is virtually inaudible 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.750
 we have compared to normal 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.040
 Membrane keyboards also very many 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.520
 Optimization work done 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.840
 that is, every button actually had 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.640
 a trigger distance of two 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.110
 millimeters 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.090
 by simply having just 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.640
 game the big advantage that you can quickly 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.160
 can react and if it affects everyone 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.830
 millisecond arrives in the game of 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.010
 between victory and defeat decides 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.140
 If you are so well served is the 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.360
 be available in stores on next days 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.519
 say everywhere 219 euros 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.630
 of course also in the German layout and 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:51.410
 is a great device also new and 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.230
 the first time 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.269
 There was already something in the case of the 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.500
 pc games are pc games hardware about it 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.610
 About the new mum we on the e3 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.950
 imagined 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.799
 nonetheless show busy here too 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.769
 again in the context of the press presentation 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:10.519
 the mum know that they are the ones 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:13.220
 maximum overkill is a philippina 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.230
 Laser sensor with 16,000 dpi resolution 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.150
 Of course we are natural 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.620
 aware that it is currently absolutely 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.239
 but who is a house is exaggerated 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.609
 She also wants to buy three four 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.489
 keep five and six years with 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:28.130
 increasing computing power you will yes 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.569
 also be able to hopefully 234 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.239
 to connect to the car monitor 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.100
 and then, of course , 16,000 are fun 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.040
 also have just for the heisen 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.200
 player through the high resolution 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.959
 sensor the possibility of lift too 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.920
 to be very very precise 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.109
 Industry standard is usually one 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.540
 mm speak as soon as you take off 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:49.579
 millimeter tracking distance from the 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.630
 sensor actually reacts that now 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.630
 gated that would be just this 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.150
 hand movement through the new sensors 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.360
 if in fact from 0 1 millimeter there 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.630
 complete so that 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:05.650
 a shiver or shake in the 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.380
 movement is also prevented 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.910
 sometimes one 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.520
 another innovation that is called the 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.740
 just survey force here one 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:18.160
 bottom we see two screws 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:21.190
 that is , mice usually have one 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.240
 required triggering power from 70 to 75 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.010
 grasp thumbs 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.840
 we have decided who we are 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.220
 said why should it always be so 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.430
 of course we want that to be this 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.830
 that's why it says so here too 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.300
 able actually the the 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.220
 set required force 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.290
 cool scenarios are for example 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.780
 especially at the league flash institute 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.550
 play the right one 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.620
 maustaste very light one has so 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.600
 naturally increased speed straight 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.530
 in the movement and the left mouse button 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.910
 can be a bit stronger for the skills 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.340
 so that we as well as the 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.970
 have full control and not through 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.730
 coincidence 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:01.450
 Just click on it is very very much 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:03.520
 available in stores soon the wired 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.460
 The tournament edition was slightly different 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.479
 Of course you will stop earlier 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.570
 like to keep up to date 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:12.760
 Last but not least, we also want here 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.890
 even the opportunity you use the times 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.760
 Gunners to show that a manufacturer 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.930
 from the us the glasses actually for 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.820
 computer player and computer user 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.280
 produce 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:26.110
 It's about the light of one 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.270
 monitors contains many blue share 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.800
 which can provide dry eyes and 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.630
 especially for longer gaming 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.390
 actually for a headache 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:37.419
 the field will filter with the glasses 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.890
 filtered out by a bit and 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:41.110
 there is a design at razer 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.120
 Cooperation that means you have one here 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.820
 also the famous razer colors at the start 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.490
 and a common design which of course 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:53.200
 especially for the fans of razer 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:56.290
 safety an exciting thing is yes 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:00.100
 I hope the things I showed you 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:01.390
 have you and we like you 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.560
 still wish you much fun 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.800
 with the coverage of the 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.800
