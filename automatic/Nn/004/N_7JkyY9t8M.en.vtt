00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.440
 hello I am if so escobar we are in the 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.510
 central mall and today we will be 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.580
 playing with the new cyber shot the song 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.139
 and taking a few pictures of videos and 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.139
 having a good time do not go 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.640
 we tried a new version of sony a 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:43.640
 camera with 16 megapixel sensor and a 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.880
 25 mm wide-angle lens 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.950
 with an 8 x optical zoom capture up 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.690
 the smallest details the camera 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.120
 has an optical stabilizer 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.550
 esther and shot so your photos do not 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.949
 sweeps out what makes the 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.820
 night images come out clearer and 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.820
 less blurry 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.960
 the camera manages to capture panoramic 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.510
 and it's as simple as pressing a button 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.280
 move the camera horizontally and wait 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.280
 to which the camera one of the images 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.590
 Intelligent auto mode adjusts 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.579
 to the scene and adjust the settings 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.890
 automatically so that your photo never 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.229
 fail the camera can capture 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.020
 3D photos and play them in 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.600
 compatible televisions you can add 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.350
 artistic effects such as monochromatic 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.350
 enriched 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.420
 just one color 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.060
 illustration 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.340
 add vignette and color to your photos 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.360
 The best part is that you do not have to 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.420
 wait to get home to share 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.340

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.890

 control it from your cell phone by 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.910
 same application play memory available 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.910
 for ios and android 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.820
 in a big screen panorama and 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.710
 super high resolution maybe you find it 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.960
 a little strange to handle them there are versions 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.690
 or even just the opposite is 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.400
 extremely small and its resolution therefore 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.350
 is not that high outside of that is a 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.540
 small option that has everything that is 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.540
 economic and that is also very practical 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.430
 in this last photo we said goodbye 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.890
