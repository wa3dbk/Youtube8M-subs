00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 welcome to a first 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.609
 little tutorial 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.919
 Here I introduce you to two types today 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.550
 from palm before a lot of fun 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.280
 yes and let's go in this tutorial where 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.759
 I show you how you already are in palm 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.220
 beach 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.670
 I have two kinds of palm 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.140
 picked out and will now build and 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.080
 explain you ps built 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.789
 I found myself here in the flatland map 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.369
 a small oasis built 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.880
 Of course, it is clearly missing here 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.360
 Palm tree 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.829
 We will build them now and for that 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.829
 I have you something here 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.489
 prepared in the inventory for the 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.800
 first palm we need four zones one 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.500
 wood or a tree trunk 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.120
 no matter what you take but oak looks 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.390
 actually best off then we have 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.399
 still foliage takes the brightest in the bio 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.620
 is probably because you're the 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.140
 palmen build star see yes again 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.270
 trying differently just like that seriously 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.049
 to take that they just so on 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.150
 freshest refreshing so yes 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.780
 We start with a palm tree 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:17.360
 directly hither we start here 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:21.920
 to build these wooden fences on each other 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:25.740
 her piece and me so 1234 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:30.720
 and on top of why we came from the room 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.070
 who should not be gassed so what 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.420
 First there's his cousin 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.350
 Lawley but the gem come what 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.260
 the palm makes up the leaves 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.430
 that probably 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.229
 but then it communicates to the palm tree 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.630
 This palm is very easy to build 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.950
 if you know how to do it 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.090
 he starts here with the first 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:56.240
 centerpiece and then builds here respectively 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.369
 There are two leaves here, two each 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.960
 two leaves and here again two 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.270
 leaves that still does not look 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.880
 like a palm but it is changing now 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.539
 and now builds exactly on this 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.649
 lower leaves block again two 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:15.100
 more to it 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.100
 that has everywhere on every page and 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:24.440
 have the palm so I think I'm beautiful 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.330
 you just can not be good at home 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.160
 build better I guess but her 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.230
 have built me up nicely in this 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.700
 format and you want me as a video 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.580
 Answer who is very cool 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.790
 yes I'll build you again very quickly 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.040
 to come along 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.489
 or should I stop quickly 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.910
 am happy here is great here 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.910
 says 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:58.500
 and that's what it was with 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.510
 the first palms and I have now 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.460
 another palm art of you me 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.260
 personally constanz as much as like 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.730
 this one where I built and that 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.190
 that's exactly the same 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.710
 only with real tree trunks he 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.930
 but needs five oak or 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:22.500
 if you do not do it as possible 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:26.180
 Rough in the foliage and then it would be too 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.890
 already done so I build directly 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.790
 however you import the Password for 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.790
 34 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:42.209
 the leaf on it then again so 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:47.810
 and it's just the sun under me 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.810
 must go very briefly what 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.230
 Now time is here again 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.820
 been set to try 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:03.650
 yes this works the same way and 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:04.820
 again super installed so that would be the 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.970
 real voices 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.710
 it looks a bit strange even 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.750
 So I think it's a matter of taste for me 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.500
 Personally, I like so well again very 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.500
 Build here quickly 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:36.310
 that was it with the pollen with 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.990
 come up with all four cases like that 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.789
 It was with a voice tutorial I hope so 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.240
 has helped you something there because it 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:46.020
 nothing special but I see so many 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.630
 people who are always looking for 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.039
 yes, I already have some doubts 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.979
 after that I also searched a few videos 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:55.720
 found and have made one yourself 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.789
 okay, I wish you a nice one 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:02.729
 day if you wanted more videos 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:02.729
 channel and up yet
