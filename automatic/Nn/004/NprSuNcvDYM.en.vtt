anyways and i'll show you how to make

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.970 
anyways and i'll show you how to make
this<00:00:33.180> simply<00:00:33.870> uh<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.469> can<00:00:34.590> see<00:00:34.710> there's<00:00:34.890> a

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
this simply uh you can see there's a

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.470 
this simply uh you can see there's a
difference<00:00:35.340> in<00:00:35.489> chest<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:36.030> know<00:00:36.090> wait<00:00:36.300> to

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
difference in chest you know wait to

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.229 
difference in chest you know wait to
 with<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.460> this<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.670> trap<00:00:38.940> chest

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
 with the this is a trap chest

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.139 
 with the this is a trap chest
you<00:00:39.780> want<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.110> read<00:00:40.260> outline<00:00:40.790> what<00:00:41.790> trapped

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
you want to read outline what trapped

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.940 
you want to read outline what trapped
chests<00:00:42.570> are<00:00:42.840> are<00:00:43.200> basically<00:00:43.530> choice<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.920> I

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
chests are are basically choice that I

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.299 
chests are are basically choice that I
made<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.309> redstone<00:00:44.910> signal<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.539> one<00:00:45.809> block<00:00:45.960> from

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
made a redstone signal a one block from

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.010 
made a redstone signal a one block from
it<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.000> can<00:00:48.239> technically<00:00:48.450> have<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> TNT

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
it so you can technically have a TNT

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.299 
it so you can technically have a TNT
here<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.320> if<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.410> open<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.710> chest<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.129> think

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
here and if you open this chest I think

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.680 
here and if you open this chest I think
it's<00:00:50.460> going<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.610> get<00:00:50.730> activated<00:00:51.120> and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
it's going to get activated and

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.260 
it's going to get activated and
blow<00:00:51.840> up<00:00:51.930> your<00:00:52.699> these<00:00:53.699> chests<00:00:54.000> were<00:00:54.090> made

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
blow up your these chests were made

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.040 
blow up your these chests were made
to<00:00:54.480> be<00:00:54.690> no<00:00:55.020> traps<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:56.300> lucky<00:00:57.300> for<00:00:57.329> us<00:00:57.510> they<00:00:57.870> act

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
to be no traps but lucky for us they act

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.290 
to be no traps but lucky for us they act
exactly<00:00:58.620> like<00:00:58.890> normal<00:00:59.489> chest<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.000> we<00:01:00.120> can

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
exactly like normal chest so we can

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.020 
exactly like normal chest so we can
actually<00:01:00.510> do<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.920> basically<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.879> make<00:01:03.000> a

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
actually do this and basically to make a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.990 
actually do this and basically to make a
trap<00:01:03.300> chest<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:04.379> need<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.830> work<00:01:05.369> bench<00:01:05.610> so

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
trap chest you need a work bench so

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.960 
trap chest you need a work bench so
let's<00:01:06.270> set<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.600> up<00:01:06.780> right<00:01:07.229> here<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:07.970> you'll

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
let's set that up right here and you'll

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.359 
let's set that up right here and you'll
need<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.510> normal<00:01:09.990> chests<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:10.799> this

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
need the normal chests with this

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.020 
need the normal chests with this
basically<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.540> how<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.840> do<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:14.030> you're

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
basically this is how you do and you're

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.340 
basically this is how you do and you're
making<00:01:15.330> yourself<00:01:18.229> there<00:01:19.229> you

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
making yourself there you

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.870 
making yourself there you
go<00:01:19.530> you're<00:01:19.979> making<00:01:20.250> yourself<00:01:20.310> trip<00:01:20.700> wire

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
go you're making yourself trip wire

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.690 
go you're making yourself trip wire
hooks<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.680> trip<00:01:22.680> wire<00:01:22.830> hooks<00:01:23.100> they<00:01:23.430> give<00:01:23.610> you

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
hooks and trip wire hooks they give you

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.820 
hooks and trip wire hooks they give you
two<00:01:23.880> per<00:01:24.150> set<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.750> mean<00:01:24.930> yes<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.560> kind<00:01:25.770> of

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
two per set I mean yes it is kind of

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.039 
two per set I mean yes it is kind of
expensive<00:01:26.070> if<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.970> if<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.450> really<00:01:27.750> want<00:01:27.960> that

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
expensive if you if you really want that

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.179 
expensive if you if you really want that
gap<00:01:29.600> you<00:01:30.600> have<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.900> pay<00:01:31.020> for<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:32.040> got

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
gap you have to pay for it you got

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.760 
gap you have to pay for it you got
yourself<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.640> hooks<00:01:33.259> what<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.350> simply<00:01:34.590> do<00:01:34.740> is

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
yourself the hooks what you simply do is

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.330 
yourself the hooks what you simply do is
put<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.369> chest<00:01:35.720> put<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.900> hook<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:38.009> got<00:01:38.220> yourself

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
put a chest put a hook you got yourself

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.940 
put a chest put a hook you got yourself
a<00:01:38.729> trapped<00:01:39.180> chest<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:40.290> let's<00:01:40.439> make<00:01:40.590> two<00:01:40.829> of

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
a trapped chest so let's make two of

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.550 
a trapped chest so let's make two of
those<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.280> we<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.490> have<00:01:41.670> both<00:01:42.119> types<00:01:43.049> we<00:01:43.439> have

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
those so we can have both types we have

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.850 
those so we can have both types we have
normal<00:01:43.979> chest<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.520> we<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.820> trapped<00:01:45.119> chest

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
normal chest and we have trapped chest

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
normal chest and we have trapped chest
basically<00:01:46.860> what<00:01:46.979> we<00:01:47.100> do<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.360> Bam<00:01:48.360> Bam<00:01:49.200> Bam<00:01:50.100> Bam

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
basically what we do is Bam Bam Bam Bam

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.300 
basically what we do is Bam Bam Bam Bam
and<00:01:51.090> there<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.259> go<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:53.070> got

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
and there you go you got

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.770 
and there you go you got
yourself<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:54.320> very<00:01:55.320> neatly<00:01:55.740> organized<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:57.030> chest

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
yourself a very neatly organized a chest

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.520 
yourself a very neatly organized a chest
