00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
just allowing your nervous system to

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.029 
just allowing your nervous system to

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
basically the addiction to thought to

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.510 
basically the addiction to thought to
start<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.350> melt<00:00:58.559> away<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.160> start<00:00:59.340> to

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
start to melt away and to start to

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.660 
start to melt away and to start to
weaken<00:00:59.879> because<00:01:00.840> there<00:01:01.710> are<00:01:01.859> other<00:01:02.070> ways<00:01:02.190> of

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
weaken because there are other ways of

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.660 
weaken because there are other ways of
understanding<00:01:02.879> reality<00:01:04.070> then<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.339> just

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
understanding reality then to just

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.789 
understanding reality then to just
through<00:01:05.970> thought<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.990> when<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.350> say<00:01:07.560> fun

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799
