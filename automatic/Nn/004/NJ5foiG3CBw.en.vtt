00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.589 
now keep in mind my setup on my phone is
constantly<00:00:31.220> changing<00:00:31.759> by<00:00:32.240> the<00:00:32.270> time<00:00:32.480> you're

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.210 
constantly changing by the time you're
watching<00:00:32.630> this<00:00:32.930> I'm<00:00:33.200> probably<00:00:33.680> probably

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
watching this I'm probably probably

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.670 
watching this I'm probably probably
already<00:00:34.579> switch<00:00:34.850> to<00:00:34.970> something<00:00:35.270> else<00:00:35.470> so<00:00:36.470> I'm

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
already switch to something else so I'm

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.229 
already switch to something else so I'm
gonna<00:00:36.800> take<00:00:36.950> this<00:00:37.070> video<00:00:37.340> off<00:00:37.550> with<00:00:37.820> what<00:00:38.060> I'm

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
gonna take this video off with what I'm

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.389 
gonna take this video off with what I'm
actually<00:00:38.510> using<00:00:38.870> on<00:00:39.230> my<00:00:39.620> phone<00:00:39.920> and<00:00:40.130> that's

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
actually using on my phone and that's

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.820 
actually using on my phone and that's
the<00:00:40.700> stuffed<00:00:40.970> case<00:00:41.180> I'm<00:00:41.450> not<00:00:42.020> really<00:00:42.230> sure<00:00:42.650> if

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
the stuffed case I'm not really sure if

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.110 
the stuffed case I'm not really sure if
that's<00:00:43.040> how<00:00:43.130> it's<00:00:43.280> pronounced<00:00:43.580> but<00:00:43.790> anyway

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
that's how it's pronounced but anyway

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.350 
that's how it's pronounced but anyway
this<00:00:44.630> is<00:00:44.690> just<00:00:44.810> a<00:00:45.110> black<00:00:45.530> thin<00:00:46.010> low<00:00:46.430> profile

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
this is just a black thin low profile

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.770 
this is just a black thin low profile
case<00:00:47.780> I<00:00:48.350> usually<00:00:49.160> prefer<00:00:49.310> the<00:00:49.610> thin<00:00:50.120> ones<00:00:50.420> that

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
case I usually prefer the thin ones that

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.210 
case I usually prefer the thin ones that
don't<00:00:50.990> add<00:00:51.200> too<00:00:51.350> much<00:00:51.470> bulk<00:00:51.680> to<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:51.920> device

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
don't add too much bulk to the device

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.040 
don't add too much bulk to the device
and<00:00:52.820> there's<00:00:52.940> no<00:00:53.000> not<00:00:53.180> too<00:00:53.300> much<00:00:53.330> to<00:00:53.630> this<00:00:53.780> case

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
and there's no not too much to this case

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.230 
and there's no not too much to this case
but<00:00:54.440> if<00:00:54.950> you<00:00:55.040> guys<00:00:55.130> are<00:00:55.280> interested<00:00:55.490> I'll<00:00:56.060> be

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
using currently it's my imogen but I'll

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.060 
using currently it's my imogen but I'll
often<00:01:50.479> switch<00:01:50.750> between<00:01:50.930> that<00:01:51.260> and<00:01:51.470> moonshine

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
often switch between that and moonshine

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.950 
often switch between that and moonshine
you<00:01:52.310> should<00:01:52.490> definitely<00:01:52.850> check<00:01:52.909> out<00:01:53.119> both<00:01:53.330> but

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
you should definitely check out both but

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.600 
you should definitely check out both but

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
as for now I'm gonna talk about my

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.399 
as for now I'm gonna talk about my
Energon<00:01:55.970> now<00:01:56.420> basically<00:01:56.630> this<00:01:56.960> is<00:01:57.110> just<00:01:57.140> a

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
Energon now basically this is just a

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.590 
Energon now basically this is just a
minimal<00:01:57.890> clean<00:01:58.190> icon<00:01:58.700> pack<00:01:58.970> there's<00:01:59.240> not<00:01:59.420> too

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
minimal clean icon pack there's not too

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.840 
minimal clean icon pack there's not too
much<00:01:59.720> to<00:01:59.780> it<00:02:00.020> it<00:02:00.500> doesn't<00:02:00.650> even<00:02:00.740> seem<00:02:01.670> that

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
much to it it doesn't even seem that

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.910 
much to it it doesn't even seem that
much<00:02:02.000> icons<00:02:02.570> but<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.350> ones<00:02:03.560> that<00:02:03.619> it<00:02:03.770> does

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
much icons but the ones that it does

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.380 
much icons but the ones that it does
they<00:02:04.250> look<00:02:04.400> great<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:04.790> I<00:02:04.970> definitely

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
they look great and I definitely

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.660 
they look great and I definitely
recommend<00:02:05.600> you<00:02:05.780> to<00:02:05.810> try<00:02:05.960> this<00:02:06.049> out<00:02:06.350> so

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
recommend you to try this out so

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.190 
recommend you to try this out so
basically<00:02:07.670> it's<00:02:07.939> compatible<00:02:08.239> with<00:02:08.450> Apex

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
basically it's compatible with Apex

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.030 
basically it's compatible with Apex
Nova<00:02:10.390> action<00:02:11.439> just<00:02:12.439> pretty<00:02:12.680> much<00:02:12.799> every

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
Nova action just pretty much every

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.890 
Nova action just pretty much every
launcher<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.459> can<00:02:13.580> think<00:02:13.819> of<00:02:13.970> just<00:02:14.750> go<00:02:14.840> ahead

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
launcher you can think of just go ahead

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.660 
launcher you can think of just go ahead
and<00:02:15.170> try<00:02:15.319> it<00:02:15.349> out<00:02:15.500> with<00:02:15.560> your<00:02:15.769> launcher<00:02:16.159> and<00:02:16.340> it

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
and try it out with your launcher and it

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.330 
and try it out with your launcher and it
should<00:02:16.819> be<00:02:16.909> compatible<00:02:18.010> alright<00:02:19.010> so<00:02:19.130> getting

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
should be compatible alright so getting

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.400 
should be compatible alright so getting
to<00:02:19.490> my<00:02:19.580> home<00:02:19.790> screen<00:02:20.000> I<00:02:20.300> have<00:02:20.540> a<00:02:20.720> widget<00:02:20.990> called

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
minimal clock and there's really not

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.740
