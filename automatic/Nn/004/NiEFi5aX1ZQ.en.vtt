00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.090
 we are not well motivated by the tricks 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.770
 that we carry and we know that we are going to 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.890
 try a favors song has not 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.990
 lost that is spoken that in 14 games 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.050
 they have not lost yet but we are going 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.359
 going to make an intelligent game and 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.910
 take out the three points of visit we 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.710
 we want to continue for the perfect step 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.679
 we know we have to take out the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.840
 points we can now on these dates 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.629
 because they follow the commitment of the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.690
 liberators cup but we are 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.820
 working day by day with everything and first 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.379
 God 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.629
 we are the adaptation of the players that 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.820
 we were already around to those who 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.190
 they just arrived they arrived very well and 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.430
 As I tell you, we work every day to 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.649
 be there in the eleven that you put tomÃ¡s 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.949
 and whoever puts it has done it very 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.010
 well and we hope to continue like this we carry 22 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.870
 triumphs and us because we 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.510
 we want to fill all the matches and if 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.470
 you can so we will try to 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.210
 do it but we know that in this tournament 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.520
 everything can happen in the matches all 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.200
 it can happen there are ups and downs but 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.000
 we now arrive the two parties 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:24.300
 cattle does not matter it will go there in the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.700
 first places for us and if it will be 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.630
 so welcome be like us 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.430
 we go with the mentality as I said to 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.030
 to play is to make a good match and 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.350
 bring us the three points do not lose 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.150
 then everything to make a good atmosphere 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.730
 that you live here the players who have 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.190
 come players that we are before the 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.920
 technical body that has taken us very 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.350
 well and I say it's the base 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.910
 of success my last team I 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.760
 then hygiene was done 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.860
 supported my last last train as it says 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.350
 not the same then because I already thought about 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.170
 play animals or do something 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.229
 but God did me very well there if I did not 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.259
 purchase that would say that atlas the challenge of a 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.860
 much better level here that I have for 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:14.580
 I feel more mature having passed 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.160
 by all previous teams equal 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.380

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.330

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.350
 player 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.440
 the players who have arrived is the base 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.209
 of success and apart the technician what we 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.620

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.580
