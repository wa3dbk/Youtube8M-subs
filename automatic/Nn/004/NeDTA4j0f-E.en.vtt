ever changing and technology is
certainly<00:00:11.730> prevalent<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.360> important<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:13.080> the

certainly prevalent and important in the
early<00:00:13.530> learning<00:00:13.650> environment<00:00:14.309> but<00:00:14.400> sometimes

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
early learning environment but sometimes

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.269 
early learning environment but sometimes
it's<00:00:15.000> great<00:00:15.090> just<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.420> get<00:00:15.599> back<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:16.020> basics

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
it's great just to get back to basics

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.529 
it's great just to get back to basics
when<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.310> was<00:00:17.640> young<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.119> when<00:00:18.390> my<00:00:18.510> parents

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
when I was young and when my parents

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.260 
when I was young and when my parents
were<00:00:19.199> young<00:00:19.350> we<00:00:19.650> played<00:00:19.949> with<00:00:20.250> telephone<00:00:20.940> cups

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
were young we played with telephone cups

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.910 
were young we played with telephone cups
for<00:00:22.170> those<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.560> who<00:00:22.710> aren't<00:00:22.830> familiar

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
for those of you who aren't familiar

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.290 
for those of you who aren't familiar
with<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:23.970> it's<00:00:24.180> just<00:00:24.359> simply<00:00:24.529> two<00:00:25.529> cups

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
with that it's just simply two cups

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.589 
with that it's just simply two cups
attached<00:00:27.300> with<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:28.080> string<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.939> it's<00:00:30.269> really<00:00:30.570> a

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
attached with a string and it's really a

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.160 
attached with a string and it's really a
lot<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.840> fun<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.439> works<00:00:32.239> so<00:00:33.239> your<00:00:33.840> supplies

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
lot of fun and it works so your supplies

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.270 
lot of fun and it works so your supplies
are<00:00:34.320> very<00:00:34.350> minimal<00:00:34.649> these<00:00:34.980> are<00:00:35.130> just

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
are very minimal these are just

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.709 
are very minimal these are just
styrofoam<00:00:35.700> cups<00:00:35.940> they<00:00:36.090> come<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.420> smaller

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
styrofoam cups they come in a smaller

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.240 
styrofoam cups they come in a smaller
size<00:00:37.020> which<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.500> probably<00:00:37.770> better<00:00:37.860> than<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
size which is probably better than the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.180 
size which is probably better than the
these<00:00:38.670> larger<00:00:39.090> size<00:00:39.620> but<00:00:40.620> we<00:00:40.710> had<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.950> remain

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
these larger size but we had to remain

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.709 
these larger size but we had to remain
these<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.550> decorated<00:00:42.059> these<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.420> children

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
these and decorated these the children

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.350 
these and decorated these the children
would<00:00:42.809> just<00:00:42.960> each<00:00:43.140> get<00:00:43.460> two<00:00:44.460> cups<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.090> they

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
would just each get two cups and they

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.520 
would just each get two cups and they
would<00:00:45.480> decorate<00:00:45.660> them<00:00:45.899> however<00:00:46.050> they<00:00:46.200> want

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
would decorate them however they want

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.119 
would decorate them however they want
and<00:00:46.950> then<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:48.570> would<00:00:48.930> punch<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.260> hole<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.800> small

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
and then you would punch a hole a small

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.400 
and then you would punch a hole a small
hole<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.300> top<00:00:51.480> or<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.899> backs<00:00:52.200> of<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
hole on the top or the backs of the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.200 
hole on the top or the backs of the
bottoms<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.920> cup<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.340> then<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.059> would

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
bottoms of the cup and then you would

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.819 
bottoms of the cup and then you would
attach<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.750> string<00:00:55.020> or<00:00:55.289> put<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> string<00:00:55.800> through

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
attach a string or put a string through

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.819 
attach a string or put a string through
each<00:00:56.370> one<00:00:56.640> knot<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.050> then<00:00:58.170> pull<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.559> so

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
each one knot it and then pull it so

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.099 
each one knot it and then pull it so
it's<00:00:59.070> tight<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.640> snug<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.899> would<00:01:00.989> do

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
it's tight and snug and you would do

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.709 
it's tight and snug and you would do
that<00:01:01.320> with<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> other<00:01:02.070> end<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.760> your<00:01:02.850> cup<00:01:03.449> and

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
that with the other end of your cup and

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.859 
that with the other end of your cup and
string<00:01:04.440> so<00:01:04.800> you<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:05.009> to<00:01:05.220> top<00:01:05.489> cups<00:01:05.940> attached

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
string so you have to top cups attached

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.980 
string so you have to top cups attached
with<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.500> string<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.070> how<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.400> works<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:09.090> one

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
with a string and how this works is one

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.130 
with a string and how this works is one
child<00:01:10.320> would<00:01:10.680> have<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:11.159> cup<00:01:11.369> here<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.140> the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
child would have a cup here and the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.320 
child would have a cup here and the
other<00:01:13.290> one<00:01:13.530> would<00:01:13.860> talk<00:01:14.130> into<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.909> cup<00:01:15.119> but

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
other one would talk into the cup but

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.090 
other one would talk into the cup but
you<00:01:15.479> want<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.750> make<00:01:15.900> sure<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.409> string<00:01:16.770> is

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
you want to make sure that the string is

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.770 
you want to make sure that the string is
pulled<00:01:17.520> tight<00:01:17.700> because<00:01:18.090> that's<00:01:18.390> what<00:01:18.600> makes

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
pulled tight because that's what makes

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.050 
pulled tight because that's what makes
