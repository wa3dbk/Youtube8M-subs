00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.940
 Y 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.940
 ah 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:15.160
 hello friends of android sis welcome to 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:19.000
 a new video of the channel in which today 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:23.080
 I will teach you how to make a copy 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.740
 of folder security to fs the 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.840
 binder 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.360
 fs is a folder 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:35.090
 internal of our terminal in our 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:38.210
 mobile phone which contains all 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.559
 the data referring to the telephone and are 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.020
 very important as email by 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.989
 example in sometimes in the process of 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:48.050
 phrasing of cooked bouquets can be 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.360
 get to lose this folder reaching 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.949
 lose the data of the phone being 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.920
 unusable to make calls 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:01:00.079
 telephone for example 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:03.579
 we have the folder fs in the root of 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.579
 files from our phone 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.989
 here you can see 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.740
 is a folder that contains all these 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.740
 files an android folder 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.150
 do the ptm and a folder the smart ones 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.400
 phones and other loose files 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.440
 all these files are the ones 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.890
 they contain data like the imei of our 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.120
 phone 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.400
 to copy it we will need a 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:36.540
 root file browser type 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.390
 explorer or that explorer or for example the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.580
 solideo explorer I will use the robot 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.800
 explorer we will open those of explorer 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.990
 whenever we open the first time we 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.170
 superuser permissions will ask you 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.520
 we'll say ok and we can go 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.050
 what we want, we have to have 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.510
 careful because it depends on what 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.210
 touch or erase is deleted 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.220
 permanently of the phone being able 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.310
 get to block the phone so 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.960
 I usually do things that you know between the 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.850
 no doubt 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.850
 If you do not know what a folder is, 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.819
 work well at the root of the phone that 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.880
 there is that symbol here this symbol of 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.980
 here 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.480
 with the bar we see that the folder is 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.610
 fs 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.940
 to do it with possibility only 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.940
 we have to catch hold and 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.720
 and tell him not the copies 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.230
 we will stick it for example on the sd card 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.900
 we already have the backup of the 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.850
 binder 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:56.420
 fs done simply by dialing 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.790
 about fs tell him to copy already the route that 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.900
 we want 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.239
 that nothing copies 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.989
 here we have the fs folder copied 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.989
 perfectly 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.060
 this folder 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.500
 It would be essential apart from having the 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.480
 copy of our phone on the card 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.810
 of memory for example external or internal 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.700
 which we want would be essential and 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.070
 copy in a safe place like 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.310
 computer or our pendrive or a 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:31.840
 pendrive hard drive because this folder 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.990
 can save us from the odd 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.810
 problem if we are fans to install 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.300
 or cooked lately are in 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.610
 many branches cooked on base and cs and 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.620
 especially jelly bean that during the 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.900
 flash process eo they get to lose 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.040
 the data now in another tutorial os 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.700
 I will teach the correct way to restore 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.700
 said folder 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.080
 so that our phone works like 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.080
 It's due 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.010
 let's go to the phone settings 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.049
 we will have to do this every time 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.200
 we will be a kitchen to go to the settings 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:18.609
 of the phone and 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.380
 in state 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:24.070
 check 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.830
 what comes out 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.560
 email and data for 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.350
 our phone well that's all for 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.200
 today in a new tutorial as I have 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.810
 said before I will teach you how to make a 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.180
 restoration of the folder of fs of a 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.720
 correct way 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.720
 but 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.940
 Y 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.940
