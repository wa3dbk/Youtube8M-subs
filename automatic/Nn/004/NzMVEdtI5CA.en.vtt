 based on yogurt 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.300
 therefore we propose a new for 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.820

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.759
 very free in terms of quantity in 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.130
 based on how many rolls you want to base 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.619
 how much yogurt there is 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.139
 advanced by a first preparation 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.600
 let's start with the preparation we remove the 

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:28.729
 end parts of zucchini cut 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.529
 with the mandolina of the thin slices 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.049
 so that then they can 

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:35.229
 anyway, easily roll it up 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:38.389
 this is the thickness of the courgette 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:41.149
 we take the juice from the two lemons with lo 

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:43.909
 juicer let the juice marinate 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.429
 lemon and zucchini this actually 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.369
 an optional operation and you can too 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.139
 not making it marinade is used for 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.090
 make the most tasty without doubt 

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:59.689
 zucchini to make them softer and 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:00.289
 three are easily malleable 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.159
 hours 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:06.649
 we can drain the zucchini 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.630
 here we dry the pitted liquid 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.820
 marinating and we are ready for the 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.120
 preparation of rolls give a little 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.360
 of garlic powder 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.330
 dried freedom we spread the yogurt on 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.980
 every single slice of courgette 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.040
 then add a sprinkling of 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.560
 oregano and dried garlic then 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.470
 lay a little rocket on top or 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.739
 rocket maybe we put one in the middle 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.430
 so in such a way that it comes out of the 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:38.280
 roll and see roll up here 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.650
