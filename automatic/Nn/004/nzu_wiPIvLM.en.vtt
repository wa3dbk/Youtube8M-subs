jeweled butterfly cookie I'm starting

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.520 
jeweled butterfly cookie I'm starting
off<00:00:07.350> by<00:00:07.620> adding<00:00:07.890> some<00:00:08.670> runny<00:00:09.480> royal<00:00:09.900> icing<00:00:10.110> to

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
off by adding some runny royal icing to

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.560 
off by adding some runny royal icing to
the<00:00:10.650> surface<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.219> my<00:00:11.400> cookies<00:00:11.849> so<00:00:12.059> that<00:00:12.300> when<00:00:12.540> I

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
the surface of my cookies so that when I

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.550 
the surface of my cookies so that when I
spray<00:00:13.259> on<00:00:13.530> my<00:00:14.370> template<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.269> will<00:00:15.750> be<00:00:15.990> visible

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
spray on my template it will be visible

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.950 
spray on my template it will be visible
if<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:17.010> spray<00:00:17.520> right<00:00:17.730> on<00:00:17.789> this<00:00:18.180> brown<00:00:18.449> cookie<00:00:18.930> I

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
if I spray right on this brown cookie I

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.170 
if I spray right on this brown cookie I
might<00:00:19.350> not<00:00:19.529> be<00:00:19.680> able<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.920> see<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.640> so<00:00:20.699> that

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
might not be able to see it and so that

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.689 
might not be able to see it and so that
is<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.630> reason<00:00:21.840> for<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.590> therefore<00:00:23.369> it

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
is the reason for this and therefore it

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.650 
is the reason for this and therefore it
is<00:00:24.000> optional<00:00:25.430> you<00:00:26.430> can<00:00:26.609> add<00:00:26.849> your<00:00:27.090> guidelines

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
is optional you can add your guidelines

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.290 
is optional you can add your guidelines
whichever<00:00:28.560> way<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.859> prefer<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.699> find<00:00:30.119> that

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
whichever way you prefer I find that

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.840 
whichever way you prefer I find that
this<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.720> fastest<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.830> most<00:00:31.859> consistent

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
this is the fastest and most consistent

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.090 
this is the fastest and most consistent
way<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.719> add<00:00:33.899> your<00:00:34.260> guidelines<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
way to add your guidelines to the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.680 
way to add your guidelines to the
surface<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.730> cookie<00:00:35.880> I've<00:00:36.149> trapped<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
surface of the cookie I've trapped the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.569 
surface of the cookie I've trapped the
paper<00:00:36.899> template<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.530> between<00:00:37.920> two<00:00:38.160> pieces<00:00:38.399> of

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
paper template in between two pieces of

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.560 
paper template in between two pieces of
mesh<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.180> I'm<00:00:39.360> airbrushing<00:00:40.079> it

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.380 

you<00:00:44.230> can<00:00:44.470> see<00:00:44.770> my<00:00:45.070> guidelines<00:00:45.700> and<00:00:45.970> I'm<00:00:46.120> able

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
you can see my guidelines and I'm able

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.930 
you can see my guidelines and I'm able
to<00:00:46.630> come<00:00:46.810> in<00:00:46.930> with<00:00:47.079> my<00:00:47.230> royal<00:00:47.530> icing<00:00:47.710> and<00:00:48.220> draw

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
to come in with my royal icing and draw

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:58.380 
to come in with my royal icing and draw
on<00:00:49.210> the<00:00:49.620> gold<00:00:50.620> lines<00:00:51.160> of<00:00:51.670> my<00:00:51.970> butterfly<00:00:57.390> I'm

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
on the gold lines of my butterfly I'm

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.210 
on the gold lines of my butterfly I'm
using<00:00:58.690> a<00:00:58.960> larger<00:00:59.350> tip<00:00:59.590> than<00:00:59.800> I<00:00:59.890> would<00:01:00.190> normally

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
using a larger tip than I would normally

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.119 
using a larger tip than I would normally
this<00:01:00.850> is<00:01:01.030> a<00:01:01.059> number<00:01:01.449> three<00:01:01.780> I<00:01:01.960> want<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:02.920> line

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
this is a number three I want the line

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.130 
this is a number three I want the line
to<00:01:03.160> be<00:01:03.460> visible<00:01:03.879> after<00:01:04.150> the<00:01:04.449> sections<00:01:04.930> are

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
to be visible after the sections are

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.960 
to be visible after the sections are
flooded<00:01:05.530> and<00:01:05.680> that's<00:01:05.890> why<00:01:06.220> I'm<00:01:06.369> using<00:01:06.490> such<00:01:06.940> a

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
flooded and that's why I'm using such a

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:25.880 
flooded and that's why I'm using such a
large<00:01:07.360> piping<00:01:07.900> tip

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890

once you're done this step let the lines

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.340 
once you're done this step let the lines
dry<00:01:29.619> for<00:01:30.070> a<00:01:30.130> little<00:01:30.369> bit
