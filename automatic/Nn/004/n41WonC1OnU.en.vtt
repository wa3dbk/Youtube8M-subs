00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:12.420
 service dogs land at the police 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.160
 the model essentially has that 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.170
 and have organized that around us 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.060
 at least one working dog at a time 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.680
 Service area available that was 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.270
 previously not the case because it was a 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.090
 randomly leave to what extent a 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.330
 service dog handler and a working dog 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.800
 was available for operational situations 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.939
 our model includes that 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.830
 colleagues themselves a roster 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.079
 set out from their layers 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.309
 that we have at least one dog around 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.350
 the clock is available 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.910
 special occasions also several dogs what 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.489
 then planned on an ad hoc basis and 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.989
 this means of use thereby also one 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.180
 corresponding value get that 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.780
 success model until is now successive 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.879
 transferred to all hesse yes there was 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.230
 working groups at the state level too 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.680
 have found that it is inefficient 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.050
 is how to handle the dog handlers and the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.879
 that is called that 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.770
 Has left to chance whether an animal in the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.129
 service is or a miracle leader with 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.610
 his team and as you try longer 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.250
 whole 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.710
 go there so that the 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.460
 value around the clock also for 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.350
 available 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.780
 The dogs will be for the inserts 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.400
 playfully trained that's easy 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.960
 technical exercise parts the the 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.790
 submission exam includes 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.850
 Of course, this includes sitting in the seat 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.710
 or sit down overcome by 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.660
 Obstacles in the case of the old 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.310
 test order hop the claims 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.930
 the obstacle stops 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.280
 The dog handler picks up the two 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.729
 go together the foundation and 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.050
 continue to defend the dogs in 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.960
 Extreme situations also lord in her 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.790
 In this case, dog handler bjÃ¶rn eggert as 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.979
 that's called a raid 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.030
 that's what he means and is stopped 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.700
 to thwart a raid 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.229
 It will be an attack on the dog for 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.170
 carried out by the helper respectively 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.830
 with stock and that's from and itself 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.810
 to thwart 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.630
 the situations are in real use 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.899
 always different than on the practice area 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.130
 Therefore, different scenarios 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.960
 trained yes the dog was so completely 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.040
 surprised because actually should the 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.600
 raid from the other side 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.040
 that means yes in the moment 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.780
 actually the number 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.989
 and he already has the attack 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.680
 urgently thwarted the three 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.239
 The stockpiles received the 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.830
 belong to examining order with the 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.840
 pattern and endure can stop 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.190
 sign goes out puts off the 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.030
 The perpetrator is searched disarmed 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.519
 arrested 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.459
 the solinger wise, he then runs away the 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.660
 dog is sent back almost to 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.370
 and he is arrested 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.470
 that 's it between dog and leader 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.380
 must build a relationship of trust 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.390
 So will I have the dog now you 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.770
 I have to think twice for two years 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.960
 been in the game for two years 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.480
 about one and a half bit older 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.440
 about three quarters and then have 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.300
 approximately 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.350
 I'll say that for four to five months 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.320
 that trains to check out 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.420
 so did not introduce daily 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.230
 but I'd say so twice three times 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.940
 week in any case 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.800
 the animals are next to their service 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.110
 use in the family life of 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.270
 dog handlers integrated and the dogs 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.430
 Can be between service and privacy 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.560
 So distinguish where then the dog that 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.100
 Even the mountain is the route 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.810
 he has time forcing his retreat 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.780
 the service very alternately in the 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.400
 vehicle is also on the way in the kennel 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.810
 is many kennels at home will be 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.820
 more taken care of so there I am 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.230
 quite often at the first ever 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.340
 when I travel with the family 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.630
 that means the other one 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.600
 Family members recognize it simply 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.750
 as rudel members on 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.460
 and then he just realizes that he wants it 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.960
 none of the opposite to one 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.490
 leckerli his pats and 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.930
 I think he did that then you realize 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.450
 that at home is a kind 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.140
 editor Michael Wasielewski has courage 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.140
 demonstrated 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:46.330
 she grazed the by some and 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.330
 got the power of the dog to feel 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.850
 allofs we are a little scared 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.080
 taken or increased I know that 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.060
 we do not really have to 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.040
 the same question again just goes only 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.330
 that's why we talk like the blind of the 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.860
 color if you do not have such a thing yourself 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.570
 then she did very quickly 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.180
 noted falco with its 50 kilo 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.260
 works so well against but that has 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.910
 I'm sure of both 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.500
 hold on and therefore was the matter 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.150
 is now in the dirt lingen 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.610
 you have to do a little bit with the dog 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.680
 play and then he succeeds us 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.100
 gets in the result his prey and 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.100
 first at
