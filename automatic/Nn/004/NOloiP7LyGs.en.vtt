the buttons over here okay before
proceeding<00:01:41.280> further<00:01:41.460> we<00:01:42.090> need<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.020> drive<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
proceeding further we need to drive the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.100 
proceeding further we need to drive the
car<00:01:43.770> taking<00:01:44.399> all<00:01:44.579> safety<00:01:45.090> precautions<00:01:45.630> into

car taking all safety precautions into
consideration<00:01:46.829> we<00:01:47.549> should<00:01:47.939> put<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.329> seat

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
consideration we should put the seat

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.690 
consideration we should put the seat
belt<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:48.930> whenever<00:01:49.259> we<00:01:49.560> drive<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.130> we<00:01:50.520> should

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
belt on whenever we drive and we should

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.460 
belt on whenever we drive and we should
also<00:01:50.880> consider<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.810> safety<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
also consider the safety of the

users so we will now drive the car and
we<00:01:59.250> will<00:01:59.340> see<00:01:59.549> how<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.939> cruise<00:02:00.299> control<00:02:00.420> works

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
we will see how the cruise control works

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.260 
we will see how the cruise control works
slot<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.070> car<00:02:02.250> into<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.520> first<00:02:02.850> gear<00:02:03.119> and
