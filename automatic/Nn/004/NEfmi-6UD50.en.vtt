00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.520
 ideas initiative mexico 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.899
 free and ecological lighting for all homes in Mexico 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.179
 how will you understand that this activity becomes a project 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:12.699
 is because of the following 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.269
 we currently have incandescent doping 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.919
 this 60 watts 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:20.149
 is the most common that are used since we have energy-saving lamps 

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:21.400
 Energy 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.739
 For example, 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:24.630
 this is 23 watts 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.730
 they are energy saving lamps 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.730
 59 in wind texts lamps 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.110
 this lamp in turn the three in total give us only 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.380
 points 6 4 with this we achieve 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.550
 illumination 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.200
 vie a room 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.430
 that we wanted our current installation is powered by commission 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.430
 federal electricity I will continue this follow 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.410
 we want it is an alternate installation this is an example still not 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.989
 It is also made as an example here we can observe lamps 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.950
 are would be controlled with the operators the new installation here 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.440
 we can see it 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.200
 we have everything to do these two beautiful because we would do a 2 3 for 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.040
 given room total because only with water to feed 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.360
 a room 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.810
 led lamps 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.200
 the entire installation would be powered by batteries 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.610
 clear here we are losing the cable 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.810
 nothing will have to be done 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.860
 well done installation here we can observe 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.350
 that are affecting this is a battery carlos this charger 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.740
 there are better batteries 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.580
 of nickel-cadmium 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.930
 what to wear this stuff is rechargeable and like the canary 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.470
 comfortable paqui 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.760
 we have letters 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.410
 how is this that is an example 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.630
 this only three votes 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.800
 three to five votes is what we're going to have to place several of these with 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.939
 this end is of those that part of the sun rather an envelope with its energy the 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.670
 sun to be able to charge the battery 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.390
 others with the air with the air we would have to go install also in 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.399
 the generators here we can observe one 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:19.079
 you can build up homemade here we post an example 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:20.189
 here we have 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.189
 for example here are the magnets copper coils 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:26.389
 the magnets or had opinion 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:27.959
 some blades 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.859
 fastened on this plate with a mussel environments as it would be here we see 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.089
 We put magnets on a set 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:36.529
 coil manufacturing 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:40.089
 the placement of the coils and finally we would have a wind turbine 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:42.589
 cassez like this 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:45.859
 with these two in my ideas air tyson 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:50.669
 we can achieve the lighting of our homes and get this idea 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:54.580
 free and ecological lighting for all homes in mexico 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.599
 become 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:57.150
 Thank you
