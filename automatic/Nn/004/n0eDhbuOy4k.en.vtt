00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750 

I<00:00:00.149> believe<00:00:00.659> that<00:00:00.780> success<00:00:01.020> is<00:00:01.589> in<00:00:02.220> one<00:00:02.520> sense

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
I believe that success is in one sense

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.910 
I believe that success is in one sense
of<00:00:03.000> mindset<00:00:03.510> and<00:00:03.689> I<00:00:03.899> do<00:00:03.959> believe<00:00:04.350> that<00:00:04.529> anyone

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
of mindset and I do believe that anyone

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.820 
of mindset and I do believe that anyone
can<00:00:05.580> develop<00:00:05.759> it<00:00:06.180> but<00:00:06.660> I<00:00:06.720> also<00:00:06.870> believe<00:00:07.319> that

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
can develop it but I also believe that

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.459 
can develop it but I also believe that
success<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.730> just<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.300> natural<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:10.019> result

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
success is just the natural and result

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.950 
success is just the natural and result
of<00:00:10.800> sharing<00:00:11.340> your<00:00:11.639> gift<00:00:11.910> with<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.210> world<00:00:12.360> and

be successful how can I tap into my
inner<00:00:19.020> drive<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.160> be<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.340> success<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.180> really

what it comes down to is starting with a

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.120

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
interested in developing the actual

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.100 
interested in developing the actual
components<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.210> computer<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.750> it's<00:01:45.899> grown

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
components of the computer so it's grown

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.380 
components of the computer so it's grown
into<00:01:46.259> quite<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.890> field<00:01:47.250> but<00:01:47.759> my<00:01:47.909> father's<00:01:48.240> idea

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
into quite a field but my father's idea

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.609 
into quite a field but my father's idea
for<00:01:48.720> me<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.930> was<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.140> major<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.500> business

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
for me it was to major in business

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.770 
for me it was to major in business
because<00:01:50.130> that's<00:01:50.310> where<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.610> money<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.180> to

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
because that's where the money is and to

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.690 
because that's where the money is and to
minor<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.200> computers<00:01:52.680> because<00:01:53.070> computers<00:01:53.640> are

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
minor in computers because computers are

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.370 
minor in computers because computers are
becoming<00:01:53.970> big<00:01:54.240> well<00:01:54.450> he<00:01:54.570> was<00:01:54.720> he<00:01:55.079> was<00:01:55.200> right

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
becoming big well he was he was right

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.770 
becoming big well he was he was right
about<00:01:55.560> all<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.369> sense<00:01:56.759> but<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.719> the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
about all of that in a sense but in the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.310 
about all of that in a sense but in the
sense<00:01:57.869> he<00:01:58.530> missed<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.829> mark<00:01:59.009> because

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
sense he missed the mark because

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.719 
sense he missed the mark because
anything<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.770> go<00:02:01.950> into<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.640> you're

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
touch with that so for me when I started

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.490 
touch with that so for me when I started
at<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.069> University<00:02:49.519> of<00:02:49.579> Florida<00:02:49.730> I<00:02:50.500> majored

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
at the University of Florida I majored

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.379 
at the University of Florida I majored
in<00:02:51.590> psychology<00:02:51.650> that<00:02:52.400> was<00:02:52.909> it<00:02:53.060> I<00:02:53.180> later

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:53.389 
in psychology that was it I later

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.539 
in psychology that was it I later
switched<00:02:53.840> as<00:02:54.139> I<00:02:54.349> got<00:02:54.560> into<00:02:54.769> my<00:02:54.889> graduate<00:02:55.340> years

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
switched as I got into my graduate years

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.309 
switched as I got into my graduate years
I<00:02:55.639> switched<00:02:55.909> to<00:02:56.030> education<00:02:56.659> because<00:02:57.109> I

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
I switched to education because I

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.409 
I switched to education because I
realized<00:02:57.709> that<00:02:57.769> I<00:02:57.859> was<00:02:57.980> teaching<00:02:58.189> more<00:02:59.030> I<00:02:59.090> was

00:02:59.409 --> 00:02:59.419 
realized that I was teaching more I was

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:03.220 
realized that I was teaching more I was
spreading<00:02:59.810> what<00:03:00.200> I<00:03:00.230> wanted<00:03:00.799> to<00:03:01.540> share<00:03:02.540> more

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
spreading what I wanted to share more

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.530 
spreading what I wanted to share more
with<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.650> world<00:03:03.889> rather<00:03:04.430> than<00:03:04.700> focusing<00:03:05.480> on

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
with the world rather than focusing on

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.629 
with the world rather than focusing on
one-on-one<00:03:06.109> clients<00:03:06.889> I<00:03:06.980> was<00:03:07.069> focusing<00:03:07.489> on

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:07.639 
one-on-one clients I was focusing on

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:09.399 
one-on-one clients I was focusing on
training<00:03:07.939> large<00:03:08.329> groups<00:03:08.629> of<00:03:08.780> people<00:03:08.840> so

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
training large groups of people so

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.470 
training large groups of people so
education<00:03:10.340> became<00:03:10.579> more<00:03:10.790> important<00:03:11.299> so<00:03:11.419> I

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
education became more important so I

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.960 
education became more important so I
understand<00:03:11.930> how<00:03:12.049> to<00:03:12.109> educate<00:03:12.680> people<00:03:12.859> how<00:03:13.489> how

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
understand how to educate people how how

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.149 
understand how to educate people how how
they<00:03:14.239> could<00:03:14.540> be<00:03:14.629> the<00:03:14.780> next<00:03:15.019> generation<00:03:15.159> to

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 
they could be the next generation to

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.979 
they could be the next generation to
share<00:03:16.400> this<00:03:16.549> information<00:03:16.879> but<00:03:17.810> it<00:03:17.900> all

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
share this information but it all

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.469 
share this information but it all
started<00:03:18.440> with<00:03:18.590> me<00:03:18.859> really<00:03:19.549> getting<00:03:19.819> clear<00:03:20.150> and

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:20.479 
started with me really getting clear and

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:22.119 
started with me really getting clear and
luckily<00:03:20.959> for<00:03:21.199> me<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.379> was<00:03:21.590> able<00:03:21.680> to<00:03:21.799> get<00:03:21.949> clear

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
luckily for me I was able to get clear

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:23.259 
luckily for me I was able to get clear
in<00:03:22.220> high<00:03:22.370> school<00:03:22.669> because<00:03:22.940> I<00:03:22.970> started

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
in high school because I started

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.000 
in high school because I started
hypnotizing<00:03:23.840> people<00:03:23.870> in<00:03:24.139> high<00:03:24.229> school<00:03:24.530> and<00:03:24.949> I

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
hypnotizing people in high school and I

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.140
