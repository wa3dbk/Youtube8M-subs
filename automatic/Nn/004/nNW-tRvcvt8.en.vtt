00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.360
 indeed first a disadvantage but you 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.820
 so I have those powers 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.060
 but that heavy of it 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.990

 heidi what the coop give you things soon became mental they have 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.790
 giving a children's number is also good in addition to that 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:13.499
 both can continue immediately 

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:17.449
 even though tough no I have not yet made black horses from stable black for us 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:22.059

 this other side has the other side 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.089
 I'm going this way 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:50.159
 look at four on the Danish pride there it is getting dark 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.669
 and then we really have one 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:56.199
 that already part of your arms need stuff also yes 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:02.419
 look around us or we don't see 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:04.489
 to that 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:05.949
 a 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:08.919
 i know there is like in the mountains 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:11.429
 there are also houses 

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:12.899
 but a bit heavy 

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:15.899
 for this there is in these more courses in pieces the eu 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.989
 what are you 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.469
 she the art 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.149
 center the quest 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:26.919
 volkel and 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.919
 and i lay dying champions in his hero 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.980
 after the party in the en plein so that is not the case all flairs 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.979
 are very many complaints or problems 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:41.609
 the quiet ones that still use it well we have what for 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:45.249
 he armor 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.239
 I see two names because I am there 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.269
 yes 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.579
 one in two names meant arcore 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.059
 so go with which again 

00:03:57.059 --> 00:04:00.339
 I'm in the house with that on 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:01.659
 by 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:03.919
 if ever I have top melo 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.730
 winning is the altar 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.359
 worth the fair 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:09.939
 I have no black where are they then 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:11.659
 watch name 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.039
 at the facts but where to 

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:16.099
 got there 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:18.840
 that way, say, come and the Quran 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.379
 seat that he look when you look there look I see that name thinks there 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:24.960
 yes yes i see you but yes there 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.850
 yes but one away 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.259
 the black comedy watching the second set says she decides three 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:34.259
 it's the fourth 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.789
 the alphense kopecky look is something not both two 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:41.949
 but they try 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.240
 denimpex 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.630
 we are also going to do a whole lot because they saved the game rhythm from being woken up by being crushed 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.830
 both sides before the crash 6 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.469
 by this way but it was a correct result 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:54.650
 That is stupid 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.759
 because they both have to strike open when beware 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:00.580
 I had a black hole to hit yes 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.409
 of course to spend outside 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:09.129
 and so do you then also from Ukraine anp dear paul prorail 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:10.539
 utrecht is 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.020
 we are also about it we are attacking and the defender 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.199
 okay then we actually have to leave 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:17.409
 could now 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:20.409
 unless they suggest no the chef said more luck for sure 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.620
 of it is 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.330
 of course 4 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.279
 under the influence 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:32.279
 that's how it is 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:34.569
 the min 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:37.569
 nusport reports for the monastery church 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.279

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:44.259
 president 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:45.160
 I do not know 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.970
 be a piece I know you come less quickly that I saw I saw the ball 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.259
 still 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:54.129
 what a good fifteen minute set 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:56.319
 I taught him to go 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:57.330
 the pilots 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.800
 yes please keep it like 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.800
 to hear it 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:08.479
 v around the corner 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:13.639
 the young boy with his phone 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:17.389
 I found myself so flooded 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.900
 we are very visible x I saw it go 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:25.849

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.490
 arnesians breed with us 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.490
 your March a fine 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:41.870
 they are both festival 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:48.139
 they are both fit to be nice come true the group is already being rewarded 

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:49.729
 also 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:51.169
 10 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:55.259
 ethiopia is that has built up the kick but in a press release 

00:06:56.379 --> 00:07:00.219
 yes not me yet but they both stood with a boat but they stood there yes 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.810
 when turn up 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.499
 online can be the disadvantage is the chance of this episode very big 

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:08.580
 and w see that do the 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:14.199
 We are French as a team, and how does he think he is not a melvin and they do it together 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:18.669
 that means a rise to work there are the video links and then you can 

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:22.289
 look further and then you can see how donner grows responsibly 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:26.789
 and how they got it at a game, jaco is indeed a very 

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:28.110
 fast time
