00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
procedure that takes literally 15

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.330

minutes<00:01:04.250> or<00:01:04.790> less<00:01:05.059> from<00:01:05.600> start<00:01:05.900> to<00:01:06.049> finish<00:01:06.340> and

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
minutes or less from start to finish and

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.640 
minutes or less from start to finish and
so<00:01:07.670> most<00:01:07.850> patients<00:01:08.000> do<00:01:08.330> very<00:01:08.360> well<00:01:08.600> when<00:01:09.380> use

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
so most patients do very well when use

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.560 
so most patients do very well when use
eye<00:01:09.920> drops<00:01:10.040> to<00:01:10.549> numb<00:01:10.729> the<00:01:10.880> eyes<00:01:11.000> so<00:01:11.299> there<00:01:11.420> are

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
eye drops to numb the eyes so there are

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.410 
eye drops to numb the eyes so there are
no<00:01:11.930> needles<00:01:12.200> involved<00:01:12.799> the<00:01:13.310> procedure<00:01:13.939> in

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
no needles involved the procedure in

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.289
