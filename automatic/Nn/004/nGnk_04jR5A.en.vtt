00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.979 
dab of glue on the hole of the bead
you're<00:00:48.420> then<00:00:48.600> going<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.870> take<00:00:49.079> your<00:00:49.649> yarn<00:00:50.010> and

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
you're going to want to put a little bit

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.590 
you're going to want to put a little bit
of<00:01:03.960> glue<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:04.620> on<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> bottom<00:01:05.280> at<00:01:05.430> first<00:01:05.730> just

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
of glue just on the bottom at first just

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.090 
of glue just on the bottom at first just
so<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.080> can<00:01:07.320> make<00:01:07.620> sure<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:10.100> yarn

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
so that you can make sure that the yarn

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.190 
so that you can make sure that the yarn
doesn't<00:01:11.430> go<00:01:11.550> anywhere<00:01:11.960> you're<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.110> to

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
doesn't go anywhere you're going to

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.200 
doesn't go anywhere you're going to
start<00:01:13.500> wrapping<00:01:14.190> your<00:01:14.430> yarn<00:01:15.350> around<00:01:16.350> your

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
start wrapping your yarn around your

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:26.770 
start wrapping your yarn around your
bead<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.450> all<00:01:18.660> directions

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.330 

I<00:01:26.840> suggest<00:01:27.770> when<00:01:27.890> you're<00:01:28.010> first<00:01:28.190> starting

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
I suggest when you're first starting

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.070 
I suggest when you're first starting
when<00:01:28.909> you're<00:01:29.060> about<00:01:29.240> to<00:01:29.390> change<00:01:29.570> directions

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
when you're about to change directions

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.730 
when you're about to change directions
to<00:01:30.979> put<00:01:31.310> a<00:01:31.340> little<00:01:31.520> dab<00:01:31.820> of<00:01:31.880> hot<00:01:32.210> glue<00:01:32.500> it<00:01:33.500> helps

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
to put a little dab of hot glue it helps

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.749 
to put a little dab of hot glue it helps
just<00:01:36.740> at<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:36.979> beginning<00:01:37.070> you<00:01:37.369> don't<00:01:37.580> have<00:01:37.670> to

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
just at the beginning you don't have to

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:47.730 
just at the beginning you don't have to
do<00:01:37.850> it<00:01:37.970> later

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.039 

if<00:01:47.829> you<00:01:48.460> can<00:01:48.759> I<00:01:49.090> would<00:01:49.270> make<00:01:49.479> it<00:01:49.659> so<00:01:49.689> that<00:01:49.990> the

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
if you can I would make it so that the

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.380 
if you can I would make it so that the
ball<00:01:50.439> is<00:01:50.549> or<00:01:51.549> the<00:01:52.030> bead<00:01:52.210> is<00:01:52.420> at<00:01:52.570> least<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:54.610> the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
ball is or the bead is at least in the

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.060 
ball is or the bead is at least in the
same<00:01:55.570> color<00:01:55.869> family<00:01:55.960> as<00:01:56.439> your<00:01:56.619> yarn<00:01:56.799> just

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
same color family as your yarn just

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:05.730 
same color family as your yarn just
think<00:01:57.220> it's<00:01:57.430> pot<00:01:57.880> so<00:01:59.700> you<00:02:00.700> can<00:02:01.380> um<00:02:04.649> kind<00:02:05.649> of

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
think it's pot so you can um kind of

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.270 
think it's pot so you can um kind of
cover<00:02:06.009> it<00:02:06.189> up<00:02:06.310> easier<00:02:10.830> I'm<00:02:11.830> going<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.069> want<00:02:12.220> to

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
cover it up easier I'm going to want to

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.699 
cover it up easier I'm going to want to
keep<00:02:12.489> wrapping<00:02:12.910> it<00:02:13.030> around<00:02:13.060> until<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:14.349> starts

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
keep wrapping it around until it starts

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:32.240 
keep wrapping it around until it starts
looking<00:02:14.830> like<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.160> ball<00:02:15.430> of<00:02:15.459> yarn

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.400 

it<00:02:32.760> also<00:02:32.910> have<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.180> get<00:02:33.330> easier<00:02:33.510> once<00:02:33.930> you've

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:44.360 

gotten<00:02:37.410> past<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:39.380> bead<00:02:40.380> part<00:02:40.740> of<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:43.370> still

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
gotten past the bead part of it still

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.590 
gotten past the bead part of it still
going<00:02:44.520> on<00:02:44.580> her<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:45.030> put<00:02:45.210> a<00:02:45.240> little<00:02:45.510> dab<00:02:45.870> of<00:02:45.930> glue

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
going on her to put a little dab of glue

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.070 
going on her to put a little dab of glue
around<00:02:48.600> every<00:02:49.230> time<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.590> change<00:02:49.860> directions

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
around every time you change directions

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.750 
around every time you change directions
and<00:02:52.760> you're<00:02:53.760> going<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.240> want<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:55.760> start

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
and you're going to want to start

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.310 
and you're going to want to start
putting<00:02:57.060> them<00:02:57.420> closer<00:02:57.959> together<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:00.840> one<00:03:01.020> so

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
putting them closer together the one so

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:13.600 
putting them closer together the one so
that<00:03:01.470> can<00:03:01.770> kind<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:02.040> get<00:03:02.220> like<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.400> design

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.330 

yeah<00:03:14.210> that's<00:03:14.450> bit<00:03:14.660> that<00:03:14.810> much<00:03:15.050> but

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:30.240 

just<00:03:20.060> enough<00:03:20.390> to<00:03:20.420> cover<00:03:22.720> your<00:03:23.720> base<00:03:25.090> bead

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:57.200 

I'm<00:03:30.790> going<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:31.000> do<00:03:31.150> one<00:03:31.390> more<00:03:32.310> little<00:03:33.310> row

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:06.410 

ok<00:03:59.000> last<00:04:02.420> yarn<00:04:03.530> okay<00:04:04.530> now<00:04:05.220> you<00:04:05.970> can<00:04:06.030> see<00:04:06.270> your

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
ok last yarn okay now you can see your
