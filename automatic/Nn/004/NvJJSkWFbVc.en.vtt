00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.700
 face during the course of the day that 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.310
 we do that with the finger slides and we 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.810
 leaves fat ok 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.580
 those are the oily skin I think that 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.110
 that and everyone knows them what 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.020

 to do in little squares and re tiny 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.800
 let's put a container and we're going to 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.720
 crush it we will throw it very well until 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.890
 let us have a tomato puree you pike 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:28.070
 tomato puree and mash we have 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.320
 and then with the egg we are going to separate the 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.420
 clear of the yolk and what are we going to 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.750
 need here is going to be the clear what is 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:39.520
 the clear hate the clear part of the egg 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.520
 that we are going to pour 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.810
 in the tomato and I'm crushed 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.280
 all the egg with the tomato and we 're going to 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.480
 mix one more time 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.480
 well mixed 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.380
 ok well mixed then we are not going to 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.569
 apply on our face this is only 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.550
 Applies to people with oily skin 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.250
 we will apply it on the face remember 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.770
 that in the neck also and so we have left 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.020
 we do not apply it by hands this is 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.490
 for oily skin after you 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.640
 put this your skin will be more 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.160
 rested more luminous and will return to 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.959
 normality how many times are we going to 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.510
 do per week you can do it one day 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.700
 through or every other day 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.620
 I think that preferable every two days there 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.410
 have to do this until our skin is 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.840
 see radiant and if you want then I keep 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:37.100
 doing for life ok that's for the 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:41.390
 oily skin we need a tomato and 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:44.150
 the white of an egg ok we're already this 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.709
 it's for the oily skin boys I hope 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.170
 serve all of you guys and 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.019
 girls now we do not see this aside 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:54.320
 but we do not need it anymore and we're going to 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.630
 pass with the skin with the skin as you 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.660
 I can say part of dry good the 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:03.170
 dry skin that is what I have 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.480
 and we are going to need the same egg 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.910
 but on the contrary of the for the skin 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.180
 fat we're going to need only the yolk the 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.850
 yolk is the yellow ok to see if I do not 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.609
 Wrong layer medium yellow and we're going 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:20.090
 to need for the skin 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.919
 for dry skin and a banana or a 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.889
 banana that in this case I already have it 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:27.080
 machucado here I have it crushed and 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:30.409
 create a paste you notice fix that 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:33.590
 this is a very very finite pasta very 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:37.409
 dense very heavy that we were going to pour what 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:40.429
 what is the yolk of the egg 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:43.340
 all the egg yolk in the banana 

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:46.230
 in the banana 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:50.120
 same we stir 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.120
 and the little girl that we have made 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.630
 and a color will be a perfect color 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.630
 a yellow color 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.210
 well we have it there, this is not going to 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.830
 apply on our little face of it 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.439
 way that the person who has 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.020
 the oily skin on the face in the neck 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:11.569
 and if it remains in the same way in the hands 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.210
 this is not going to be left there by some 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:16.699
 15 20 minutes just like those of the 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.560
 oily skin 15 to 20 minutes and this 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:22.069
 You can also repeat it twice per 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:24.349
 two to every two days or how it suits you 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:26.300
 your schedules are great these 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:28.460
 two more masks I recommend you 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.039
 I have been this approximately 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.740
 from the day on Tuesday he returns to walk in 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:36.259
 my vacation vacations generates 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:39.650
 walking and it worked wonders 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:41.990
 because they were hours of driving a lot 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.750
 long were 5 or 6 hours or so of 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.810
 handle without washing my face without applying 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:50.810
 no product so the face arrives a 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:53.169
 little stressed a little tired and you see 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:56.300
 unhappy with this my face got better 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:59.479
 in 20 minutes so I hope that all 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.550
 these and those two masks you the 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:04.400
 try at home tell me if you 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.289
 it works or not something before it 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.540
 forget for the mixed skin how about that 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:11.090
 is in the middle of the fat 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.910
 and the dry good instead of using 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.980
 the banana or the tomato we are going to use 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:19.040
 an apple an apple that is not very 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:22.050
 green more or less mature we crush 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:25.199
 as apple and put to 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.849
 the egg white or the yolk that 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.379
 It depends on you not if your skin is 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:31.620
 mixed but it tends to be much more 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:33.870
 greasy then let's put the clear 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.900
 If your skin is mixed but it tends to be 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:39.240
 drier let's put the yolk that's 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:42.389
 you two is optional for you already 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:46.289
 as they know their mixed skin type 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:48.599
 dry or mixed very greasy ok that's it 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:50.310
 boys girls and remember the ones I gave 

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:51.569
 what I told them before starting the 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.080
 video 

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:54.080
 Oh
