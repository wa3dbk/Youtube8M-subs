00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.839
 so today i want you 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:11.610
 to demonstrate 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:14.400
 very wonderful inexpensive and tasty 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:19.410
 dessert gogol module from which no one 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.630
 will not give up and very very budget 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.000
 although in restaurants this dessert will be 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:35.420
 cost 40 60 hryvnia 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:40.070
 that we need 2 eggs sugar bowl 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.070
 whisk well and 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.630
 piece of plate for dessert and very 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.579
 for protein 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.710
 so 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.710
 for starters let's separate 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:01:01.880
 yolk from squirrel puru bride I did not break 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:07.510
 lu yolk broke 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.510
 in this way we separate 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.600
 wonderful decided 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.600
 one 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.280
 and in what way 2 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.790
 protein can later be 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.000
 backwater for 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.150
 pressure without this is an example or protein 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.150
 cream 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.150
 So 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:52.869
 2 yolks, I recommend using 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:52.869
 just 2 teaspoons of sugar and so 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:09.800
 yolks if desired, you can add 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:12.110
 Danilin in eggnog is acceptable or 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.000
 that any flavor is possible 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:23.420
 some kind of liquor will make something 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 liquor like that now follows this all 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:32.480
 smash thoroughly whip so have 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.480
 somewhere 3-5 minutes the hand gets tired very much 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.100
 much but what to do of course for 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.450
 simplifications you can use 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:48.880
 electronic mixer 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:48.880
 cool hand made at one hundred percent 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.750
 the century is already becoming a different color 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:19.520
 see already slightly lighter the dessert but 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.540
 in order for it to be for real 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:27.590
 ready he should be even brighter 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:32.000
 Here is approximately such a color as 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:35.510
 this as remember duck yellowish of 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.660
 durum wheat so whip 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.660
 farther 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:04:08.269
 wonderful color is probably already in the hot 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.890
 principle who has enough strength yet 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:23.330
 you can still beat 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:23.810
 we are all ready and so I have a dessert 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.900
 took 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:33.220
 in time to five minutes everyone will be 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.340
 satisfied it remained only to lay out 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.500
 creamer 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.500
 and for example in such 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.060
 it would be good ukr 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:58.410
 titty crumpled let's say any closer 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:05:02.070
 lay out the sauce on top but so very 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.070
 tasty try 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.980
 Well 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:17.410
 this one is awesome, everyone, everybody 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.410
 appetite to new meetings
