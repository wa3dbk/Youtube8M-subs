00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 greetings is starting one more edition 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.779
 of today in the world tek 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.170
 you will see that they have already unlocked the ps4 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.320
 a supposed new windows and also the 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.120
 with a visual office is renewed for 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.900
 so stay connected that was to stay 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.900
 updated 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.050
 microsoft should unify windows 8 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.349
 windows phone and also the xbox system 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.330
 in one until the end of 2015 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.740
 this information was disclosed by the website 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.200
 zd net 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.380
 the page is based on a supposed e-mail 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.989
 sent by terry myerson who is 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.750
 executive vice president of the company 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.090
 the idea is that this wave of updates 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.710
 makes the three systems even more 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.020
 similar to each other 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.690
 the site also states that microsoft 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.030
 is working in a single 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.160
 applications for all 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.899
 and this would make it easier to 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.030
 of developers 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.180
 Microsoft should release a new 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.909
 update for systems in 2014 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.460
 before this supposed unification a 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.830
 curious novelty promises to protect 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.470
 any material good that you have 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.420
 We're talking about the six titles this is. 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.750
 a padlock with only four centimeters 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.000
 using cable 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.590
 66 cm super-resistant 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.600
 hold your objects 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.990
 then it is possible to use in backpack bags 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.890
 and bicycles for example he does not use 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.020
 tea pot 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.909
 it uses a two-digit password that 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.049
 at least give an insured to a thief 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.630
 for a while 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.030
 the sef plus costs 12 a little more than 12 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.630
 which today gives an average of 40 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.420
 real 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.149
 a Japanese company wants to build a 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.060
 ring with solar pickup cells at the 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.700
 around the moon to generate energy 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.159
 design is called the bad lunar and this ring 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.590
 would send energy to land by means of 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.829
 laser and microwave 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.439
 The company responsible is the shimizu corp 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.840
 according to the company after building 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.149
 the ring with more than 10 thousand kilometers is 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.459
 necessary to create collectors around the 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.379
 land to capture the entire 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.280
 energy created on the moon 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.900
 the plan is to send a fleet of robots 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.290
 the moon together with the necessary material 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.150
 all this is to store sunlight that 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.520
 is not coming to earth 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.170
 The problem with all this is that it is necessary 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.819
 a force on a global scale to 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.700
 able to put this project into 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.520
 practice who knows whatsapp in the future 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.750
 famous ace has gained a renewed look 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.180
 for the s7 from today Tuesday the 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.830
 ep starts to be updated 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.870
 the new interface the icons 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.120
 minimalist and white color 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.920
 you can now create mailing lists 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.959
 simultaneous messages 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.480
 in addition the sharing of 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.390
 location via 3d maps has been 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.730
 The size of the text follows the 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.430
 device and new sounds and 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.010
 notification alerts were entered 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.100
 this update is free and can be 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.560
 made manually hackers already announced 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.590
 a gel break for the ps4 rotate games 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.870
 pirates and unauthorized software 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.690
 the authors state that the unlocking was 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.870
 made fast because the ps4 system 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.250
 is highly inspired by the cold psd that 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.440
 have open source 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.140
 the group even released the instructions 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.700
 and the sequence of commands is simple 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.040
 This was another issue of today 's
