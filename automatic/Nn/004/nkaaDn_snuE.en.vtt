00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.859
 the tablature allows musicians to read 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.859
 score without having notions of solfeggio 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.560
 this technique is very simple 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.710
 you have limits that correspond to the strings of the instrument 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.500
 6 it's a guitar 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.500
 4 if it's a ball 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.880
 every site the production 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.100
 the different therefore the risk 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.660
 everything seems to be targeted 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.660
 after the beginning of the uprising 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.040
 and that's why it works 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.550
 like the rest of the season 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.700
 no doubt 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.100
 I like the mix of different people from one person to another 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.530
 for the world of discipline 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.250
 it is a technique that consists of stretching the tightrope 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.310
 no long term rating of your choice 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.860
 to play a note is a rotary movement of the forearm 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.830
 without moving the kippur fingers 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.790
 return on these flights 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.260
 abbiati attention 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.650
 here is the note 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.050
 ronnie cooke 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.250
 if it was difficult to hear
