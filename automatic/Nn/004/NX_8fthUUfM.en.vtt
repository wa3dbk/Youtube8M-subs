 john people your race kieran welcome to 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.250
 episode number one of the live call 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.540
 of duty ghosts hurts series here on my 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.580
 channel here as the gaming 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.020
 in this series I simply play the game 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.150
 ever hurts playing because that is natural 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.250
 has been introduced new in call of duty 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.560
 ghost and it contains the most action 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.640
 and thereby i will try in every 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.349
 episode 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.360
 a certain chenice for you too 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.860
 pick up is delivery number on a so 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.120
 I don't have a chalice here yet 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.650
 if you have chalice shapes before 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.059
 in this series such as get a kem strike 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.670
 in offense 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.640
 get 30 kills in hurt 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.270
 For example, the maniac kill streak in 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.710
 offended 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.090
 let's just know in the 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.280
 no responses immediately these 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.899
 episode number only a thumb 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.309
 up and that naturally helps me a lot 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.690
 first what you are going to be hurt on the 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.090
 man warhawk 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.640
 with the a12 with external mix and therefore eines 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.629
 on it and beautiful your talent care 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.789
 mill 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.130
 I almost got this weapon gold content 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.200
 I'll just see kills entertain you for a while 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.910
 must if you want a certain camel one 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.399
 blocks for each weapon you must be 100 the 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.229
 make lily kills but seriously i still have it 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.149
 never loved the whole game and linus 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.979
 Of course some corners going so to 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.780
 but I never do that 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.890
 does not have to do that either and that is 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.600
 really only for the kempers 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.800
 included who go camping already go 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.349
 so walk me 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.500
 and now really something for me but oh hey 

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:31.479
 are going to try to set a growth score 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.690
 I want three 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:37.060
 teammate has a nice teammate once 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.319
 cocktail and rowlet pop pop pop pop pop 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.599
 pop pop pop 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.940
 I don't want to die there and he is him 

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:44.590
 split next to me off fuck that further this 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.450
 science according to me and so I heard whole 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.340
 fan now running well makes driving too 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.319
 will calf so I have amplify on 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.429
 That means the emmy follows their footsteps 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:53.319
 so harsh words around me 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.000
 for example, a walking person is now also dead 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:57.190
 and that really helps very well 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.920
 and the point is also with amplify 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.209
 only the footsteps of him and 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.500
 the footsteps are increased in terms of sound 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:04.840
 most of your team just stay 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.750
 same as your footsteps after short 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.280
 it is always the footstep of the and m 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.860
 so you should remember that if you have the puck 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.630
 Amplify used and are quite tasty 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.520
 busy teammates we might go 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.780
 a bit too fast for me so of course 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.129
 just fine 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.870
 oh shit is it a date again 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.410
 downstairs so of course the notorious cam 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.030
 spotlight now and 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.530
 then runs one to the left 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.990
 or after him 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.610
 tjuk tjuk tjoek all gone 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.020
 runs over there and I continue 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.100
 I'm not going after an enemy like me 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.810
 know that if i go there that 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.550
 that guy is chilled as a whole 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.140
 often believed in and way right to you 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.690
 team mates off and the think of me can be there 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.460
 chase and maybe 1% here 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.690
 chance pick up the time or I later 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.400
 nice walk and grab him the team 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.720
 so there are true decisions that 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.490
 must make then you can have a better one 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.220
 walk and then you fill the others again 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.470
 people die instead because you're behind 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.960
 enter into a certain person then there must be 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.060
 dirty little harder to go and I know it 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.470
 not where they are all boys 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.420
 of course nobody uses set bowl anymore 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.940
 I use almost everyone of the great 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.320
 they don't have much on you anymore either 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.510
 because of this can catch up that state in that 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.310
 in which the core was a disturbing core 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.900
 thought i'm stuck here fuck i want you 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.640
 down 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.870
 so then nobody walks again we go 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.020
 not anymore 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.460
 let's go pay attention and hurt something 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.870
 Everyone just runs too quickly to 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.210
 him with that is hurting site you get 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.560
 of course 5 Turkish and there are quite a few 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.740
 a lot of 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.420
 and what the fuck man holy shit I lasting 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.709
 pink peacefuller one 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.420
