what I was just doing so you got there
you<00:02:24.040> can<00:02:24.160> then<00:02:24.340> basically<00:02:24.580> put<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:24.940> frame

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
you can then basically put a frame

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.210 
you can then basically put a frame
around<00:02:25.330> it<00:02:25.960> you<00:02:26.110> can<00:02:26.230> add<00:02:26.380> more<00:02:26.620> pictures<00:02:27.100> and

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
around it you can add more pictures and

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.210 
around it you can add more pictures and
you<00:02:27.310> can<00:02:27.460> add<00:02:27.610> shapes<00:02:28.210> as<00:02:28.510> well<00:02:28.720> so<00:02:29.380> again<00:02:29.740> play

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
you can add shapes as well so again play

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.560 
you can add shapes as well so again play
around<00:02:30.400> when<00:02:30.820> I'm<00:02:30.970> going<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.210> put<00:02:31.300> this<00:02:31.390> into

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
around when I'm going to put this into

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.960 
around when I'm going to put this into
something<00:02:31.810> as<00:02:32.050> simple<00:02:32.260> as<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.590> frame<00:02:32.980> click

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
something as simple as a frame click

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.660 
something as simple as a frame click
right<00:02:34.240> click<00:02:34.270> that<00:02:34.810> send<00:02:35.440> this<00:02:35.620> image<00:02:36.100> over<00:02:36.280> to

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
right click that send this image over to

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.190 
right click that send this image over to
the<00:02:36.820> back<00:02:37.090> where<00:02:37.120> is<00:02:37.510> it<00:02:37.630> going<00:02:37.750> there<00:02:37.960> we're

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
the back where is it going there we're

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.740 
the back where is it going there we're
going<00:02:38.320> to<00:02:38.380> send<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.710> image<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.100> back<00:02:39.750> and

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
going to send that image to the back and

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.380 
going to send that image to the back and
send<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.290> backwards<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:42.070> now<00:02:43.000> you've<00:02:43.210> got<00:02:43.360> a

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
send it backwards and now you've got a

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.240 
send it backwards and now you've got a
frame<00:02:43.720> around<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:44.260> so<00:02:44.440> once<00:02:44.620> any<00:02:44.800> prints<00:02:45.070> it

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
frame around it so once any prints it

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.980 
frame around it so once any prints it
out<00:02:45.340> you<00:02:45.490> can<00:02:45.520> duplicate<00:02:45.970> that<00:02:46.180> version<00:02:46.630> about

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
out you can duplicate that version about

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.020 
out you can duplicate that version about
3-4<00:02:47.560> times<00:02:47.890> on<00:02:48.100> one<00:02:48.130> page<00:02:48.520> in<00:02:48.550> you<00:02:48.760> can<00:02:48.910> make

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
3-4 times on one page in you can make
