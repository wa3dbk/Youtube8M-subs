00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
and bottom of our frame so we're going

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.590 
and bottom of our frame so we're going
to<00:00:31.439> put<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> 41<00:00:32.309> inch<00:00:32.460> board<00:00:32.730> at<00:00:32.850> each<00:00:33.000> end<00:00:33.329> and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
to put a 41 inch board at each end and

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.990 
to put a 41 inch board at each end and
then<00:00:34.170> one<00:00:34.829> at<00:00:35.070> nine<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.489> three-quarters<00:00:35.969> and

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
then one at nine and three-quarters and

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.549

one at twenty and three-quarters and

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.380 
one at twenty and three-quarters and
we've<00:00:37.980> decided<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.430> add<00:00:38.550> pocket<00:00:38.940> holes<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.300> our

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
we've decided to add pocket holes to our

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.360 
we've decided to add pocket holes to our
41<00:00:39.780> inch<00:00:39.930> pieces<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.620> makes<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:40.920> part<00:00:41.160> much

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
41 inch pieces that makes this part much

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.010 
41 inch pieces that makes this part much
easier<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.850> attach<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.570> she'll<00:00:42.809> get<00:00:42.899> it

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
easier to attach and a she'll get it

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.580 
easier to attach and a she'll get it
clamped<00:00:43.140> up<00:00:43.379> for<00:00:43.559> us<00:00:44.930> we'll<00:00:45.930> use<00:00:46.079> our<00:00:46.200> Rio<00:00:46.379> V

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
clamped up for us we'll use our Rio V

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.410 
clamped up for us we'll use our Rio V
impact<00:00:46.950> driver<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.489> attach<00:00:47.760> these<00:00:48.000> pieces

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
impact driver to attach these pieces

00:00:48.420 --> 00:01:03.240 
impact driver to attach these pieces
using<00:00:48.600> two<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.989> half<00:00:49.140> inch<00:00:49.350> wood<00:00:49.559> screws

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.860

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
okay make sure that you attach boards

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.120 
okay make sure that you attach boards
the<00:01:05.960> same<00:01:06.170> way<00:01:06.320> and<00:01:06.560> then<00:01:06.650> we'll<00:01:06.770> do<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:06.980> same

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
the same way and then we'll do the same

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:35.410 
the same way and then we'll do the same
thing<00:01:07.190> with<00:01:07.490> our<00:01:07.580> second

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.820 

okay<00:01:36.420> guys<00:01:36.570> we<00:01:36.869> have<00:01:36.960> our<00:01:36.990> two<00:01:37.229> frames<00:01:37.530> built

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
okay guys we have our two frames built

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.590 
okay guys we have our two frames built
now<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.250> we're<00:01:38.369> going<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.610> attach<00:01:38.760> 21<00:01:39.450> inch

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
now and we're going to attach 21 inch

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.480 
now and we're going to attach 21 inch
boards<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.080> connect<00:01:40.350> them<00:01:40.530> start<00:01:41.220> with<00:01:41.340> your

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
boards to connect them start with your

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.190 
boards to connect them start with your
quarter<00:01:41.729> pieces<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.330> attach<00:01:42.420> them<00:01:42.840> like<00:01:42.990> this

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
quarter pieces and attach them like this

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.200 
quarter pieces and attach them like this
make<00:01:43.920> sure<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.190> the<00:01:44.400> four<00:01:44.640> inch<00:01:44.790> side<00:01:45.030> is

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
make sure that the four inch side is

00:01:45.210 --> 00:02:05.139 
make sure that the four inch side is
flush<00:01:45.509> with<00:01:45.540> your<00:01:45.780> 48<00:01:46.259> inch<00:01:46.440> boards

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.059 

so<00:02:06.149> at<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.420> point<00:02:06.689> we<00:02:06.960> have<00:02:07.109> four<00:02:07.409> more<00:02:07.560> 21

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
so at this point we have four more 21

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.680 
so at this point we have four more 21
inch<00:02:08.220> ports<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.640> attach<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.300> these<00:02:09.479> are<00:02:09.599> going

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
inch ports to attach and these are going

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.509 
inch ports to attach and these are going
to<00:02:09.750> be<00:02:09.899> our<00:02:10.019> dividers<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.979> foreign<00:02:11.280> side

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
to be our dividers and the foreign side

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.040 
to be our dividers and the foreign side
is<00:02:11.640> going<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.849> face<00:02:12.030> up<00:02:12.269> with<00:02:12.330> our<00:02:12.690> pocket

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
is going to face up with our pocket

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:34.680 
is going to face up with our pocket
voles<00:02:13.230> facing<00:02:13.620> down<00:02:13.769> to<00:02:13.920> hide<00:02:14.069> them

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.050 

so<00:02:35.140> we<00:02:35.260> attached<00:02:35.590> our<00:02:35.830> tot<00:02:36.070> dividers<00:02:36.550> at<00:02:36.760> 9<00:02:36.940> and

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
so we attached our tot dividers at 9 and

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.690 
so we attached our tot dividers at 9 and
3/4<00:02:37.540> inches<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:38.110> 21<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:38.650> 3/4<00:02:39.100> inches<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.640> our

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
3/4 inches and 21 and 3/4 inches and our

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.610 
3/4 inches and 21 and 3/4 inches and our
shelf<00:02:40.030> supports<00:02:40.510> we've<00:02:40.660> attached<00:02:41.020> at<00:02:41.230> 18

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
shelf supports we've attached at 18

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.560 
shelf supports we've attached at 18
inches<00:02:41.740> from<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.130> top<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.490> frame<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:43.150> now

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
inches from the top of the frame and now

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.420 
inches from the top of the frame and now
it's<00:02:43.750> time<00:02:43.960> to<00:02:43.990> attach<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.650> other<00:02:44.830> frame<00:02:45.100> so

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
it's time to attach the other frame so

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:58.580 
it's time to attach the other frame so
you<00:02:45.490> want<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.760> move<00:02:45.880> it<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.120> floor
