00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.569 
nice shape if you're not familiar with
these<00:00:26.960> machines<00:00:27.199> it's<00:00:28.130> something<00:00:28.369> you<00:00:28.429> should

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:28.579 
these machines it's something you should

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:30.009 
these machines it's something you should
probably<00:00:28.730> pay<00:00:28.939> attention<00:00:29.329> to<00:00:29.480> because<00:00:29.869> it's

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
probably pay attention to because it's

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.770 
probably pay attention to because it's
really<00:00:30.849> machine<00:00:31.849> that<00:00:32.060> is<00:00:32.180> widely<00:00:32.599> sought

really<00:00:39.590> like<00:00:39.769> these<00:00:40.010> for<00:00:40.789> their<00:00:40.910> width<00:00:41.180> their

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
really like these for their width their

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.479 
really like these for their width their
speed<00:00:43.420> they're<00:00:44.420> just<00:00:44.600> very<00:00:44.719> well<00:00:44.989> engineered

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
speed they're just very well engineered

speed they're just very well engineered
this<00:00:46.489> machine<00:00:46.940> that<00:00:47.390> came<00:00:47.780> to<00:00:47.960> us<00:00:48.079> and<00:00:48.320> very

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
this machine that came to us and very

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.130 
this machine that came to us and very
good<00:00:48.859> shape<00:00:49.070> used<00:00:49.570> we've<00:00:50.570> been<00:00:50.719> over<00:00:51.019> it

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
good shape used we've been over it

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.500 
good shape used we've been over it
pretty<00:00:51.829> thoroughly<00:00:52.190> and<00:00:52.609> found<00:00:52.879> it<00:00:53.059> to<00:00:53.269> just

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
pretty thoroughly and found it to just

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.599 
pretty thoroughly and found it to just
be<00:00:53.690> already<00:00:54.230> very<00:00:54.530> clean<00:00:54.829> already<00:00:55.309> in<00:00:55.399> very

be already very clean already in very
good<00:00:55.760> condition<00:00:56.440> and<00:00:58.329> we've<00:00:59.329> got<00:00:59.570> a<00:00:59.809> hundred

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
good condition and we've got a hundred

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
a hundred percent test pattern kind of

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.430 
a hundred percent test pattern kind of
hard<00:01:04.280> to<00:01:04.370> see<00:01:04.489> on<00:01:04.519> the<00:01:04.670> video<00:01:04.990> but<00:01:05.990> this<00:01:06.080> is<00:01:06.140> how

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
hard to see on the video but this is how

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.720 
hard to see on the video but this is how
they<00:01:06.620> do<00:01:06.680> their<00:01:06.860> test<00:01:07.070> pad<00:01:07.220> in<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.430> yellow<00:01:07.610> you

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:07.730 
they do their test pad in the yellow you

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.040 
they do their test pad in the yellow you
probably<00:01:08.030> won't<00:01:08.210> even<00:01:08.270> see<00:01:08.390> here<00:01:08.720> but<00:01:08.900> it's

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
probably won't even see here but it's

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.580 
probably won't even see here but it's
100%<00:01:09.190> our<00:01:10.190> cyan<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:10.880> our<00:01:10.940> black<00:01:11.470> 100%<00:01:12.470> of<00:01:12.530> the

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
100% our cyan and our black 100% of the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.800 
100% our cyan and our black 100% of the
novels<00:01:12.950> are<00:01:13.040> firing<00:01:13.280> you<00:01:14.270> may<00:01:14.390> not<00:01:14.570> see<00:01:14.750> them

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
novels are firing you may not see them

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.510 
novels are firing you may not see them
in<00:01:14.900> the<00:01:15.020> video<00:01:15.230> really<00:01:15.440> clearly<00:01:15.920> but<00:01:16.190> we're

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
in the video really clearly but we're

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.100 
in the video really clearly but we're
very<00:01:16.670> impressed<00:01:17.120> with<00:01:17.240> that<00:01:17.390> it's<00:01:17.660> really

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
very impressed with that it's really

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.060 
very impressed with that it's really
good<00:01:19.750> machines<00:01:20.750> working<00:01:21.020> really<00:01:21.230> well<00:01:21.350> this

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
good machines working really well this

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.390 
good machines working really well this
thing<00:01:22.370> can<00:01:22.670> run<00:01:22.940> anywhere<00:01:23.450> from<00:01:24.080> at<00:01:24.920> the

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
thing can run anywhere from at the

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.610 
thing can run anywhere from at the
highest<00:01:25.640> quality<00:01:25.910> modes<00:01:26.480> around<00:01:26.840> 55<00:01:27.290> square

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
highest quality modes around 55 square

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.859 
highest quality modes around 55 square
feet<00:01:27.830> an<00:01:27.920> hour<00:01:28.040> up<00:01:28.670> to<00:01:29.150> the<00:01:29.570> fastest<00:01:30.050> mode<00:01:30.260> but

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
feet an hour up to the fastest mode but

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.779 
feet an hour up to the fastest mode but
forty<00:01:31.200> square<00:01:31.259> feet<00:01:31.500> an<00:01:31.799> hour<00:01:31.890> seems<00:01:32.640> like

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
forty square feet an hour seems like

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:34.700 
forty square feet an hour seems like
most<00:01:33.000> people<00:01:33.090> run<00:01:33.479> them<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.960> seventy<00:01:34.590> two

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
most people run them in the seventy two

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.940 
most people run them in the seventy two
hundred<00:01:34.799> square<00:01:35.369> feet<00:01:35.670> an<00:01:35.789> hour<00:01:35.880> range

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
hundred square feet an hour range

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.859 
hundred square feet an hour range
basically<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.280> can<00:01:38.460> do<00:01:38.549> very<00:01:38.759> well<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:39.600> thing

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
basically you can do very well one thing

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.469 
basically you can do very well one thing
the<00:01:40.049> Muto's<00:01:40.409> do<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.920> nobody<00:01:41.189> else<00:01:41.310> does<00:01:41.609> they

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
the Muto's do that nobody else does they

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.219 
the Muto's do that nobody else does they
got<00:01:42.659> their<00:01:42.810> wave<00:01:43.049> printing<00:01:43.560> technology<00:01:45.229> which

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
got their wave printing technology which

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.660 
got their wave printing technology which
actually<00:01:46.649> I'm<00:01:46.770> going<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.950> pause<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:47.429> here

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
actually I'm going to pause this here

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.309 
actually I'm going to pause this here
for<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> sec<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.360> machine<00:01:48.630> won't<00:01:48.750> like<00:01:48.990> me<00:01:49.170> that

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
for a sec the machine won't like me that

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:50.620 
for a sec the machine won't like me that
I'll<00:01:49.409> show<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.619> it's<00:01:49.829> cool

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
I'll show you it's cool

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.940 
I'll show you it's cool
okay<00:01:51.630> Matt<00:01:51.929> if<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.140> want<00:01:52.319> to<00:01:52.409> zoom<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.679> here

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
okay Matt if you want to zoom in here

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.499 
okay Matt if you want to zoom in here
you<00:01:53.159> can<00:01:54.060> actually<00:01:54.390> see<00:01:55.909> see<00:01:56.909> if<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.149> can<00:01:57.270> see

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
you can actually see see if you can see

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.419 
you can actually see see if you can see
in<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.719> video<00:01:57.810> see<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.409> waves<00:01:58.619> there<00:01:59.039> how<00:01:59.310> it

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
in the video see the waves there how it

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.330 
in the video see the waves there how it
lays<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.759> down<00:01:59.789> and<00:02:00.240> by<00:02:01.170> doing<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.560> another

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
lays it down and by doing that another

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.469 
lays it down and by doing that another
was<00:02:02.459> going<00:02:02.609> to<00:02:02.670> come<00:02:02.789> out<00:02:02.819> while<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.179> the<00:02:03.270> video

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
was going to come out while in the video

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.740 
was going to come out while in the video
but<00:02:04.039> it<00:02:05.039> is<00:02:05.099> going<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.789> show<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:07.789> that<00:02:08.789> it

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
but it is going to show you that it

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.830 
but it is going to show you that it
decreases<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.530> banding<00:02:11.000> significantly<00:02:12.000> over

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
decreases the banding significantly over

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.330 
decreases the banding significantly over
a<00:02:12.870> lot<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.290> older<00:02:13.500> printer<00:02:13.769> technologies

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
a lot of the older printer technologies

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.550 
a lot of the older printer technologies
to<00:02:14.459> lay<00:02:14.610> things<00:02:14.880> down<00:02:14.970> online<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:15.930> print<00:02:16.379> it

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
to lay things down online so print it

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.110 
to lay things down online so print it
like<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.980> but<00:02:17.250> that's<00:02:17.610> okay<00:02:17.910> it'll<00:02:18.239> get<00:02:18.390> over

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
like that but that's okay it'll get over

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.050 
like that but that's okay it'll get over
so<00:02:21.120> this<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.900> very<00:02:22.170> nice<00:02:22.349> machine<00:02:22.910> it's<00:02:23.910> a

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
so this is a very nice machine it's a

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.850 
so this is a very nice machine it's a
four<00:02:24.360> color<00:02:24.629> printer<00:02:25.110> but<00:02:25.349> I<00:02:25.379> get<00:02:25.560> some<00:02:25.709> really

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
four color printer but I get some really

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.440 
four color printer but I get some really
vibrant<00:02:26.190> colors<00:02:26.700> as<00:02:26.910> you'll<00:02:27.030> see<00:02:27.239> by<00:02:27.420> our

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
vibrant colors as you'll see by our

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.190 
vibrant colors as you'll see by our
previous<00:02:27.750> Ortloff<00:02:28.260> coming<00:02:28.530> out<00:02:28.650> here<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:30.200> it

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
previous Ortloff coming out here and it

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.319 
previous Ortloff coming out here and it
takes<00:02:31.440> Muto<00:02:31.890> he<00:02:32.069> go<00:02:32.220> all<00:02:32.400> for<00:02:32.610> ink<00:02:32.790> which<00:02:33.180> you

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
takes Muto he go all for ink which you

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.809 
takes Muto he go all for ink which you
can<00:02:33.480> get<00:02:33.660> in<00:02:33.959> either<00:02:34.709> 220<00:02:35.489> milliliter

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
can get in either 220 milliliter

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.780 
can get in either 220 milliliter
cartridges<00:02:36.329> or<00:02:36.480> 440<00:02:37.489> another<00:02:38.489> kind<00:02:38.730> of

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
cartridges or 440 another kind of

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.190 
cartridges or 440 another kind of
convenient<00:02:39.239> thing<00:02:39.389> about<00:02:39.420> this<00:02:39.810> is<00:02:39.989> that<00:02:40.079> it

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
convenient thing about this is that it

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.780 
convenient thing about this is that it
doesn't<00:02:40.470> have<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.620> gazillion<00:02:41.010> cartridges<00:02:41.639> in

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
doesn't have a gazillion cartridges in

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.319 
doesn't have a gazillion cartridges in
the<00:02:41.819> back<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.359> it's<00:02:43.049> just<00:02:43.230> got<00:02:43.410> four<00:02:44.329> drawers

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
the back so it's just got four drawers

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.809 
the back so it's just got four drawers
down<00:02:45.540> there<00:02:45.810> has<00:02:45.989> one<00:02:46.349> printhead<00:02:46.920> that's<00:02:47.579> got

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
down there has one printhead that's got

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.370 
down there has one printhead that's got
eight<00:02:48.030> channels<00:02:48.480> in<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.889> and<00:02:50.510> so<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.810> lot<00:02:52.349> of

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
eight channels in it and so a lot of

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.170 
eight channels in it and so a lot of
things<00:02:52.620> are<00:02:52.739> simplified<00:02:53.250> on<00:02:53.430> this<00:02:53.519> machine<00:02:53.849> it

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
things are simplified on this machine it

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.809 
things are simplified on this machine it
has<00:02:54.209> integrated<00:02:54.900> heating<00:02:55.410> from<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.370> factory

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
in three different zones and it all can

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.460 
in three different zones and it all can
