00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:15.710
 What if I'm a little it seems difficult likely piled up behind this month also a little 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:21.530
 It came out Well say talk is better Kedomo do not know if that time happens 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:23.810
 Also in the will to practice somewhere in to secure the time and did not have time to hit if today

 Enter you Yes Well teacher immediately 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.500
 Thank you 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.890
 I would like to ask for a hand from the first stop immediately 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:38.149
 This block is a defensive technology but 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:42.200
 I will scold it when my opponent was attacked first 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.030
 By blog this blog is good 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.360
 a 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.540
 Well there is also the possibility of winning a strong player 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.370
 That 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:58.470
 So you can turn to now attack from the defense this is very important as the practice of tuna how 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:01.940
 I would like to show you my practice with my strength. 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.940
 Yes core block 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:21.510
 I would like to ask for a counter drive after the teacher 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:23.190
 Here is the block of Iber's good is to return the age to the ball of the opponent 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.580
 Not to make mistakes 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.180
 Well target the course a 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.150
 Kedomo open of hope returns win put the cut machine I'm a better name 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:36.170
 Sense drive 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:39.830
 That attack is while using your opponent 's rotation 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:44.420
 Is the compression method that returns to the rotation on that by 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:50.540
 It is likely that it is doubled by now Yes this counter drive now 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:54.560
 I can not do this counter drive because it is a table tennis siri 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:03:01.370
 It will be decided how good it can be 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:06.860
 Counters, especially players with small bodies, come behind and have difficult axis 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:11.090
 It is quite common for players who try to play ping pong about Daidai if they can not do this counter drive 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:14.550
 It is not possible to win the seal I want to show you from the practice 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.180
 Well first hit the differences between the block and the viewfinder drive 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:22.180
 To you because a 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:27.489
 If I can accept your way of taking songs ball I think that the spirit is understood well 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:31.210
 I would like you to tell me about the tank's Chiquita that I went to earlier 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:38.110
 It's a name that does little unfamiliar Te Chiquita but er Yes 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:42.100
 Indeed I folder out Fighters Fighters of this trick it Is Seko did Mase God called you want to develop 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:45.470
 I'm Corbel This is Bell Player Hi That's a development technique 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:49.040
 It is and hit the ball with this ballistic 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:54.320
 I'm going to get into the other's court this way 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.790
 It feels like drawing a circle or it's really different but it gets crooked but how to get up 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.880
 There, such as curve 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.220
 That 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:04.980
 The fact that there is that Chiquita bananas are very similar to the curve of the flower in balance 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.700
 Is the name that you heard about the garden banana? 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:15.090
 Chiquita banana It seems so I have not heard yet 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:16.870
 Since resemble small ball as immediately of this Chiquita is said to have been named Fu says Chiquita 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.799
 Please tell me the point of practice 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:27.790
 Yes So let's use the players and explain 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:29.139
 Cheers for good work was aqueous this month really did studying really could use the technique in the attack game 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.969
 Though 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:35.349
 That's right I 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:41.049
 Use defensive block opponent 's rotation 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:47.769
 Most of the top players in Japan now do counter drive Cheetah 

00:04:41.049 --> 00:04:48.249
 In particular , I think I was able to introduce the rally game behind and the skills necessary for that game, especially 

00:04:47.769 --> 00:04:50.990
 so 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:56.060
 But it is so difficult because it is so 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:05:01.400
 I would like to continue practicing steadily since au does not get better immediately 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:05.150
 Because I think that it is not attached to that always only I want to do my best little I today Shiraoka 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:10.980
 You and I tried to make a Chikita together but I think it is a kit cut 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:11.810
 But it's because it's up to the people who edit it 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:17.090
 Already 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:21.770
 I think it 's good I think that the leader image is an image by migration if it's good 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:31.830
 It took a lot of time , so I'm on the bottom 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:34.980
 Oh yeah yes I want you to see by all means Ushimu 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:39.510
 As we introduced practice to fight in game 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:45.440
 I think if I can learn about the election of the cut from next month from next month 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:45.440
 Yes, I understand So goodbye please look at the next month you come
