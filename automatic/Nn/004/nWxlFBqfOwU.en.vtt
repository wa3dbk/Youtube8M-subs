00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
way to do the leaf stem I'm going to

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.020 
way to do the leaf stem I'm going to
just<00:00:07.280> turn<00:00:08.510> the<00:00:09.510> wires<00:00:10.610> that<00:00:11.610> are<00:00:11.670> left

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
just turn the wires that are left

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.769 
just turn the wires that are left
together<00:00:14.089> and<00:00:15.089> I'm<00:00:15.330> going<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.570> take<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.680> green

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
green tape just cut it a little bit i'm

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.359 
green tape just cut it a little bit i'm

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
going to cut because it's very thin it's

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.530 
going to cut because it's very thin it's
harder<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:31.579> to<00:00:32.579> do<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.910> touch<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:35.540> because

to the tape I cut it and I'm just going

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:53.209 
to the tape I cut it and I'm just going
to<00:00:42.210> go<00:00:43.250> around<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:46.230> wires<00:00:51.649> as<00:00:52.649> close<00:00:52.980> as

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
to go around the wires as close as

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:02.290 
to go around the wires as close as
possible<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:54.020> the<00:00:55.020> lust<00:00:55.520> bead<00:00:56.750> of<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.809> leaf

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.859 

you<00:01:02.930> should<00:01:03.140> do<00:01:03.410> it<00:01:03.530> very<00:01:03.890> tight<00:01:07.510> makes<00:01:08.510> it<00:01:08.720> a

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
you should do it very tight makes it a

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:23.060 
you should do it very tight makes it a
little<00:01:09.260> bit<00:01:09.409> stronger

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.800 

till<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.940> end<00:01:25.040> and<00:01:26.040> now<00:01:26.280> I'm<00:01:26.460> going<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.820> cut

till the end and now I'm going to cut

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:39.380 
till the end and now I'm going to cut
the<00:01:28.050> rest<00:01:34.010> and<00:01:36.020> take<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.290> leaf<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:38.880> attach<00:01:39.360> it

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
the rest and take the leaf and attach it

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:49.280 
the rest and take the leaf and attach it
to<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:42.420> flower<00:01:46.220> when<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.340> put<00:01:47.550> the<00:01:48.290> green

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
to the flower when you put the green

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.790 
to the flower when you put the green
tape<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.890> makes<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.400> little<00:01:50.580> bit<00:01:50.759> thicker

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
tape it makes it a little bit thicker

00:01:51.800 --> 00:02:02.930 
tape it makes it a little bit thicker
more<00:01:52.800> stable<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:58.820> it<00:01:59.820> looks<00:02:00.390> like<00:02:00.539> that
