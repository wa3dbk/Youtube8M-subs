Sparkman<00:00:41.620> and<00:00:41.980> Clayman<00:00:42.720> as<00:00:43.720> I<00:00:44.560> said<00:00:44.800> this<00:00:45.190> is

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
Sparkman and Clayman as I said this is

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.860 
Sparkman and Clayman as I said this is
based<00:00:45.580> on<00:00:45.760> all<00:00:45.880> the<00:00:46.000> strategies<00:00:46.450> thus<00:00:46.720> you

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
based on all the strategies thus you

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.860 
based on all the strategies thus you
have<00:00:47.020> the<00:00:47.320> originals<00:00:47.800> and<00:00:48.070> you<00:00:48.970> have<00:00:49.150> Neos<00:00:49.450> so

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
have the originals and you have Neos so

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.860 
have the originals and you have Neos so
that's<00:00:50.230> the<00:00:50.380> only<00:00:50.470> vanillas<00:00:51.220> that<00:00:51.430> he<00:00:51.490> plays

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
that's the only vanillas that he plays

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.540 
that's the only vanillas that he plays
then<00:00:52.870> you<00:00:52.990> have<00:00:53.200> the<00:00:53.620> effect<00:00:53.920> heroes<00:00:54.250> which

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
then you have the effect heroes which

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.110 
then you have the effect heroes which
are<00:00:54.730> bubbleman<00:00:55.710> wild<00:00:56.710> heart

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
are bubbleman wild heart

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.830 
are bubbleman wild heart
Prisma<00:00:58.150> blade<00:00:59.050> edge<00:00:59.290> and<00:01:00.010> nicker<00:01:00.730> shade<00:01:01.090> so<00:01:01.810> I

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
Prisma blade edge and nicker shade so I

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.369 
Prisma blade edge and nicker shade so I
tried<00:01:02.230> to<00:01:02.380> include<00:01:02.650> a<00:01:03.190> very<00:01:04.089> good<00:01:04.509> variety<00:01:04.750> I

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
tried to include a very good variety I

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.260 
tried to include a very good variety I
didn't<00:01:05.920> go<00:01:06.100> with<00:01:06.340> this<00:01:06.520> stuff<00:01:06.759> that<00:01:06.970> he<00:01:07.060> played

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270

in the manga I just went with the anime
cards<00:01:09.790> and<00:01:10.420> I<00:01:10.540> think<00:01:10.690> you<00:01:10.750> can<00:01:10.870> make<00:01:10.990> a<00:01:11.020> pretty

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
cards and I think you can make a pretty

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.140 
cards and I think you can make a pretty
good<00:01:11.440> bit<00:01:11.650> of<00:01:11.680> the<00:01:11.950> elemental<00:01:12.520> hero<00:01:12.700> fusions

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150

like this Jaden's deck can be worked in
many<00:01:16.000> ways<00:01:16.180> just<00:01:16.210> like<00:01:16.570> timing<00:01:17.080> you<00:01:17.200> he<00:01:17.530> has

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
many ways just like timing you he has

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.010 
many ways just like timing you he has
tons<00:01:18.190> of<00:01:18.340> cards<00:01:18.670> you<00:01:18.760> can<00:01:18.909> choose<00:01:19.090> from<00:01:19.240> so<00:01:19.570> if

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
character debt so if you're looking at

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.029 
character debt so if you're looking at
the<00:05:33.270> pullet<00:05:33.539> where<00:05:33.719> you<00:05:33.840> own<00:05:33.990> it<00:05:34.169> go<00:05:34.740> ahead<00:05:34.860> and

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 
the pullet where you own it go ahead and

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:37.850 
the pullet where you own it go ahead and
put<00:05:35.400> that<00:05:35.430> in<00:05:35.789> I<00:05:36.060> guess<00:05:36.330> instead<00:05:36.840> of<00:05:37.020> aqua<00:05:37.620> Neos

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
put that in I guess instead of aqua Neos

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.459 
put that in I guess instead of aqua Neos
because<00:05:38.370> it's<00:05:39.150> probably<00:05:39.599> my<00:05:39.690> least<00:05:39.900> favorite

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:40.469 
because it's probably my least favorite

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:43.879 
because it's probably my least favorite
of<00:05:40.680> the<00:05:41.120> lineup<00:05:42.120> their<00:05:42.509> divine<00:05:43.440> neo<00:05:43.620> is<00:05:43.740> a

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
of the lineup their divine neo is a

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.439 
of the lineup their divine neo is a
really<00:05:44.069> strong<00:05:44.279> card<00:05:44.580> if<00:05:44.729> you<00:05:44.819> can<00:05:44.940> summon<00:05:45.240> it

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
really strong card if you can summon it

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:47.300 
really strong card if you can summon it
all<00:05:46.229> the<00:05:46.440> rest<00:05:46.620> of<00:05:46.770> these<00:05:46.860> have<00:05:47.130> their

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
all the rest of these have their

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.610 
all the rest of these have their
utilities<00:05:47.819> obviously<00:05:48.479> air<00:05:48.659> Neos<00:05:49.020> is<00:05:49.229> probably

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
utilities obviously air Neos is probably

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.610 
utilities obviously air Neos is probably
the<00:05:49.740> best<00:05:49.949> one<00:05:50.130> but<00:05:50.520> I<00:05:51.080> can<00:05:52.080> only<00:05:52.169> do<00:05:52.380> so<00:05:52.560> much

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
the best one but I can only do so much

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.120 
the best one but I can only do so much
so<00:05:53.690> that's<00:05:54.690> it<00:05:54.930> that's<00:05:55.199> the<00:05:55.469> Jaden<00:05:55.979> Yuki

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130
