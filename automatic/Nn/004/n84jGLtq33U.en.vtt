00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.020
 and you 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.750
 and good friends, I bring you the revised 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.530
 this cover that the company has sent us 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.710
 best and it's kind of coming back with a 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:22.140
 back cover so it does not scratch your 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.380
 iphone comes out of these sent us 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.589
 enough for the iphone 55 s already does 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.169
 some time and they work very parents are 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.990
 covers a rapting are covers that 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.940
 you need to have a screen saver 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:38.699
 you can see that it has absolutely 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.550
 nothing of relief on the table but if 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:45.449
 questions to me are from my favorites leaves 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:49.289
 you can see volume button without any 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:52.440
 lock problem of the device without 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.550
 no problem and let's go to the section on 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.649
 vibration you can see we enter without any 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.940
 problem since it is a pretty button 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.129
 big on the side 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.500
 and the connectors we can find 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.590
 our line connector on our speaker 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.440
 and our 3.5 jack completely 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.390
 discovered by the back then 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.880
 well there's nothing to say about the part 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.399
 from behind it just looks amazing 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.460
 kind of blur on our iphone 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.210
 and you can see the flash without any 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.210
 problem 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:30.140
 let's take pictures 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.140
 magic mouse photo and here 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:41.020
 a second now yes flash there is 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.690
 you can see it does not bounce the light simply 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.040
 it's quite a father the sheath this 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.920
 I repeat again they are from my covers 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.930
 I like them very much 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.880
 they protect all the iphone that's what I 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.800
 I always look for a protection cover not 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.440
 so much that it looks good but that you 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.360
