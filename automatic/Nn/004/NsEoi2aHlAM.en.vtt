00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.369 
10.1 RC 0 and also paranoid android 315

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
really makes sense to have paranoid

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.709 
really makes sense to have paranoid
android<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:49.020> run<00:00:49.289> paranoid<00:00:49.800> android<00:00:50.190> or<00:00:50.910> run<00:00:51.690> a
