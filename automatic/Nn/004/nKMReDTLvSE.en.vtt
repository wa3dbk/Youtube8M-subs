to his main base and yet again Nova
losing<00:04:56.640> his<00:04:56.820> base<00:04:57.090> so<00:04:57.660> early<00:04:58.170> on<00:04:58.350> that<00:04:58.920> is<00:04:59.040> a

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
losing his base so early on that is a

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.130 
losing his base so early on that is a
major<00:04:59.430> major<00:04:59.820> problem<00:05:00.000> right<00:05:00.540> now<00:05:00.570> now<00:05:01.080> the

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140

these buildings hopefully those early
let's<00:05:08.370> try<00:05:08.460> to<00:05:08.520> go<00:05:08.640> for<00:05:08.790> that<00:05:08.880> as<00:05:09.000> well<00:05:09.030> couples

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
let's try to go for that as well couples

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.760 
let's try to go for that as well couples
Earthlings<00:05:10.110> and<00:05:10.230> they're<00:05:10.380> just<00:05:10.500> gonna<00:05:10.680> be

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
Earthlings and they're just gonna be

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.350 
Earthlings and they're just gonna be
trying<00:05:10.980> to<00:05:11.010> bust<00:05:11.250> through<00:05:11.430> into<00:05:11.760> Tasha's<00:05:12.180> base

and<00:05:12.600> this<00:05:12.960> is<00:05:13.140> the<00:05:13.230> problem<00:05:13.440> it<00:05:13.680> does<00:05:13.980> look

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
and this is the problem it does look

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.340 
and this is the problem it does look
like<00:05:14.250> Tosh<00:05:14.640> will<00:05:15.210> be<00:05:15.330> losing<00:05:15.870> that<00:05:16.020> front<00:05:16.260> of

like Tosh will be losing that front of

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.330 
like Tosh will be losing that front of
all<00:05:16.470> off<00:05:16.620> and<00:05:16.740> that's<00:05:16.890> going<00:05:17.070> to<00:05:17.130> allow<00:05:17.250> the

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
all off and that's going to allow the

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.010 
all off and that's going to allow the
speedlings<00:05:17.880> and<00:05:18.030> hellions<00:05:18.360> to<00:05:18.480> just<00:05:18.630> push<00:05:18.870> on

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020

very effective early game aggression is

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.050 
very effective early game aggression is
