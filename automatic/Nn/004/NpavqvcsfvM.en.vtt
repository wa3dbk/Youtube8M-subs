the<00:01:10.920> came<00:01:11.100> up<00:01:11.250> higher<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.299> gets<00:01:12.479> pretty

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
the came up higher so it gets pretty

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.530 
the came up higher so it gets pretty
much<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.380> entire<00:01:13.470> screen<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.610> if<00:01:15.420> you're

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
much the entire screen and if you're

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.390 
much the entire screen and if you're
using<00:01:15.720> an<00:01:15.900> ipod<00:01:16.500> you're<00:01:17.009> going<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.189> want<00:01:17.310> to

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
using an ipod you're going to want to

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.260 
using an ipod you're going to want to
keep<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.290> screen<00:01:19.290> lower<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.729> you're<00:01:21.060> going<00:01:21.150> to

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
keep the screen lower so you're going to

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.289 
keep the screen lower so you're going to
want<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.799> maybe<00:01:22.799> make<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.520> box<00:01:23.790> or<00:01:24.090> whatever

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
want to maybe make the box or whatever

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.810 
want to maybe make the box or whatever
is<00:01:24.390> holding<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.750> up<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.930> lot<00:01:25.140> lower<00:01:25.950> just<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:26.759> you

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
is holding it up a lot lower just so you

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.410 
is holding it up a lot lower just so you
can<00:01:27.000> get<00:01:27.210> more<00:01:28.430> closer<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.850> screen<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.390> you

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
can get more closer to the screen so you

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.260 
can get more closer to the screen so you
get<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.750> tire<00:01:31.590> screen<00:01:32.040> up<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:33.150> know

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
get the tire screen up to the you know

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.990 
get the tire screen up to the you know
camera<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.990> then<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.250> want<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.520> want<00:01:35.939> to

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
camera and then you just want to want to

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.039 
camera and then you just want to want to
take<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.180> ruler<00:01:36.479> out<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:38.310> extends<00:01:39.060> out<00:01:39.420> over

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
take a ruler out so it extends out over

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.840 
take a ruler out so it extends out over
the<00:01:40.170> camera<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:41.159> you're<00:01:41.310> not<00:01:41.430> going<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.670> have

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
the camera so you're not going to have

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.149 
the camera so you're not going to have
to<00:01:42.119> have<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.990> like<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.409> you're<00:01:43.770> not<00:01:43.920> like

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
to have it like this so you're not like

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.090 
to have it like this so you're not like
holding<00:01:45.090> over<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.530> can<00:01:46.770> pretty<00:01:47.009> much

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
holding over it so you can pretty much

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.460 
holding over it so you can pretty much
just<00:01:47.369> move<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.820> out<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:48.540> extended<00:01:49.110> over

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
just move it out so it's extended over

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.069 
just move it out so it's extended over
it<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:50.119> if<00:01:51.119> you're<00:01:51.299> sitting<00:01:51.450> at<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.720> angle<00:01:51.990> i

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
it and if you're sitting at the angle i

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.450 
it and if you're sitting at the angle i
do<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.470> should<00:01:52.619> give<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.890> some<00:01:52.920> sort<00:01:53.399> of

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
do this should give you some sort of

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.550 
do this should give you some sort of
playing<00:01:54.060> room<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.020> don't<00:01:55.229> really<00:01:55.290> have<00:01:55.470> to

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
playing room so you don't really have to

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.990 
playing room so you don't really have to
