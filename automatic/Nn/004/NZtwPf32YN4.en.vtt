here<00:00:25.400> good<00:00:26.400> tip<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.269> crack<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.720> eggs<00:00:28.189> on<00:00:29.189> a

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
here good tip is to crack the eggs on a

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.769 
here good tip is to crack the eggs on a
flat<00:00:29.550> surface<00:00:29.789> not<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.330> edge<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.599> bowl

flat surface not in the edge of the bowl

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.690 
flat surface not in the edge of the bowl
and<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.380> reduce<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.040> chance<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.550> getting

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
and you reduce the chance of getting

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.400 
and you reduce the chance of getting
eggshell<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.750> mix<00:00:35.510> okay<00:00:36.510> now<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.140> I'm

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
eggshell in the mix okay now to that I'm

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.310 
eggshell in the mix okay now to that I'm
going<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.649> add<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:38.160> touch<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:38.910> milk<00:00:39.210> some<00:00:40.020> double

and then just give it a light whisk

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.240 
and then just give it a light whisk
I<00:00:59.450> don't<00:01:00.050> know<00:01:00.110> whisk<00:01:00.320> this<00:01:00.440> too<00:01:00.770> much<00:01:00.980> don't

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
I don't know whisk this too much don't

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.680 
I don't know whisk this too much don't
incorporate<00:01:01.520> too<00:01:01.880> much<00:01:02.030> air<00:01:02.240> into<00:01:02.480> the

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
incorporate too much air into the

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.920 
incorporate too much air into the
mixture<00:01:03.460> and<00:01:04.460> then<00:01:07.150> just<00:01:08.150> place<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:08.750> bowl

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
mixture and then just place the bowl

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.950 
mixture and then just place the bowl
over<00:01:09.400> a<00:01:10.400> pan<00:01:10.460> a<00:01:10.700> very<00:01:11.060> lightly<00:01:11.270> simmer<00:01:11.570> water

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
over a pan a very lightly simmer water

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.880 
over a pan a very lightly simmer water
there<00:01:14.960> all<00:01:15.050> you<00:01:15.170> need<00:01:15.320> to<00:01:15.410> do<00:01:15.560> is<00:01:15.650> just<00:01:15.800> be

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
there all you need to do is just be

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.300 
there all you need to do is just be
patient<00:01:15.920> and<00:01:16.520> stir<00:01:20.110> so<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.200> idea<00:01:21.530> here<00:01:21.560> is<00:01:22.040> to

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
patient and stir so the idea here is to

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.520 
patient and stir so the idea here is to
click<00:01:22.610> these<00:01:22.790> eggs<00:01:22.970> low<00:01:23.300> and<00:01:23.600> slow<00:01:23.869> and<00:01:24.350> that's

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
click these eggs low and slow and that's

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.230 
click these eggs low and slow and that's
why<00:01:24.740> I'm<00:01:24.860> putting<00:01:25.040> it<00:01:25.190> in<00:01:25.250> a<00:01:25.280> bowl<00:01:25.490> set<00:01:25.970> under

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
why I'm putting it in a bowl set under

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.430 
why I'm putting it in a bowl set under
the<00:01:26.330> water<00:01:26.540> there's<00:01:26.840> a<00:01:26.869> much<00:01:27.020> more<00:01:27.200> delicate

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
the water there's a much more delicate

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.580 
the water there's a much more delicate
heat<00:01:27.890> we're<00:01:28.580> looking<00:01:28.970> for<00:01:29.210> is<00:01:29.450> that<00:01:30.350> egg

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
heat we're looking for is that egg

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.010 
heat we're looking for is that egg
mixture<00:01:31.009> to<00:01:31.100> start<00:01:31.430> to<00:01:31.550> thicken<00:01:31.840> almost<00:01:32.840> to<00:01:32.990> a

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
mixture to start to thicken almost to a

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.139 
mixture to start to thicken almost to a
custard<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:33.770> then<00:01:33.979> form<00:01:34.369> very<00:01:34.640> delicate

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
custard and then form very delicate

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.840 
custard and then form very delicate
creamy<00:01:35.450> lumps<00:01:35.869> in<00:01:35.990> it<00:01:36.140> it<00:01:36.770> should<00:01:37.130> take<00:01:37.460> about

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
creamy lumps in it it should take about

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.749
