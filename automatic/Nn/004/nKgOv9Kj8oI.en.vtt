like on a real ship you even move the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.260 
like on a real ship you even move the
roof<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.560> see<00:01:31.770> inside<00:01:32.130> got<00:01:33.060> some

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
double doors leading up and I know that

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.670 
double doors leading up and I know that
he's<00:01:47.130> not<00:01:47.610> entirely<00:01:48.149> accurate<00:01:48.710> but<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:50.130> can

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
he's not entirely accurate but you can

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:59.590 
he's not entirely accurate but you can
move<00:01:52.680> these<00:01:54.530> ropes<00:01:55.530> wrote<00:01:56.399> pieces<00:01:57.110> to<00:01:58.110> access

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
move these ropes wrote pieces to access

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.069 
move these ropes wrote pieces to access
the<00:02:00.619> luggage<00:02:01.619> compartment<00:02:02.570> normally<00:02:03.570> in<00:02:03.810> real

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
the luggage compartment normally in real

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.830 
the luggage compartment normally in real
ships<00:02:04.409> they<00:02:05.159> store<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.670> luggage<00:02:06.030> below<00:02:06.600> deck

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
ships they store the luggage below deck

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.160 
ships they store the luggage below deck
that's<00:02:07.740> here<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.390> didn't<00:02:09.390> have<00:02:09.509> enough<00:02:09.899> space

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
that's here I didn't have enough space

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.890 
that's here I didn't have enough space
so<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.979> just<00:02:11.700> filled<00:02:11.970> up<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.540> space

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
so I just filled up the space

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.399 
so I just filled up the space
on<00:02:13.019> top<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.500> deck<00:02:14.480> he<00:02:15.480> stored<00:02:16.349> the

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
on top of the deck he stored the

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:21.619 
on top of the deck he stored the
suitcases<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.430> he<00:02:18.209> larger<00:02:18.989> items<00:02:20.599> then<00:02:21.599> you

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
suitcases and he larger items then you

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.979 
suitcases and he larger items then you
close<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.819> secure<00:02:23.819> it<00:02:24.000> with<00:02:24.180> some<00:02:25.019> ropes

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
close that and secure it with some ropes

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.420 
close that and secure it with some ropes
because<00:02:27.989> you<00:02:28.170> don't<00:02:28.379> want<00:02:28.530> any<00:02:28.680> opening<00:02:29.129> in

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
because you don't want any opening in

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.619 
because you don't want any opening in
rough<00:02:30.299> seas<00:02:30.329> that<00:02:34.430> is<00:02:35.430> probably<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.030> least

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
rough seas that is probably the least

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.869 
rough seas that is probably the least
accurate<00:02:36.930> thing<00:02:37.409> about<00:02:37.799> my<00:02:38.129> cruise<00:02:38.430> ship<00:02:38.640> Mach

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
accurate thing about my cruise ship Mach

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.729 
accurate thing about my cruise ship Mach
but<00:02:39.450> other<00:02:39.629> than<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:39.870> it's<00:02:40.500> pretty

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
but other than that it's pretty

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:47.720 
but other than that it's pretty
realistic<00:02:42.230> so<00:02:43.230> if<00:02:43.530> we<00:02:43.829> remove<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:45.060> roof<00:02:46.730> we

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
realistic so if we remove the roof we

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.360 
realistic so if we remove the roof we
can<00:02:47.760> access<00:02:48.829> the<00:02:49.829> room<00:02:50.870> level<00:02:52.250> here's<00:02:53.250> a

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
can access the room level here's a

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:29.239 
basically all of my cruise ship Mach and
I<00:04:27.689> think<00:04:28.199> it<00:04:28.409> turned<00:04:28.590> out<00:04:28.800> pretty<00:04:28.860> well

00:04:29.239 --> 00:04:29.249 
I think it turned out pretty well

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:33.559 
I think it turned out pretty well
especially<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.629> size<00:04:30.870> of<00:04:31.110> it<00:04:31.249> I'm<00:04:32.249> I<00:04:32.699> really

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:33.569 
especially the size of it I'm I really

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:37.159 
especially the size of it I'm I really
like<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.289> color<00:04:34.529> of<00:04:34.650> it<00:04:34.919> and<00:04:35.189> I<00:04:36.180> think<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:36.990> goes

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
like the color of it and I think it goes

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:43.010 
like the color of it and I think it goes
very<00:04:37.590> well<00:04:37.770> with<00:04:38.090> what<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.719> red<00:04:40.999> so<00:04:41.999> I<00:04:42.270> hope
