00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:09.639
 gta 5 and I bring you another speed test 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.009
 and integration because we do not know if you're 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.360
 speed or slowness so here you 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.919
 I bring again another new test that I 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.550
 you asked in the comments that is the 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:21.400
 This motorcycle was created since May and the 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.020
 tractor so vote before you 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.150
 start the test first let's do 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.250
 as always a test of each to see 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.370
 against seconds it takes and we will see 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.920
 then the final race and it's like that 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.410
 make your bet before you see it and go 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.930
 to see how this ends, so let's go 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:01:01.139
 start with the bike 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:01:01.139
 [Music] 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.900
 and well there we see that it is coming 22 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:11.290
 23 24 and 25 seconds exactly that has 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.630
 taken this motorcycle stand and time has 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.250
 appeared to the golf caddy so good 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.450
 Now we go with the tractor to see how 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.890
 he is going to him 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.090
 [Music] 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:30.430
 [Applause] 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.430
 [Music] 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:44.749
 [Music] 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.409
 Y 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.729
 there goes this tractor that is pretty 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:57.509
 fat 32 seconds 7 seconds longer than 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:00.689
 motorcycle there you have it so good and 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.220
 It seems that by the time there is a 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.720
 winner but now we will see in the race 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.149
 end to see what difference there is between one 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.890
 and another one so now let's do 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.890
 to see what difference it makes 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.800
 botillo of great difference and size 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.840
 with the aphids upset are there 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.880
 prepared the bike and the tractor to see 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.340
 who starts better to see who wins 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.350
 although already by the time already it is deduced 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.989
 this so there they are going to take and the 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.540
 tractor seems to have a starter 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.180
 better the motorcycle follows you there so 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.459
 bera bera bera bera but you already take it 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.230
 It has a very high speed 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.090
 greater than the treatment of the tractor that 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.890
 devote then to what you have to 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.569
 dedicate ourselves to go for the field 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.630
 picking me up I know what I have to 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.670
 so pick up the bike the bike there because 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.100
 the weight also influences no is not what 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.410
 same an uncle that with 20 kilos that 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.040
 run with anointing or it will be a good boy a 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.570
 uncle of 50 kilos to a uncle of one thousand 120 not 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.940
 who is going to run more more then this 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.650
 it's the same thing we have the skinny little 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.010
 way and then there is the tractor that is 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.250
 there 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.840
 record etc so here you have it wins 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.489
 the bike and for the next episode 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.390
 saying the comments to whom 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.340
 he wants me to compare, it's worth as you see 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.230
 CadÃ­ and the bike have been the fastest 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.030
 up to now the series so 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.829
 We will take the following episodes of 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.840
 the comments that you want to see so 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.910
 then in the afternoon 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.620
