00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
back is going to be rough IL he's

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.970 
back is going to be rough IL he's
probably<00:00:42.930> our<00:00:43.140> best<00:00:43.260> right<00:00:43.500> back<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.920> I

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
probably our best right back and I

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.040 
probably our best right back and I
really<00:00:44.340> do<00:00:44.460> like<00:00:44.489> him<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.450> think<00:00:45.629> he's<00:00:45.899> going

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
really do like him so I think he's going

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.110

to<00:00:46.110> be<00:00:46.170> staying<00:00:46.440> at<00:00:47.070> right<00:00:47.460> back<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.850> don't

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
to be staying at right back I don't

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.100 
to be staying at right back I don't
think<00:00:48.180> we'll<00:00:48.360> be<00:00:48.420> getting<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.690> new<00:00:48.719> centre-back

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
think we'll be getting a new centre-back

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.650 
think we'll be getting a new centre-back
right<00:00:49.890> back<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.100> mean<00:00:50.280> for<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.120> centre-back<00:00:51.510> I

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
right back I mean for the centre-back I

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.299 
right back I mean for the centre-back I
know<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.960> might<00:00:52.050> be<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.230> big<00:00:52.500> long<00:00:52.710> shot<00:00:53.039> but<00:00:53.250> I

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
know it might be a big long shot but I

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.639 
know it might be a big long shot but I
think<00:00:53.579> Hamas<00:00:53.879> will<00:00:54.239> be<00:00:54.360> joining<00:00:54.570> my<00:00:54.780> united<00:00:55.230> we

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
think Hamas will be joining my united we

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.220 
think Hamas will be joining my united we
put<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> late<00:00:56.160> bid<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:57.180> think<00:00:57.480> 21<00:00:57.960> million

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
put in a late bid for think 21 million

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.569 
put in a late bid for think 21 million
and<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.739> really<00:00:59.010> think<00:00:59.160> that's<00:00:59.370> going<00:00:59.520> to

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
and I really think that's going to

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.250 
and I really think that's going to
happen<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.300> would<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.449> such<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> boost

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
happen and that would be such a boost

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.650 
happen and that would be such a boost
because<00:01:01.469> we<00:01:01.710> need<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> new<00:01:02.160> centre-back<00:01:02.660> sure

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
because we need a new centre-back sure

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.719 
because we need a new centre-back sure
definitely<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.680> going<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.979> join<00:01:05.159> because

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
really thing that's going to be a

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.490

gonna<00:01:42.600> be<00:01:42.689> playing<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.020> lot<00:01:43.229> with<00:01:43.259> van<00:01:43.680> Persie

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
gonna be playing a lot with van Persie

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.999 
gonna be playing a lot with van Persie
up<00:01:44.100> front<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:45.390> think<00:01:46.020> he's<00:01:46.470> going<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.740> drop

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
up front and I think he's going to drop

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.830 
up front and I think he's going to drop
more<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.670> midfield<00:01:48.030> because<00:01:48.390> when<00:01:48.659> Gail

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
more to the midfield because when Gail

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.090 
more to the midfield because when Gail
said<00:01:49.079> he<00:01:49.170> won't<00:01:49.290> simply<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.740> more<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.070> a

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
said he won't simply a more like a

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.580 
said he won't simply a more like a
skulls<00:01:50.549> then<00:01:51.149> more<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> striker<00:01:52.290> like

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
skulls then more like a striker like

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.020 
skulls then more like a striker like
he's<00:01:52.740> been<00:01:52.920> playing<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.820> would<00:01:53.909> be<00:01:53.939> a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
he's been playing so that would be a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.660 
he's been playing so that would be a
good<00:01:54.210> thing<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.810> think<00:01:55.799> here<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.100> going<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.520> be

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
good thing I think here is going to be

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.910 
good thing I think here is going to be
videl<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.329> was<00:01:57.659> going<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.930> put<00:01:58.020> cruise<00:01:58.320> but<00:01:58.649> we

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
videl I was going to put cruise but we

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.139 
videl I was going to put cruise but we
don't<00:01:59.130> think<00:01:59.310> that's<00:01:59.460> happening<00:01:59.610> without

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
don't think that's happening without

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.200 
don't think that's happening without
might<00:02:00.869> be<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.380> really<00:02:02.100> difficult<00:02:02.399> transfer<00:02:03.060> to

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
might be a really difficult transfer to

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.149 
might be a really difficult transfer to
get<00:02:03.360> him<00:02:03.540> could<00:02:03.990> we<00:02:04.079> have<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.259> pay<00:02:04.409> like<00:02:04.590> 45

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
get him could we have to pay like 45

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.819 
get him could we have to pay like 45
million<00:02:05.369> plus<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.850> nany<00:02:06.000> but<00:02:06.869> if<00:02:07.259> that

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
million plus and nany but if that

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.889 
million plus and nany but if that
happens<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.399> be<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.580> great<00:02:09.030> boost<00:02:09.270> for<00:02:09.420> United

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
happens that be a great boost for United

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.449 
happens that be a great boost for United
because<00:02:10.140> then<00:02:10.319> they<00:02:10.440> have<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.619> solid<00:02:10.950> midfield

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
because then they have a solid midfield

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.400 
because then they have a solid midfield
and<00:02:11.670> there<00:02:11.790> were<00:02:11.849> enough<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.060> play<00:02:12.270> Carrick

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
and there were enough to play Carrick

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.320 
and there were enough to play Carrick
was<00:02:13.500> going<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.770> put<00:02:13.890> Fellaini<00:02:14.190> there<00:02:14.520> but<00:02:15.060> I

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
was going to put Fellaini there but I

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.630 
was going to put Fellaini there but I
think<00:02:16.290> he's<00:02:16.410> going<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.560> get<00:02:16.710> sold<00:02:17.010> for<00:02:17.220> like<00:02:17.310> 12

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
think he's going to get sold for like 12

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.370 
think he's going to get sold for like 12
million<00:02:17.880> just<00:02:18.330> because<00:02:18.570> Rangel<00:02:19.020> don't<00:02:19.260> like

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
million just because Rangel don't like

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.920 
million just because Rangel don't like
him<00:02:19.590> on<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.310> wing<00:02:20.490> it's<00:02:20.850> no<00:02:21.060> other<00:02:21.330> matter<00:02:21.600> I

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
him on the wing it's no other matter I

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.450 
him on the wing it's no other matter I
really<00:02:22.290> think<00:02:22.410> this<00:02:22.590> year<00:02:22.800> matters<00:02:23.190> gonna<00:02:23.370> be

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
really think this year matters gonna be

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.010 
really think this year matters gonna be
playing<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.730> lot<00:02:23.970> more<00:02:24.150> on<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.480> left<00:02:24.720> hand<00:02:24.900> side

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
playing a lot more on the left hand side

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.250 
playing a lot more on the left hand side
on<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:26.160> play<00:02:26.640> than<00:02:27.300> in<00:02:27.540> sentiment<00:02:28.020> field

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
on the play than in sentiment field

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.130 
on the play than in sentiment field
because<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.830> think<00:02:29.160> Rooney<00:02:29.970> preferred<00:02:30.840> being

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
because I think Rooney preferred being

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.540 
because I think Rooney preferred being
in<00:02:31.320> center<00:02:31.620> midfield<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.070> lot<00:02:32.310> more<00:02:32.490> than

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
in center midfield a lot more than

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.550 
in center midfield a lot more than
matter<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.300> he<00:02:33.600> actually<00:02:33.750> performs<00:02:34.260> really

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
matter and he actually performs really

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.830 
matter and he actually performs really
well<00:02:34.740> with<00:02:35.130> matter<00:02:35.370> up<00:02:35.850> front<00:02:36.210> it's<00:02:36.420> no<00:02:36.600> other

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
well with matter up front it's no other

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.920 
well with matter up front it's no other
than<00:02:37.140> Robin<00:02:37.590> van<00:02:37.860> Persie<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:39.120> striker<00:02:39.660> that

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
than Robin van Persie the striker that

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.380 
than Robin van Persie the striker that
was<00:02:40.050> amazing<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:41.070> world<00:02:41.280> cup<00:02:41.490> and<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:42.000> really
