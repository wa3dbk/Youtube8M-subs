00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
that was like a yellow light bulb

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.150 
that was like a yellow light bulb
looking<00:00:14.580> thing<00:00:14.790> with<00:00:14.969> an<00:00:15.120> X<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:16.160> it's

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
looking thing with an X in it and it's

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.740 
looking thing with an X in it and it's
been<00:00:17.430> there<00:00:17.580> for<00:00:17.789> quite<00:00:18.000> some<00:00:18.210> time<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:18.720> I

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
been there for quite some time so I

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.939 
been there for quite some time so I
spent<00:00:19.109> some<00:00:19.199> time<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:20.330> I<00:00:21.350> had<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.380> look<00:00:22.800> at

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
spent some time and I had to look at

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.000 
spent some time and I had to look at
every<00:00:23.220> single<00:00:23.430> light<00:00:24.240> bulb<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.720> see<00:00:24.930> what<00:00:25.199> was

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
every single light bulb to see what was

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.890 
every single light bulb to see what was
possibly<00:00:26.910> burned<00:00:27.240> out<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:29.330> found<00:00:30.330> out<00:00:30.570> that

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
possibly burned out and found out that

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.030 
possibly burned out and found out that
what<00:00:31.590> was<00:00:31.740> burned<00:00:31.980> out<00:00:32.189> was<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.829> light<00:00:34.829> bulb

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
what was burned out was this light bulb

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.860 
what was burned out was this light bulb
that<00:00:35.160> goes<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.700> here<00:00:35.840> which<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.050> consider<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.219> a

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
that goes in here which I consider is a

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.410 
that goes in here which I consider is a
running<00:00:39.870> light<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.430> so<00:00:41.430> trying<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.239> figure

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
running light and so trying to figure

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.830 
running light and so trying to figure
out<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.620> 2008<00:00:45.110> out<00:00:46.110> ett<00:00:47.750> trying<00:00:48.750> to

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
out this is a 2008 out ett trying to

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.920 
out this is a 2008 out ett trying to
figure<00:00:49.079> out<00:00:49.370> how<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.399> could<00:00:50.610> get<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.750> that

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
figure out how I could get that to that

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.430 
figure out how I could get that to that
light<00:00:52.260> bulb<00:00:52.969> hoping<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.180> maybe<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.780> would

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
light bulb hoping that maybe I would

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.889 
light bulb hoping that maybe I would
just<00:00:55.469> be<00:00:55.800> able<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.010> get<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.670> right<00:00:57.660> through

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
just be able to get to it right through

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.930 
just be able to get to it right through
here<00:00:58.410> but<00:00:59.250> as<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.969> can<00:01:00.120> see<00:01:00.180> there<00:01:00.989> really<00:01:01.940> you

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
here but as you can see there really you

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.270 
here but as you can see there really you
know<00:01:03.059> here's<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.449> plug<00:01:03.660> for<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.110> power<00:01:04.320> for

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
know here's the plug for the power for

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.660 
know here's the plug for the power for
the<00:01:05.369> light<00:01:05.549> bulbs<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.350> it<00:01:07.350> there's<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.310> real

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
the light bulbs and it there's a real

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.980 
the light bulbs and it there's a real
easy<00:01:08.939> way<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.659> get<00:01:10.020> into<00:01:10.290> into<00:01:10.710> there<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.990> so

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
easy way to get into into there and so

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.780 
easy way to get into into there and so
you<00:01:13.500> know<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.680> could<00:01:13.890> pull<00:01:14.100> these<00:01:14.280> things<00:01:14.520> off

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
you know you could pull these things off

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.899 
you know you could pull these things off
and<00:01:15.119> get<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.290> some<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.740> area<00:01:17.070> but<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
and get to some of the area but the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.120 
and get to some of the area but the
easiest<00:01:18.330> way<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.630> discovered<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.500> take<00:01:19.860> care<00:01:20.100> of

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
easiest way I discovered to take care of

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.810 
easiest way I discovered to take care of
this<00:01:20.369> was<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:21.500> actually<00:01:22.500> take<00:01:23.270> out<00:01:24.320> this<00:01:25.320> whole

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
this was to actually take out this whole

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.990 
this was to actually take out this whole
piece<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:27.180> whole<00:01:27.390> piece<00:01:28.549> come<00:01:29.549> straight<00:01:29.970> out

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
piece this whole piece come straight out

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.420 
piece this whole piece come straight out
and<00:01:30.950> how<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.009> get<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.490> out<00:01:32.659> is<00:01:33.659> not<00:01:34.189> real<00:01:35.189> easy

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
and how you get it out is not real easy

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.670 
and how you get it out is not real easy
but<00:01:35.850> I'll<00:01:36.060> give<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.329> an<00:01:36.420> example<00:01:36.720> here<00:01:37.020> this

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
but I'll give you an example here this

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.280 
but I'll give you an example here this
piece<00:01:38.579> right<00:01:38.820> here<00:01:39.079> does<00:01:40.079> come<00:01:40.950> off<00:01:41.159> and

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
piece right here does come off and

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.410 
piece right here does come off and
there's<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.500> hit<00:01:44.070> there's<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.549> snap<00:01:44.880> right<00:01:45.090> here

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
there's a hit there's a snap right here

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.010 
there's a hit there's a snap right here
and<00:01:45.619> then<00:01:46.619> there's<00:01:46.920> two<00:01:47.700> snaps<00:01:48.030> one<00:01:48.420> here<00:01:48.810> in

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
and then there's two snaps one here in

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.469 
and then there's two snaps one here in
one<00:01:49.290> here<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.829> then<00:01:50.520> there's<00:01:50.759> like<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:51.000> hinge

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
one here and then there's like a hinge

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.130 
one here and then there's like a hinge
sort<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.229> setup<00:01:52.560> here<00:01:53.369> here<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:54.479> important

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
sort of setup here here it's important

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.010 
sort of setup here here it's important
if<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.560> get<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.890> off<00:01:56.329> because<00:01:57.329> there's

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
if you can get that off because there's

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.350 
if you can get that off because there's
a<00:01:58.140> screw<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> screw<00:01:58.890> that's<00:01:59.399> back<00:01:59.670> behind<00:01:59.909> here

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
a screw a screw that's back behind here

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.020 
a screw a screw that's back behind here
that<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.689> need<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.990> loosen<00:02:01.170> up<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:02.250> help<00:02:02.579> free

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
that you need to loosen up to help free

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.660 
that you need to loosen up to help free
this<00:02:03.240> up<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:04.590> other<00:02:04.619> one<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.040> helps<00:02:05.460> free

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
this up the other one that helps free

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.199 
this up the other one that helps free
this<00:02:05.850> up<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.329> little<00:02:07.170> screw<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.520> down

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
this up is a little screw that is down

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.479 
this up is a little screw that is down
inside<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.810> hole<00:02:10.020> there<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:11.099> could<00:02:11.280> see

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
inside that hole there and you could see

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.170 
inside that hole there and you could see
that<00:02:11.520> screw<00:02:12.030> so<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.989> know

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
that screw so you know

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.899 
that screw so you know
have<00:02:13.329> to<00:02:13.450> take<00:02:13.659> it<00:02:13.810> out<00:02:13.959> you<00:02:13.989> just<00:02:14.349> need<00:02:14.590> to

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
have to take it out you just need to

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.630 
have to take it out you just need to
unloosen<00:02:15.909> enough<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.920> that<00:02:18.099> way<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.310> could

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
unloosen enough so that way you could

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.209 
unloosen enough so that way you could
just<00:02:18.879> slide<00:02:19.209> right<00:02:19.510> out<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.959> then<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.040> last

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:21.219 
just slide right out and then the last

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:23.880 
just slide right out and then the last
screw<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.329> thought<00:02:22.989> this<00:02:23.140> was<00:02:23.379> one<00:02:23.590> of<00:02:23.620> them<00:02:23.799> but

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
screw I thought this was one of them but

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.670 
screw I thought this was one of them but
it's<00:02:24.040> not<00:02:24.219> is<00:02:24.489> this<00:02:25.329> screw<00:02:25.659> right<00:02:25.689> here<00:02:25.870> this

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
it's not is this screw right here this

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.119 
it's not is this screw right here this
one<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.640> just<00:02:27.879> unscrew<00:02:28.180> that<00:02:28.540> one<00:02:29.129> you

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
one you just unscrew that one you

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.690 
one you just unscrew that one you
unscrew<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:31.780> screw<00:02:32.109> that's<00:02:32.950> down<00:02:33.250> in<00:02:33.280> there

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
unscrew this screw that's down in there

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.729 
unscrew this screw that's down in there
loosen<00:02:34.269> it<00:02:34.389> up<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.750> then<00:02:35.409> there's<00:02:35.590> another

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
loosen it up and then there's another

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.509 
loosen it up and then there's another
one<00:02:36.010> that's<00:02:36.370> like<00:02:36.730> this<00:02:37.090> that's<00:02:37.920> back<00:02:38.920> in<00:02:38.950> here

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
one that's like this that's back in here

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.819 
one that's like this that's back in here
behind<00:02:39.670> this<00:02:39.969> cover<00:02:40.239> I've<00:02:40.959> snapped<00:02:41.379> this<00:02:41.590> back

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
behind this cover I've snapped this back

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.679 
behind this cover I've snapped this back
into<00:02:42.040> place<00:02:42.129> so<00:02:42.579> I<00:02:42.639> don't<00:02:42.670> want<00:02:42.909> to<00:02:43.000> try<00:02:43.659> to

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:43.689 
into place so I don't want to try to

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.729 
into place so I don't want to try to
take<00:02:43.989> it<00:02:44.049> off<00:02:44.849> you<00:02:45.849> can<00:02:45.879> probably<00:02:46.419> get<00:02:46.959> to<00:02:47.470> this

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
take it off you can probably get to this

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.970 
take it off you can probably get to this
grew<00:02:48.099> back<00:02:48.340> here<00:02:48.730> through<00:02:49.629> this<00:02:50.909> area<00:02:52.980> right

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
grew back here through this area right

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.729 
grew back here through this area right
in<00:02:54.159> here<00:02:54.250> you<00:02:55.209> could<00:02:55.720> kind<00:02:55.959> of<00:02:56.049> see<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.439> screw

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
in here you could kind of see the screw

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.849 
in here you could kind of see the screw
that's<00:02:56.980> back<00:02:57.280> in<00:02:57.310> there<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:58.379> you<00:02:59.379> might<00:02:59.680> be

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
that's back in there and you might be

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.429 
that's back in there and you might be
able<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.099> get<00:03:00.219> to<00:03:00.370> it<00:03:00.489> that<00:03:00.669> way<00:03:00.849> but<00:03:01.079> in<00:03:02.079> case

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.439 
able to get to it that way but in case

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.259 
able to get to it that way but in case
you<00:03:02.620> can't<00:03:02.859> get<00:03:03.040> this<00:03:03.280> off<00:03:03.549> because<00:03:03.819> when<00:03:04.180> you

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
you can't get this off because when you

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.110 
you can't get this off because when you
try<00:03:04.480> to<00:03:04.510> get<00:03:04.719> this<00:03:04.930> off<00:03:05.169> this<00:03:05.469> piece<00:03:05.680> here

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
try to get this off this piece here

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.509 
try to get this off this piece here
these<00:03:07.120> two<00:03:07.450> snaps<00:03:07.840> that<00:03:08.079> are<00:03:08.139> in<00:03:08.290> here<00:03:08.519> behind

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
these two snaps that are in here behind

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.940 
these two snaps that are in here behind
here<00:03:09.810> probably<00:03:10.810> are<00:03:10.959> going<00:03:11.079> to<00:03:11.139> break<00:03:11.379> off<00:03:11.650> I

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
here probably are going to break off I

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.940 
here probably are going to break off I
did<00:03:12.819> end<00:03:13.030> up<00:03:13.150> breaking<00:03:13.419> one<00:03:13.750> off<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.769> the

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
did end up breaking one off and the

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.569 
did end up breaking one off and the
other<00:03:15.099> one<00:03:15.310> it's<00:03:15.459> still<00:03:15.639> intact<00:03:16.450> and<00:03:17.280> so<00:03:18.280> once

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
other one it's still intact and so once

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.080 
other one it's still intact and so once
you<00:03:18.699> get<00:03:18.849> that<00:03:18.970> off<00:03:19.349> then<00:03:20.349> you<00:03:21.010> can<00:03:21.040> loosen<00:03:21.879> the

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
you get that off then you can loosen the

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.539 
you get that off then you can loosen the
screw<00:03:22.389> that's<00:03:22.599> there<00:03:22.959> you<00:03:23.709> loosen<00:03:24.129> the<00:03:24.250> screw

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
screw that's there you loosen the screw

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.210 
screw that's there you loosen the screw
that<00:03:24.790> is<00:03:25.060> over<00:03:25.959> here<00:03:26.229> you<00:03:26.260> take<00:03:26.650> this<00:03:26.829> one<00:03:27.010> off

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
that is over here you take this one off

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.679 
that is over here you take this one off
and<00:03:27.489> then<00:03:28.150> this<00:03:28.599> piece<00:03:29.790> will<00:03:30.790> slide<00:03:31.150> out<00:03:31.389> I

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:31.689 
and then this piece will slide out I

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.319 
and then this piece will slide out I
recommend<00:03:32.260> a<00:03:32.680> course<00:03:32.919> that<00:03:33.159> you<00:03:34.139> take<00:03:35.139> this

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
recommend a course that you take this

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:42.960 
recommend a course that you take this
piece<00:03:37.329> off<00:03:37.659> just<00:03:38.819> just<00:03:39.819> snaps<00:03:40.750> off<00:03:41.699> like<00:03:42.699> that

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
piece off just just snaps off like that

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.949 
piece off just just snaps off like that
and<00:03:44.759> then<00:03:45.759> of<00:03:46.030> course<00:03:46.239> you<00:03:46.389> could<00:03:46.540> snap<00:03:46.780> it

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
and then of course you could snap it

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.649 
and then of course you could snap it
back<00:03:46.989> on<00:03:47.290> but<00:03:47.859> you<00:03:48.849> know<00:03:48.909> and<00:03:49.060> snap<00:03:49.269> that<00:03:49.299> and

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
back on but you know and snap that and

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:57.869 
back on but you know and snap that and
this<00:03:52.659> piece<00:03:52.959> can<00:03:53.199> just<00:03:53.409> stay<00:03:53.590> on<00:03:54.449> and<00:03:56.220> then<00:03:57.220> you

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
this piece can just stay on and then you

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.999 
this piece can just stay on and then you
just<00:03:57.989> you<00:03:58.989> pull<00:03:59.290> this<00:03:59.849> completely<00:04:00.849> out<00:04:01.000> and

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:02.009 
just you pull this completely out and

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:05.369 
just you pull this completely out and
this<00:04:03.009> piece<00:04:03.310> with<00:04:03.549> this<00:04:03.729> plastic<00:04:04.000> cover<00:04:04.479> that

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
this piece with this plastic cover that

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.770 
this piece with this plastic cover that
I<00:04:05.409> took<00:04:05.500> off<00:04:05.829> here<00:04:06.129> you'll<00:04:07.030> discover<00:04:07.389> that

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
I took off here you'll discover that

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.379 
I took off here you'll discover that
there's<00:04:08.229> two<00:04:09.040> more<00:04:09.310> of<00:04:09.579> these<00:04:09.790> that<00:04:10.359> are

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
there's two more of these that are

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.740 
there's two more of these that are
smaller<00:04:10.870> on<00:04:11.199> the<00:04:11.259> underside<00:04:12.250> of<00:04:12.280> this<00:04:12.579> and<00:04:12.879> so

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
smaller on the underside of this and so

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.610 
smaller on the underside of this and so
you<00:04:14.169> just

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
you just

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.300

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
pulled it off in order to get to the to

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.570 
pulled it off in order to get to the to
this<00:04:21.489> particular<00:04:22.030> bulb<00:04:22.420> and<00:04:23.250> there<00:04:24.250> is<00:04:24.370> sort

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
this particular bulb and there is sort

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.070 
this particular bulb and there is sort
of<00:04:24.610> like<00:04:24.700> a<00:04:25.110> stick<00:04:26.110> that's<00:04:26.890> up<00:04:27.160> inside<00:04:27.520> there<00:04:27.850> I

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
of like a stick that's up inside there I

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.690 
of like a stick that's up inside there I
didn't<00:04:29.080> know<00:04:29.110> what<00:04:29.290> it<00:04:29.380> was<00:04:29.530> at<00:04:29.680> first<00:04:29.920> but<00:04:30.190> you

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
made a mistake because I couldn't find

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.440 
made a mistake because I couldn't find
anything<00:04:50.590> that<00:04:50.770> really<00:04:51.280> talked<00:04:51.520> about<00:04:51.700> you

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
know how to get this out is that you

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.120 
know how to get this out is that you
really<00:04:54.880> have<00:04:55.030> to<00:04:55.300> pull<00:04:55.960> this<00:04:56.170> thing<00:04:56.440> straight

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130
