00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.000
 case extractions 10lot - of the special we will make an exception 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.169
 thank you very much 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:14.189
 but I must warn you that it is a girl 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:18.439
 we say rather particular that it means particular 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.039
 please don't misunderstand me it's the best researcher we have 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.890
 good morning the species 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.829
 good morning 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:34.829
 10 front 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.330
 transcription of his sms 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.870
 the weather 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.640
 bank statements 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.690
 how this documentation arrived 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.690
 they are not made only she orders I advise respect 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.150
 what else can you tell me about opening this dossier tunnel effect 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.880
 I summarize in a few words 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.970
 mikael blomkvist and nicknamed calle blog seen since he solved the case 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.510
 of some robberies in the 80s since then he is a public figure that has very few 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.830
 networks lost a lot of news wasted newspaper clippings 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.100
 few secrets means that secrets anyway 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.870
 everyone has secrets 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.720
 to what extent he believes he is struck by the millennium crisis from the point of 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.800
 financial view in the end 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.540
 it is all written in the price-happiness relationship who would not be 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.860
 by chance there is something you would like to add 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.440
 maybe even a little more personal reflection 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.420
 something is wrong with the press 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.380
 she says 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.610
 there is more than what appears below, he asked me about blogs having seen it 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.010
 sea â€‹â€‹view work place 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.420
 but I would be very interested in knowing your personal opinion on this 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.869
 I saw it as a political topic 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.129
 I didn't find anything on him. It's completely clean 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.169
 I don't think he made the evidence against streaming females 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.379
 I think they screwed her 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.379
 almost always playing Libyans is not water 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.969
 I remember you 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:32.449
 analytics 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:33.950
 I never had 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.339
 of children 

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:37.809
 she was the light of my eyes 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:40.099
 a smart cute girl 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.099
 for me it was like my daughter 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.209
 that happened to her 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.959
 I believe he was killed 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.459
 killed 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.069
 this 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.229
 and the family cutters 

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:05.319
 my family 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:11.739
 September 22, 1967 we were gathered free one of those detestable annual meeting 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.429
 in which family affairs were discussed 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:18.449
 exemplary torrent of humanity, very emis killa 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.109
 who fight for a slice a little bigger than cake 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.419
 of these people 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:31.249
 he killed air 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.969
 that day was the Harlequin children's day he was 16 years old 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.299
 the ink in the box acquires a way to see the parade on the road 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.299
 main hdr photography on a local newspaper 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:47.189
 he came home 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:49.879
 around 2 pm 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.999
 he came to me and I wanted to talk to you 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:55.999
 but I was too busy with the meeting 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.479
 how she was killed 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:03.539
 nobody knows 

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:04.979
 has disappeared into thin air
