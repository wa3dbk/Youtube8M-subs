00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 Well, today I bring you a 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.020
 pretty pretty good tweet is very 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.929
 simple but I think it is very effective 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.240
 with this tweet that is called with post 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.429
 look for it with that name inside cydia e 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.440
 install you will be able to do what 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.410
 next let's suppose that you are 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.660
 a person who likes to use some 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.340
 type of application where you have to 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.949
 send either an email or 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.710
 some message such as whatsapp 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.359
 among others or maybe twitter this 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.450
 tweet will allow you to do what 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.610
 next when you open what is this 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.920
 window and you find all these 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.890
 options on your phone in the part of 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.180
 down is where you are going to be able to place 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.399
 any of the applications that you 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.840
 I am mentioning among others by 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.510
 example if I want to send a message 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.300
 from here I give you a click and 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.250
 it automatically takes me to the section 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.980
 to be able to send a message or maybe 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.890
 on the right side to send an email 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.809
 electronic now this does not just work 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.719
 when your phone is awake if I 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.860
 I sleep my phone even without putting 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.040
 what it is 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.380
 key me on this side can I access 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.940
 this same section and here below I'm going to 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.950
 find what are the two buttons 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.630
 to do exactly what I finish you 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.940
 to show if I want to send a message 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.490
 I give a click to message and here 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.320
 I automatically send it now let's 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.660
 enter your configurations we are going to 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.760
 enter the settings or settings of this 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.890
 side if you look in the bottom 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.800
 let's find what is the 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.270
 application called with post we are going to 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.460
 enter and here as for your 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.410
 configurations is really this 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.869
 section is quite simple is not so 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.610
 complicated here you have two options for 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.130
 choose the left button and the button 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.410
 right if I enter the left of this 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.420
 side you will be able to find all the 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.180
 applications that you can change or 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.520
 use in this case because I have the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.890
 which is to send a message that is the 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.780
 first that is by default but I 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.190
 could place what whatsapp is what 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.200
 better in case he had it 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.509
 installed of this application or any 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.759
 another like for example facebook of this 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.200
 side returning me to the previous window 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.540
 we also have what the button is 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.490
 right in this case I have to be 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.530
 open the email application 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.060
 but I can put any other as 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.500
 I just mentioned you let's suppose 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.240
 that I want to send a new tweet 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.640
 when you select here a 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.270
 certain application is not necessary 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.320
 that you do the restrica your phone 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.210
 it automatically starts to work such 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.520
 and how do you realize select twitter 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.080
 when I give it a click, this opens 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.090
 next window so that I can 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.360
 write a tweet and automatically 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.090
 send it then that's what it does 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.190
