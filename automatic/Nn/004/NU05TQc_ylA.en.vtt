activate<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.810> but<00:00:19.140> one<00:00:19.350> person<00:00:19.529> has<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.949> go

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
activate it but one person has to go

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.439 
activate it but one person has to go

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.480 
down and so you do need well you don't
necessarily<00:00:24.750> need<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.380> key<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.859> helps

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
necessarily need the key it helps

down and then you go to that you need
someone<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.320> act<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:41.040> needs<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.340> be<00:00:41.430> active

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
someone to act it needs to be active

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.889

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
he did not have a thousand bucks like

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.880 
he did not have a thousand bucks like
someone's<00:01:03.359> gonna<00:01:03.480> actually<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.710> money

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
someone's gonna actually have the money

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.770 
someone's gonna actually have the money
to<00:01:05.100> start<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.580> okay<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.270> when<00:01:06.420> they<00:01:06.510> started

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
to start it okay so when they started

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.990 
to start it okay so when they started
you<00:01:06.869> can<00:01:06.960> see<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.890> pulls<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.340> away<00:01:08.610> then

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
you can see that it pulls that away then

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.940 
you can see that it pulls that away then
you<00:01:09.180> push<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.600> back<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.470> changes<00:01:10.830> it

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
you push it back and that changes it

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.429 
you push it back and that changes it
from<00:01:10.979> sniper<00:01:11.490> fire<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.360> like<00:01:12.510> mortar<00:01:12.990> rounds

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
from sniper fire to like mortar rounds

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.200 
from sniper fire to like mortar rounds

so that's actually pretty cool be nice

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.080 
so that's actually pretty cool be nice
if<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.509> was<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:16.020> better<00:01:16.619> area<00:01:16.970> but<00:01:17.970> it's

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
if it was in a better area but it's

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.380 
if it was in a better area but it's
still<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.270> pretty<00:01:18.509> cool<00:01:18.840> defense<00:01:19.409> type<00:01:19.740> system

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390
