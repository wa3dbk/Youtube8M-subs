let's<00:02:11.030> go<00:02:11.150> take<00:02:11.300> a<00:02:11.330> drive<00:02:11.600> and<00:02:11.630> see<00:02:11.990> how<00:02:12.080> this

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
let's go take a drive and see how this

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.490 
let's go take a drive and see how this
thing<00:02:12.410> handles<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:17.120> Ford<00:02:17.390> Fiesta<00:02:17.600> comes<00:02:18.050> bass

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
thing handles the Ford Fiesta comes bass

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.160 
thing handles the Ford Fiesta comes bass
with<00:02:18.920> a<00:02:18.950> 5-speed<00:02:19.730> manual<00:02:19.760> transmission<00:02:20.180> now

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
with a 5-speed manual transmission now

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.630 
with a 5-speed manual transmission now
we<00:02:21.230> have<00:02:21.440> this<00:02:21.560> six-speed<00:02:22.280> dual-clutch

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
we have this six-speed dual-clutch

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.490 
we have this six-speed dual-clutch
transmission<00:02:23.570> so<00:02:23.780> I<00:02:23.810> put<00:02:23.990> it<00:02:24.080> in<00:02:24.200> Drive

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
transmission so I put it in Drive

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.550 
transmission so I put it in Drive
there's<00:02:25.490> not<00:02:26.180> a<00:02:26.210> lot<00:02:26.480> of<00:02:26.510> creep<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:27.050> starts<00:02:27.410> to

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
there's not a lot of creep it starts to

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.990 
there's not a lot of creep it starts to
move<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.800> little<00:02:27.950> bit<00:02:28.160> but<00:02:28.460> you<00:02:28.640> really<00:02:28.820> have<00:02:28.910> to

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
move a little bit but you really have to

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.210 
move a little bit but you really have to
give<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.150> gas<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.720> get<00:02:29.840> going<00:02:30.230> as<00:02:30.350> opposed<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.860> a

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
give a gas to get going as opposed to a

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.120 
give a gas to get going as opposed to a
standard<00:02:32.090> torque<00:02:32.630> converter<00:02:32.930> automatic<00:02:33.620> it

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
standard torque converter automatic it

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.980 
standard torque converter automatic it
has<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:34.310> low<00:02:34.850> range<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.330> can<00:02:35.420> put<00:02:35.600> it<00:02:35.690> in<00:02:35.810> that

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
has a low range you can put it in that

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.870 
has a low range you can put it in that
and<00:02:36.320> this<00:02:36.980> low<00:02:37.130> range<00:02:37.340> is<00:02:37.460> really<00:02:37.640> aggressive

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
and this low range is really aggressive

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.600 
and this low range is really aggressive
lets<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.780> RPMs<00:02:39.440> rise<00:02:39.770> really<00:02:40.040> high<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.430> you

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
lets the RPMs rise really high and you

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.060 
lets the RPMs rise really high and you
really<00:02:40.790> hear<00:02:41.210> that<00:02:41.240> too<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:42.200> think<00:02:42.740> it<00:02:42.950> comes

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
really hear that too I think it comes

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.610 
really hear that too I think it comes
from<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.250> European<00:02:43.430> design<00:02:44.120> that<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:45.110> sound

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
from the European design that the sound

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.980 
from the European design that the sound
in<00:02:46.100> it<00:02:46.310> it's<00:02:46.880> a<00:02:46.970> little<00:02:47.180> harsher<00:02:47.570> it<00:02:47.690> seems<00:02:47.900> a

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
in it it's a little harsher it seems a

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.290 
in it it's a little harsher it seems a
little<00:02:48.050> louder<00:02:48.440> a<00:02:48.830> little<00:02:48.860> harder<00:02:49.670> ride<00:02:49.940> than

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
little louder a little harder ride than

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.420 
little louder a little harder ride than
you'd<00:02:50.600> expect<00:02:50.990> from<00:02:51.110> an<00:02:51.320> American<00:02:51.800> car<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.070> a

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
you'd expect from an American car and a

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.220 
you'd expect from an American car and a
lot<00:02:53.000> of<00:02:53.090> Americans<00:02:53.450> might<00:02:53.510> drive<00:02:53.840> this<00:02:54.020> and

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
lot of Americans might drive this and

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.020 
lot of Americans might drive this and
think<00:02:54.410> how<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.800> feels<00:02:55.040> is<00:02:55.220> kind<00:02:55.459> of<00:02:55.520> cheap<00:02:55.820> it

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
think how it feels is kind of cheap it

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.840 
think how it feels is kind of cheap it
kind<00:02:56.239> of<00:02:56.270> feels<00:02:56.510> you<00:02:56.959> know<00:02:57.050> harsh<00:02:57.350> but<00:02:58.310> it's

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
kind of feels you know harsh but it's

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.190 
kind of feels you know harsh but it's
also<00:02:59.060> designed<00:02:59.330> to<00:02:59.600> be<00:02:59.720> a<00:02:59.750> little<00:02:59.989> more

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
also designed to be a little more

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.530 
also designed to be a little more
maneuverable<00:03:01.010> that<00:03:01.220> suspension<00:03:02.150> that<00:03:02.300> makes

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
maneuverable that suspension that makes

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.130 
maneuverable that suspension that makes
a<00:03:02.660> little<00:03:02.930> tougher<00:03:03.530> is<00:03:03.709> also<00:03:04.160> more<00:03:04.340> rigid<00:03:04.820> so<00:03:05.140> I

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
a little tougher is also more rigid so I

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.470 
a little tougher is also more rigid so I
feel<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.590> lot<00:03:06.860> of<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.070> road<00:03:07.459> coming<00:03:08.030> through<00:03:08.300> it

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
feel a lot of the road coming through it

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.930 
feel a lot of the road coming through it
and<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:09.470> steering<00:03:10.220> which<00:03:10.610> is<00:03:10.760> also

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
and the steering which is also

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.699 
and the steering which is also
electrically<00:03:11.510> power<00:03:11.840> booster<00:03:12.260> steering

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
electrically power booster steering

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.610 
electrically power booster steering
feels<00:03:13.459> a<00:03:13.610> little<00:03:13.700> more<00:03:13.940> responsive<00:03:14.690> overall<00:03:15.410> I

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
feels a little more responsive overall I

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.740 
feels a little more responsive overall I
like<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.070> feeling<00:03:17.000> of<00:03:17.120> this<00:03:17.270> car<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.480> way<00:03:17.630> it

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
like the feeling of this car the way it

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.710 
like the feeling of this car the way it
handles<00:03:18.140> it<00:03:18.620> can<00:03:19.160> feel<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:19.340> little<00:03:19.400> twitchy<00:03:19.790> but

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
handles it can feel a little twitchy but

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.990 
handles it can feel a little twitchy but
it<00:03:21.470> definitely<00:03:22.010> feels<00:03:22.100> very<00:03:22.400> connected<00:03:22.760> with

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
it definitely feels very connected with

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.100 
it definitely feels very connected with
the<00:03:23.150> road<00:03:23.300> it<00:03:23.450> feels<00:03:23.720> like<00:03:24.019> you're<00:03:24.230> driving

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110

but<00:03:54.200> I<00:03:54.230> really<00:03:54.560> like<00:03:54.739> Sync<00:03:55.160> and<00:03:55.400> I<00:03:55.700> think<00:03:55.910> that

gives<00:03:56.330> the<00:03:56.480> Fiesta<00:03:57.019> a<00:03:57.140> bit

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
gives the Fiesta a bit

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.750 
gives the Fiesta a bit
edge
