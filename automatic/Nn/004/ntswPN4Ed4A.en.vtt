00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.270
the boy who cried wolf. Every day a

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.810
shepherd boy sat on a hill watching the village sheep

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:13.590
his job was to make sure nothing bad
happened to the sheep

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.970
one afternoon the boy decided to play a
trick on the villagers

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.820
"Wolf! Wolf! he cried. "Theres a wolf chasing the sheep!"

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.850
The villagers raced up the hill to chase the wolf away

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.930
but there was no wolf in sight

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.000
"don't cry wolf when there is no wolf!" they warned the boy

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.740
the boy was surprised his trick worked so
well

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.830
"I can't believe he played a trick
like that"

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.550
the villagers grumbled as they stormed
down the hill

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.940
the next day the boy tried his trick
again

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.589
Wolf Wolf! He called out. Theres a wolf

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.690
chasing the sheep!

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.780
the villagers came running and again found

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.509
no wolf. "Dont do this again!" They scolded

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:09.560
"Only cry wolf when there actually is a wolf!"

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.189
A few hours later, the boy noticed something out of the corner of his eye

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.390
A wolf was sneaking up behind the
sheep

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.290
"Wolf, Wolf!" he cried in a panic

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.090
No one came. "Wolf, Wolf!"

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.560
He cried again, "Please help! Theres a wolf chasing the sheep!"

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.600
Still no one came.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.200
At sunset, the boy did not return the
sheep to the village as he normally did

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.540
the villagers went up the hill to check
on the sheep

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.450
they found the boy but no sheep

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.940
A wolf was here, it chased the sheep away

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.410
"Why didn't you come to help me?" he cried.  "You tricked us twice when there was no wolf"

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.320
"we thought you were tricking us again"
said the villagers

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.930
"I shouldn't have cried wolf when there was no wold" said the boy

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.060
I'm sorry for my tricks

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.620
an old man comforted the boy. "If you tell too many lies,

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.580
no one will believe you when you tell the truth" he said.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.490
The end.
