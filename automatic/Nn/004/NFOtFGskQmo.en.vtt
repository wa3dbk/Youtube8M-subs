that's complete science-fiction isn't it
well<00:01:22.210> in<00:01:22.420> actual<00:01:22.690> fact<00:01:22.810> there's<00:01:23.020> a<00:01:23.080> team<00:01:23.290> in

well in actual fact there's a team in

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.720 
well in actual fact there's a team in
Austria<00:01:23.860> who<00:01:24.010> have<00:01:24.130> actually<00:01:24.460> managed<00:01:24.670> to

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
Austria who have actually managed to

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.640 
Austria who have actually managed to
teleport<00:01:25.240> individual<00:01:25.900> atoms<00:01:26.230> of<00:01:26.410> matter

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
teleport individual atoms of matter

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.290 
teleport individual atoms of matter
across<00:01:27.010> the<00:01:27.190> laboratory

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
across the laboratory

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.960 
across the laboratory
well<00:01:29.200> what<00:01:29.350> about<00:01:29.590> say<00:01:30.040> free<00:01:30.220> whole<00:01:30.460> human

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
well what about say free whole human

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.330 
well what about say free whole human
being<00:01:31.290> well<00:01:32.290> obviously<00:01:32.350> your<00:01:32.800> body's<00:01:33.100> made<00:01:33.310> up

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
being well obviously your body's made up

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.220 
being well obviously your body's made up
of<00:01:33.550> billions<00:01:33.850> and<00:01:34.210> billions<00:01:34.450> of<00:01:34.720> these<00:01:34.870> atoms

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
of billions and billions of these atoms

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.840 
of billions and billions of these atoms
and<00:01:35.950> so<00:01:36.100> it's<00:01:36.220> a<00:01:36.280> heck<00:01:36.430> of<00:01:36.550> a<00:01:36.640> lot<00:01:36.730> of

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
and so it's a heck of a lot of

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.040 
and so it's a heck of a lot of
information<00:01:37.450> so<00:01:37.570> you'd<00:01:37.720> probably<00:01:37.780> be<00:01:38.020> looking

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
information so you'd probably be looking

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.320 
information so you'd probably be looking
at<00:01:38.290> about<00:01:38.410> a<00:01:38.500> billion<00:01:38.770> years<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.550> transmit<00:01:40.150> all

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
at about a billion years to transmit all

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.850 
at about a billion years to transmit all
that<00:01:40.480> information<00:01:41.110> you<00:01:41.140> know<00:01:41.320> from<00:01:41.500> one<00:01:41.650> place

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
that information you know from one place

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.920 
that information you know from one place
to<00:01:42.100> another<00:01:42.310> so<00:01:42.580> not<00:01:42.880> just<00:01:43.030> yet<00:01:43.330> it<00:01:43.690> could<00:01:43.840> be

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
to another so not just yet it could be

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.500 
to another so not just yet it could be
quite<00:01:44.050> a<00:01:44.140> way<00:01:44.910> one<00:01:45.910> thing<00:01:46.090> people<00:01:46.240> have<00:01:46.390> always

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
quite a way one thing people have always

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.350 
quite a way one thing people have always
laughed<00:01:46.840> at<00:01:47.050> is<00:01:47.260> the<00:01:47.530> Dalek<00:01:48.120> seemingly<00:01:49.120> an

science<00:02:01.360> fiction<00:02:01.390> there<00:02:01.780> well<00:02:02.290> again<00:02:02.619> not

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
science fiction there well again not

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.840 
science fiction there well again not
necessarily<00:02:02.920> there's<00:02:03.550> actually<00:02:03.820> a

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
necessarily there's actually a

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.150 
necessarily there's actually a
researcher<00:02:04.330> over<00:02:04.600> in<00:02:04.690> Finland<00:02:05.200> and<00:02:05.320> he<00:02:05.860> thinks

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
researcher over in Finland and he thinks

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.980 
researcher over in Finland and he thinks
he's<00:02:06.280> constructed<00:02:06.850> an<00:02:06.940> antigravity<00:02:07.479> device

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
he's constructed an antigravity device

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.480 
he's constructed an antigravity device
so<00:02:08.290> perhaps<00:02:08.619> that<00:02:08.830> could<00:02:08.920> be<00:02:09.010> the<00:02:09.100> basis

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
so perhaps that could be the basis

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.230 
so perhaps that could be the basis

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
Daleks actually fly now how about this

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.060 
Daleks actually fly now how about this

again<00:02:17.740> I<00:02:18.160> mean<00:02:18.190> this<00:02:18.550> is<00:02:18.700> something<00:02:18.910> that

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
again I mean this is something that
