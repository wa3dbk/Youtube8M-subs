 And we can see USB 

00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:30.654
 Ok, let’s take a look at this protagonist right away. 

00:01:30.654 --> 00:01:31.946
 Take it out 

00:01:31.946 --> 00:01:35.441
 Its very mini is just the size of my palm. 

00:01:35.441 --> 00:01:37.288
 We see this lens 

00:01:37.288 --> 00:01:40.034
 This lens can actually shoot in the range of 

00:01:40.034 --> 00:01:42.201
 Within 10~30 meters 

00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:46.796
 And it is 100 degree wide angle at F2.2 large aperture 

00:01:46.796 --> 00:01:52.244
 And it is a high resolution 支援 that supports the highest resolution 720P 30FSP喔

00:01:52.244 --> 00:01:54.902
 Ok, we can see the surface and this is the speaker. 

00:01:54.902 --> 00:01:58.004
 And the voice holes for the call are here. 

00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:02.227
 That part of the voice is to support two-way voice calls. 

00:02:02.227 --> 00:02:03.858
 Come again, we see the side 

00:02:03.858 --> 00:02:06.914
 There is a slot for this Micro SD on the side. 

00:02:06.914 --> 00:02:09.983
 Then come back to the USB jack 

00:02:09.983 --> 00:02:14.152
 And we see that this part is the location of the installation kit. 

00:02:14.152 --> 00:02:19.201
 Come again, we see that the mode key and the open key are here. 

00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:20.701

00:02:23.302 --> 00:02:25.344
 Press the shutter 

00:02:25.344 --> 00:02:31.406
 Then its built-in lithium battery is a two-hour continuous use. 

00:02:31.406 --> 00:02:37.910
 And it has support for up to 64GB of Micro SD 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.557
 Yes, let's take a look at ApoEye blink now. 

00:02:40.557 --> 00:02:41.808
 The method is simple 

00:02:41.808 --> 00:02:43.466
 First we see this side 

00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:44.487
 Then we see the Power button 

00:02:44.487 --> 00:02:47.144
 We long click 

00:02:47.144 --> 00:02:49.309
 We see if the LED lights are blinking 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:50.826
 This means that it is already open. 

00:02:50.826 --> 00:02:55.763
 Turning to the back we can also see the Wi-Fi zone displayed here. 

00:02:55.763 --> 00:02:57.997
 It can also be connected 

00:02:57.997 --> 00:02:59.487
 So it is flashing 

00:02:59.487 --> 00:03:01.654
 Then we can see that this is also bright. 

00:03:01.654 --> 00:03:03.241
 Is the part of photography 

00:03:03.241 --> 00:03:04.950
 Then how do we get if we want to switch to a camera? 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.172
 We are the mode button to here. 

00:03:07.172 --> 00:03:09.495
 Mode button we click 

00:03:09.495 --> 00:03:10.529
 You can take pictures 啰

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:12.649
 Let's take a selfie now. 

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:15.533
 Yes, self-timer is successful 

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:18.052
 Then if we want to use 

00:03:18.052 --> 00:03:22.025
 We can change to this mode in the cloud by clicking on it again. 

00:03:22.025 --> 00:03:24.998
 Awkward voice 

00:03:24.998 --> 00:03:26.945
 Ok, let's switch again. 

00:03:26.945 --> 00:03:29.007
 We can switch to this photography mode again. 

00:03:29.007 --> 00:03:32.000
 Let's record a movie now. 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.342
 Blinking eyes 

00:03:36.342 --> 00:03:37.841
 Yes, it’s recorded. 

00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:39.241
 Turn him off 

00:03:39.241 --> 00:03:41.086
 After it is turned off, it will not flash again. 

00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:43.329
 It means it has been closed. 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.495
 Ok, we have to take the iPad now. 

00:03:46.495 --> 00:03:49.457
 We invite our photographer Anthony 

00:03:49.457 --> 00:03:52.352
 Yes, we are using this software before 

00:03:52.352 --> 00:03:57.334
 Of course, we will first download the software related to ApoEye啰

00:03:57.334 --> 00:04:02.704
 Well, it can support iOS and Android systems. 

00:04:02.704 --> 00:04:05.943
 Ok, we are already making a connection. 

00:04:07.804 --> 00:04:10.001
 We will jump out of the good connection. 

00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:12.213
 We have downloaded the software. 

00:04:12.213 --> 00:04:17.138
 Let's go to ApoEye 

00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:25.334
 Ok, now we are entering this picture. 

00:04:25.334 --> 00:04:26.245
 Have you seen me? 

00:04:26.245 --> 00:04:28.032
 It’s so beautiful. 

00:04:28.032 --> 00:04:29.580
 Very narcissistic 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.578
 Ok, let's introduce some basic functions. 

00:04:31.578 --> 00:04:33.207
 Let's put it first 

00:04:33.207 --> 00:04:35.668
 Can you see me like this? 

00:04:35.668 --> 00:04:36.912
 OK, it does not matter 

00:04:36.912 --> 00:04:39.164
 Ok, let's take a look at the basic buttons like 

00:04:39.164 --> 00:04:43.496
 We can enlarge this picture and shrink this picture is also ok 喔

00:04:43.496 --> 00:04:47.789
 Then if we reverse this blink 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:48.822
 Inadvertently reversed 

00:04:48.822 --> 00:04:50.453
 Ok, let's reverse it. 

00:04:50.453 --> 00:04:52.583
 We assume this 

00:04:52.583 --> 00:04:54.218
 How can I see it and see it? 

00:04:54.218 --> 00:04:56.494
 Ok, we just press this button 

00:04:56.494 --> 00:04:57.684
 We will be able to return 

00:04:57.684 --> 00:04:59.403
 So it can actually be used upside down 

00:04:59.403 --> 00:05:01.657
 Then we can just mute 

00:05:01.657 --> 00:05:04.332
 And we can see that this is the most basic 

00:05:04.332 --> 00:05:06.005
 Let’s take a photo again. 

00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:08.410
 It’s not good to shoot. 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.161
 Ok, we can just video. 

00:05:11.161 --> 00:05:14.273
 Blinking eyes 

00:05:14.273 --> 00:05:15.072
 Yes 

00:05:15.072 --> 00:05:18.906
 Ok, we can also use this software. 

00:05:18.906 --> 00:05:19.643
 Very convenient 

00:05:19.643 --> 00:05:22.430
 We just mentioned two-way voice calls. 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.597
 Let's wait and test it. 

00:05:23.597 --> 00:05:25.677
 We are using Anthony’s mobile phone now. 

00:05:25.677 --> 00:05:27.764
 Android system phone is also available 

00:05:27.764 --> 00:05:29.159
 Ok, we invite Anthony. 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:31.888
 Let's ask Kevin. 

00:05:31.888 --> 00:05:34.558
 We are now Kevin actually sneaked into the scene喔

00:05:34.558 --> 00:05:39.514
 Kevin is bothering you to take this ApoEye to the warehouse. 

00:05:39.514 --> 00:05:43.243
 Yes, ok, we see Kevin. 

00:05:43.243 --> 00:05:45.364
 Kevin, you are lazy today, not going to work. 

00:05:45.364 --> 00:05:47.281
 Fans are asking where are you going? 

00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:48.478
 Why don't you host 

00:05:49.893 --> 00:05:53.461
 Ok, let's wait for Kevin. 

00:05:59.947 --> 00:06:01.959
 Ok 

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:04.226
 Then we just mentioned that this is muted. 

00:06:04.226 --> 00:06:06.008
 Sorry it is not actually silent 

00:06:06.008 --> 00:06:07.624
 It is when we want to communicate with Kevin. 

00:06:07.624 --> 00:06:09.243
 We have to click 

00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:10.397
 What is Kevin doing? 

00:06:10.397 --> 00:06:12.233
 Kevin is peeping 

00:06:12.233 --> 00:06:14.228
 Let's click 

00:06:14.228 --> 00:06:16.668
 Hey Kevin, what are you doing? 

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:18.136
 Ok, if you hear my voice now 

00:06:18.136 --> 00:06:20.370
 Than a demi 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.691
 More than a demi for everyone to see 

00:06:26.065 --> 00:06:30.598
 Abi is better than 

00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:34.926
 Hi 

00:06:34.926 --> 00:06:38.537
 Good Kevin has already compared 

00:06:38.537 --> 00:06:41.711
 Kevin now tells you a few words. 

00:06:41.711 --> 00:06:44.377
 Say a few words to everyone 

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:54.363
 Ok, so this blink is actually very useful. 

00:06:54.363 --> 00:06:56.612
 If you put it in the children's room, 

00:06:56.612 --> 00:07:00.523
 It is also a two-way instant communication. 

00:07:00.523 --> 00:07:02.475
 Yes Yes 

00:07:02.475 --> 00:07:04.653
 Ok, we are very grateful to Kevin. 

00:07:04.653 --> 00:07:06.611
 Kevin thank you, I have to continue to host. 

00:07:06.611 --> 00:07:10.523
掰

00:07:10.523 --> 00:07:12.032
 The above is the introduction today. 

00:07:12.032 --> 00:07:13.613
 ApoEye blinks 

00:07:13.613 --> 00:07:15.598
 Yes, Yao Yao personally feels quite special. 

00:07:15.598 --> 00:07:17.700
 Because it is very small except 

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.858
 In fact, it is in the use of features 

00:07:20.858 --> 00:07:24.863
 For example, you can remotely control through a mobile device. 

00:07:24.863 --> 00:07:26.455
 Watch real-time images 

00:07:26.455 --> 00:07:27.463
 Very convenient 

00:07:27.463 --> 00:07:29.855
 So Yao Yao personally likes it. 

00:07:29.855 --> 00:07:33.122
 And the point is that it can also be a two-way voice call. 

00:07:33.122 --> 00:07:35.531
 Is to facilitate the mother to communicate with the little baby 

00:07:35.531 --> 00:07:37.146
 It’s good 

00:07:37.146 --> 00:07:39.395
 Then you can also purchase other accessories yourself. 

00:07:39.395 --> 00:07:41.614
 Such as a waterproof case, etc. 

00:07:41.614 --> 00:07:43.857
 Of course, the market has also introduced higher-order 

00:07:43.857 --> 00:07:46.953
 But if you are a general family, 

00:07:46.953 --> 00:07:48.362
 Will be more suitable 

00:07:48.362 --> 00:07:49.698
 It’s ApoEye. 

00:07:49.698 --> 00:07:51.114
 That is the introduction today. 

00:07:51.114 --> 00:07:52.703
