Hello we are MBLAQ!

00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:24.900
This song draws on a sexy man

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.500
Also the concept of the music video is a sexy man which can be described by moderate dance moves

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.500
We used fluorescent and glowing colours to make the environment look like a club

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:55.918
We made a comeback after 1 year and 4 months

00:00:56.804 --> 00:01:02.800
We did a concert in Korea including our tour this year. It's been a long time since we have seen our fans in Korea

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.239
We really had so much fun there. We loved it

00:01:13.098 --> 00:01:17.098
For me I have plans to take parts in a number of films

00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:22.167
I will try my best to show you something better than you expected

00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:25.351
Maybe humour?

00:01:24.868 --> 00:01:26.868
Joking!

00:01:30.265 --> 00:01:33.900
We have various plans. We are currently working on our new album

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.500
We are also participating in various areas like films and musicals

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.800
Please cheer for us with our appearances in various programs

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.870
What we remember the most during our trip last time were our fans and first concert in Sydney

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.860
Every time we travelled overseas for concerts we always go straight back to Korea

00:02:00.867 --> 00:02:07.800
On our previous Sydney visit all artists and crew members had time to go on a cruise to enjoy the beautiful sceneries in Sydney

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:12.800
We could see the Sydney Opera House

00:02:13.293 --> 00:02:17.290
We all have great memories of the beautiful sceneries in Australia

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:32.500
Every performances on stage are a must see!

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.900
We prepared 4 songs for tonight which have different concepts and amazing stage performances!

00:02:59.631 --> 00:03:02.630
Our fans are great people

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:07.510
Our fan club A+ was firstly established in Korea

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:13.150
Now our fan club has expanded from Asia to South America and beyond

00:03:13.896 --> 00:03:17.900
They greet us at airports. Some of them took a long journey to see us

00:03:18.388 --> 00:03:22.390
They are really our energy

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:38.500
We always spend longer time preparing our albums than other artists

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.500
From now on we plan to meet our fans more often than before

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:49.430
We are currently working hard on our new album and more concerts

00:03:53.596 --> 00:03:57.600
You will see us as MBLAQ soon
