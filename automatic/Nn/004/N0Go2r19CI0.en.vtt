00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
minute twenty into the plate by the way

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.500 
minute twenty into the plate by the way
there<00:02:46.740> was<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:46.920> three<00:02:47.580> knockdown<00:02:48.060> rule<00:02:48.090> in

there was a three knockdown rule in

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.350 
there was a three knockdown rule in
effect<00:02:48.600> so<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.380> think<00:02:50.280> if<00:02:50.520> he<00:02:50.610> does<00:02:50.790> rise<00:02:51.090> this

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
effect so I think if he does rise this

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.690 
effect so I think if he does rise this
fight<00:02:51.600> a<00:02:51.630> light<00:02:51.840> soon

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
fight a light soon

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.670 
fight a light soon
this<00:02:53.940> is<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.270> six<00:02:54.600> fight<00:02:54.870> in<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.140> last<00:02:55.350> five

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
this is the six fight in the last five

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.220 
this is the six fight in the last five
months<00:02:55.980> for<00:02:56.850> water<00:02:57.090> not<00:02:57.630> bad

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
months for water not bad

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.600 
months for water not bad
I'm<00:02:58.440> thinking<00:02:59.040> he<00:02:59.130> could<00:02:59.280> get<00:02:59.460> at<00:02:59.580> least

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
I'm thinking he could get at least

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.600 
I'm thinking he could get at least
twenty<00:03:00.420> with<00:03:01.230> these<00:03:01.410> kind<00:03:01.740> of<00:03:01.800> opponents<00:03:02.430> he's

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
twenty with these kind of opponents he's

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.360 
twenty with these kind of opponents he's
been<00:03:02.790> fighting<00:03:03.030> maybe<00:03:03.420> two<00:03:03.840> every<00:03:04.770> week<00:03:05.040> I

right hand didn't even look like a real
clean<00:04:35.820> shot<00:04:36.120> again<00:04:36.450> honestly<00:04:37.230> but<00:04:37.820> Alan<00:04:38.820> went

and again the outcome was already

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.790
