00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.520
 1 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.000
 first event of this importance 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.320
 for the brand 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.559
 this is the first time actually 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.980
 that we organized a meeting with our 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.260
 customers 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.059
 quad around the theme of hiking on 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.559
 is very very satisfied because they have 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:52.149
 answered present to catch a 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.360
 ten years I start and I 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:58.329
 started at 15,150 kymco then prejudices 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.790
 250 of the 300 hp is mounted in the ranges 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.260
 then after I had finished beautiful 500-550 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.880
 then now socks smell 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.780
 absolutely 15th I know pretty much a 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.220
 very good team of friendly 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.430
 licensed a good one and then I did very well 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.430
 received 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.490
 we teamed up with an organizer who 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.540
 know how to do that is to madam they are the 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.590
 Beaujolais region 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.000
 lyon so we had a place easily 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.650
 accessible power stations in France 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.580
 and then at had already had permissions 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.810
 at the level of prefectures and 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.130
 common because they use these 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.730
 paths so three times in the year that 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.860
 It's going very well 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:04.030
 very good day very well organized 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.930
 and as much with nice people are where 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.930
 but arrive 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.290
 we need to stay connected this 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.010
 we have information feedback 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.930
 networks but it's not always 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.840
 enough there was also a will 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.579
 for me to immerse the kymco staff 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.620
 they better understand the issues the 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.390
 customer needs his expectations 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.010
 how does it work and then it's 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.690
 a great feedback of information 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:43.030
 on the product allows to see the 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.329
 novelties and especially around what big 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.780
 than what the 450 mac does not come out of 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:52.120
 badly as machine frankly well flow 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:56.170
 and I who have 458 put two wheels 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.120
 the steel wheels and usb 700 hopes 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.250
 works very well from what I tried 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.340
 there is the xv and 450 which is enough 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.989
 bluffing who is who seems pretty little 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.340
 performing like that on the paper that 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.500
 in fact is very playful and very 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.549
 nice to drive very comfortable a 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.549
 good engine performance 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:32.000
 very well organized good ride 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.250
 vary the meals nickel the mechanics on 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.510
 very helpful place and I had a 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.090
 mechanical problem that is repaired from this 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.320

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.710
 mark and those who send it back to us are 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.000

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.160
 wake up a bit it's time to 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.600
 work around brands and him 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.440
 see and share something with them 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.370
 22nd quad in 11 years because someone 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.560

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.240
 the kymco event but it's great 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.150
 you have to start to a goal more 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:03.190
 often we love it I thank a lot 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.190

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:26.190
 simply when we question them they 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.180
 are very happy with the welcome of the 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.360
 region 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.960
 the plot of everything that was with the 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.900
 package 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.820
 Well, I'm from the Dijon region 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.560

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.919

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.919

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.050
