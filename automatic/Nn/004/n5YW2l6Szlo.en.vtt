entertainment and this is a thumb rip
obviously<00:01:30.829> I<00:01:31.009> guess<00:01:31.819> you<00:01:31.939> can<00:01:32.060> hold<00:01:32.270> it<00:01:32.359> back

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
obviously I guess you can hold it back

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.190 
obviously I guess you can hold it back
here<00:01:32.810> as<00:01:32.929> well<00:01:33.109> that<00:01:34.100> feels<00:01:34.310> kind<00:01:34.520> of<00:01:34.549> odd<00:01:35.200> no

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
here as well that feels kind of odd no

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.559 
here as well that feels kind of odd no
no<00:01:36.380> this<00:01:37.219> is<00:01:37.369> a<00:01:37.399> false<00:01:37.670> edge<00:01:37.969> on<00:01:38.209> there<00:01:38.359> so

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
no this is a false edge on there so

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:39.760 
no this is a false edge on there so
we'll<00:01:38.719> probably<00:01:38.929> take<00:01:39.109> this<00:01:39.259> out<00:01:39.469> and<00:01:39.499> beat

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
we'll probably take this out and beat

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.699 
we'll probably take this out and beat
this<00:01:39.889> up<00:01:40.069> as<00:01:40.159> well<00:01:40.509> quarter<00:01:41.509> inch<00:01:41.659> thick<00:01:42.439> steel

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:42.709 
this up as well quarter inch thick steel

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:45.249 
this up as well quarter inch thick steel
so<00:01:43.549> you<00:01:43.609> pry<00:01:44.029> some<00:01:44.090> doors<00:01:44.479> open<00:01:44.810> this<00:01:44.990> is<00:01:45.139> from

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
so you pry some doors open this is from

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.469 
so you pry some doors open this is from
k<00:01:45.469> bar<00:01:45.679> and<00:01:45.829> mil-spec<00:01:46.009> monkey<00:01:46.490> so<00:01:47.299> that's

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
k bar and mil-spec monkey so that's

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.160 
k bar and mil-spec monkey so that's
pretty<00:01:47.929> interesting<00:01:48.139> so<00:01:49.899> interesting<00:01:50.899> sheath

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
pretty interesting so interesting sheath

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.349 
pretty interesting so interesting sheath
is<00:01:51.950> on<00:01:52.099> to<00:01:52.310> this<00:01:52.429> is<00:01:52.579> obviously<00:01:52.819> something

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
is on to this is obviously something
