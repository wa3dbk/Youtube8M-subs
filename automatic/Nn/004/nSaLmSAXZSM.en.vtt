00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:09.520
 Hello 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:14.559
 It will be a welcome party for newcomers from now on when it will be April 35th or something of the circle of university 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:19.060
 I'll be in the season of variety or Dattari comparator Mika comes more and more in still in its 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:23.660
 Or even up or the point from the strikingly little noticeable or Toka to and Well girl 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:28.460
 Or you think you Toka or can liven up a little it in its place 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.960
 It is very important that do an impersonation of one and to everyone know of one of them 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.490
 I think 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.730
 Until that thing 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:40.610
 It is Mickey Mouse Today 's box of this and I see a lot of junior voice actors say 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:45.660
 This I who has been deceiving 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:51.010
 Mikkemaa I think I want to teach the imitation to everyone's or 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:55.329
 There is a bit of sandals that I can go to first, so I would like to hear them 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.870
 No, my name is Mickey 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.079
 Nice to meet you 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:04.729
 Such is that often there tend to words that say 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:08.659
 That's it, but first of all, back voice is important if Mike escort 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:12.170
 As there are important points when making this back voice, listen carefully and remember 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:15.980
 Please, it's about putting abdominals 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.470
 By putting the return to become a coherent voice 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.880
 It becomes voice through sharply 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.780
 Such as come through month Among which was far Saosao 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.400
 It will be a voice 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:31.170
 And say it does not and whether made to any voice will be like this 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:36.060
 No, my name is Mickey Mouse. 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.700
 Because it becomes like a back voice that can not become a back voice of a somewhat halfway 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.259
 Please be careful 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.590
 And even this becomes a thing of Mickey First of all the other your hand if the master to the second 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.649
 How to handle vowels 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.829
 A science mouse meets and swims when speaking 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:53.859
 I will bring great accent to this vowel of 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:02:00.219
 So, for example, happy halloween 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:02:01.980
 Is why to this kind of pronunciation that say Happy hard Vienna is also a word that 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:05.060
 I want to do it 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.060
 Happy ha 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:12.530
 It will be Happy Vienna and no accent on the contrary 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.660
 Somehow 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:23.330
 Of course I think it will be a bit scarce Mickey Mouse at the time of introducing his name 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.840
 Also when the Mickey Mouse brings up to the accent of this key, it sounds like it 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.720
 I will 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.350
 It's Mickey Mouse 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:35.180
