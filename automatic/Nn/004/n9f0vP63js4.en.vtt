so<00:00:03.949> this<00:00:04.100> is<00:00:04.250> the<00:00:04.399> Cyprus<00:00:04.880> capsule<00:00:05.810> suitcase

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:06.410 
so this is the Cyprus capsule suitcase

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.759 
so this is the Cyprus capsule suitcase
demo<00:00:06.979> in<00:00:07.220> a<00:00:07.279> box<00:00:07.630> what<00:00:08.630> we<00:00:08.870> have<00:00:09.050> here<00:00:09.349> is<00:00:09.530> a

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:09.769 
demo in a box what we have here is a

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.100 
demo in a box what we have here is a
demonstration<00:00:10.099> that<00:00:10.670> implements<00:00:11.389> capacitive

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
demonstration that implements capacitive

from competitor a and competitor B and

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.130 
from competitor a and competitor B and
as<00:00:21.500> you<00:00:21.680> see<00:00:22.010> here<00:00:22.250> we've<00:00:22.400> got<00:00:22.430> a<00:00:23.140> proximity

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
as you see here we've got a proximity

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.460 
as you see here we've got a proximity
sensor<00:00:24.730> so<00:00:25.730> as<00:00:25.850> I<00:00:26.000> approach<00:00:26.120> my<00:00:26.840> hands<00:00:27.140> towards

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
sensor so as I approach my hands towards

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.550 
sensor so as I approach my hands towards
the<00:00:27.530> kit<00:00:27.830> you<00:00:27.980> can<00:00:28.130> see<00:00:28.400> these<00:00:28.730> four<00:00:28.970> LEDs<00:00:29.360> that

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
the kit you can see these four LEDs that

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.069 
the kit you can see these four LEDs that
turn<00:00:30.560> on<00:00:30.740> or<00:00:31.040> turn<00:00:31.070> off<00:00:31.450> and<00:00:32.450> we've<00:00:32.570> got<00:00:32.780> four

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
turn on or turn off and we've got four

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.640 
turn on or turn off and we've got four
buttons<00:00:33.500> of<00:00:34.150> various<00:00:35.150> sizes<00:00:35.660> and<00:00:35.810> the<00:00:36.380> setup

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
buttons of various sizes and the setup

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.190 
buttons of various sizes and the setup
is<00:00:36.829> then<00:00:37.040> replicated<00:00:37.640> three<00:00:37.880> times<00:00:38.150> over<00:00:38.390> so

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
is then replicated three times over so

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.979 
is then replicated three times over so
just<00:00:39.350> looking<00:00:39.530> at<00:00:39.650> the<00:00:39.710> captions<00:00:39.980> buttons

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
just looking at the captions buttons

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.030 
just looking at the captions buttons
touching<00:00:41.989> these<00:00:42.079> obviously<00:00:42.560> the<00:00:42.770> buttons

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
touching these obviously the buttons

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.620 
touching these obviously the buttons
turn<00:00:43.280> on<00:00:43.489> one<00:00:43.730> after<00:00:44.030> each<00:00:44.150> other

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
turn on one after each other

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.680 
turn on one after each other
I<00:00:44.829> can<00:00:45.829> even<00:00:45.950> slide<00:00:46.489> my<00:00:46.700> finger<00:00:46.760> across<00:00:47.239> and

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
I can even slide my finger across and

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.970 
I can even slide my finger across and
and<00:00:47.960> see<00:00:48.380> each<00:00:49.160> of<00:00:49.370> those<00:00:49.460> four<00:00:49.730> LEDs<00:00:50.120> light<00:00:50.450> up

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
and see each of those four LEDs light up

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.950 
and see each of those four LEDs light up
so<00:00:51.980> I<00:00:52.040> can<00:00:52.220> use<00:00:52.370> it<00:00:52.489> as<00:00:52.610> a<00:00:52.640> as<00:00:53.000> a<00:00:53.060> slider<00:00:53.570> with

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
so I can use it as a as a slider with

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.010 
so I can use it as a as a slider with
gestures<00:00:55.300> doing<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:56.390> same<00:00:56.570> thing<00:00:56.870> on

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
gestures doing the same thing on

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.010 
gestures doing the same thing on
competitions<00:00:57.910> all<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:59.059> proximity<00:00:59.770> works

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020

sort of button one button to button
three<00:01:08.299> at<00:01:08.450> six<00:01:08.659> millimeters<00:01:09.229> is<00:01:09.409> really<00:01:09.710> hard

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
three at six millimeters is really hard

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.750 
three at six millimeters is really hard
trigger<00:01:10.479> and<00:01:11.479> doesn't<00:01:11.810> seem<00:01:11.960> to<00:01:12.049> turn<00:01:12.200> on<00:01:12.409> and

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
trigger and doesn't seem to turn on and

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.110 
trigger and doesn't seem to turn on and
then<00:01:13.760> button<00:01:14.090> four<00:01:14.360> is<00:01:14.600> okay<00:01:15.520> but<00:01:16.520> doing<00:01:16.940> the

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
then button four is okay but doing the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.600 
then button four is okay but doing the
slider<00:01:17.870> gesture<00:01:18.500> it<00:01:18.770> looks<00:01:19.070> like<00:01:19.250> it's<00:01:19.400> still

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
slider gesture it looks like it's still

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.420 
slider gesture it looks like it's still
missing<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:20.830> button<00:01:21.830> three<00:01:22.040> it<00:01:22.159> doesn't

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
missing the button three it doesn't

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.870 
missing the button three it doesn't
doesn't<00:01:22.670> pick<00:01:22.909> it<00:01:22.940> up<00:01:24.340> solution<00:01:25.340> number<00:01:25.580> three

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
doesn't pick it up solution number three

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.000 
doesn't pick it up solution number three
and<00:01:26.360> doesn't<00:01:26.900> seem<00:01:27.049> to<00:01:27.170> have<00:01:27.320> implemented<00:01:27.710> any

and doesn't seem to have implemented any

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.180 
and doesn't seem to have implemented any
sort<00:01:28.250> of<00:01:28.310> proximity<00:01:28.729> demos<00:01:29.890> it<00:01:30.890> does<00:01:31.040> have

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
sort of proximity demos it does have

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.960 
sort of proximity demos it does have
buttons<00:01:31.520> though<00:01:31.729> that<00:01:31.880> work<00:01:32.090> alright

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.510 

but<00:01:35.299> the<00:01:35.540> slider<00:01:36.020> gesture<00:01:36.619> does<00:01:36.920> not<00:01:37.070> seem<00:01:37.369> to

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
but the slider gesture does not seem to

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.539 
but the slider gesture does not seem to
pick<00:01:37.700> up<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:37.970> two<00:01:38.150> smaller<00:01:38.540> buttons<00:01:39.080> or<00:01:39.650> very

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
pick up the two smaller buttons or very

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.200 
pick up the two smaller buttons or very
intermittently<00:01:41.330> so<00:01:42.580> each<00:01:43.580> of<00:01:43.640> these<00:01:43.939> three

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
intermittently so each of these three

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.580 
intermittently so each of these three
designs<00:01:44.600> are<00:01:44.869> implemented<00:01:45.409> with<00:01:45.439> the
