 Therapeutic nopal in which 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.779
 always being part of the culture in 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.850
 Mexico our ancestors used it 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.949
 as part of their daily diet and was 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.590
 in everyone in all his present in his life 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.570
 everyday look at nopal

 is part of our national symbols 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.890
 in this case in our flag 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.470
 We keep a cactus represented too 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.900
 which was part of life inclusive 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.030
 of the Aztecs and Mexicas 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.250
 I do not know if you remember but tenochtitlan 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.010
 I do not know if you knew it means place of 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.930
 cactus leaves in cactus water because 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.460
 it's good not to stop from those then 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.900
 truths of our ancestors 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.970
 so that our ancestors 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.799
 consumed was always considered as a 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.260
 extremely beneficial product for 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:08.140
 health of all Mexicans but what 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.350
 in recent years the great 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.300
 scientists have really tried to follow 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.490
 studying more about the benefits 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.290
 therapeutic that it brings in a bar and for 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.060
 that is that it has been revalued more in 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.190
 these last years I 'm going to talk to you 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.960
 because he's so good at it for because 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.550
 contains I'll explain you have 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.820
 vitamins vitamin b1 b2 b3 vitamin c 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.800
 contains chlorophyll contains proteins 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.350
 minerals and we continue is extremely 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.960
 important that they are 17 in amino acids of 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.670
 which 8 are essential for life 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.930
 we need them in our life 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.000
 daily in our daily diet 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.770
 we need them and there are times when 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.390
 we consume until consuming nopal 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.280
 you guarantee you have these amino acids 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.740
 that you need to elaborate the 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.540
 proteins of all the organs look 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.490
 that also the cactus contains something that 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.010
 it is extremely important that it is fiber 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.750
 soluble and insoluble fiber I 'm not going to 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.580
 allow you to explain yourself in a very 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.820
 simple and with an element that all 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.950
 we have in our house 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.540
 the soluble fiber if I can 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.240
 represent you would be like a sponge 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.580
 because because like a sponge that 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.830
 absorbs 50 times a dry weight and 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.780
 it expands in the stomach then that 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.750
 expansion in the stomach provides you 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.540
 a feeling of fullness and satiety 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.130
 especially if you are in regimes of 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.890
 encourage slimming control of 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.530
 weight if you suffer from obesity the nopal is 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.600
 an extraordinary product also as 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.640
 part of the soluble fiber other of the 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.350
 benefits of soluble fiber is that it 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.570
 you go to the absorption of sugars in 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.790
 the blood when we eat something 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.400
 sweet for example a piece of cake yo 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.470
 I like pie baix tickets sugar 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.750
 the blood immediately went into action 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.540
 the pancreas because that 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.239
 sugar cargo and you need to produce 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.739
 insulin to regularize those 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.600
 levels so that the 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.850
 blood glucose levels but 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.620
 then that is extremely damaging these 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.030
 peaks of those high sugars for 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.370
 our organism are your time 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.920
 sights and especially by a diabetic in 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.670
 this case 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.340
 how it works imagine here I'm going to 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.250
 hydrate a little this sponge imagine 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.440
 that your sponge is as if for fiber 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.209
 soluble that receives that cargo of 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.459
 sugar then in tc that immediately 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.530
 go to the bloodstream what 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.150
 it is that it retains it and starts 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.739
 release little by little in a way 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.350
 Paulatin begins to release that sugar 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.840
 bloodstream and then they are avoided 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.030
 those real sugar spikes and you're 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.310
 highs that are so harmful to the 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.840
 diabetic that's the fiber side 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.569
 soluble now let's talk about the fiber 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.670
 insoluble insoluble fiber if we 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.410
 we see here on this side we have the fiber 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.450
 green the green planting so that it's going to 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.250
 help regularly like that is what 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.890
 we had damaged the fat 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.989
 we damage the cochambre or what is 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.019
 find hit our free hands of 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.780
 the same way all the insoluble fiber 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:58.840
 battling goes cleaning your intestines 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.090
 is cleaning your colon your arteries and your 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.120
 Veins that are left 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.650
 cholesterol and fat plates are 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.900
 they are cleaning thanks to fiber 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.670
 Insoluble is extremely important because 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.129
 that soluble fiber and fiber 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.980
 insoluble that contains the nopal for this 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.239
 is that this product the nopal is so 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.940
 good and has so many qualities 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.970
 therapeutic summarizing I tell you the nopal 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.049
 help for diabetics 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.060
 hypoglycemic for people who 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.979
 they are obese and are in control of 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.870

 cholesterol although the nopal acts as a 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.430
 natural antibiotic has one is a 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.950
 Great source of strong calcium source 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.160

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.690

 that probably with the world beating is 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.420
 it happens that we eat it and the cactus that 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.760
 I have here for example it is normal that 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.350

 you would like to receive all the benefits 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.280
 of the evils daily perhaps they 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.720
 wait for him but maybe maybe to you 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.580
 Do not even like the taste of

 because it is a product that is used 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:09.510
 what is the system used 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.950
 It consists in dehydrating the 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.300
 product the piles of which 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.280
 dehydrate but at temperatures 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.950
 freezing in such a way that the 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.300

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.490
 it takes away all their ages in 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.740
 freezing temperatures not like the 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.560
 heat that would regularly be lost 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:28.080
 they would lose property and this guarantees
