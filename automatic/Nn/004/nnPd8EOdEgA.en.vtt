there is a there is a little tab on the
side<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.119> your<00:01:39.240> ignition<00:01:39.450> locks<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:39.930> there

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
side of your ignition locks on there

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.140 
side of your ignition locks on there
that's<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.740> there<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.490> can<00:01:41.670> access<00:01:42.000> that

that's in there and you can access that

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.840 
that's in there and you can access that
through<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:43.200> access<00:01:43.619> hole<00:01:43.770> here

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
through this this access hole here

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.240 
through this this access hole here
you'll<00:01:44.850> need<00:01:45.060> either<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.659> really<00:01:46.590> thin

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
you'll need either a really thin

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.280 
you'll need either a really thin
screwdriver<00:01:47.700> or<00:01:48.360> I'm<00:01:48.540> going<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.720> use<00:01:48.780> an<00:01:49.020> allen

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
screwdriver or I'm going to use an allen

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.520 
screwdriver or I'm going to use an allen
key<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.759> to<00:01:50.759> press<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.149> in<00:01:51.299> but<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.380> know<00:01:52.409> you

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
key to to press it in but you know you

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.490 
key to to press it in but you know you
might<00:01:52.799> want<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.479> get<00:01:54.479> underneath<00:01:54.810> there<00:01:55.140> and

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
might want to get underneath there and

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.039 
might want to get underneath there and
look<00:01:56.130> for<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.689> way<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.869> know

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
look for it and so that way you know

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.920 
look for it and so that way you know
which<00:01:58.200> way<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.500> aim<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.219> allen<00:01:59.490> key<00:01:59.840> once<00:02:00.840> you

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
which way to aim the allen key once you

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.289 
which way to aim the allen key once you
put<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.290> it's<00:02:01.530> at<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.399> bit<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.820> an<00:02:03.000> angle<00:02:03.270> so

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
put it in it's at a bit of an angle so

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.300 
put it in it's at a bit of an angle so
it<00:02:03.600> might<00:02:03.719> be<00:02:03.869> confusing<00:02:04.290> if<00:02:04.500> you're<00:02:05.070> doing<00:02:05.159> it

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
it might be confusing if you're doing it

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.130 
it might be confusing if you're doing it
are<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.490> first<00:02:05.700> time<00:02:05.909> it's<00:02:06.090> it's<00:02:06.719> going<00:02:06.990> this

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
are the first time it's it's going this

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.109 
are the first time it's it's going this
way<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:08.399> might<00:02:08.550> think<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:08.849> might<00:02:09.000> need

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
way and you might think you might need

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.550 
way and you might think you might need
to<00:02:09.239> put<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.479> straight<00:02:09.599> but<00:02:09.989> it's<00:02:10.140> actually<00:02:10.440> at

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
to put it straight but it's actually at

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.050 
to put it straight but it's actually at
an<00:02:10.649> angle<00:02:10.920> going<00:02:11.099> this<00:02:11.340> way<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:11.700> we<00:02:11.849> want<00:02:12.000> to

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
an angle going this way so we want to

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.900 
an angle going this way so we want to
keep<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.270> in<00:02:12.330> mind

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
keep that in mind

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.580 
keep that in mind
okay<00:02:13.210> so<00:02:13.300> what<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:13.660> want<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.900> do<00:02:13.960> next<00:02:14.170> is<00:02:14.320> just

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
handing to this access hole and then try

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.580 
handing to this access hole and then try
to<00:02:24.520> find<00:02:24.790> that<00:02:24.970> tab<00:02:25.270> as<00:02:25.540> best<00:02:25.870> as<00:02:26.020> you<00:02:26.050> can

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590

to drill that thing out and once you
drill<00:03:09.490> that<00:03:09.640> out<00:03:09.820> you<00:03:10.600> can<00:03:11.520> you<00:03:12.520> know<00:03:12.690> find

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
drill that out you can you know find

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.200 
drill that out you can you know find
ways<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:14.130> to<00:03:15.130> pull<00:03:15.370> this<00:03:15.550> ignition<00:03:15.940> lock

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
ways to to pull this ignition lock

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.000 
ways to to pull this ignition lock
cylinder<00:03:16.570> out<00:03:16.690> you<00:03:16.840> know<00:03:16.960> you<00:03:17.020> can<00:03:17.260> drill

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
cylinder out you know you can drill
