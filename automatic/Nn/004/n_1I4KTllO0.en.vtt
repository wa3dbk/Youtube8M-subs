00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
it next to the samsung galaxy note 2

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.700 
it next to the samsung galaxy note 2
this<00:00:20.850> particular<00:00:21.539> design<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.230> created

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
this particular design that I created

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.689 
this particular design that I created
it's<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.460> six-point<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.480> three<00:00:24.720> inches<00:00:25.130> and<00:00:26.130> as

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
it's a six-point and three inches and as

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.200 
it's a six-point and three inches and as
you<00:00:26.970> can<00:00:27.210> see<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:28.170> vessel<00:00:28.680> on<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.400> sides<00:00:29.640> it's

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
you can see the vessel on the sides it's

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.330 
you can see the vessel on the sides it's
really<00:00:30.750> really<00:00:31.109> thin<00:00:32.059> so<00:00:33.770> it<00:00:34.770> looks<00:00:35.250> like

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
really really thin so it looks like

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.569 
really really thin so it looks like
you're<00:00:35.430> going<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.820> get<00:00:36.000> more<00:00:36.329> screen<00:00:37.370> but<00:00:38.370> not

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
you're going to get more screen but not

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.119 
you're going to get more screen but not
necessarily<00:00:39.120> making<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.870> phone<00:00:40.170> too<00:00:40.710> big<00:00:40.920> or

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
necessarily making the phone too big or

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:48.319 
necessarily making the phone too big or
too<00:00:41.160> tall<00:00:43.670> as<00:00:44.670> France<00:00:45.000> expects<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:47.670> rumor

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
too tall as France expects the rumor

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.340 
too tall as France expects the rumor
that<00:00:48.360> he's<00:00:48.719> been<00:00:48.870> going<00:00:48.930> on<00:00:49.320> it's<00:00:49.680> about<00:00:51.350> two

so<00:01:19.400> those<00:01:20.400> are<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.640> main<00:01:20.909> specs<00:01:22.130> i<00:01:23.130> also

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
so those are the main specs i also

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.649 
so those are the main specs i also
created<00:01:24.270> guys<00:01:25.700> 6<00:01:27.140> 6.5<00:01:28.490> inch<00:01:29.490> screen<00:01:30.060> which<00:01:30.450> I

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
created guys 6 6.5 inch screen which I

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.999 
created guys 6 6.5 inch screen which I
have<00:01:30.869> right<00:01:31.049> here<00:01:32.720> this<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.990> older<00:01:34.500> design

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
have right here this is the older design

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.359 
have right here this is the older design
that<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.340> being<00:01:35.640> showing<00:01:36.210> up<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:37.320> as<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.159> can

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
that is being showing up and as you can

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.200 
that is being showing up and as you can
tell<00:01:39.170> they<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.770> course<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.700> 6.5<00:01:42.600> looks<00:01:43.020> beer<00:01:44.210> but

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
tell they of course a 6.5 looks beer but

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.370 
tell they of course a 6.5 looks beer but
also<00:01:45.390> wider<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:49.100> 6.5<00:01:50.420> looks<00:01:51.420> pretty<00:01:52.079> much

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
also wider the 6.5 looks pretty much

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.609 
also wider the 6.5 looks pretty much
almost<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.399> same<00:01:53.640> as<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.270> galaxy<00:01:55.259> note<00:01:55.439> 2

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
almost the same as the galaxy note 2

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.120 
almost the same as the galaxy note 2
right<00:01:55.860> now<00:01:56.270> except<00:01:57.270> for<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.540> bigger<00:01:58.380> screen<00:01:58.770> a

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
right now except for a bigger screen a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.660 
right now except for a bigger screen a
little<00:01:59.430> bit<00:01:59.790> wider<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:01.140> course<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:02.340> specs

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
little bit wider and of course the specs

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.679 
little bit wider and of course the specs
are<00:02:02.820> going<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.030> be<00:02:03.119> way<00:02:03.299> better<00:02:03.950> but<00:02:05.420> if<00:02:06.420> you

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
are going to be way better but if you

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.130 
are going to be way better but if you
look<00:02:06.899> at<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.550> these<00:02:08.550> design<00:02:09.030> here<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.509> 6.5

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
look at the these design here of the 6.5

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.860 
look at the these design here of the 6.5
versus<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.860> 6.3<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:12.170> will<00:02:13.170> have<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.319> say

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
versus a 6.3 I will have to say

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.570 
versus a 6.3 I will have to say
my<00:02:13.959> opinion<00:02:14.409> I<00:02:14.590> would<00:02:14.620> rather<00:02:14.950> go<00:02:15.280> with<00:02:15.459> this

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
my opinion I would rather go with this

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.440 
my opinion I would rather go with this
one<00:02:15.870> because<00:02:17.310> this<00:02:18.310> is<00:02:18.580> looking<00:02:19.239> like<00:02:19.420> a

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
one because this is looking like a

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.449 
one because this is looking like a
little<00:02:19.870> too<00:02:20.140> wide<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:21.640> hole<00:02:21.879> in<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.180> head<00:02:23.459> so

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
little too wide to hole in the head so

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.509 
little too wide to hole in the head so
if<00:02:24.640> I<00:02:24.790> can<00:02:24.970> show<00:02:25.209> you<00:02:25.269> here<00:02:25.750> it's<00:02:26.519> really

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
if I can show you here it's really

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.119 
if I can show you here it's really
really<00:02:27.879> hard<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:29.049> reach<00:02:29.319> on<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:29.920> other<00:02:30.010> side

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
really hard to reach on the other side

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.020 
really hard to reach on the other side
to<00:02:30.579> try<00:02:30.819> to<00:02:30.879> access<00:02:31.239> a<00:02:31.599> the<00:02:31.930> phone<00:02:32.170> keypad<00:02:32.650> or

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
to try to access a the phone keypad or

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.339 
to try to access a the phone keypad or
any<00:02:34.030> application<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.720> you<00:02:34.900> have<00:02:35.079> on<00:02:35.200> the

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
any application that you have on the

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:43.440 
any application that you have on the
left<00:02:35.590> side<00:02:35.769> of<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.069> screen<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:41.430> if<00:02:42.430> i<00:02:42.730> hold<00:02:43.060> the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
left side of the screen so if i hold the

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.800 
left side of the screen so if i hold the
six<00:02:44.200> point<00:02:44.470> three<00:02:44.590> inches<00:02:45.299> it's<00:02:46.299> a<00:02:46.510> little

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
six point three inches it's a little

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.199 
six point three inches it's a little
more<00:02:46.989> comfortable<00:02:47.500> I'm<00:02:47.950> still<00:02:48.430> able<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.819> reach

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
more comfortable I'm still able to reach

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.650 
more comfortable I'm still able to reach
on<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:50.410> other<00:02:50.590> side<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.430> as<00:02:52.209> a<00:02:52.359> matter<00:02:52.569> of

on the other side and as a matter of

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.289 
on the other side and as a matter of
fact<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:53.019> might<00:02:53.170> be<00:02:53.349> a<00:02:53.379> little<00:02:53.829> bit<00:02:55.590> thinner

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
fact it might be a little bit thinner

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.059 
fact it might be a little bit thinner

quick video comparison sizes just to
give<00:04:10.690> you<00:04:10.810> an<00:04:11.139> idea<00:04:11.290> of<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:12.220> all<00:04:13.090> these

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
differentials up so we can get a better
