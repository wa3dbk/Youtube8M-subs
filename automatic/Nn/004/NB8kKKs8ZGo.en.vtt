00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.890 
some evidence to prove otherwise I'll
now<00:02:12.460> go<00:02:12.730> over<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.090> eight<00:02:13.240> most<00:02:13.420> credible

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
now go over the eight most credible

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.920 
now go over the eight most credible
pieces<00:02:14.290> of<00:02:14.410> evidence<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.950> back<00:02:15.100> this<00:02:15.340> up

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
pieces of evidence to back this up

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.510 
pieces of evidence to back this up
they're<00:02:16.930> both<00:02:17.170> pink<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.650> regular<00:02:18.010> form<00:02:18.340> in

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
they're both pink and regular form in

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.880 
they're both pink and regular form in
blue<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:18.880> shiny<00:02:19.180> form<00:02:19.600> while<00:02:20.350> ditto<00:02:20.620> is

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
blue and shiny form while ditto is

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.860 
blue and shiny form while ditto is
technically<00:02:21.490> purple<00:02:22.000> depending<00:02:22.150> on<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.630> game

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
technically purple depending on the game

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.690 
technically purple depending on the game
this<00:02:23.260> doesn't<00:02:23.680> disprove<00:02:23.950> anything<00:02:24.310> since

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
this doesn't disprove anything since

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.740 
this doesn't disprove anything since
Mewtwo<00:02:25.090> is<00:02:25.120> purple<00:02:25.770> they<00:02:26.770> both<00:02:27.010> weigh<00:02:27.280> exactly

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
Mewtwo is purple they both weigh exactly

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.320 
Mewtwo is purple they both weigh exactly
8.8<00:02:28.750> pounds<00:02:29.550> they<00:02:30.550> are<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:30.700> only<00:02:30.970> two

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
8.8 pounds they are the only two

8.8 pounds they are the only two
pokemons<00:02:31.840> that<00:02:31.990> could<00:02:32.110> learn<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.410> move

pokemons that could learn the move
transform<00:02:33.160> that's<00:02:33.880> right<00:02:34.270> out<00:02:34.480> of<00:02:34.650> 649

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
Mew and ditto ditto simply looks like a

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.190 
Mew and ditto ditto simply looks like a
failed<00:02:42.490> science<00:02:42.910> experiment<00:02:43.600> which<00:02:44.020> would

failed science experiment which would

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
make sense if he's a failed clone they

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.010 
make sense if he's a failed clone they
are<00:02:47.020> both<00:02:47.260> genderless<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:49.240> game<00:02:49.480> state<00:02:49.810> that

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
are both genderless the game state that

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.840 
are both genderless the game state that
Mewtwo<00:02:50.380> is<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.650> only<00:02:50.800> successful<00:02:51.310> clone<00:02:51.700> of

Mewtwo is the only successful clone of

Mewtwo is the only successful clone of
MU<00:02:52.030> which<00:02:52.330> would<00:02:52.510> make<00:02:52.660> you<00:02:52.780> assume<00:02:53.110> that

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
MU which would make you assume that

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.860 
MU which would make you assume that
there<00:02:53.440> were<00:02:53.500> unsuccessful<00:02:53.890> clones<00:02:54.870> in

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870

dittos in the pokémon mansion and truly
in<00:02:59.620> cave<00:02:59.920> which<00:03:00.370> just<00:03:00.610> so<00:03:00.760> happens<00:03:01.120> to<00:03:01.209> be<00:03:01.300> the

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
in cave which just so happens to be the

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.680 
in cave which just so happens to be the
two<00:03:01.660> places<00:03:01.959> associated<00:03:02.830> with<00:03:02.920> you<00:03:03.330> both<00:03:04.330> Mew

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
two places associated with you both Mew

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.360 
two places associated with you both Mew
and<00:03:04.720> ditto<00:03:05.110> have<00:03:05.350> base<00:03:05.590> stats<00:03:05.920> that<00:03:06.100> are<00:03:06.250> the

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
and ditto have base stats that are the

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.240 
and ditto have base stats that are the
same<00:03:06.610> in<00:03:06.760> every<00:03:06.910> category<00:03:07.920> with<00:03:08.920> all<00:03:09.070> the

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
same in every category with all the

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.070 
same in every category with all the
evidence<00:03:09.580> on<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.850> table<00:03:10.239> let<00:03:10.450> me<00:03:10.570> give<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:10.900> my

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
evidence on the table let me give you my

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.490 
evidence on the table let me give you my
opinion

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.429 

in<00:03:18.610> my<00:03:19.610> personal<00:03:20.120> opinion<00:03:20.269> I<00:03:20.840> think<00:03:20.900> ditto<00:03:21.260> is

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:21.439 
in my personal opinion I think ditto is

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:23.740 
in my personal opinion I think ditto is
a<00:03:21.470> failed<00:03:21.829> clone<00:03:22.129> mu<00:03:22.519> just<00:03:23.209> for<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.510> sheer

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
a failed clone mu just for the sheer

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.869 
a failed clone mu just for the sheer
amount<00:03:23.870> of<00:03:24.079> evidence<00:03:24.290> supporting<00:03:24.680> it<00:03:25.159> but<00:03:25.790> the

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
amount of evidence supporting it but the

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:27.429 
amount of evidence supporting it but the
only<00:03:26.060> way<00:03:26.329> we'll<00:03:26.480> know<00:03:26.540> for<00:03:26.689> sure<00:03:26.900> is<00:03:27.200> if<00:03:27.349> the

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:27.439 
only way we'll know for sure is if the

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:29.050 
only way we'll know for sure is if the
people<00:03:27.590> like<00:03:27.860> gamefreak<00:03:28.370> confirm<00:03:28.790> or<00:03:28.909> deny

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
people like gamefreak confirm or deny

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.720 
people like gamefreak confirm or deny
the<00:03:29.209> claim<00:03:29.629> so<00:03:30.560> until<00:03:30.890> then<00:03:31.159> we'll<00:03:31.430> just<00:03:31.610> have

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
the claim so until then we'll just have

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.250 
the claim so until then we'll just have
to<00:03:31.849> keep<00:03:32.060> on<00:03:32.269> theorizing<00:03:34.629> so<00:03:35.629> that's<00:03:35.810> my<00:03:36.019> take

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
to keep on theorizing so that's my take

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.869 
to keep on theorizing so that's my take
on<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.560> new<00:03:36.709> ditto<00:03:36.920> theory<00:03:37.430> and<00:03:37.549> if<00:03:37.640> you<00:03:37.730> have

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 
on the new ditto theory and if you have

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.250 
on the new ditto theory and if you have
any<00:03:38.030> other<00:03:38.209> thoughts<00:03:38.510> please<00:03:38.840> feel<00:03:39.049> free<00:03:39.079> to

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
any other thoughts please feel free to
