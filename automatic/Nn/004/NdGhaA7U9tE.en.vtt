00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
part of the reason for this was I first

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.630 
part of the reason for this was I first
started<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.500> uno<00:01:57.650> project<00:01:58.130> it<00:01:58.340> was<00:01:58.460> a<00:01:58.490> high

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640

school science fair project I was never
supposed<00:02:00.380> to<00:02:00.560> be<00:02:00.710> a<00:02:00.740> business<00:02:00.920> I<00:02:01.370> quickly

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
supposed to be a business I quickly

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.180 
supposed to be a business I quickly
realized<00:02:02.420> that<00:02:02.690> there's<00:02:03.290> really<00:02:03.680> practical

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
realized that there's really practical

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.470 
realized that there's really practical
safety<00:02:04.520> issues<00:02:04.820> that<00:02:04.850> we<00:02:05.060> just<00:02:05.210> can't

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
safety issues that we just can't

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.660 
safety issues that we just can't
overcome<00:02:05.990> when<00:02:06.290> they<00:02:06.410> own<00:02:06.530> up<00:02:06.680> what<00:02:07.370> started

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
overcome when they own up what started

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.090 
overcome when they own up what started
off<00:02:07.760> as<00:02:07.790> very<00:02:08.210> simple<00:02:08.750> concept<00:02:09.440> of<00:02:09.619> one<00:02:09.860> motor

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
off as very simple concept of one motor

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.160 
off as very simple concept of one motor
turned<00:02:10.670> into<00:02:10.820> something<00:02:11.300> at<00:02:11.660> hundreds<00:02:12.110> of

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
turned into something at hundreds of

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.950 
turned into something at hundreds of
moving<00:02:12.470> parts<00:02:12.770> for<00:02:13.160> motors<00:02:13.520> quickly<00:02:14.300> moving

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
moving parts for motors quickly moving

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.870 
moving parts for motors quickly moving
out<00:02:15.080> of<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.260> realm<00:02:15.560> yeah<00:02:15.740> reasonable<00:02:16.490> pricing

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
out of the realm yeah reasonable pricing

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.490 
out of the realm yeah reasonable pricing
so<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.270> wasn't<00:02:17.570> until<00:02:17.780> this<00:02:17.900> big<00:02:18.080> investment

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
so it wasn't until this big investment

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.930

you<00:03:29.470> know<00:03:29.620> this<00:03:29.830> is<00:03:29.980> like<00:03:30.130> if<00:03:30.310> you<00:03:30.340> want<00:03:30.610> ever

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
you know this is like if you want ever

this<00:03:33.670> is<00:03:33.820> what<00:03:34.000> you<00:03:34.120> take<00:03:34.360> so<00:03:34.990> there's<00:03:35.200> these

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
this is what you take so there's these

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.980 
this is what you take so there's these
little<00:03:35.440> spiked<00:03:35.890> things<00:03:36.280> on<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.700> foot<00:03:36.910> pad<00:03:37.150> I'm

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
little spiked things on the foot pad I'm

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.630 
little spiked things on the foot pad I'm
wearing<00:03:38.350> awesome<00:03:38.710> boots<00:03:38.980> so<00:03:39.220> I<00:03:39.250> can't<00:03:39.550> even

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
wearing awesome boots so I can't even

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.030 
wearing awesome boots so I can't even
really<00:03:40.000> feel<00:03:40.210> it<00:03:40.420> so<00:03:41.260> this<00:03:41.440> is<00:03:41.560> essentially

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
really feel it so this is essentially

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.550 
really feel it so this is essentially
like<00:03:42.070> a<00:03:42.220> BMX<00:03:42.730> trail<00:03:43.090> right<00:03:43.960> back<00:03:44.140> here<00:03:44.350> through

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
like a BMX trail right back here through

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
the mud no problem the big treads just

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.950 
the mud no problem the big treads just
take<00:03:48.370> it<00:03:48.580> on<00:03:48.730> oh<00:03:50.580> yeah<00:03:51.580> you<00:03:52.420> can<00:03:52.570> see<00:03:52.600> if<00:03:52.870> you

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 
take it on oh yeah you can see if you

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.740 
take it on oh yeah you can see if you
let<00:03:53.140> off<00:03:53.320> the<00:03:53.470> throttle

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
let off the throttle

you<00:03:55.750> don't<00:03:55.870> even<00:03:55.989> have<00:03:56.140> to<00:03:56.319> break<00:03:56.530> it<00:04:01.470> why

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
you don't even have to break it why

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.589 
you don't even have to break it why
decide<00:04:02.920> to<00:04:03.159> go<00:04:03.310> with<00:04:03.519> the<00:04:03.670> steering<00:04:04.150> in<00:04:04.360> the

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
decide to go with the steering in the

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.420 
decide to go with the steering in the
board<00:04:04.870> instead<00:04:05.200> of<00:04:05.470> you<00:04:05.920> know<00:04:05.950> almost<00:04:06.190> like<00:04:06.340> a

stability purposes considering that
you're<00:04:11.019> standing<00:04:11.260> on<00:04:11.500> something<00:04:11.980> that<00:04:12.700> you

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
you're standing on something that you

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.880 
you're standing on something that you
want<00:04:13.060> to<00:04:13.269> be<00:04:13.390> directly<00:04:13.959> connected<00:04:14.409> to<00:04:14.440> so<00:04:14.829> if

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
want to be directly connected to so if

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.469 
want to be directly connected to so if
you<00:04:14.980> have<00:04:15.069> the<00:04:15.190> handle<00:04:15.519> moving<00:04:15.730> and<00:04:16.030> the

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
you have the handle moving and the

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:17.819 
you have the handle moving and the
machine<00:04:16.750> moving<00:04:17.079> then<00:04:17.199> you<00:04:17.290> got<00:04:17.410> nothing<00:04:17.530> to

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
machine moving then you got nothing to

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.650 
machine moving then you got nothing to
hold<00:04:17.949> on<00:04:18.190> to<00:04:18.370> so<00:04:18.669> the<00:04:18.790> board<00:04:19.030> is<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.449> thing

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
hold on to so the board is the thing

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.270 
hold on to so the board is the thing
that<00:04:19.690> moves<00:04:20.049> where<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:20.889> rest<00:04:21.070> of<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:21.190> machine

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
that moves where the rest of the machine

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.189 
that moves where the rest of the machine
stays<00:04:21.639> fixed<00:04:21.940> to<00:04:22.090> your<00:04:22.150> body<00:04:22.389> how<00:04:22.900> does<00:04:23.080> it

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 
stays fixed to your body how does it

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:25.200 
stays fixed to your body how does it
work<00:04:23.440> essentially<00:04:24.190> yeah<00:04:24.669> it's<00:04:25.000> not

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
work essentially yeah it's not

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.909 
work essentially yeah it's not
electronic<00:04:25.900> at<00:04:26.199> all<00:04:26.350> actually<00:04:26.680> it's

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
electronic at all actually it's

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.279 
electronic at all actually it's
completely<00:04:27.070> mechanical<00:04:27.970> it<00:04:28.300> has<00:04:28.479> a<00:04:28.510> patented

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.600 
control like doing a high and a low gear
kind<00:04:40.120> of<00:04:40.210> thing<00:04:40.800> thirty<00:04:41.800> miles<00:04:42.010> an<00:04:42.190> hour<00:04:42.280> top

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
kind of thing thirty miles an hour top

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.180 
kind of thing thirty miles an hour top
speed<00:04:42.639> was<00:04:43.449> 30<00:04:43.780> just<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.199> sweet<00:04:44.470> spot<00:04:44.800> or<00:04:45.070> how

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
speed was 30 just the sweet spot or how

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.950 
speed was 30 just the sweet spot or how
did<00:04:45.310> you<00:04:45.430> get<00:04:45.580> to<00:04:45.699> that<00:04:45.820> number<00:04:46.030> I<00:04:46.389> think<00:04:46.449> 30

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
did you get to that number I think 30

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.500 
did you get to that number I think 30
represents<00:04:47.770> honestly<00:04:48.580> for<00:04:48.789> most<00:04:48.970> people<00:04:49.330> the

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
represents honestly for most people the

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.270 
represents honestly for most people the
maximum<00:04:50.050> speed<00:04:50.289> you'd<00:04:50.440> want<00:04:50.710> to<00:04:50.830> be<00:04:50.889> going<00:04:51.130> on

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
maximum speed you'd want to be going on

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.040 
maximum speed you'd want to be going on
something<00:04:51.610> standing<00:04:51.940> up<00:04:52.090> after<00:04:52.660> that<00:04:52.840> it's

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
something standing up after that it's

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.900 
something standing up after that it's
just<00:04:53.350> it's<00:04:53.740> frightening<00:04:54.070> yeah<00:04:54.460> so<00:04:54.729> you<00:04:54.789> don't

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
just it's frightening yeah so you don't

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.180 
just it's frightening yeah so you don't
want<00:04:55.150> to<00:04:55.240> be<00:04:55.330> going<00:04:55.479> you<00:04:55.930> know<00:04:56.050> 70<00:04:56.860> miles<00:04:57.010> an

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
guys have coming up one of our very

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.390 
guys have coming up one of our very
first<00:05:20.169> youtube<00:05:20.380> videos<00:05:20.860> was<00:05:21.039> seen<00:05:21.220> by<00:05:21.340> the

first youtube videos was seen by the
military<00:05:21.910> and<00:05:22.000> they<00:05:22.270> invited<00:05:22.690> us<00:05:22.780> out<00:05:22.930> to<00:05:23.080> do

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 
military and they invited us out to do

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.080 
military and they invited us out to do
testing<00:05:23.590> and<00:05:23.770> four<00:05:24.250> years<00:05:24.430> later<00:05:24.580> we<00:05:24.820> now<00:05:24.940> have

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
testing and four years later we now have

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:31.670 
testing and four years later we now have
a<00:05:25.120> very<00:05:25.300> different<00:05:25.570> creature

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.460 

it<00:05:32.550> has<00:05:32.669> a<00:05:32.699> hybrid<00:05:32.910> drive<00:05:33.270> system<00:05:33.300> it<00:05:33.870> is<00:05:33.990> a<00:05:34.020> 48

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
it has a hybrid drive system it is a 48

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.469 
it has a hybrid drive system it is a 48
horsepower<00:05:34.919> rotary<00:05:35.160> engine<00:05:35.669> that<00:05:36.090> drives<00:05:36.270> a

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
horsepower rotary engine that drives a

lithium<00:05:36.810> battery<00:05:36.840> bank<00:05:37.350> and<00:05:37.470> then<00:05:37.620> two

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
lithium battery bank and then two

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.439 
lithium battery bank and then two
electric<00:05:38.250> hub<00:05:38.400> motors<00:05:38.729> so<00:05:39.000> it<00:05:39.180> has<00:05:39.300> the

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:39.449 
electric hub motors so it has the

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:41.360 
electric hub motors so it has the
ability<00:05:39.539> to<00:05:39.750> spin<00:05:39.990> on<00:05:40.110> the<00:05:40.229> spot<00:05:40.500> okay<00:05:40.680> and<00:05:41.280> it

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
ability to spin on the spot okay and it

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.490 
ability to spin on the spot okay and it
can<00:05:41.520> carry<00:05:41.669> 800<00:05:42.210> pounds<00:05:42.509> of<00:05:42.600> equipment<00:05:42.780> on<00:05:43.199> top

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
can carry 800 pounds of equipment on top

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.499 
can carry 800 pounds of equipment on top
of<00:05:43.680> the<00:05:44.039> idea<00:05:44.340> is<00:05:44.460> that<00:05:44.520> of<00:05:44.820> some<00:05:44.970> of<00:05:45.060> the<00:05:45.120> extra

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
of the idea is that of some of the extra

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:47.240 
of the idea is that of some of the extra
baggage<00:05:45.690> that<00:05:46.169> is<00:05:46.380> an<00:05:46.620> essential<00:05:46.860> to<00:05:47.130> their

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
baggage that is an essential to their

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.070 
baggage that is an essential to their
survival<00:05:47.460> they<00:05:47.910> can<00:05:48.030> put<00:05:48.180> on<00:05:48.270> the<00:05:48.360> mule<00:05:48.539> light

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
survival they can put on the mule light

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.510 
survival they can put on the mule light
hitting<00:05:49.259> the<00:05:49.380> whole<00:05:49.560> squads<00:05:49.889> load<00:05:50.220> and
