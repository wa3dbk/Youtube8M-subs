 video then galera tower with fury and 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.820
 So beauty is like thinking of 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.830
 when you had this channel here it's a lottery 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:20.699
 the result is bugre while that 's it 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:23.900
 demonstrates, knows the draw, but let's 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:28.619
 there then is the following I have to say is 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:32.060
 the dragon br for those who do not know it is 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.060
 my brother has a channel on youtube 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:42.750
 he bought a microwave 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:45.120
 so and before he had a goal it 's a 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.610
 reiterated today a cycle 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:56.760
 but now that 's how he's doing with that 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:58.800
 on the periphery equipment he will return the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.710
 channel was that it was a draw of 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:17.670
 Return was kaka, I do not know how to do the law. 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:20.150
 so now it 's this to win neither to any 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.759
 angel of me the year 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:29.520
 Then everything will work out for you and it will go 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:32.659
 sending will give result and result 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:38.189
 From here , I broke off the black, too. 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.780
 're being held and has just ceeja 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.979
 more chance of winning another peripheral 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.009
 of the reservation 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.270
 I know it's not the top of the breeze it's 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.270
 one of the most basic nÃ© 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:56.000
 but it is very useful and good it is strong that the 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.189
 keyboard is waterproof is to prove the 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.290
 cycle and I quite annoyed not 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.500
 I'll talk a lot, but you already know what 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.240
 have to do from where the goal goes 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.300
 be 500 to settle it is that in this video 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.750
 hence it would not come from the flower and follow the 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.010
 people come in since the channels come 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.650
 That's it 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.959
 it was a strong hug and if something else 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.150
 they were like this guy here always 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.060
 remembering this channel that is a lottery 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:28.019
 I have an official channel of five emmys 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:31.319
 600 is currently described by the work can 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:34.110
 come from the gameplay I do live in great 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.930
 things write there is and if you want 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.549
