00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 you have planted a tree in your 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.120
 garden and then one day you see 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:13.230
 that it bothers you how transplanted this 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:14.730
 rice shrub it's a noise then 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.170
 in addition it is not well suited here 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.690
 since only a little bit wet at 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.430
 body to change the place we go the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.930
 plants and and for that there are some 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.880
 steps to take the first thing 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.170
 so if you are in wet weather this 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.580
 is not necessary but if you are 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.380
 in a drier period it takes at 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.510
 beforehand or at least one week 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.669
 the advanced bring him 10 15 or even 20 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.070
 liters of water now let's 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.030
 proceed to transplant 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.360
 so you must never put the wick 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.190
 in the direction of the tree it is necessary 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.180
 to m spade perpendicular 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.710
 and we will calculate about 50 cm 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.059
 trunk and we're going to do a little 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.059
 trench all around 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.670
 now you have dug your little 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.239
 trench the value of 20 to 30 cm of 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.670
 depth 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.549
 we will do to make second 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.460
 spade so as to be more than 40 cm from 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.960
 depth to reach the roots 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.580
 we will clear the roots in 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.470
 below giving spades 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:21.439
 just below the roots for that one 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:24.920
 the hatch we slip a cost on one side 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.920
 a shot of the other 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.510
 now that our goal has arrived at 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.010
 good port 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.710
 I'm going to make a hole so I'm going 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.380
 first disengage sounded the surface on 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.950
 a few inches deep 5 6 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.960
 cm 10 cm big maximum my first do 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.430
 of Belgians to use me to remove the land 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:55.250
 from above that I want to put aside 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:02:00.050
 now I remove the earth from below 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.700
 I'm on the other side at the bottom of the hole 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.270
 give a little spade of way 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.430
 endless 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.080
 we will take the opportunity to improve the 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.960
 field age brings a little bit of 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.280
 potting soil potting mixed with 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.650
 our land now that the mound is 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.920
 in place and bring back my land and to the tass 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.080
 as and until the month 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.090
 now the planting and finished 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.950
 almost done I did a little 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.110
 bowl around for to make a 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.390
 water reserve 10 to 15 liters of water for 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.460
 make him leave 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.620
 and if we want to prevent moisture from 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.620
 evaporates nothing also prevents you from 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.340
 payet the foot of your bus art for 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.340
 they have a better recovery
