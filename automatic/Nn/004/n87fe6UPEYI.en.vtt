00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.729
 very good to all the last one we are 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.979
 in a new video tutorial of with sprays 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:10.220
 good for the first one I'm going to teach 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:13.730
 the commands commands and configurations 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:17.440
 basic for the happy the girl 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.890
 options that were name 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:25.390
 here this can be any in colors 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:28.270
 as you want the look is longer than is 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.390
 it is not recommended 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:34.870
 the color is the same no matter after 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.800
 I'm translucent they do not give lean to 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.850
 advanced 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:43.570
 is that they touch him and this is normal 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:47.350
 looking is the web and you have to give 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.059
 words look at the pasteur later for the 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.730
 weapon they have to give is to the 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:55.210
 left and it's on the right after 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.860
 to buy the hostel menus that is like 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.650
 what all the pros have these is 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.940
 normal that shows up for you in the 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.680
 control this this and this normal this 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:11.540
 Center player mails is for when you 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:14.450
 you see the type of radar in transparent 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.750
 After that, this is how the wine came 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.420
 content normally the mouse this is 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.400
 for the new one for example if we want it 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.710
 to 20 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.470
 or 3.0 we put here 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.350
 than the normal configuration later on 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.310
 audio they have it in half more or 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.799
 less and the mp3 volume nothing 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.670
 and the sound quality put it in the 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:44.060
 that they put better I hope is the video of 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.700
 all of us nothing I go I know this for 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.659
 try the microphone that to test 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:55.960
 microphone this does not touch anything in the ok the 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.960
 we control the gate the sun 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.940
 all right 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.190
 and it appears I only have an easy knot 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.500
 says that when they change for example 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.560
 they have the m4 also the knife they're going 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.860
 to leave the menu but this directly 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:18.380
 they put it after him king and what he says 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.300
 down in microsoft 3500 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.300
 and it's perfect 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.300
 max 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:32.090
 and also good are the commands 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:36.560
 after 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:40.610
 for example here I already said it here 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.040
 touched nothing and then only to play 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.420
 best 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:50.140
 to others and they do not know very well how to play what 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.409
 you have to do is shoot 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.930
 crouched that much better and looks at her 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:58.260
 it shrinks you more so you have more 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.060
 precision 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.730
 and another thing that I recommend you 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.069
 follow a pack of weapons or texture 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.420
 as I would have thought in another video 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.420
 I will teach them how to install it 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.480
 I would tell you that servers can not 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:19.620
 because the server takes him as a boy 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.300
 for example it has good now to please not 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.930
 I should be like this 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.700
 closed 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:33.920
 and there would have to be normally 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:36.200
 that's how it looks normal and it 's good that it's 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.180
 you can now point the record 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.200
 that was cut when we only want 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.740
 shoot for example here there is sun and you 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.040
 we are going up the gun 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:50.050
 we see that here is where there 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.930
 than hit him and he has two or three bullets left 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.530
 then you leave some techniques for 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:00.040
 lowering the record level is to duck and 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.319
 good is shooting to put the most for 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.780
 down 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.329
 they have for example this is so and this is 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.790
 much more concentrated and then another 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:11.280
 which is not very recommendable but they do 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.680
 what am I going to do here that they shoot and 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.169
 they do so 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.139
 but this way it concentrates more and spend 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:22.919
 more bullets if here is if you move you get 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:25.139
 that name and then look at it and the 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.930
 spent better and is with the guns 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.699
 best 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:34.930
 then the m4 treat and the definition 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:38.220
 use it with a silencer that better 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.220
 and for true chau 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.419
 well then the center play e mails that 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.479
 and when you have for example to each 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:50.690
 one I just do not know 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:54.830
 valentino imagine and here and the name 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:57.199
 I usually showed them down here but 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:01.009
 when from these the home down in the 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:03.710
 character that's a lot better 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:06.199
 very very many thanks for watching this 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.720
 video helps them please leave 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:14.060
 a like and here I will also leave you in 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:17.880
 the staff videos on the channel of a very 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:20.220
 good friend of mine destroys 77 gamer 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:24.090
 others have some classes out there but in 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:27.300
 the recommended ones and I want to win 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:30.210
 and good and then later with him we are going to 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.190
 upload more videos like for example that 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.160
 now I'm going to go up inside very 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:38.699
