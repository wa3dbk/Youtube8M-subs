2012 Ram 1500 sport talking about the
dome<00:00:06.600> map<00:00:07.020> lights<00:00:07.350> up<00:00:07.620> here<00:00:08.510> the<00:00:09.510> left<00:00:09.719> side

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
dome map lights up here the left side

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.209 
dome map lights up here the left side
here<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.679> got<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.849> dual<00:00:12.300> or<00:00:12.660> double<00:00:13.290> stack<00:00:13.590> LEDs

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
here I got a dual or double stack LEDs

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.870 
here I got a dual or double stack LEDs
with<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.759> resistor<00:00:15.920> canvas<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> resistor<00:00:17.670> on

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
with the resistor canvas a resistor on

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.300 
with the resistor canvas a resistor on
there<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:18.869> side<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.199> have<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.980> single

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
there this side I have the single

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.950 
there this side I have the single
stacked<00:00:20.640> without<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.510> resistor<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:23.960> this

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
stacked without the resistor and this

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.370 
stacked without the resistor and this
side<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> little<00:00:25.769> bit<00:00:25.859> wider<00:00:27.199> this<00:00:28.199> side

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
side is a little bit wider this side

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.689 
side is a little bit wider this side
it's<00:00:28.500> even<00:00:28.710> got<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.890> little<00:00:28.949> blue<00:00:29.220> tint<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.670> it

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
it's even got a little blue tint to it

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.260 
it's even got a little blue tint to it
the<00:00:30.029> side<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.539> brighter<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.410> dual<00:00:31.590> stacked

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
the side is brighter the dual stacked

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.440 
the side is brighter the dual stacked
obviously<00:00:33.270> it's<00:00:33.570> got<00:00:33.719> more<00:00:33.870> LEDs<00:00:34.260> um<00:00:35.450> there's

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
obviously it's got more LEDs um there's

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.810 
obviously it's got more LEDs um there's
a<00:00:36.540> video<00:00:36.809> online<00:00:36.960> where<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.739> guy<00:00:37.920> has<00:00:38.219> single

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
a video online where this guy has single

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.090 
a video online where this guy has single
stacked<00:00:39.320> LEDs<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.530> there<00:00:40.649> without<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
stacked LEDs on there without the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.090 
stacked LEDs on there without the
resistor<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.930> they<00:00:42.930> work<00:00:43.260> when<00:00:43.559> he<00:00:43.620> opens<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
resistor and they work when he opens the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.910 
resistor and they work when he opens the
door<00:00:44.690> but<00:00:45.690> when<00:00:45.719> he<00:00:45.989> simply<00:00:46.379> turns<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:46.860> and

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
door but when he simply turns it on and

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.150 
door but when he simply turns it on and
off<00:00:47.160> they<00:00:48.149> don't<00:00:48.360> work<00:00:48.770> you<00:00:49.770> know<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:50.010> both

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
off they don't work you know on both

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.930 
off they don't work you know on both
sides<00:00:50.960> see<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.020> right<00:00:52.199> now<00:00:52.370> with<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
sides see you right now with the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.529 
sides see you right now with the
resistor<00:00:54.420> on<00:00:55.190> it<00:00:56.190> works<00:00:57.949> but<00:00:58.949> when<00:00:59.129> are<00:00:59.280> off<00:00:59.539> it

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
resistor on it works but when are off it

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.210 
resistor on it works but when are off it
doesn't<00:01:01.440> work<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:02.190> when<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.730> open<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.030> door

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
doesn't work and when you open the door

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.600 
doesn't work and when you open the door
they<00:01:05.220> do<00:01:05.280> turn<00:01:05.549> off<00:01:06.650> so<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.920> know<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
they do turn off so you know this is the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.670 
they do turn off so you know this is the
2012<00:01:09.920> Ram<00:01:10.920> 1500<00:01:11.460> sport<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.170> don't<00:01:13.470> know<00:01:13.560> how

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
2012 Ram 1500 sport so I don't know how

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
2012 Ram 1500 sport so I don't know how
there<00:01:13.890> are<00:01:14.010> another<00:01:14.220> years<00:01:14.640> um<00:01:15.860> they<00:01:16.860> do<00:01:16.920> they

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
there are another years um they do they

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.410 
there are another years um they do they
do<00:01:17.759> dim<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.600> know<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.650> guy<00:01:19.799> again<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.000> video

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
do dim I know the guy again the video

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.899 
do dim I know the guy again the video
I'm<00:01:21.540> talking<00:01:21.840> about<00:01:21.869> his<00:01:22.439> don't<00:01:22.770> dim<00:01:23.130> let

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
I'm talking about his don't dim let

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.300 
I'm talking about his don't dim let
these<00:01:24.150> indeed<00:01:24.780> do<00:01:25.530> dim<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:28.380> here<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.040> Shack

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
these indeed do dim so here in a Shack

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.210 
these indeed do dim so here in a Shack
they<00:01:29.520> should<00:01:29.729> dim<00:01:30.530> both<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.770> them<00:01:31.860> even

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
they should dim both of them even

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.499 
they should dim both of them even
without<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.670> resistor<00:01:34.670> there<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.820> go<00:01:35.939> and

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
without the resistor there you go and

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.889 
without the resistor there you go and
they<00:01:36.630> go<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.840> gym<00:01:38.930> so<00:01:41.000> these<00:01:42.000> are<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.659> stock

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
they go the gym so these are the stock

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.100 
they go the gym so these are the stock
ones<00:01:44.060> these<00:01:45.060> are<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.630> ones<00:01:45.810> without<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
ones these are the ones without the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.050 
ones these are the ones without the
resistor<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.799> have<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.399> single<00:01:47.729> stacked

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
resistor that I have the single stacked

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.230 
resistor that I have the single stacked
and<00:01:48.409> these<00:01:49.409> are<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.799> dual<00:01:49.950> stack<00:01:50.310> LEDs<00:01:50.790> with

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
and these are the dual stack LEDs with

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.249 
and these are the dual stack LEDs with
the<00:01:51.600> resistor<00:01:55.969> canvas<00:01:56.969> got<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.869> resistor

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
the resistor canvas got the resistor

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.670 
the resistor canvas got the resistor
right<00:01:58.350> there<00:01:58.560> in<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.710> middle<00:01:58.860> and<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:01.200> remove

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
right there in the middle and to remove

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.490 
right there in the middle and to remove
them<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:03.049> just<00:02:04.049> use<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.259> butter<00:02:04.469> knife<00:02:06.290> pop<00:02:07.290> out

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
them I just use a butter knife pop out

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:20.149 
them I just use a butter knife pop out
the<00:02:07.770> two<00:02:08.369> tabs<00:02:08.849> here<00:02:09.090> on<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.330> bottom

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159

ass to get out because their way in

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.599 
ass to get out because their way in
there<00:02:25.409> sticking<00:02:26.409> my<00:02:26.530> fingers<00:02:27.159> in<00:02:27.189> there<00:02:27.370> try

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:27.609 
there sticking my fingers in there try

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:28.490 
there sticking my fingers in there try
and<00:02:27.730> get<00:02:27.849> them<00:02:27.939> out

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
and get them out

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.240 
and get them out
BES<00:02:30.540> shoes<00:02:31.540> are<00:02:31.870> these<00:02:32.260> are<00:02:32.469> directional<00:02:33.069> you

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
BES shoes are these are directional you

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.770 
BES shoes are these are directional you
know<00:02:33.340> they<00:02:33.519> do<00:02:33.579> have<00:02:33.879> to<00:02:34.000> be<00:02:34.090> in<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.389> right<00:02:34.480> way

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
know they do have to be in the right way

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.619 
know they do have to be in the right way
so<00:02:37.349> and<00:02:38.349> they<00:02:39.159> do<00:02:39.219> fit<00:02:39.579> I<00:02:39.790> know<00:02:39.939> they're<00:02:40.209> longer

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
so and they do fit I know they're longer

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.170 
so and they do fit I know they're longer
than<00:02:41.499> the<00:02:41.620> single<00:02:41.859> sack<00:02:42.159> but<00:02:42.459> they<00:02:42.730> do<00:02:42.790> indeed

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
than the single sack but they do indeed

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.020 
than the single sack but they do indeed
fit<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.780> this<00:02:44.200> is<00:02:44.579> this<00:02:45.579> right<00:02:45.790> here's<00:02:45.969> a

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
fit and this is this right here's a

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.800 
fit and this is this right here's a
