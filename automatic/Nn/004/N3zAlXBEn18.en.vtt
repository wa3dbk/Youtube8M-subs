00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.309
 is equipped the price 2000 is concentrated 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.200
 in the facet air air although from the 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.360
 principle this versatile apparatus could 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.620
 carry more than six tons of sugar mills

 a primary mission for any

 modern air force the mirage 2000 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.450

 of penetration of 9 or 18 pumps 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.800
 The bea p of 100 millimeters is 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.660
 stabilized with a parachute with an engine 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.610

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.160
 asphalt surface of a track

 characters created by the bp do very 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.710
 difficult for the enemy to repair their

 contains 151 submunitions the belugas

 the system of laser guided pumps 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.310
 is equivalent to the visible spas 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.170
 american wayne that were used 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.470
 with an annihilating effect in the war 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.470
 from the gulf 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.010
 a laser beam points to the precise point 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.950
 about an objective with a margin of 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.290
 centimeters the reflected beam of the laser 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.570
 about the objective is detected by the 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.500
 pump that will be guided by the reflections of the

 white illuminated 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.210
 the pump is dropped like any 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.190
 another snow fall pump the long ones 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.530
 tail fins keep the pump in

 head is directed towards the target over

 the one that hits with lethal precision 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:07.060
 the space missile s 30 l uses a 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.369
 similar guidance system impacting on 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.560
 the reflection of a laser flying to

 the mtr to arm is a watchman to drill 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.650

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.410
 50 km 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.660
 this missile flying low over the sea 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.370
 uses its own radar to impact on 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.370
 the white with a devastating effect 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.120

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.330
 also rockets not guided air
