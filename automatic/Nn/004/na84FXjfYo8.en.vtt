00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.880 
you literally would think that she was a
brand-new<00:00:18.540> ship<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.380> would<00:00:19.529> put<00:00:19.680> her<00:00:19.770> up

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
brand-new ship and I would put her up

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.769 
brand-new ship and I would put her up
against<00:00:20.220> any<00:00:20.430> ship<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.970> fleet<00:00:21.000> in<00:00:21.450> terms

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
against any ship in the fleet in terms

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.380 
against any ship in the fleet in terms
of<00:00:21.960> going<00:00:22.200> from<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.950> ship<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:23.580> was<00:00:23.910> maybe<00:00:24.300> a

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
of going from a ship that was maybe a

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.150 
of going from a ship that was maybe a
little<00:00:24.540> bit<00:00:24.720> more<00:00:24.869> mature<00:00:25.020> in<00:00:25.380> her<00:00:25.500> age<00:00:25.710> to

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.730 
little bit more mature in her age to
absolutely<00:00:26.790> looking<00:00:27.029> like<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.240> brand-new<00:00:27.599> ship

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
absolutely looking like a brand-new ship

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.410

it<00:00:28.740> was<00:00:28.860> an<00:00:28.950> opportunity<00:00:29.040> for<00:00:29.580> us<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.910> change

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
it was an opportunity for us to change

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.060 
it was an opportunity for us to change
the<00:00:30.660> milk<00:00:30.900> change<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.410> field<00:00:31.650> get<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.890> much

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070
