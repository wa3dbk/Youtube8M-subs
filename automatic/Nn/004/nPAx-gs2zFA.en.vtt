 Now let me tell you today that Scale Image 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:18.400
 How to cross 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:24.910
 Coming from two small images deurilkka I'd known for a way to capture 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:27.400
 Here you see in the first folder in the control bits Matt then in Elk app folder folder 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:33.040
 If you look inside the monster folder 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:38.969
 If you have kids like you and now you have ooo right now, 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.969
 In the folder that finds images of 30 reps on the screen . 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.070
 4 and 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:51.079
 5 folders image heroes manage to go one rep to find an image on one rep yo 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.079
 Folder 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:01:00.070
 Mostly now when I replace it, I say that this is the second folder image 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.070
 To modify the main Iooked 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:08.110
 There are those who can not do it . 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:12.940
 So let's take a look at the existing folder then the club. 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:16.570
 If you have a file then you need to change the two. 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.390
 What language is that two characters s1 claw profile 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.880
 After that, 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.950
 In order 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:29.180
 Find the image first 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:32.900
 First, the image tatjyo where somewhere here in this 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:38.000
 If you give me a ride, stop and look for this image. 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.470
 I'm looking for s1 before finding the next one club chair is why 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.140
 What requirements 2 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.580
 Haejusimyeon but it is doing now, if you like yimoyang Can I taechung less the same size 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.729
 If you see 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.729
 What 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:02:00.060
 55 20 squad Yes it will be defeated 55 20 squad 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.060
 Well, where's the ball just over the onc 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.580
 Something like this 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.800
 The second coat should also look at what you want to change again. Oh that Zion 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:15.650
 That's it. 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:17.690
 Now, if you have an image like this one, 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.650
 There's something you need to do. 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:28.450
 Let you see the images should see better do a good starting point begins one did 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:31.810
 Yes. 1 I'll see my size at almost the end . 51 55 to 30. 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:36.819
 55 to 30, so when you capture 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:39.420
 If you look at the number 1 in the alphabet, there will be one border on the outside 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.420
 It is. 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:50.670
 5 can start in the last part . 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.670
 If you do this in the same way, report 15 to 30 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.510
 like this 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:03:00.920
 You can do this with image capture. 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.920
 I'll tell you again. 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:11.980
 You have to modify two things, first modify s1 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:17.170
 Then you will be able to modify 1 clove. 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.850
 I'll first look for s1 and then find it. 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:24.750
 You understood. 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.750
 Now Then I'll tell you how to capture skiing 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.459
 In the case of skel 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.590
 i'll check it out 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:53.930
 There are two things. 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:57.110
 There are 8 self-defeats , and there's 802. 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.440
 You need two skills. 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:04.900
 How did Capture work ? 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:11.940
 Please turn off the skill first . 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.940
 You do not need to capture it. You have to activate it and capture it. 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.320
 Because I've used it. 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:25.130
 Let's see the jujube 4 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:28.730
 When the image size is doing something in 2848 or 3333 what 47 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:31.060
 Well, just in the vocabulary between 4 this point 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.060
 Do it 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:46.330
 In this state that is activated, the capture is activated 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:48.910
 How did you do this now that KoolTime is back, Global KoolTime goes around 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:54.070
 Getting more and more from the middle dance 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:56.470
 The whole one what was drawn more and more and to do this kind Joe 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.210
 Now, you have to get rid of it as much as possible. 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.080
 You will be avoided 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:04.909
 You can see the border . Get out of the white new white line. 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.780
 About one or two 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:13.310
 Abr 2 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:13.310
 Because it is the upper side, please open the main compartment from the right side of sweat. 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.850
 31 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:27.000
 It does not matter if the size is too big. 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.310
 Well in 30 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.729
 1 54 2 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:37.639
 Doubles 30 times right 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.639
 I want to be number one. 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:06:00.500
 Then, if you did it now , you should be with Dili . 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:07.380
 delay 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:08.520
 If you look at Delay, you will see that each skill 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.569
 each 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:16.009
 It's time to use it yesterday. 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:16.009
 What jeorido and 7 seconds 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:25.729
 Preferably, 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.729
 When you see the skill 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:35.180
 Zoids. Just the same. - Zeltem starts. 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.900
 Rather it is captured Haeju jabaegi to have you stand at about nine objects from the 9 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:41.540

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:45.260
 When the margin of a little time doing lift Yes 73 seconds.stop first start 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:50.440
 Then I wait for 6 seconds 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.440
 Let's do this part six seconds when you do this part 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:59.839
 Likewise 31 something 

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:59.839
 Like this 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.330
 Do you understand? 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:06.600

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:11.880
