00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.160
 do this is a cage 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.270
 with fitch material they spent about 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.290
 twenty euro 15 you will be 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:22.000
 another 56 euros 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:23.800
 the small parts then the staff and screws 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.750
 some other nonsense 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.869
 the wood was decorated by a father 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:34.059
 for a platform the hinges of a cake 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.930
 for roller shutters and so on for the others 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.050
 what's this 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.850
 I will now explain to you as a fact 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.559
 let's cut wood and wood 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.399
 I cut it from a platform that they are 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:51.340
 debut need four pieces from a 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:52.570
 other 22 cm x 2 cm the cage will be high 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.629
 one meter 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.809
 because the network I buy at a height of a 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:01.269
 meter and 20 centimeters and will be i 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.790
 idiots in running away for the 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:07.450
 dirt 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:09.450
 then 12 TV companies from 58 cm are needed 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:14.880
 always 2 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:18.049
 that will go to sight the four sides 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.049
 now I'll show you how 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:29.630
 place the two mysteries by a meter e 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.630
 winds to the left and right data 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:44.509
 in this way in the center 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.509
 let's put the mystery at 58 cm 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:02:01.520
 we assure that the two structures that al 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:04.780
 90 chart stop or three teams if that 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.780
 so we can paste them 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:34.160
 we put a second level at a meter 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.160
 of distance 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:41.730
 let us remember that the network is one meter high 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.220
 therefore the listel must re-enter 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.220
 otherwise we don't know where to point it 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.980
 let's pass to paste too I give 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.980
 the whole structure 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.440
 when something has dried out 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:02.290
 reinforced and the structure with of the 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.290
 iron brackets and screws 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:39.930
 we continue to build after real 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.550
 putting the last lines from 58 cm for 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:48.330
 to form a parallelepiped then 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:50.279
 will stand alone once 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.479
 finished becoming everything 

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:56.999
 we do very strong always with del 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:00.990
 wood 2 cm x 2 cm 

00:04:56.999 --> 00:05:03.509
 this checa 12 cm losers in addition to 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.270
 this is another fact here that is 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:09.479
 the opening of the nets a finger I decided 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:13.590
 to put the feeders on the ground then 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:16.699
 I will not do other small doors if you 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:19.800
 but you want to do poker 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:23.069
 now I can't manage the whole thing 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:28.219
 structure with a network from a meter from 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:28.219
 a few days and fix it with the bad guys
