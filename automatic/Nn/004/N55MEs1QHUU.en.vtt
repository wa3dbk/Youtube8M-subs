00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.850
 I want to show you how to cook 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.119
 why from pita so to cook 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:30.240
 we will need three sheets of armenian 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:33.600
 pita 500 grams of suluguni cheese 2 eggs 1 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.660
 a glass of kefir and vegetable oil 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.710
 let's start cooking for me to start 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:47.570
 need to whip kefir with eggs in a bowl 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.570
 pour kefir I drive two eggs 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:06.900
 and i'm doing a good job of rubbing suluguni cheese 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.190
 on large terochku 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.750
 driving around half so i will 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.750
 easier to rub 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.990
 This recipe I cook is not the first time 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:26.470

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:33.700
 now when i rub the whole circus on 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.600
 Terochku I need to divide it into three 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.600
 equal parts 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:58.770
 baking mold grease 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:58.770
 sunflower nose. I iron the sheet of pita 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.550
 I cut the excess comfortably it is very 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.820
 do with scissors 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:11.820
 so pita does not break neatly 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.820
 cropped 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.560
 all the remaining pita need to pick 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:48.020
 slices and put personally kefir 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:51.170
 the mixture for five minutes passed five minutes 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:54.020
 pita softened well and now you need 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.820
 it is divided into three parts 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:05.000
 Now I will lay out the form in layers 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:08.830
 first the cheese is one piece of cheese now from 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.830

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.829

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.700

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.380
