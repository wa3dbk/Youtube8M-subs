system now look we had a bit of a

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.170 
system now look we had a bit of a
problem<00:00:19.100> when<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.130> put<00:00:20.369> these<00:00:20.490> guys<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:21.000> if<00:00:21.119> you

problem when I put these guys in if you

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.519 
problem when I put these guys in if you
remember<00:00:21.480> they<00:00:21.570> were<00:00:21.630> pretty<00:00:21.900> leggy<00:00:22.230> and

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
remember they were pretty leggy and

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.009 
remember they were pretty leggy and
after<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> few<00:00:23.640> days<00:00:23.880> they<00:00:24.330> looked<00:00:24.600> like<00:00:24.689> they

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
after a few days they looked like they

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.170 
after a few days they looked like they
were<00:00:25.050> just<00:00:25.380> gonna<00:00:25.529> keel<00:00:25.800> over<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.160> die<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.820> as

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
were just gonna keel over and die and as

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.390 
were just gonna keel over and die and as
funny<00:00:27.480> as<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.660> sounds<00:00:27.810> they<00:00:28.590> actually<00:00:29.160> looked

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
funny as it sounds they actually looked

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.370 
funny as it sounds they actually looked
like<00:00:29.519> they<00:00:29.849> had<00:00:30.000> too<00:00:30.240> much<00:00:30.390> water<00:00:30.660> which<00:00:31.080> I

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
like they had too much water which I

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.990 
like they had too much water which I
mean<00:00:31.529> that's<00:00:32.009> what<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.250> just<00:00:32.279> did<00:00:32.489> was<00:00:32.669> put<00:00:32.880> in

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
mean that's what we just did was put in

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.970 
mean that's what we just did was put in
a<00:00:33.059> bucket<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.390> water<00:00:33.590> but<00:00:34.590> they<00:00:34.680> shouldn't

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
a bucket of water but they shouldn't

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.110 
a bucket of water but they shouldn't
have<00:00:35.040> been<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.250> way<00:00:35.520> because<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
have been that way because of the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.119 
have been that way because of the
airspace<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.960> left<00:00:37.200> for<00:00:37.410> them<00:00:37.530> and

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
airspace that we left for them and

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.760 
airspace that we left for them and
actually<00:00:38.670> got<00:00:38.760> ahold<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.239> MHP<00:00:40.079> gardener<00:00:40.590> and

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
actually got ahold of MHP gardener and

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.100 
actually got ahold of MHP gardener and
Bobby<00:00:41.760> was<00:00:42.030> telling<00:00:42.390> me<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.960> know<00:00:43.020> that

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
Bobby was telling me that you know that

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.560 
Bobby was telling me that you know that
I<00:00:43.350> let<00:00:43.710> him<00:00:43.829> get<00:00:43.950> too<00:00:44.129> leggy<00:00:44.489> because<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
I let him get too leggy because of the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.240 
I let him get too leggy because of the
light<00:00:45.750> source<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.289> was<00:00:46.469> using<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.070> probably

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
light source I was using and I probably

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.850 
light source I was using and I probably
really<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:47.820> need<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:47.969> start<00:00:48.390> again<00:00:48.800> but<00:00:49.800> I

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
really just need to start again but I

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.340 
really just need to start again but I
wasn't<00:00:50.070> ready<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.460> start<00:00:50.760> again<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.320> I<00:00:52.320> just

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
wasn't ready to start again so I just

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.189 
wasn't ready to start again so I just
left<00:00:52.800> these<00:00:52.980> guys<00:00:53.280> here<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.329> see<00:00:54.360> how<00:00:54.989> they

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
left these guys here to see how they

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.920 
left these guys here to see how they
would<00:00:55.350> recover<00:00:55.710> now<00:00:56.670> I'm<00:00:56.789> confident<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.449> if

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
would recover now I'm confident that if

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.990 
would recover now I'm confident that if
I<00:00:58.379> didn't<00:00:58.800> have<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> problem<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.430> begin<00:00:59.579> with

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
I didn't have the problem to begin with

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.459 
I didn't have the problem to begin with
that<00:01:00.030> these<00:01:00.390> would<00:01:00.600> be<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> lot<00:01:00.960> further<00:01:01.199> along

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
that these would be a lot further along

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.789 
that these would be a lot further along
than<00:01:01.770> they<00:01:01.949> are<00:01:02.129> but<00:01:03.059> they<00:01:03.329> are<00:01:03.449> surviving<00:01:04.080> now

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
than they are but they are surviving now

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.000 
than they are but they are surviving now
over<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.580> last<00:01:05.670> couple<00:01:06.090> days<00:01:06.350> we<00:01:07.350> had<00:01:07.619> several

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
over the last couple days we had several

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.859 
over the last couple days we had several
inches<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.400> rain<00:01:08.520> coming<00:01:09.090> through<00:01:09.180> and

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
inches of rain coming through and

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.050 
inches of rain coming through and
because<00:01:10.500> these<00:01:10.740> didn't<00:01:11.070> have<00:01:11.189> any<00:01:11.310> cover<00:01:11.670> over

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
because these didn't have any cover over

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.560 
because these didn't have any cover over
them<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:13.369> water<00:01:14.369> got<00:01:14.640> onto<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.060> bucket<00:01:15.240> and

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
them the water got onto the bucket and

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.080 
them the water got onto the bucket and
then<00:01:15.869> down<00:01:16.110> inside<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.890> had<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.700> open<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
then down inside and had to open the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.390 
then down inside and had to open the
bucket<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.570> take<00:01:18.630> out<00:01:18.960> about<00:01:19.110> 10<00:01:19.619> large<00:01:20.009> cups

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
bucket and take out about 10 large cups

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.880 
bucket and take out about 10 large cups
of<00:01:20.580> water<00:01:20.869> just<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.990> get<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.350> water<00:01:22.500> level

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
of water just to get the water level

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.600 
of water just to get the water level
back<00:01:23.040> down<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.549> bottom<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.360> net<00:01:24.540> pots

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
back down to the bottom of the net pots

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.219 
back down to the bottom of the net pots
the<00:01:26.610> only<00:01:26.880> thing<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.299> I'm<00:01:27.390> worried<00:01:27.900> about

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
the only thing that I'm worried about

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.380 
the only thing that I'm worried about
is<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:29.100> how<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.250> probably<00:01:29.700> diluted<00:01:30.299> the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
is that how that probably diluted the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.560 
is that how that probably diluted the
fertilizer<00:01:31.100> but<00:01:32.100> that's<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:33.180> can<00:01:33.299> see<00:01:33.450> how

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
fertilizer but that's it you can see how

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.960 
fertilizer but that's it you can see how
the<00:01:33.630> plants<00:01:33.960> are<00:01:34.079> doing<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.130> see<00:01:38.430> I'm

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
the plants are doing and you can see I'm

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.420 
the plants are doing and you can see I'm
starting<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.509> get<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.950> pretty<00:01:40.950> little<00:01:41.100> root

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
starting to get that pretty little root

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.969 
starting to get that pretty little root
thing<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.360> Bobby<00:01:42.600> Ellie<00:01:42.869> shows<00:01:43.170> us

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.340 

so<00:01:46.979> it's<00:01:47.100> not<00:01:47.189> going<00:01:47.399> too<00:01:47.640> bad<00:01:49.009> except<00:01:50.299> that

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
so it's not going too bad except that

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.690 
so it's not going too bad except that
normally<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.640> keep<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.880> modular<00:01:54.450> baby<00:01:55.020> gate

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
normally I keep this modular baby gate

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.380 
normally I keep this modular baby gate
around<00:01:56.700> these<00:01:56.969> for<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> fence<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:59.390> yesterday

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
around these for a fence and yesterday

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.020 
around these for a fence and yesterday
when<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.630> had<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.979> quick<00:02:02.219> thought<00:02:02.490> past<00:02:02.790> my

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
when I had the quick thought past my

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.539 
when I had the quick thought past my
head<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.810> rain<00:02:04.439> was<00:02:04.740> gone<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.369> need

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
head that the rain was gone and I need

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.920 
head that the rain was gone and I need
to<00:02:05.610> come<00:02:05.759> out<00:02:05.880> here<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.119> take<00:02:06.450> care<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.719> the
