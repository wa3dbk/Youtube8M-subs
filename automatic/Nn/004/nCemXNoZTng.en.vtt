00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.506
 Hey. 

00:00:11.953 --> 00:00:14.173
 This time, something small. 

00:00:14.686 --> 00:00:16.020
 Something useful. 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.153
 Something simple. 

00:00:17.153 --> 00:00:19.753
 Finally - something black. 

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:21.306
 Did I surprise you? 

00:00:21.446 --> 00:00:23.566
 Do not be afraid, it's nothing scary. 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.340
 This is Pentagram TAB 7.5. 

00:00:26.413 --> 00:00:31.946
 In fact, Pentagram TAB 7.5 Dual Core IPS P5341, 

00:00:32.093 --> 00:00:36.280
 a small tablet, which fits easily in your hand, 

00:00:36.393 --> 00:00:39.166
 a pocket of a men's jacket, in a ladies purse 

00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:41.500
 or even on the car cockpit. 

00:00:42.313 --> 00:00:45.633
 In the latter case, it is worth using the Gecko pad, 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.560
 which effectively holds the device in place - without getting dirty, 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.966
 gluing or limiting the field of view of elements. 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.593
 Let's return to the Pentagram TAB 7.5 Dual Core tablet. 

00:00:58.246 --> 00:01:02.986
 A power button and headphone input are located on the upper edge of the phone. 

00:01:04.213 --> 00:01:07.320
 In turn, on the bottom you can find more interesting facts. 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.320
 Looking from the left we have: microSD card slot, 

00:01:11.546 --> 00:01:15.313
 power socket being at the same time a microUSB input, 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.106
 RESET button, HDMI socket, HOME button and microphone. 

00:01:21.913 --> 00:01:26.146
 The RESET button is used to emergency restart the device. 

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:30.206
 To use it, insert a needle or a paper clip into the hole. 

00:01:31.253 --> 00:01:35.886
 In turn, the HOME key allows you to return to the home screen from any application. 

00:01:36.953 --> 00:01:41.420
 There is a loudspeaker on the back of the Pentagram TAB 7.5 tablet, 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.300
 which automatically turns off the use of headphones. 

00:01:45.553 --> 00:01:50.033
 Of course, the biggest interest of tablet users is always the screen. 

00:01:50.286 --> 00:01:52.760
 In this case, we are dealing with capacitive 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.493
 a 7-inch touch screen and 1024 x 600px resolution. 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.026
 Capacitive touch screens do not react to the touch of a pencil or a gloved hand. 

00:02:05.226 --> 00:02:09.246
 This technology allows the use of the famous Multi-Touch 

00:02:09.246 --> 00:02:10.766
 it is very precise. 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.786
 All thanks to the use of the phenomenon of electrostatic field change. 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.320
 Tablet Pentagram TAB 7.5 supports up to five-point multitouch, 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.193
 thanks to which applications can be used in many different ways. 

00:02:25.753 --> 00:02:27.806
 The matrix itself with LED backlight 

00:02:27.806 --> 00:02:31.266
 made in the most modern In-Plane Switching technology, 

00:02:31.266 --> 00:02:34.533
 thanks to which we have very wide viewing angles, 

00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:37.453
 lower reaction time and high color saturation. 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.920
 The graphics accelerator is also responsible for image quality, especially in games. 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.553
 in this case it is Mali-400. 

00:02:46.913 --> 00:02:49.186
 The tablet is also equipped with a dual-core processor 

00:02:49.186 --> 00:02:51.873
 and 1 GB of RAM 

00:02:51.873 --> 00:02:54.186
 and 16 GB of internal memory, 

00:02:54.186 --> 00:02:57.553
 which can be expanded with the mentioned microSD card. 

00:02:59.193 --> 00:03:01.540
 The whole works on android 4.1 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.173
 which operating system is worth updating, at every opportunity. 

00:03:06.033 --> 00:03:09.680
 There are a lot of accessories in the box outside the tablet, 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.926
 i.e. network charger, car charger, headphones, 

00:03:13.926 --> 00:03:17.006
 USB cable, velvet protective case, 

00:03:17.006 --> 00:03:18.660
 microfiber cloth, 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.386
 Finally, the manual micro-A USB to mini USB OTG adapter. 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.840
 The last cable, or USB On-The-Go 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.833
 allows you to connect a popular pendrive memory to the device, 

00:03:31.833 --> 00:03:36.646
 to browse files stored on it, send data or backup information. 

00:03:37.086 --> 00:03:39.666
 You can also connect a 3G usb modem 

00:03:39.666 --> 00:03:42.346
 (the tablet supports the majority available on the market) 

00:03:42.346 --> 00:03:44.846
 which makes the equipment even more mobile.
