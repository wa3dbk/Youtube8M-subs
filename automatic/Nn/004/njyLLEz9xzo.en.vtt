00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:49.200 

let's<00:01:37.610> get<00:01:37.850> it<00:01:38.000> out<00:01:38.120> of<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.390> bag

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.870

the most points computer case the money
can<00:01:53.210> buy<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:55.420> just<00:01:56.420> a<00:01:56.510> quick<00:01:56.659> look<00:01:56.900> around<00:01:56.990> this

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
can buy so just a quick look around this

can buy so just a quick look around this
is<00:01:57.500> a<00:01:59.320> thought<00:02:00.320> this<00:02:00.530> thing<00:02:00.680> is<00:02:00.830> big<00:02:01.070> for<00:02:01.220> ideas

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
is a thought this thing is big for ideas

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.980 
is a thought this thing is big for ideas
this<00:02:03.740> was<00:02:04.009> all<00:02:04.159> flexi<00:02:04.820> stuff<00:02:05.180> this<00:02:05.720> is<00:02:05.869> all

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
this was all flexi stuff this is all

this was all flexi stuff this is all
soft<00:02:06.350> touch<00:02:06.619> really<00:02:07.430> nice<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:07.850> soft<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.989> air

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
soft touch really nice and soft the air

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.350

comes<00:02:10.220> in<00:02:10.399> to<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:11.569> outsides<00:02:11.989> there<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:13.610> I'm

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.830 

is<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:17.570> better<00:02:17.840> that's<00:02:18.320> better

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
is that better that's better

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.670 
is that better that's better
maybe<00:02:20.840> I'll<00:02:21.019> have<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.260> put<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.470> light<00:02:21.680> on<00:02:21.709> though

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
maybe I'll have to put a light on though

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.509 
maybe I'll have to put a light on though
how<00:02:24.680> does<00:02:24.739> that<00:02:25.040> work<00:02:26.170> so<00:02:27.170> this<00:02:27.800> is<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:28.370> big

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
how does that work so this is a big

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:34.060 
how does that work so this is a big
Phoenix<00:02:28.850> prodigy<00:02:29.269> so<00:02:30.670> on<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.880> top<00:02:32.090> of<00:02:32.239> it<00:02:33.070> it

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
Phoenix prodigy so on the top of it it

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.320 
Phoenix prodigy so on the top of it it
has<00:02:34.430> these<00:02:34.640> this<00:02:36.430> thing<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.700> this<00:02:37.790> just<00:02:38.060> comes

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
has these this thing and this just comes

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.990 
has these this thing and this just comes
out<00:02:38.920> like<00:02:39.920> so<00:02:41.050> it<00:02:42.050> is<00:02:42.550> somewhat<00:02:43.550> of<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:43.790> dust

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
out like so it is somewhat of a dust

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.690 
out like so it is somewhat of a dust
filter<00:02:44.440> but<00:02:45.440> it's<00:02:45.590> really<00:02:45.800> just<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:46.220> very<00:02:46.250> fine

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
filter but it's really just a very fine

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.000 
filter but it's really just a very fine
mesh<00:02:47.000> however<00:02:47.390> from<00:02:48.230> experience<00:02:48.769> with<00:02:48.890> the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
mesh however from experience with the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.590 
mesh however from experience with the
other<00:02:49.100> case<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.549> mesh<00:02:49.730> is<00:02:49.880> still<00:02:50.090> fine

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
other case the mesh is still fine

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.990 
other case the mesh is still fine
that<00:02:51.049> this<00:02:51.380> just<00:02:51.890> gets<00:02:52.100> trapped<00:02:52.430> in<00:02:52.610> it<00:02:52.730> as<00:02:52.850> if

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
that this just gets trapped in it as if

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.810 
that this just gets trapped in it as if
it<00:02:53.150> were<00:02:53.299> a<00:02:53.540> dust<00:02:53.780> filter<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.549> then<00:02:55.549> what<00:02:55.730> you

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
it were a dust filter and then what you

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.840 
it were a dust filter and then what you
can<00:02:55.850> do<00:02:56.320> is<00:02:57.320> you<00:02:57.470> just<00:02:57.500> rub<00:02:57.920> it<00:02:57.950> rub<00:02:58.489> the<00:02:58.670> mesh

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
can do is you just rub it rub the mesh

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.479 
can do is you just rub it rub the mesh
and<00:02:59.090> all<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.329> dust<00:02:59.540> will<00:02:59.720> just<00:02:59.900> fall<00:03:00.110> off<00:03:00.489> so

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
and all the dust will just fall off so

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:07.030 
and all the dust will just fall off so
that's<00:03:01.670> pretty<00:03:01.910> cool<00:03:02.150> stuff<00:03:02.450> actually<00:03:06.040> though

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
that's pretty cool stuff actually though

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.490 
that's pretty cool stuff actually though
it's<00:03:07.250> not<00:03:07.400> all<00:03:07.640> orange<00:03:08.090> so<00:03:08.510> I<00:03:08.720> think<00:03:09.230> it<00:03:09.350> would

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
it's not all orange so I think it would

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.009 
it's not all orange so I think it would
be<00:03:09.650> pretty<00:03:10.549> boring<00:03:10.850> if<00:03:11.120> they<00:03:11.269> made<00:03:11.480> everything

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
be pretty boring if they made everything

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.789 
be pretty boring if they made everything

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
focus the camera trick does not work

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:27.960 
focus the camera trick does not work
okay<00:03:20.739> focus<00:03:21.790> there<00:03:22.790> we<00:03:23.030> go

amazingly brilliant stuff because it has
taught<00:04:08.950> us<00:04:09.190> between<00:04:09.550> onboard<00:04:10.110> this<00:04:11.110> is<00:04:11.230> all

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
taught us between onboard this is all

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
previous case so there we go so it's a

this is just black pages um this is
actually<00:04:39.730> being<00:04:40.230> run<00:04:41.230> along<00:04:41.500> already<00:04:41.860> for

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
actually being run along already for

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:49.580 
actually being run along already for
just<00:04:42.340> a<00:04:42.460> view<00:04:42.640> around<00:04:42.970> the<00:04:43.120> core<00:04:43.360> of<00:04:43.660> something

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.450 

anyway<00:04:50.940> and<00:04:51.940> also<00:04:52.090> preview<00:04:52.540> all<00:04:52.660> these<00:04:52.870> bolts

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
anyway and also preview all these bolts

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.500 
anyway and also preview all these bolts
so<00:04:54.460> takes<00:04:54.790> a<00:04:54.910> while<00:04:55.090> to<00:04:55.230> get<00:04:56.230> everything<00:04:56.350> out

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
so takes a while to get everything out

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.470 
so takes a while to get everything out
anyway<00:04:59.370> here's<00:05:00.370> for<00:05:00.580> your<00:05:00.700> side<00:05:00.880> panel<00:05:01.210> so<00:05:01.360> it

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
anyway here's for your side panel so it

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.230 
anyway here's for your side panel so it
has<00:05:01.720> power<00:05:02.430> reset<00:05:03.430> and<00:05:03.700> then<00:05:03.910> you<00:05:04.030> got

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
has power reset and then you got

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.080 
has power reset and then you got
microphone<00:05:04.930> no<00:05:05.440> headphone<00:05:06.190> microphone<00:05:06.550> and

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
microphone no headphone microphone and

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.800 
microphone no headphone microphone and
two<00:05:07.210> USB<00:05:07.480> treats<00:05:08.940> one<00:05:09.940> of<00:05:10.090> the<00:05:10.180> problems<00:05:10.660> with

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
two USB treats one of the problems with

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.680 
two USB treats one of the problems with
this<00:05:10.990> cage<00:05:11.310> case<00:05:12.310> other<00:05:12.700> than<00:05:13.000> the<00:05:13.150> side<00:05:13.330> panel

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
this cage case other than the side panel

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.670 
this cage case other than the side panel
is<00:05:13.750> not<00:05:13.990> be<00:05:14.200> the<00:05:14.500> easiest<00:05:14.530> things<00:05:15.010> to<00:05:15.100> get<00:05:15.280> off

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
is not be the easiest things to get off

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.040 
is not be the easiest things to get off
is<00:05:17.680> that<00:05:18.070> all<00:05:18.640> the<00:05:18.820> cables<00:05:19.240> are<00:05:19.419> fitted<00:05:19.810> to<00:05:19.930> the

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
is that all the cables are fitted to the

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.370 
is that all the cables are fitted to the
side<00:05:20.230> panel<00:05:20.590> so<00:05:20.860> it<00:05:21.430> might<00:05:21.640> be<00:05:21.850> a<00:05:21.880> bit<00:05:22.060> tricky

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
side panel so it might be a bit tricky

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.130 
side panel so it might be a bit tricky
to<00:05:23.380> actually<00:05:23.950> get<00:05:24.430> everything<00:05:24.580> in<00:05:24.910> place<00:05:25.140> but

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
to actually get everything in place but

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.820 
to actually get everything in place but
I'm<00:05:26.260> very<00:05:26.710> happy<00:05:26.980> with<00:05:27.250> the<00:05:27.400> core<00:05:27.640> it's<00:05:27.850> a<00:05:27.970> nice

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
I'm very happy with the core it's a nice

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.930 
I'm very happy with the core it's a nice
smooth<00:05:29.830> but<00:05:30.820> not<00:05:31.000> too<00:05:31.270> smooth<00:05:32.669> yeah<00:05:33.669> how<00:05:33.880> do

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
smooth but not too smooth yeah how do

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.020 
smooth but not too smooth yeah how do
you<00:05:34.180> call<00:05:34.570> the<00:05:34.750> texture<00:05:35.200> of<00:05:35.230> this<00:05:35.880> so<00:05:36.880> very

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
you call the texture of this so very

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.869 
you call the texture of this so very
like<00:05:37.600> a<00:05:37.630> very<00:05:37.930> very<00:05:38.010> fine<00:05:39.010> sandpaper

00:05:39.869 --> 00:05:39.879 
like a very very fine sandpaper

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:41.639 
like a very very fine sandpaper
that's<00:05:40.240> pretty<00:05:40.509> much<00:05:40.629> the<00:05:40.689> texture<00:05:41.259> of<00:05:41.319> this

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:41.649 
that's pretty much the texture of this

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:45.899 
that's pretty much the texture of this
case<00:05:42.059> and<00:05:43.059> this<00:05:43.270> color<00:05:43.539> and<00:05:44.529> so<00:05:45.189> this<00:05:45.789> is

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:45.909 
case and this color and so this is

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:48.299 
case and this color and so this is
pretty<00:05:46.179> much<00:05:46.330> just<00:05:46.599> like<00:05:47.229> any<00:05:47.469> other<00:05:47.619> black

00:05:48.299 --> 00:05:48.309 
pretty much just like any other black

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:52.459 
pretty much just like any other black
prodigy<00:05:48.819> but<00:05:48.999> then<00:05:49.149> with<00:05:49.360> color<00:05:49.629> tops<00:05:50.020> and<00:05:50.349> no

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:52.469 
prodigy but then with color tops and no

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:56.429 
prodigy but then with color tops and no
not<00:05:53.469> a<00:05:53.499> cold<00:05:53.800> bottom<00:05:54.159> and<00:05:54.959> just<00:05:55.959> a<00:05:56.110> different

00:05:56.429 --> 00:05:56.439 
not a cold bottom and just a different

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.079
