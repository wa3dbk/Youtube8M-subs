first thing to note about this upgrade

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.679 
first thing to note about this upgrade
system<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.640> meant<00:00:26.939> for<00:00:27.029> max<00:00:27.390> level

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
system is that it is meant for max level

system is that it is meant for max level
characters<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.619> won't<00:00:28.800> even<00:00:28.949> be<00:00:29.130> able<00:00:29.310> to

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
characters you won't even be able to

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.950 
characters you won't even be able to
Zone<00:00:29.609> into<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.970> area<00:00:30.240> for<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.449> lowest<00:00:30.779> tier

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
Zone into the area for the lowest tier

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.380 
Zone into the area for the lowest tier
piece<00:00:31.199> until<00:00:31.590> level<00:00:31.769> 98<00:00:32.130> anyway<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.210> best

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
piece until level 98 anyway so the best

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.080 
piece until level 98 anyway so the best
choice<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.899> level<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.290> 100<00:00:34.860> my<00:00:35.640> advice<00:00:35.850> for

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
choice is to level to 100 my advice for

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.970 
choice is to level to 100 my advice for
leveling<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:37.050> run<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.350> signature<00:00:37.770> quest
