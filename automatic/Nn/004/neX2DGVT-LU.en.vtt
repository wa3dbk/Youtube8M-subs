00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.820
 sneakers 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:18.480
 how much sadness in this word for the heart 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.460
 Germans feel as i lose their guys when you 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.380
 then tanchik mercilessly bend 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.380
 then this tanchik for several 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.779
 years mercilessly sucked after it apnuli 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.410
 and he again felt the former power but 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.000
 the developers decided that he suddenly would not 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.040
 historical so we re panel it 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.020
 film and put on level 7 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.780
 hello guys with you jov and this 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.520
 new infa super test so go and 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.110
 first news today of course 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.590
 concerns the German heavy tank 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.719
 level nine vk 4502 aus b 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.160
 sneakers used as you know guys 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.289
 the developers decided to remove it from 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.469
 level nine and replace the prototype 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.120
 Mouse, they say, prototype of mouse 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.010
 okay that we will be on 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.199
 ninth and tenth level practically two 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.989
 identical cars do not worry 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.390
 players are accustomed to after entering mx 30 b 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.820
 and other identical cloned tanks 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.189
 this is not so important in principle 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.380
 of course, but what will happen to his shoe 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.420
 probably completely taken from the game there 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.100
 Guys, why pick them all up? 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.860
 you need to make it suffer 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.960
 developers will clean up the seventh level in 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.299
 what quality will he be there premium 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.670
 premium or promotion so far in 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.710
 principle is not clear but already known 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.650
 characteristics and let's see them 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.020
 so what sneaker would be on the seventh 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.090
 level first guys it would be like 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.070
 completely hysterical well i mean he 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.170
 will be its original characteristics 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.880
 if guys who didn't know then even those 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.100
 characteristics that a sneaker would have 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.790
 yes oops they were once very serious 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.890
 stretched 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.630
 four years ago the developers just 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.979
 there was no car that could be 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.079
 put on level 9 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.970
 in the German line of cords so they 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.439
 just took it pulled 170 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.960
 millimeters of armor and here it is 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.759
 beautiful turned out now he will be like 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.649
 historic and on his seventh level 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:07.409
 there will be a cannon from tiger 1 203 penetration 240 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.840
 dpm damage is certainly not the most record but 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.640
 principle and not the worst 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.830
 2000 accuracy well accuracy guys 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.230
 good principle but 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.900
 33 per 100 meters true debt and mixing 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.640
 2 and 7 principle is quite good 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.840
 instrument for level seven that 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.540
 I can not say anything 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.760
 mobility well here again guys too 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.770
 nothing new 700 horse engine 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.170
 power density ten horsepower 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.780
 per ton well that means our pb 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.420
 will be as slow as a tiger p 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.000
 he basically can ride but 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.210
 probably very, very slowly and very well 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.650
 The last amount of hp and armor is what 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.320
 developers will give us on the seventh level 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:49.190
 but let's see x n by the way guys 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.709
 will be very very much as much as 1600 for 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.720
 seventh level well, it is very highly 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.700
 a good indicator is an indicator 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.370
 eighth level in principle then 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.280
 and what armor we will have armor forehead 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.280
 hull 80 millimeters bead hull 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.160
 80 millimeters forehead tower stock by the way 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.810
 100 millimeters of the tower 80 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.570
 millimeters 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.360
 a lot of them 80 are guys or a little 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:17.720
 let's calculate y given the slope 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:21.350
 it will be somewhere around 125 130 millimeters forehead 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.320
 dunlop 125 130 millimeters forehead vdd you don't 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.150
 made a mistake and let's see what 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.420
 last break through heavy tanks on 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.209
 seventh level 170 175 to have even 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:36.310
 someone 203 or 198 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:39.470
 I wonder how well it will tank 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.450
 slow slow heavy tank 8 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.880
 level against your classmates 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.980
 I'm not even talking about level 8 forget and 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.709
 not even talking about Fri-Sau just about 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.320
 ordinary shame level seven as far as 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.260
 he will be good to tank with armor 130 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.140
 millimeters with all inclinations well 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.880
 I leave the answer to this question guys 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.160
 you write it in the comments on 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.670
 how much will he tank 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.560
 I think your sophisticated imagination and experience 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.040
 watching movies like 50 shades 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.840
 gray 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.570
 they will tell you what will be the rates 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.430
 Randy do in his excellent new 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.930
 armor on the seventh level here such here 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.729
 guys funny news 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.910
 now slipper b will be hysterical to you 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.200
 will suck again thanks for thanks 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.000
 this one just 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.890
 ingenious rebalancing 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.170
 The next guys news of course already by 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.300
 more positively it concerns new cards 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.750
 The card is called guys like it 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.430
 strange paris food soon well how soon 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.470
 maybe next patch can be through 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.500
 patch I think it will be available in 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.630
 the game is beautiful very beautiful urban 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.180
 the card is now its boot screen you 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.910
 see before you as to how 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.250
 says terrain guys then 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.900
 here, in principle, probably contradictory with 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.180
 one side it is urban yes there is 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.470
 streets wide avenues and so on but 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.090
 on the other hand, thanks to this 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.890
 broad avenues artillery will 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.750
 where a lot to throw but she still 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.240
 urban and slippers many objects 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.940
 Ira is still beautiful in general, I think that 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.230
 the map will be quite interesting here 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.000
 at least there will be where 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.430
 turn around and heavy tank and fri-sau 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.110
 exhibitions will be able to go there to talk 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.310
 because of the castle and so on in general 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.450
 let's see what she will be like 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.640
 present on the general test 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.530
 but so far in advance I like her 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.330
 write what you think bt comments 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.450
 map and the latest news for today 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:27.190
 Concerns incomprehensible screen as card 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:31.520
 the monastery on this screen can be seen awesome 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:35.360
 thick bushes awesomely beautiful landscape 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:37.460
 awesomely beautiful trees but another 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.040
 screen guys here are awesome 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.690
 leaves again 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.460
 very very everything is so beautiful 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.919
 worked out so on everyone thought that 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.169
 this is probably some kind of new render 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:51.050
 probably just covered new new render 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:53.720
 herbs everyone thought it was just direct x 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.300
 11 which is finally five years later 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.250
 will add to our game and asked the storm 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.940
 like this is a new render well and maybe 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:05.060
 new direct 11 storm answered yes it is he 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.510
 but after that he said that 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.050
 that stone left down he too 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.780
 detailed and 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:15.260
 super polygonal probably this is hd 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.419
 map and storm such yes guys this is hd 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.160
 a card that is what you guys are now 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:21.830
 saw this screenshots 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.960
 hd cards you are doing now 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.120
 developers that is glory to heaven 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.100
 finally they took up the matter on 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.700
 brides we will soon see 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.400
 our first hd card 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.230
 game with new graphics well, with the new 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.970
 study well, this sulfur will be super 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.220
 duper beautiful another question guys 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:41.280
 of course how long will 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:43.260
 make each a Cartesian and how many of them 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.270
 will get in every patch I'm so 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.830
 I assume if even hd-models are made 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.780
 very slowly your most likely these 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.810
 cards will be made even slower and 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.910
 it will be another ten years until all the cards in 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.770
 The game will be updated Well , here I am 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.570
 pessimist don't know what you think 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.610
