few days to a few weeks late on the ball
and<00:00:37.019> I'm<00:00:38.019> referring<00:00:38.260> to<00:00:38.590> the<00:00:39.600> Diablo<00:00:40.600> 3<00:00:42.030> ladder

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
and I'm referring to the Diablo 3 ladder

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.180 
and I'm referring to the Diablo 3 ladder
season<00:00:44.019> or<00:00:44.140> whatever<00:00:44.410> they<00:00:44.590> call<00:00:44.800> it<00:00:44.829> launch

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
season or whatever they call it launch

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.900 
season or whatever they call it launch
so<00:00:46.000> I<00:00:46.030> want<00:00:46.300> to<00:00:46.359> go<00:00:46.510> over<00:00:46.780> it<00:00:47.609> pretty<00:00:48.609> much<00:00:48.699> what

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
so I want to go over it pretty much what

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.029 
so I want to go over it pretty much what
I<00:00:48.940> understand<00:00:49.539> of<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:50.050> patch<00:00:50.230> notes<00:00:50.260> and<00:00:50.829> how

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
I understand of the patch notes and how

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.430 
I understand of the patch notes and how
it<00:00:51.190> relates<00:00:51.550> to<00:00:51.760> how<00:00:52.570> I<00:00:52.600> thought<00:00:52.989> Blizzard

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
it relates to how I thought Blizzard

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.329 
it relates to how I thought Blizzard
would<00:00:53.559> handle<00:00:53.980> this<00:00:54.129> like<00:00:55.089> two<00:00:55.300> years<00:00:55.570> ago

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
would handle this like two years ago

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.329 
would handle this like two years ago
okay<00:00:57.339> so<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:59.410> patch<00:00:59.620> notes<00:00:59.649> are<00:00:59.949> very<00:01:00.129> long

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
okay so the patch notes are very long

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:01.560 
okay so the patch notes are very long
there's<00:01:00.609> a<00:01:00.670> lot<00:01:00.789> of<00:01:00.879> stuff<00:01:01.059> that<00:01:01.089> they<00:01:01.269> change

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
there's a lot of stuff that they change

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.520 
there's a lot of stuff that they change
I'm<00:01:02.050> going<00:01:02.409> to<00:01:02.589> separate<00:01:03.249> things<00:01:04.239> into<00:01:04.629> things

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
I'm going to separate things into things

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.310 
I'm going to separate things into things
that<00:01:05.740> don't<00:01:05.860> matter<00:01:06.070> and<00:01:06.460> things<00:01:07.030> that<00:01:07.320> might

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
that don't matter and things that might

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.720 
that don't matter and things that might
matter<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:10.060> things<00:01:10.420> that<00:01:10.600> don't<00:01:10.780> matter<00:01:11.020> are

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:11.730 
matter so things that don't matter are

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.880 
matter so things that don't matter are
there<00:01:12.730> are<00:01:12.910> new<00:01:13.120> items<00:01:13.320> they<00:01:14.320> change<00:01:14.620> around

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
there are new items they change around

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.220 
there are new items they change around
some<00:01:15.100> skills<00:01:15.430> or<00:01:15.580> some<00:01:16.060> they<00:01:16.600> like<00:01:16.810> plus

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
some skills or some they like plus

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.290 
some skills or some they like plus
and<00:01:17.530> minus<00:01:17.920> a<00:01:18.130> couple<00:01:18.280> percentage<00:01:18.820> points<00:01:18.880> on

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
and minus a couple percentage points on

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.970 
and minus a couple percentage points on
a<00:01:19.330> lot<00:01:19.510> of<00:01:19.630> skills<00:01:19.840> I<00:01:19.990> kind<00:01:20.170> of<00:01:20.230> crap<00:01:20.470> most<00:01:20.770> like

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
a lot of skills I kind of crap most like

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.640 
a lot of skills I kind of crap most like
didn't<00:01:21.280> read<00:01:21.490> through<00:01:21.700> it<00:01:21.790> to<00:01:21.910> be<00:01:22.030> honest<00:01:22.650> so

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
didn't read through it to be honest so

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.580 
didn't read through it to be honest so
they<00:01:23.860> always<00:01:24.010> do<00:01:24.220> this<00:01:24.340> every<00:01:24.610> patch<00:01:25.230> but<00:01:26.230> the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
they always do this every patch but the

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.360 
they always do this every patch but the
main<00:01:27.070> bulk<00:01:27.790> is<00:01:28.230> the<00:01:29.230> stuff<00:01:29.470> that<00:01:29.620> does<00:01:29.890> kind<00:01:30.250> of

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
main bulk is the stuff that does kind of

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.850 
main bulk is the stuff that does kind of
matter<00:01:30.580> is<00:01:30.850> that<00:01:31.180> everyone<00:01:32.080> gets<00:01:32.380> a<00:01:32.530> fresh

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
matter is that everyone gets a fresh

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.220 
matter is that everyone gets a fresh
start<00:01:33.160> in<00:01:33.490> what<00:01:33.940> they<00:01:34.120> call<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:34.570> season<00:01:35.020> and

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
start in what they call the season and

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.990 
start in what they call the season and
it's<00:01:35.380> not<00:01:35.560> called<00:01:35.800> the<00:01:35.890> ladder<00:01:36.070> because<00:01:36.400> the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
it's not called the ladder because the

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.710 
it's not called the ladder because the
measurement<00:01:37.540> of<00:01:38.290> you<00:01:39.070> know<00:01:39.220> the<00:01:39.880> ranks<00:01:40.330> is<00:01:40.480> not

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
measurement of you know the ranks is not

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.470 
measurement of you know the ranks is not
based<00:01:41.080> on<00:01:41.350> your<00:01:41.680> level<00:01:42.010> so<00:01:42.490> because<00:01:43.300> of<00:01:43.450> that

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
based on your level so because of that

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.970 
based on your level so because of that
it<00:01:43.780> kind<00:01:44.020> of<00:01:44.110> makes<00:01:44.320> sense<00:01:44.440> that<00:01:44.710> they<00:01:44.830> use

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
it kind of makes sense that they use

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.910 
it kind of makes sense that they use
this<00:01:45.160> term<00:01:45.400> and<00:01:45.700> what<00:01:46.350> basically<00:01:47.350> is<00:01:47.770> the

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
this term and what basically is the

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.860 
this term and what basically is the
purpose<00:01:48.280> is<00:01:48.460> you<00:01:48.970> make<00:01:49.150> a<00:01:49.180> new<00:01:49.390> character<00:01:49.570> you

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
purpose is you make a new character you

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.510 
purpose is you make a new character you
start<00:01:50.140> from<00:01:50.260> fresh<00:01:50.470> you<00:01:50.740> compare<00:01:51.190> how<00:01:51.340> you're

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
start from fresh you compare how you're

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.240 
start from fresh you compare how you're
doing<00:01:51.790> with<00:01:52.000> how<00:01:52.900> other<00:01:53.170> characters<00:01:54.100> are

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
doing with how other characters are

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.540 
doing with how other characters are
doing<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:55.480> idea<00:01:55.870> is<00:01:55.990> that<00:01:56.550> they

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
doing and the idea is that they

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.700 
doing and the idea is that they
introduced<00:01:58.030> these<00:01:58.390> new<00:01:58.660> type<00:01:58.900> of<00:01:58.930> rifts<00:01:59.530> that

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
introduced these new type of rifts that

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.130 
introduced these new type of rifts that
you<00:02:00.190> can<00:02:00.370> get<00:02:00.640> from<00:02:01.120> completing<00:02:01.600> a<00:02:01.780> regular

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
you can get from completing a regular

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.460 
you can get from completing a regular
rift<00:02:02.380> I<00:02:02.560> believe

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
rift I believe

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.100 
rift I believe
and<00:02:03.640> doing<00:02:04.640> this<00:02:04.910> riff<00:02:05.180> gives<00:02:05.510> you<00:02:05.660> like<00:02:05.840> some

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
and doing this riff gives you like some

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.460 
and doing this riff gives you like some
kind<00:02:06.350> of<00:02:06.380> trial<00:02:06.800> and<00:02:07.100> you<00:02:07.430> progress<00:02:07.790> through

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
kind of trial and you progress through

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.140 
kind of trial and you progress through
rifts<00:02:09.470> that<00:02:09.500> escalate<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:10.369> difficulty<00:02:10.970> and

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
rifts that escalate and difficulty and

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.750 
rifts that escalate and difficulty and
the<00:02:11.360> difficulty<00:02:12.020> of<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.550> rifts<00:02:13.550> is

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
the difficulty of the rifts is

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.450 
the difficulty of the rifts is
irrelevant<00:02:14.690> of<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.530> difficulty<00:02:16.160> that<00:02:16.190> you're

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
irrelevant of the difficulty that you're

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.790 
irrelevant of the difficulty that you're
playing<00:02:16.760> on<00:02:16.970> so<00:02:17.150> if<00:02:17.210> you're<00:02:17.330> playing<00:02:17.510> on<00:02:17.800> I

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
playing on so if you're playing on I

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.030 
playing on so if you're playing on I
don't<00:02:19.160> know<00:02:19.250> torment<00:02:19.940> something<00:02:20.740> it<00:02:21.740> doesn't

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
don't know torment something it doesn't

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.710 
don't know torment something it doesn't
matter<00:02:22.220> or<00:02:22.490> is<00:02:22.640> playing<00:02:22.940> on<00:02:23.060> normally<00:02:23.510> the

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
matter or is playing on normally the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.660 
matter or is playing on normally the
difficulties<00:02:24.290> based<00:02:24.530> on<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.980> rift<00:02:25.130> itself

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
difficulties based on the rift itself

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.150 
difficulties based on the rift itself
and<00:02:25.970> I<00:02:26.050> kind<00:02:27.050> of<00:02:27.110> saw<00:02:27.290> how<00:02:27.470> these<00:02:27.650> work<00:02:27.950> I

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
and I kind of saw how these work I

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.530 
and I kind of saw how these work I
didn't<00:02:28.460> play<00:02:28.610> through<00:02:28.850> it<00:02:28.910> myself

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
didn't play through it myself

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.720 
didn't play through it myself
but<00:02:30.140> they<00:02:30.320> do<00:02:30.500> seem<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.740> get<00:02:30.920> pretty<00:02:31.190> hard<00:02:31.490> and

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
but they do seem to get pretty hard and

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.650 
but they do seem to get pretty hard and
there<00:02:32.450> is<00:02:32.660> a<00:02:32.690> timer<00:02:33.200> I<00:02:34.070> don't<00:02:34.790> know<00:02:35.150> if<00:02:35.300> you<00:02:35.420> die

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
there is a timer I don't know if you die

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.810 
there is a timer I don't know if you die
if<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:35.990> timer<00:02:36.230> runs<00:02:36.530> out<00:02:36.740> but<00:02:37.070> I'm<00:02:37.250> sure<00:02:37.280> on

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
if the timer runs out but I'm sure on

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.550 
if the timer runs out but I'm sure on
hardcore<00:02:38.450> you<00:02:38.690> can<00:02:38.870> just<00:02:39.080> leave<00:02:39.290> if<00:02:39.410> that's

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
hardcore you can just leave if that's

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.980 
hardcore you can just leave if that's
the<00:02:39.770> case<00:02:39.920> I<00:02:40.100> don't<00:02:40.130> think<00:02:40.430> that's<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.760> case

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
the case I don't think that's the case

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.230 
the case I don't think that's the case
but<00:02:41.990> to<00:02:42.170> continue<00:02:42.530> on<00:02:42.709> you<00:02:43.010> have<00:02:43.250> to<00:02:43.280> beat<00:02:44.060> the

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
but to continue on you have to beat the

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.449 
but to continue on you have to beat the
rift<00:02:44.480> boss<00:02:44.720> within<00:02:45.320> that<00:02:45.560> time<00:02:45.890> period<00:02:45.920> and

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
rift boss within that time period and

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.280 
rift boss within that time period and
because<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.209> difficulty<00:02:47.720> escalates

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
because the difficulty escalates

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.650 
because the difficulty escalates
characters<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:49.640> know<00:02:49.730> they<00:02:49.850> kind<00:02:50.090> of<00:02:50.270> enter

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660

not<00:03:21.290> because<00:03:21.620> Diablo<00:03:22.100> 3<00:03:22.370> is<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.700> best<00:03:22.850> game

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
not because Diablo 3 is the best game

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.350 
not because Diablo 3 is the best game
ever

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
ever

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.790 
ever
it's<00:03:25.030> possibly<00:03:26.030> not<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.660> best<00:03:26.989> game<00:03:27.290> ever<00:03:27.470> but

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
it's possibly not the best game ever but

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.259 
it's possibly not the best game ever but
it's<00:03:27.980> an<00:03:28.100> alright<00:03:28.250> game<00:03:28.640> it's<00:03:28.820> pretty<00:03:28.970> fine

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
it's an alright game it's pretty fine

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.180 
it's an alright game it's pretty fine
you<00:03:29.420> kill<00:03:29.630> stuff<00:03:29.900> you<00:03:30.470> turn<00:03:30.680> your<00:03:30.800> graphics

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
you kill stuff you turn your graphics

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.860 
you kill stuff you turn your graphics
all<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.459> way<00:03:31.580> up<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.000> you<00:03:32.299> play<00:03:32.510> with<00:03:32.600> friends

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
all the way up and you play with friends

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.600 
all the way up and you play with friends
I<00:03:33.080> mean<00:03:33.230> that's<00:03:33.680> that's<00:03:34.040> what<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.280> game<00:03:34.459> is

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
I mean that's that's what the game is

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.030 
I mean that's that's what the game is
about<00:03:34.730> and<00:03:35.150> that's<00:03:36.019> just<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.680> way<00:03:36.769> I'm<00:03:36.920> gonna

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
about and that's just the way I'm gonna

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.680 
about and that's just the way I'm gonna
play<00:03:37.310> it<00:03:37.430> this<00:03:37.549> time<00:03:37.790> around<00:03:38.680> so<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:41.540> best

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
play it this time around so the best

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.330 
play it this time around so the best
part<00:03:41.959> is<00:03:42.110> that<00:03:42.380> everyone<00:03:42.739> starts<00:03:43.130> from

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
part is that everyone starts from

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.250 
part is that everyone starts from
nothing<00:03:43.730> and<00:03:44.049> I<00:03:45.049> really<00:03:46.510> thought<00:03:47.510> this<00:03:47.840> needed

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
nothing and I really thought this needed

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.460 
nothing and I really thought this needed
to<00:03:48.350> happen<00:03:48.769> much<00:03:49.220> sooner<00:03:49.280> than<00:03:50.290> you<00:03:51.290> know

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:02.219 
build and I have a few ideas rolling

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:04.580 
build and I have a few ideas rolling
around<00:05:02.280> so<00:05:03.030> I<00:05:03.300> will<00:05:03.539> need<00:05:03.840> some<00:05:04.050> time<00:05:04.259> to<00:05:04.379> take

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
around so I will need some time to take

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.649 
around so I will need some time to take
care<00:05:04.770> of<00:05:04.830> that<00:05:05.069> and<00:05:05.430> if<00:05:05.610> you<00:05:06.180> know<00:05:06.300> that<00:05:06.539> is

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:06.659 
care of that and if you know that is

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:09.260 
care of that and if you know that is
taken<00:05:07.050> care<00:05:07.080> of<00:05:07.289> by<00:05:08.069> the<00:05:08.129> time<00:05:08.279> that<00:05:08.849> it's<00:05:09.000> time

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
taken care of by the time that it's time

longer but overall some action RPGs are

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.439 
longer but overall some action RPGs are
