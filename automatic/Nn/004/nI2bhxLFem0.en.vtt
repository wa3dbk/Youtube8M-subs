00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
this cannon on the basically the top

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.539 
this cannon on the basically the top
cannon<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:10.470> space<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.830> pretty<00:01:11.189> tough

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
cannon this space is pretty tough

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.000 
cannon this space is pretty tough
because<00:01:11.720> look<00:01:12.720> at<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.080> coverage<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.799> these

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
defenses every inch of this base is

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.929 
defenses every inch of this base is
covered<00:01:16.500> there's<00:01:16.950> no<00:01:17.159> free<00:01:17.520> buildings

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
the inside like these barracks these

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.219 
the inside like these barracks these
builders<00:01:23.970> huts<00:01:24.180> they're<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.780> inside

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
outside so makes it tough to get that

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.770 
outside so makes it tough to get that
fifty<00:01:28.680> percent<00:01:29.159> here<00:01:30.000> we've<00:01:30.150> lured<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.570> clan

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
to boot we're going up against a base

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.540 
to boot we're going up against a base
that<00:04:35.330> have<00:04:35.570> single<00:04:36.080> infernos<00:04:36.710> which<00:04:37.190> makes<00:04:37.430> it

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
even easier to use balloons minions and

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.570 
even easier to use balloons minions and
lava<00:04:41.150> hounds<00:04:41.540> it's<00:04:42.170> easier<00:04:42.470> to<00:04:42.620> overwhelm<00:04:43.250> the

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
lava hounds it's easier to overwhelm the

right now took out all the air defenses
except<00:05:34.340> for<00:05:34.490> one<00:05:34.760> that's<00:05:35.690> a<00:05:35.870> bummer<00:05:36.080> if<00:05:36.320> we

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
except for one that's a bummer if we

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.750 
except for one that's a bummer if we
were<00:05:36.680> going<00:05:36.800> to<00:05:36.860> three<00:05:37.070> star<00:05:37.310> we<00:05:37.520> would<00:05:37.640> have

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
were going to three star we would have

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.670 
were going to three star we would have
definitely<00:05:38.090> needed<00:05:38.720> to<00:05:38.750> take<00:05:38.960> out<00:05:39.140> that<00:05:39.320> last

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680
