00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:13.183
 Welcome to the League of Legends Champion Spotlight, featuring Tryndamere "the Barbarian King". 

00:00:15.368 --> 00:00:19.636
 Tryndamere is a short range fighter who excels in making big damage through his usual attacks. 

00:00:19.874 --> 00:00:23.690
 This Spotlight will focus on its legendary skin "Demonblade Tryndamere". 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.919
 This skin has a model, animation, sound, and particle effects that are different from the usual appearance, 

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:35.349
 Tryndamere's passive is "Battle Fury". Tryndamere gets Fury when attacking, critical, and killing units. 

00:00:35.349 --> 00:00:38.847
 The more Fury is collected, the more Critical Chance increases. 

00:00:39.354 --> 00:00:42.874
 Bloodlust gives a bonus damage based on the health he has. 

00:00:42.874 --> 00:00:47.500
 He gets a little damage when full health and increases until when his health is only 1. 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.698
 Tryndamere can activate Bloodlust to use all Fury, heal it based on the amount of Fury used. 

00:00:53.374 --> 00:00:56.918
 Mocking Shout reduces Attack Damage for all Champion opponents around. 

00:00:56.918 --> 00:01:00.240
 The opponent facing back will also slow down for a few seconds. 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.833
 Spinning Slash made Tryndamere advance to a location and injure all the opponents he passed. 

00:01:05.882 --> 00:01:10.292
 Every time Tryndamere lands a critical attack, Cooldown Spinning Slash decreases. 

00:01:10.292 --> 00:01:14.947
 The Undying Rage provides an additional Fury and makes Tryndamere unable to die for a few seconds, 

00:01:14.947 --> 00:01:17.745
 holding him in 1 Health when he will die. 

00:01:17.745 --> 00:01:21.351
 This ability can be activated even if it is affected by Stun, Silence, or other disabling effects. 

00:01:21.351 --> 00:01:27.398
 As a suggestion, you usually want to use Bloodlust to heal yourself when the Undying Rage ends to survive. 

00:01:28.095 --> 00:01:34.009
 I play Tryndamere as a Jungler, making me able to do the Farm without interruption and ambush my opponent suddenly. 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.880
 Ask a teammate to attack the Golem and help you clean the camp without receiving much damage. 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.470
 Continue to Wraith, Wolf, and give the blue Golem to the team members who can use it well. 

00:01:45.225 --> 00:01:49.400
 I then ambushed Lane downstairs. I started with Mocking Shout and Spinning Slash. 

00:01:49.402 --> 00:01:53.398
 We finished Health Blitzcrank and killed him despite being hit by Alistar Stun. 

00:01:53.398 --> 00:01:56.190
 I attacked Alistar with a critical attack and away from the reach of the Turret. 

00:01:56.831 --> 00:01:59.060
 Seeing him dying, I played too aggressively. 

00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:01.190
 I only have to kill one more Minion to reach level 6, 

00:02:01.194 --> 00:02:07.240
 but carelessly I crashed and instead died under the opponent's turret when I was stunned. 

00:02:07.243 --> 00:02:10.028
 When Ultimate is available, you can fight with anyone if you play well. 

00:02:10.028 --> 00:02:12.820
 Facing Vladimir in the middle lane, I started aggressively. 

00:02:12.821 --> 00:02:16.500
 I waited for the Sanguine Pool, but he turned when I used Mocking Shout. 

00:02:16.504 --> 00:02:21.319
 Luckily I was able to chase it, using Flash and Spinning Slash to chase it down to the Turret. 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.680
 The scariest part here is running away from the Turret. 

00:02:23.681 --> 00:02:27.708
 Right before Undying Rage runs out and receives a Turret attack, I use Bloodlust, 

00:02:27.708 --> 00:02:29.930
 makes me able to hold one more attack and stay out of reach. 

00:02:30.646 --> 00:02:37.470
 When fighting in the middle, I move away when Alistar uses Ultimate. Then return when Taric appears and Stun Vayne. 

00:02:37.472 --> 00:02:40.020
 I killed him with just a few attacks and Spinning Slash. 

00:02:40.022 --> 00:02:45.276
 Turning to Vladimir, he can't afford enough damage because I give a lot of damage and have Lifesteal. 

00:02:45.276 --> 00:02:49.206
 After he died, I chased Alistar who did not have Ultimate. 

00:02:49.206 --> 00:02:52.740
 Thanks to Taric, I got three kills without touching the Undying Rage. 

00:02:53.454 --> 00:02:58.700
 I was pulled to the opponent's Turret by Blitzcrank. I ran and used the Undying Rage when I was almost killed. 

00:02:58.702 --> 00:03:02.546
 Yorick made a copy of myself with the Omen of Death when I tried to attack Vladimir. 

00:03:02.546 --> 00:03:05.920
 I saw the coffee myself, I beat Blitzcrank to death, so I killed him. 

00:03:05.922 --> 00:03:10.470
 Vladimir's damage was unable to match my Lifesteal so I killed him easily. 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:16.230
 I destroyed the middle Turret, but immediately ran away because the opponent had a lot of Stun and ability to escape. 

00:03:16.234 --> 00:03:19.900
 When facing Blitzcrank, I used the Undying Rage at the last moment. 

00:03:19.903 --> 00:03:22.640
 After finishing him, I looked for the next target. 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.230
 Even though Alistar is approaching, Vayne is a far more important target, 

00:03:25.233 --> 00:03:27.910
 so I killed him with Slash and Spinning critically. 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.139
 Undying Rage was exhausted and I was killed, but Yorick had used Omen of Death on me, 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.070
 so for the rest of my short life, I lunged at Tristana and killed her before time ran out. 

00:03:38.814 --> 00:03:43.830
 There was a fight in the opposing forest. Blizcrank looks like an easy target, so I attacked it first. 

00:03:43.831 --> 00:03:48.546
 Unfortunately, his friends came and he also used Flash. Because I was still healthy, I attacked Vladimir, 

00:03:48.546 --> 00:03:50.760
 but the opposing team pushed me against the wall. 

00:03:50.991 --> 00:03:53.855
 I turned on the Undying Rage and chased it with Spinning Slash. 

00:03:53.855 --> 00:03:58.415
 At this time, I should have run around the wolf camp and immediately attacked Blitzcrank, Tristana, and Vayne. 

00:03:58.415 --> 00:04:03.109
 But I made a mistake and attacked from the front, directly facing Alistar and killed by Pulverize. 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.940
 Keep in mind that Tryndamere can get out and re-enter the fight easily. 

00:04:07.951 --> 00:04:11.600
 Don't think that you can only attack from the front. 

00:04:11.603 --> 00:04:16.820
 One of the great advantages of Damage Tryndamere is that you can kill Baron Nashor quickly. 

00:04:16.824 --> 00:04:21.080
 When attacking the Baron, remember that he will attack the closest target, 

00:04:21.082 --> 00:04:24.016
 so make sure at least one of your friends is closer to the Baron. 

00:04:24.016 --> 00:04:25.800
 If not, at least half your damage will be lost. 

00:04:26.626 --> 00:04:30.187
 When meeting Vayne, I use Spinning Slash to approach and use Mocking Shout. 

00:04:30.187 --> 00:04:35.136
 The great effect of Slow makes us able to catch up. He turned away knowing he was unable to escape. 

00:04:35.136 --> 00:04:37.140
 We continue to pursue even though Alistar uses Pulverize. 

00:04:38.558 --> 00:04:42.009
 I also managed to hit Tristana with Mocking Shout and chased him with Spinning Slash. 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:45.699
 After finishing him, I moved away from the Turret attack with Spinning Slash. 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:50.228
 I tried to use Undying Rage at the last moment and turned to kill Blitzcrank with the help of my friend. 

00:04:50.228 --> 00:04:53.550
 Fortunately, I managed to get away when Alistar tried to attack me. 

00:04:53.554 --> 00:04:56.670
 I turned around to kill him critically before leaving the base. 

00:04:57.328 --> 00:05:02.118
 Tryndamere is very dependent on position. Crossing Vayne will immediately stop my attack 

00:05:02.118 --> 00:05:04.830
 and made me use Undying Rage before I could attack. 

00:05:04.831 --> 00:05:08.780
 Luckily I could use Spinning Slash and Flash to finish Tristana, 

00:05:08.785 --> 00:05:12.950
 but if I entered from another angle at the beginning of the fight, I would have been able to last longer. 

00:05:13.704 --> 00:05:17.920
 I managed to separate Vladimir from his team and proceeded to crash to kill him. 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:25.637
 Unfortunately, I was wrong and used the Undying Rage before I nearly died. My health will not decrease below 1 in that duration. 

00:05:25.637 --> 00:05:30.560
 Finally, Blitzcrank and Tristana finished me off even though I could have killed them easily. 

00:05:31.277 --> 00:05:35.188
 One of the most important things as Tryndamere is to avoid the Tanks and their annoying attacks. 

00:05:35.188 --> 00:05:41.140
 I see the fight going to happen, so I use Spinning Slash and Flash to jump over Alistar and reach Vayne right away. 

00:05:41.143 --> 00:05:46.838
 Oracle's Elixir made me able to kill it even though it disappeared. When chasing Vladimir, I noticed the duration of my Ultimate. 

00:05:46.838 --> 00:05:52.628
 Hemoplague will definitely kill me, so I step back and look for another angle. I turned to attack Blitzcrank and killed him quickly. 

00:05:52.628 --> 00:05:58.829
 For runes, I use Attack Speed ​​Marks, Flat Armor Seals, Glyph Attack Speeds, and Armor Penetration Quintessences. 

00:05:58.829 --> 00:06:03.300
 This arrangement allows me to fight well in the forest and get Fury quickly thanks to the addition of Attack Speed. 

00:06:03.302 --> 00:06:10.640
 My Mastery is 9/21/9, by taking all Physical Damage enhancers in the Offense section and adding Buff duration in the Utility section. 

00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:14.017
 I use Smite and Flash to quickly clear the forest and increase movement in combat. 

00:06:14.017 --> 00:06:17.528
 I maximize Bloodlust immediately for healing abilities and dealing with damage. 

00:06:17.528 --> 00:06:23.280
 I took Spinning Slash at level 2 and left it there, giving priority to Mocking Shout to weaken opponents in the middle of the game. 

00:06:24.142 --> 00:06:29.689
 For Items, I started with Vampiric Scepter. I continue with Berserker's Greaves and Youmuu's Ghostblade as my main items. 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:37.190
 From there, I continue with Infinity Edge to add damage. After that, I maximize Critical Chance with Cloak and Dagger and Elixir of Agility. 

00:06:37.192 --> 00:06:41.400
 My last item is Bloodthirster and Black Cleaver for Damage at the end of the game and survival. 

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:47.710
