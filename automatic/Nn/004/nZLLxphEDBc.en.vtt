00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:03.760
 hello everyone is the first tutorial 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.589
 what I intend is taught the cost overruns for two 

00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:13.109
 in this sense mendez since the algorithms that are used to 

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:15.489
 prolong most 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:16.820
 we put this one 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.730
 and in case of parity 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.359
 what is above the resolution that sometimes happens sometimes not 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.440
 then you found out about this exchange of actions 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.789
 until the ninth 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.390
 maybe in the afternoon 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.310
 - that all with care first about the celestial 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.930
 I could fish 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.110
 you also to start a project that yesterday 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.470
 the number two of the pp 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.910
 udrih that face so much effort to work 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.580
 the colloquium will be left me quemé have a hundred the reasons that tell us 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.580
 all 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.710
 the third place is shared by the band 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.070
 for this to this date this will be the big screen 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.760
 this special professional edition n 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.630
 here 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:05.520
 and blue 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.410
 We are looking for another blue and white record so that we have to go fifth to want a 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.570
 championship 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.980
 I told them carazo bruno 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.990
 I smelled this plant and blue 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.230
 vázquez uru blanquiazul 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.710
 then he feels 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.909
 you have to upload it 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.300
 as it was known 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.660
 because it is placed just below that stable growth three days then nothing 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.680
 it's known 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.190
 for zapata the cicr is to go down side ponderó the extreme 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.140
 forlan 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.370
 Dreams 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.430
 we already have all 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.940
 following 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.830
 this fishing in white and purple 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.020
 white and purple this one has to go here 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.570
 as it is done equally missing going down 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.470
 bean 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.170
 just missing ponds white and green acts white and green 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.940
 demille that recognizes its time like all 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.320
 zapata is going for long with another attitude 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.020
 Egypt 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.680
 it's placed below we assume it's out there 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.690
 we place it under 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.749
 under the leader up here 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:10.369
 jakarta 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.299
 is low spoken is placed 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.749
 an extra crown is urgent 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:20.849
 look back after finishing up this team has three by three 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.189
 employ that we have inside just another part of the end of the corner 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:29.409
 I believe it is that it is to include the one that has no muamar and I 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.259
 and place it side that match the colors 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:35.289
 red allow to die 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:38.579
 we complain about nothing in these three teams 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.299
 the cis also positioned 90 I base myself positioned 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.610
 is not pressed well why the blue and the red are not they are not the ones 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:47.640
 correspond 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.509
 no good corresponds 

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:50.829
 to order them 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.779
 by the same government 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:57.189
 in which he untied after dinner or so he said is the same 

00:02:57.789 --> 00:03:00.350
 so with him that is imposed for right 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.819
 da vinci naciri nothing easy 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.669
 in the first state in what I'm going to do will be in total these three enter 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:09.320
 they 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.259
 in this counterclockwise sense I will be here I am here and be here 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:15.549
 the material is top 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:16.669
 on the left 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:18.699
 up right 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:22.729
 top left right up and upside down 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:25.729
 today it is expected to win left to do this job 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:29.689
 Despair is the sport that I work the most 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:32.199
 Give more as we have been 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:33.969
 they still do not correspond 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:35.429
 again 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:38.609
 sometimes superior to the left, right part of the river 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.709
 top right match that the previous 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.709
 for top left part of that work 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.769
 from the right 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.119
 this we recover white 

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:53.019
 in front of it they correspond make up the corresponding 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.850
 here it would be solved at the starting grid 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.780
 not in this case we do not have much luck in the exit but I am going to do that 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.719
 come out first 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:03.949
 we solved this would be solved 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:05.569
 diego atmosphere 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.069
 comadres because I know them are events that we already know that is up left 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.729
 arpaio jobs 

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:13.950
 they seem to rise right 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.489
 is enough pitch 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.489
 fergerson you do 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.729
 it would be done 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.789
 I'm going to create parity 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:30.789
 toronto makes gestures that are deep 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.960
 this is a case of parity 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.889
 yes clear is that we want that we are left is the cube of the line that we are 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.020
 doing is that brazil that's fine 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.090
 and they give in this good first red red and green valverde there is no other hand 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.330
 we leave you these two 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.430
 both changed 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.550
 and it is that red I arrived here 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.270
 red stylist and the moro of the team that is wrong must be changed 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.339
 I'm going to do is look at the opposite face 

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:03.059
 to the two who are here 

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:04.949
 to the proposal 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.129
 i jia the cube well 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:08.520
 I repeat again 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.069
 are these two times I explain to trust 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:13.960
 look me in the opposite face 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.839
 the fluctuation 

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:18.020
 it has to be, that is, elements 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.050
 the famous part of that work 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.460
 for anyone 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.300
 it must be terrible 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.589
 for me it was not part of the fence 

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:27.639
 this request below 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:29.740
 the bottom left 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.969
 maybe left up 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:34.969
 to go back as it was before 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:39.409
 from right down the previous to the right in fact this river 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:42.409
 we have twice the bottom 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.240
 they are all day well put that country 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.039
 since these two 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:51.389
 we have not changed 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:55.009
 de alcalá are already within a year after the four events in this 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:56.270
 wellness list 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.270
 center 

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:05.169
 fiasco students of said principle that you have to know how to do 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.180
 the iphone 3 0 can make this celebration 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.810
 you were made to see the control of the steering wheel and unequivocal will happen nothing 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.119
 these properties 3% 

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:30.430
 but these comments foundations that jazztel orange 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.580
 e the two hundreds 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.569
