 beauty recipes this you will love 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.290
 and well, well, we started well 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.479
 first we need are dry branches 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.880
 very long branches if you do not have very long 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.400
 do not worry we are going to join with 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.070
 wire now on a wooden base 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.729
 let's put the all together with 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.980
 our wire is going around and 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.730
 we are placing several branches 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.590
 look very well as we hold it in the 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.930
 bottom part and in the part of up 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.050
 above this wire is already lined what 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.420
 you can buy lined or unlined 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.580
 now to join one branch with another we're going 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.010
 to do the same 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.440
 with a piece of wire we join two 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:51.490
 branches and so we're going to make it bigger 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:54.370
 our tree is very easy you only see 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.640
 holding them with the wire and tighten 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.650
 very well now with brown paint or 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.930
 color that you want because also the 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.230
 long you can paint it white blue 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.930
 let's paint our branches I'll 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.600
 I advise that the paint be acrylic and 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.600
 you make it very diluted is to say a little 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.210
 aguada not so thick 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.210
 that makes it easy for you to paint it perfectly 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.740
 everywhere the branches usually 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.650
 they are not the same tone 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.410
 painting it becomes a tree of it 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.050
 tone everything helps to make it look like 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.150
 out one piece if your wire is not 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.940
 lined also paint it as it is 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.880
 subject on the branch paint it over with 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.400
 this painting will look like a single 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.900
 piece will not be assembled by saying so 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.020
 A) Yes 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.000
 now with leaves we are going to drill 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.550
 butterflies dragonflies whatever you want 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.620
 with beautiful drills or also the 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.440
 you can cut by hand 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.920
 we have many designs of 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.070
 flowers dragonflies butterflies a little bit of 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.010
 all anyone can find them are 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.490
 very easy to paste and also decorate 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.070
 very much 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:10.190
 I like to bend it a little bit to 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.520
 give relief to each piece for example to 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.370
 the flowers we are going to fold each petal 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.170
 this gives it much more realism now the 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.810
 butterflies we are going to fold them in half 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.780
 and we're going to leave a gap in the 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.660
 half with this we're going to hit 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.570
 our branches look very well now in 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.270
 the butterfly we are going to place right in 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.880
 half a little silicone and we're going to 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.710
 stick in our branches we will do what 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.320
 same with our flowers I like it 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.730
 put the flowers all together you can 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.830
 put leaves dragonflies flowers butterflies 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.190
 hearts what you want the joke is 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.230
 decorate this tree 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.670
 You can also leave it very sober at 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.400
 better white with a little bit of 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.600
 glitter if it's a coral wedding or 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.840
 as you want 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.630
 place bigger butterflies 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.240
 applications we also have them now 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.870
 with a little moss we will put 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.420
 right at the base it puts a lot of silicone and 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.640
 go placing the world on it squeezes what 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.430
 very well so that it does not fall apart too 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.739
 right at the base we will place a 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.320
 little bit more this makes you miss 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.330
 completely the wooden base I te 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.170
 I suggest that also with what is moss 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:29.170
 on the stem right here another thing that you 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.650
 you can place is dry leaves or what 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.120
 you can fit everything in a pot 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.710
 remember that here on the rise we have 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.900
 many centerpieces for 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.150
 any event this is just an idea 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.850
 Now you can cut cards in shape 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:47.840
 of heart or circle and make them a 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.490
 hole right on the shore above this 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.979
 is for your guests to 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.650
 write the wishes and leave it in the 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:57.169
 tree at the end of the event you will have a 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.350
 tree full of wishes and memories 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:02.180
 we were that were that day placed the 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.190
 ribbon just in the hole that I 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.160
 you just did to make the guests 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.000
 they can hang it for all the art is left 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.460
 very nice 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.410
 also decorates a lot 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.509
 and remember that this can be for 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.120
 any event for example in a baby 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:21.199
 shower you can place pictures of 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:23.000
 an ultrasound or pacifiers and your cartons 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:25.190
 can be in the form of clothes 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.949
 example can be in the form of a 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.110
 pants of a sweater and if it's a 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:33.050
 bachelorette party you can place 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:36.500
 with artificial roses flowers with 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.360
 hearts ideas there are so many 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.210
 example for another event you can 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.070
 place miniature gifts or 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.770
 You can also paint it white and 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.410
 fill them with artificial flowers with 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.900
 some plastic or glass beads 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.460
 and you can even place the stars 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.470
 members 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.479
 There are many sizes and several 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.610
 colors and inside of the stars 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:01.680
 You can leave a message surprise 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.750
 invited to do it upside down 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.460
 this can be something very fun in 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.430
 any event even in a Christmas 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.680
 for example to each guest we can 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.680
 leave a little cry inside a heart 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.690
 or from a star the joke is that 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.419
 details are incredible and very 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:21.180

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:23.430
 how beautiful our tree is 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.560
 very nice and remember that these cards 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.930
 where they are going to leave the wishes can be 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.880
 heart- shaped circle in the 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.770
 way that you want because it depends on the 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.870
 event if you are going to do it for example 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.270
 for a baby shower you can leave them in 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.860
 circle shape in a little box in the 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.979
 entrance and all the people are going to tell you 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.780
