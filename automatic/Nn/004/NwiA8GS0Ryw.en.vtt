receiver<00:00:49.010> DB<00:00:49.370> interaction<00:00:49.969> which<00:00:50.570> has<00:00:50.989> been

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
receiver DB interaction which has been

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.350 
receiver DB interaction which has been
blown<00:00:51.530> out<00:00:51.710> into<00:00:51.980> a<00:00:52.250> collection<00:00:52.910> of<00:00:53.000> features

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.560 
blown out into a collection of features
called<00:00:53.600> air<00:00:53.840> supremacy<00:00:54.260> so<00:00:55.039> because<00:00:55.640> we<00:00:56.329> have

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
called air supremacy so because we have

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.420 
called air supremacy so because we have
been<00:00:56.840> claiming<00:00:57.199> that<00:00:57.469> we<00:00:57.590> want<00:00:57.800> more<00:00:57.980> dby

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430

receiver<00:00:58.820> interaction<00:00:59.359> they<00:00:59.989> came<00:01:00.230> up<00:01:00.350> with<00:01:00.410> a

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
receiver interaction they came up with a

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.410 
receiver interaction they came up with a
system<00:01:00.829> called<00:01:01.250> air<00:01:01.370> supremacy<00:01:01.609> there's<00:01:02.270> a

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
system called air supremacy there's a

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.450 
system called air supremacy there's a
primitive<00:01:02.899> privacy<00:01:03.500> revolutionizes<00:01:04.339> the

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
primitive privacy revolutionizes the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.950 
primitive privacy revolutionizes the

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
with a wide variety of outcomes so um

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.770 
with a wide variety of outcomes so um
they<00:01:19.130> implanted<00:01:19.640> this<00:01:19.849> new<00:01:20.060> system<00:01:20.270> guys<00:01:20.599> its

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
they implanted this new system guys its

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.010 
they implanted this new system guys its
many<00:01:21.020> 16<00:01:21.470> of<00:01:21.940> called<00:01:22.940> air<00:01:23.179> supremacy<00:01:23.509> and

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
many 16 of called air supremacy and

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.990 
many 16 of called air supremacy and
hopefully<00:01:25.009> is<00:01:25.069> gonna<00:01:25.220> make<00:01:25.340> a<00:01:25.399> lot<00:01:25.610> more<00:01:25.640> fun<00:01:25.940> I

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
hopefully is gonna make a lot more fun I

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.520 
hopefully is gonna make a lot more fun I
don't<00:01:26.330> know<00:01:26.420> I<00:01:26.450> thinking<00:01:27.110> man<00:01:27.289> by<00:01:27.470> the

we're gonna have two people going to get

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.490 
we're gonna have two people going to get
used<00:01:35.119> to<00:01:35.179> some<00:01:35.360> animations<00:01:35.959> and<00:01:36.200> going<00:01:36.319> to<00:01:36.380> be

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
used to some animations and going to be

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.229 
used to some animations and going to be
triggered<00:01:36.709> in<00:01:36.890> them<00:01:37.009> triggering<00:01:38.000> those

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
about air supremacy in this new system

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.609 
about air supremacy in this new system
in<00:01:49.640> madden<00:01:49.880> 16<00:01:50.030> let<00:01:50.780> me<00:01:50.869> know<00:01:50.989> man<00:01:51.170> here<00:01:51.440> in<00:01:51.530> the

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
in madden 16 let me know man here in the

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.559 
in madden 16 let me know man here in the
comments<00:01:51.979> section<00:01:52.009> I<00:01:52.489> personally<00:01:53.090> think<00:01:53.420> is
