00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
too big of a fan of hard match but I'm

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.490 
too big of a fan of hard match but I'm
starting<00:03:34.630> to<00:03:34.660> become<00:03:34.780> a<00:03:34.930> little<00:03:35.200> bit<00:03:35.290> more

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
starting to become a little bit more

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.250 
starting to become a little bit more
like<00:03:36.370> slowly<00:03:36.790> starting<00:03:37.690> to<00:03:37.720> become<00:03:37.840> more<00:03:38.110> of<00:03:38.140> a

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
like slowly starting to become more of a

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:47.759 
like slowly starting to become more of a
fan<00:03:38.440> of<00:03:38.470> hard<00:03:38.739> mesh<00:03:39.840> it's<00:03:40.840> a<00:03:45.930> shoots<00:03:46.930> faster<00:03:47.530> I

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
fan of hard mesh it's a shoots faster I

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.710 
fan of hard mesh it's a shoots faster I
mean<00:03:48.310> it<00:03:48.400> holds<00:03:48.670> faster<00:03:49.000> but<00:03:49.150> you<00:03:49.330> can't<00:03:49.570> get

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
mean it holds faster but you can't get

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.590 
mean it holds faster but you can't get
much<00:03:49.870> hold<00:03:50.290> or<00:03:50.830> whip<00:03:51.400> off<00:03:51.610> of<00:03:51.820> it<00:03:51.970> probably<00:03:52.510> I

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
much hold or whip off of it probably I

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.090 
much hold or whip off of it probably I
don't<00:03:52.810> know<00:03:52.870> if<00:03:52.989> I<00:03:53.049> didn't<00:03:53.350> if<00:03:53.470> I<00:03:53.590> strong<00:03:53.950> it
