00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.650 
fit on the screen it's not stretched at
all<00:02:16.170> it's<00:02:16.440> just<00:02:16.530> perfect<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.480> know<00:02:18.540> you

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
all it's just perfect and you know you

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.220 
all it's just perfect and you know you
can<00:02:18.870> do<00:02:18.989> that<00:02:19.110> with<00:02:19.290> any<00:02:20.390> of<00:02:21.390> these<00:02:21.569> pictures<00:02:22.050> I

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
can do that with any of these pictures I

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.990 
can do that with any of these pictures I
mean<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.560> can<00:02:22.709> have<00:02:22.920> one<00:02:23.069> that's<00:02:23.190> above<00:02:23.819> your

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
mean you can have one that's above your

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.850 
mean you can have one that's above your
screen<00:02:24.300> resolution<00:02:24.420> but<00:02:25.110> it's<00:02:25.260> it's<00:02:25.590> better

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
screen resolution but it's it's better

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.589 
screen resolution but it's it's better
to<00:02:26.099> have<00:02:26.250> one<00:02:26.519> that<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.239> your<00:02:27.390> screen

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
to have one that is your screen

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:28.759 
to have one that is your screen
resolution<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.260> doesn't<00:02:28.470> have<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.620> be

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
resolution so it doesn't have to be

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.460 
resolution so it doesn't have to be
shrunk<00:02:29.099> down<00:02:29.310> or<00:02:29.670> you're<00:02:30.630> not<00:02:30.690> missing<00:02:31.080> like

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
shrunk down or you're not missing like

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.160 
shrunk down or you're not missing like
half<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:31.920> image<00:02:32.160> it's<00:02:32.940> not<00:02:33.180> like<00:02:33.300> out<00:02:33.780> of

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
half of the image it's not like out of

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.580 
half of the image it's not like out of
the<00:02:34.319> screen<00:02:34.590> or<00:02:34.739> anything<00:02:34.920> like<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:36.590> yeah

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
the screen or anything like that so yeah

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.949 
the screen or anything like that so yeah
that's<00:02:37.920> basically<00:02:38.069> just<00:02:38.640> how<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:38.819> get<00:02:39.120> your
