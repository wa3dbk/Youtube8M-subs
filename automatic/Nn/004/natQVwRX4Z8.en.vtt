the<00:01:59.259> problem<00:01:59.829> that<00:01:59.979> we<00:02:00.130> have<00:02:00.340> here<00:02:00.369> is<00:02:00.880> it

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
the problem that we have here is it

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.719 
the problem that we have here is it
automatically<00:02:02.140> sets<00:02:02.530> up<00:02:02.710> with<00:02:02.920> page<00:02:03.189> one<00:02:03.549> and

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
automatically sets up with page one and

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.679 
automatically sets up with page one and
two<00:02:04.000> and<00:02:05.100> then<00:02:06.100> three<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.549> four<00:02:06.969> now<00:02:07.000> we

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
two and then three and four now we

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.330 
two and then three and four now we
really<00:02:08.049> don't<00:02:08.229> want<00:02:08.470> it<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.649> print<00:02:08.950> that<00:02:09.130> way

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
really don't want it to print that way

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.640 
really don't want it to print that way
and<00:02:09.610> if<00:02:10.149> we<00:02:10.329> did<00:02:10.570> print<00:02:10.929> it<00:02:11.079> that<00:02:11.260> way

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
and if we did print it that way

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.220 
and if we did print it that way
it<00:02:11.709> just<00:02:12.430> wouldn't<00:02:12.730> copy<00:02:13.000> right<00:02:13.329> and<00:02:13.600> we<00:02:14.110> would

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
it just wouldn't copy right and we would

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.699 
it just wouldn't copy right and we would
have<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.440> make<00:02:14.709> some<00:02:14.950> changes<00:02:16.530> people<00:02:17.530> that

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
have to make some changes people that

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.100 
have to make some changes people that
have<00:02:17.829> tried<00:02:18.040> this<00:02:18.310> task<00:02:18.610> have<00:02:18.850> known<00:02:19.060> how<00:02:19.720> hard

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
have tried this task have known how hard

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.020 
have tried this task have known how hard
it<00:02:20.230> is<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.620> how<00:02:20.829> difficult<00:02:21.100> it<00:02:21.579> would<00:02:21.670> be<00:02:21.730> to

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
it is and how difficult it would be to

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.810 
it is and how difficult it would be to
actually<00:02:22.810> figure<00:02:23.019> out<00:02:23.200> which<00:02:24.100> way<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.430> order
