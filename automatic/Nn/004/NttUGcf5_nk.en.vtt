alright<00:00:15.960> so<00:00:16.139> we've<00:00:16.289> already<00:00:16.410> tested<00:00:16.650> the

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
alright so we've already tested the

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.230 
alright so we've already tested the
capacitors<00:00:17.490> what<00:00:17.670> we<00:00:17.760> want<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.000> do<00:00:18.060> now<00:00:18.210> is

in<00:01:07.280> order<00:01:07.369> to<00:01:07.549> find<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:07.940> sub<00:01:08.150> cool<00:01:09.400> now<00:01:10.400> we're

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
in order to find the sub cool now we're

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.950 
in order to find the sub cool now we're
going<00:01:10.670> to<00:01:10.729> give<00:01:10.880> it<00:01:10.970> a<00:01:11.030> second<00:01:11.390> to<00:01:11.450> equalize

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
going to give it a second to equalize

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.480 
going to give it a second to equalize
here<00:01:12.380> and<00:01:12.560> get<00:01:13.280> some<00:01:13.490> good<00:01:13.610> readings

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.200 

all<00:01:20.490> right<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.730> we're<00:01:20.850> gonna<00:01:20.910> get<00:01:21.090> some

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
all right so we're gonna get some

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.820 
all right so we're gonna get some
readings<00:01:21.540> off<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.750> our<00:01:21.960> digital<00:01:22.350> gauge<00:01:22.500> here

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
readings off of our digital gauge here

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.530 
readings off of our digital gauge here
and<00:01:23.010> now<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.580> right<00:01:23.790> side<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.330> have<00:01:24.510> our

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
and now on the right side we have our

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.710 
and now on the right side we have our
pressure<00:01:24.900> which<00:01:25.620> is<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.890> psig<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.850> we've<00:01:27.510> got

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
pressure which is in psig and we've got

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.060 
pressure which is in psig and we've got
the<00:01:27.870> sub<00:01:28.080> cool<00:01:28.320> below<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.800> and<00:01:30.950> we're<00:01:31.950> gonna

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the sub cool below that and we're gonna

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.040 
the sub cool below that and we're gonna
hook<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.400> up<00:01:32.550> here<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.720> left<00:01:33.930> side

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
hook this up here and on the left side

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.410 
hook this up here and on the left side
there's<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.160> low<00:01:35.400> pressure<00:01:35.610> suction<00:01:36.120> reading

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
there's a low pressure suction reading

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.560 
there's a low pressure suction reading
and<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.750> superheat<00:01:37.290> below<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:38.330> in<00:01:39.330> this

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
and the superheat below that in this

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.450 
and the superheat below that in this
case<00:01:39.780> though<00:01:40.020> there's<00:01:40.410> an<00:01:40.590> indoor<00:01:40.890> TXV

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
case though there's an indoor TXV

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.550 
case though there's an indoor TXV
controlling<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.120> superheat<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:43.110> we'll<00:01:43.290> use

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
controlling the superheat so we'll use

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.610 
controlling the superheat so we'll use
the<00:01:43.710> sub<00:01:43.920> cool<00:01:44.160> to<00:01:44.280> find<00:01:44.550> it<00:01:44.760> now<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:46.320> charge

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
the sub cool to find it now this charge

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.730 
the sub cool to find it now this charge
is<00:01:46.950> within<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:48.090> correct<00:01:48.330> specifications<00:01:48.740> so

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
is within the correct specifications so

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.660 
is within the correct specifications so
that's<00:01:50.040> good<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.400> it<00:01:50.460> checks<00:01:50.610> out<00:01:50.820> all<00:01:51.450> fine

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
that's good and it checks out all fine

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.620 
that's good and it checks out all fine
all<00:01:53.670> right<00:01:53.700> now<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.150> my<00:01:54.180> digital

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
all right now this is my digital

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.969 
all right now this is my digital
multimeter<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.320> we're<00:01:55.470> gonna<00:01:55.560> check<00:01:55.800> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
multimeter and we're gonna check the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.190 
multimeter and we're gonna check the
amperage<00:01:56.280> draws<00:01:56.550> of<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.330> condenser<00:01:57.600> fan<00:01:57.900> and

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
amperage draws of the condenser fan and

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.290 
amperage draws of the condenser fan and
the<00:01:58.259> compressor<00:01:58.830> but<00:01:59.729> first<00:02:00.000> I'm<00:02:00.119> going<00:02:00.240> to

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
the compressor but first I'm going to

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.960 
the compressor but first I'm going to
check<00:02:00.360> my<00:02:00.630> voltage<00:02:01.020> now<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.560> system<00:02:01.740> runs<00:02:02.610> on

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
check my voltage now this system runs on

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.640 
check my voltage now this system runs on
240<00:02:03.630> volts<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.530> we<00:02:05.490> take<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> look<00:02:05.910> here<00:02:06.650> looks

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
240 volts so we take a look here looks

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.729 
240 volts so we take a look here looks
good<00:02:07.970> all<00:02:08.970> right<00:02:09.170> now<00:02:10.170> we're<00:02:10.320> gonna<00:02:10.440> find<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
good all right now we're gonna find the

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.520 
good all right now we're gonna find the
black<00:02:10.920> wire<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.250> it's<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.120> common<00:02:12.510> wire<00:02:12.720> from

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
black wire and it's the common wire from

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.080 
black wire and it's the common wire from
the<00:02:13.590> condenser<00:02:13.950> fan<00:02:14.250> in<00:02:14.489> order<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.760> get<00:02:14.910> its

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
the condenser fan in order to get its

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.590 
the condenser fan in order to get its
reading<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.290> we<00:02:16.530> grab<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:17.010> there

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
reading so that we grab that there

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.710 
reading so that we grab that there
that's<00:02:18.600> up<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.870> specifications<00:02:20.690> so<00:02:21.690> that

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
that's up to specifications so that

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.660 
that's up to specifications so that
checks<00:02:22.080> out<00:02:23.989> now<00:02:24.989> we're<00:02:25.110> gonna<00:02:25.230> find<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:26.370> look

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
checks out now we're gonna find and look

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.460 
checks out now we're gonna find and look
for<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:26.940> thicker<00:02:27.330> gauge<00:02:27.600> black<00:02:27.930> wire<00:02:28.170> coming

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
for a thicker gauge black wire coming

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.060 
for a thicker gauge black wire coming
from<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.920> top<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.730> contactor<00:02:31.070> it's

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
from the top of the contactor it's

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.290 
from the top of the contactor it's
called<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.400> common<00:02:32.610> wire<00:02:32.910> for<00:02:33.209> the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
called the common wire for the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.070 
called the common wire for the
compressor<00:02:34.010> we're<00:02:35.010> gonna<00:02:35.100> get<00:02:35.310> its<00:02:35.459> reading

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
compressor we're gonna get its reading

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.810 
compressor we're gonna get its reading
let<00:02:37.080> me<00:02:37.110> see<00:02:37.410> there<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:38.250> got<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.430> good<00:02:38.610> reading

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
let me see there you got a good reading

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.800 
let me see there you got a good reading
there<00:02:39.000> as<00:02:39.090> well<00:02:39.299> -<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:40.140> looks<00:02:40.350> good

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.270 

all<00:02:43.350> right<00:02:43.440> so<00:02:43.680> that's<00:02:43.740> pretty<00:02:44.010> much<00:02:44.100> it

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
all right so that's pretty much it

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.650 
all right so that's pretty much it
that's<00:02:44.310> how<00:02:44.520> we<00:02:44.580> read<00:02:44.880> pressures<00:02:45.240> and<00:02:45.420> ampere

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
that's how we read pressures and ampere

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.240 
that's how we read pressures and ampere
