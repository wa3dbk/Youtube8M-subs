00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:15.100 

let<00:00:02.010> the<00:00:02.220> prototype<00:00:02.700> hunting<00:00:03.120> begin

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.870 

sure<00:00:16.110> if<00:00:16.230> that's<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.590> next-generation<00:00:17.070> Raptor

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
sure if that's a next-generation Raptor

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.420 
sure if that's a next-generation Raptor
or<00:00:18.770> what<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.189> does<00:00:20.369> have<00:00:20.580> BFG<00:00:21.150> tires<00:00:22.430> it

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
or what it is it does have BFG tires it

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.499 
or what it is it does have BFG tires it
does<00:00:23.820> have<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:25.099> lift<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:27.150> has<00:00:27.329> the

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509 
does have a lift on it it has the

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:33.500 
does have a lift on it it has the
current<00:00:27.900> as<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.849> current<00:00:30.300> chase<00:00:32.210> is<00:00:33.210> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
current as the current chase is the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:49.070 
current as the current chase is the
current<00:00:33.870> face<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.530> it

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.890 

so<00:00:50.080> now<00:00:50.260> I'm<00:00:50.440> in<00:00:50.470> pursuit<00:00:51.130> of<00:00:51.450> what<00:00:52.450> looks<00:00:52.780> like

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
so now I'm in pursuit of what looks like

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.040 
so now I'm in pursuit of what looks like

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
dual exhausts has a lot of computer

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:09.130 
dual exhausts has a lot of computer
equipment<00:01:02.199> on<00:01:02.680> it<00:01:03.570> and

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.620 

does<00:01:10.009> have<00:01:10.220> a<00:01:10.250> definite<00:01:10.759> lift<00:01:11.060> and<00:01:11.390> it's<00:01:11.509> a

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630
