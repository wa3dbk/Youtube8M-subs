another guitar that I really like it's
sort<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.100> unsung<00:00:29.610> hero<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.350> fenders

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.350 
sort of the unsung hero of fenders

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.820 
sort of the unsung hero of fenders
arsenal<00:00:32.010> is<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.610> duo<00:00:32.820> sonic<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.570> have<00:00:34.080> an

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
arsenal is is the duo sonic I have an

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.760 
arsenal is is the duo sonic I have an
original<00:00:35.520> one<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.660> could<00:00:36.870> be<00:00:36.990> wrong<00:00:37.170> on<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
original one and I could be wrong on the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.920 
original one and I could be wrong on the
the<00:00:38.100> actual<00:00:38.760> vintage<00:00:39.120> year<00:00:39.360> but<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.540> think<00:00:39.600> it's

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
the actual vintage year but I think it's

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.360 
the actual vintage year but I think it's
like<00:00:40.170> 1958<00:00:41.630> it's<00:00:42.630> it's<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.650> shorter<00:00:44.070> scale

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
like 1958 it's it's a shorter scale

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.270 
like 1958 it's it's a shorter scale

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
always liked that shape because it was

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.960 
always liked that shape because it was

guitars<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.670> can<00:01:17.880> bend<00:01:18.149> the<00:01:18.270> strings<00:01:18.660> like

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
guitars is you can bend the strings like

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.350 
guitars is you can bend the strings like
seven<00:01:19.770> or<00:01:19.860> eight<00:01:19.920> frets<00:01:20.460> like<00:01:20.759> it's<00:01:20.940> nothing

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
seven or eight frets like it's nothing

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.800 
seven or eight frets like it's nothing
because<00:01:21.540> it's<00:01:22.050> so<00:01:22.320> dinky<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.810> just

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
because it's so dinky and the the just

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.570 
because it's so dinky and the the just
the<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.410> string<00:01:25.649> tension<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.190> so<00:01:26.340> different

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
the the string tension is so different

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.289 
the the string tension is so different
because<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.210> scale<00:01:27.450> length<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:29.299> they

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
because of the scale length and they

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.320 
because of the scale length and they
just<00:01:30.690> have<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.140> real<00:01:31.530> great<00:01:32.520> personality

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
just have a real great personality

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.690 
just have a real great personality
that's<00:01:33.570> it's<00:01:34.140> kind<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> strat<00:01:35.250> but<00:01:35.520> not

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
that's it's kind of a strat but not

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.830 
that's it's kind of a strat but not
really<00:01:36.240> it's<00:01:36.510> just<00:01:36.630> got<00:01:36.990> its<00:01:37.110> own<00:01:37.320> thing<00:01:38.250> and

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
really it's just got its own thing and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.690 
really it's just got its own thing and
