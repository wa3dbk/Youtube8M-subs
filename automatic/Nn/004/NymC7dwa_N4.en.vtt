00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
at my Best Buy and at the time they only

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.060 
at my Best Buy and at the time they only
had<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.199> color<00:01:01.440> which<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.829> kind<00:01:02.039> of

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
had it in this color which is kind of

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.350 
had it in this color which is kind of
like<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.250> frost<00:01:03.409> clear<00:01:04.409> sort<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.430> color<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:06.150> is

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
like a frost clear sort of color this is

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.440 
like a frost clear sort of color this is
like<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> plastic<00:01:07.350> back<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.850> believe<00:01:09.299> it's

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
like a plastic back so I believe it's

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.810 
like a plastic back so I believe it's
made<00:01:09.600> out<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.869> like<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.070> polycarbonate<00:01:11.070> shell

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
made out of like a polycarbonate shell

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.940 
made out of like a polycarbonate shell
and<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.869> way<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.350> going<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.740> work

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
and the way that this is going to work

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.249 
and the way that this is going to work
is<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.220> simply<00:01:14.520> put<00:01:14.970> your<00:01:15.000> iPad<00:01:15.780> I've<00:01:15.960> got<00:01:16.140> an

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
is you simply put your iPad I've got an

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.300 
is you simply put your iPad I've got an
iPad<00:01:16.740> 3rd<00:01:17.220> generation<00:01:17.930> this<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:18.990> an<00:01:19.290> LTE<00:01:19.740> model

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
iPad 3rd generation this is an LTE model

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.370 
iPad 3rd generation this is an LTE model
and<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.119> basically<00:01:21.330> put<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.200> one

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
and you basically put it in in one

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.899 
and you basically put it in in one
corner<00:01:22.680> just<00:01:22.979> like<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.549> then<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.729> come

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
corner just like that and then you come

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.120 
corner just like that and then you come
around<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.240> these<00:01:24.360> two<00:01:24.659> corners<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.200> simply

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
around to these two corners and simply

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.670 
around to these two corners and simply
snap<00:01:26.670> them<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.180> just<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.229> that's<00:01:28.439> all

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
snap them in just like so that's all

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.010 
snap them in just like so that's all
there<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.460> one<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.570> things<00:01:30.840> that

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
there is to this one of the things that

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.660 
there is to this one of the things that
I'm<00:01:31.110> going<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.290> call<00:01:31.470> out<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.920> I've<00:01:32.070> used<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.520> lot

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
I'm going to call out is I've used a lot

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.109 
I'm going to call out is I've used a lot
of<00:01:32.729> shells<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.450> my<00:01:33.689> iPad<00:01:34.049> too<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:35.119> they

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
of shells on my iPad too and they

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.600 
of shells on my iPad too and they
typically<00:01:36.630> snap<00:01:37.200> in<00:01:37.439> all<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.130> way<00:01:38.220> around<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
typically snap in all the way around the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.600 
typically snap in all the way around the
corners<00:01:39.090> all<00:01:39.270> for<00:01:39.860> this<00:01:40.860> one<00:01:41.100> seems<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.490> little

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
corners all for this one seems a little

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.550 
corners all for this one seems a little
different<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.210> saw<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.600> laid<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.200> here

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
different and you saw I laid it in here

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.960 
different and you saw I laid it in here
and<00:01:43.710> then<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.860> really<00:01:44.100> only<00:01:44.250> snapped<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.850> two

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
and then I really only snapped in two

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.350 
and then I really only snapped in two
corners<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.070> it<00:01:47.070> snaps<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.729> right<00:01:48.000> there

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
corners and it snaps in right there

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.330 
corners and it snaps in right there
where<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.720> can<00:01:48.899> see<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.380> go<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.680> little<00:01:50.130> bit

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
where you can see it go a little bit

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.170 
where you can see it go a little bit
over<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:50.970> there<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.079> likewise<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.490> those<00:01:53.909> two

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
over and there and likewise on those two

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.090 
over and there and likewise on those two
corners<00:01:54.570> right<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.140> area<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.680> right<00:01:55.950> in

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
corners right in that area and right in

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.310 
corners right in that area and right in
that<00:01:56.250> area<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.360> don't<00:01:57.930> know<00:01:58.020> if<00:01:58.110> that's

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
that area so I don't know if that's

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.469 
that area so I don't know if that's
going<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.770> alleviate<00:01:59.250> some<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.729> stress<00:02:00.149> on

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
going to alleviate some of the stress on

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.319 
going to alleviate some of the stress on
the<00:02:00.810> corners<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.469> will<00:02:01.680> then<00:02:01.950> prevent<00:02:02.939> it

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
the corners that will then prevent it

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.480 
the corners that will then prevent it
from<00:02:03.390> cracking<00:02:03.869> over<00:02:04.530> time<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.040> shell<00:02:05.310> that

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
from cracking over time the shell that

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.119 
from cracking over time the shell that
is<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.479> we'll<00:02:06.689> see<00:02:06.930> as<00:02:07.110> time<00:02:07.380> goes<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.740> I'll<00:02:07.979> let

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
is so we'll see as time goes on I'll let

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.979 
is so we'll see as time goes on I'll let
you<00:02:08.250> guys<00:02:08.429> know<00:02:08.459> here's<00:02:09.450> what<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.720> looks<00:02:09.869> like

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
you guys know here's what it looks like

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.320 
you guys know here's what it looks like
on<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.259> back<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:11.160> again<00:02:11.489> it's<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.760> frosted

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
on the back and again it's a frosted

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.820 
on the back and again it's a frosted
clear<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:13.110> going<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.319> show

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
clear it is going to show

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.770 
clear it is going to show
little<00:02:13.980> bit<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.420> fingerprinting<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:15.660> you'll

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
little bit of fingerprinting so you'll

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.470 
little bit of fingerprinting so you'll
wipe<00:02:15.960> it<00:02:16.140> down<00:02:16.320> from<00:02:16.500> time<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:17.010> time

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
wipe it down from time to time

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.060 
wipe it down from time to time
everything<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.780> fine<00:02:18.990> I<00:02:19.020> mean<00:02:19.260> as<00:02:19.470> far<00:02:19.650> as<00:02:19.710> cut

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
everything is fine I mean as far as cut

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.680 
everything is fine I mean as far as cut
outs<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.460> can<00:02:20.490> see<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.790> big<00:02:21.000> wide<00:02:21.150> opening<00:02:21.540> for

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
then there's also a hint of some I don't

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.880 
then there's also a hint of some I don't
know<00:03:02.520> it's<00:03:02.790> like<00:03:02.850> stamp<00:03:03.630> for<00:03:04.050> manufacturing

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
know it's like stamp for manufacturing

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.440 
know it's like stamp for manufacturing
right<00:03:05.070> in<00:03:05.220> here<00:03:05.400> but<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:05.610> really<00:03:05.880> can't<00:03:06.120> see

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
right in here but you really can't see

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.720 
right in here but you really can't see
it<00:03:06.480> now<00:03:07.110> when<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.350> put<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.770> smart<00:03:08.250> cover<00:03:08.490> on

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
it now when you put the smart cover on

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.420 
it now when you put the smart cover on
this<00:03:09.320> it's<00:03:10.320> really<00:03:10.620> simple<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:11.010> attach<00:03:11.400> it

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
this it's really simple you attach it

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.449 
this it's really simple you attach it
and<00:03:12.140> this<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.290> what<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.530> looks<00:03:13.680> like<00:03:13.860> so<00:03:14.130> you

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
and this is what it looks like so you

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.390 
and this is what it looks like so you
have<00:03:14.610> a<00:03:14.640> very<00:03:14.940> small<00:03:15.270> gap<00:03:15.570> in<00:03:15.840> between<00:03:16.400> but

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
have a very small gap in between but

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.220 
have a very small gap in between but
there's<00:03:17.760> no<00:03:18.000> issues<00:03:18.330> with<00:03:18.450> folding<00:03:18.870> this<00:03:19.019> all

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
there's no issues with folding this all

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.380 
there's no issues with folding this all
the<00:03:19.350> way<00:03:19.500> back<00:03:19.709> this<00:03:20.310> is<00:03:20.459> not<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.880> magnetic

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
the way back this is not the magnetic

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.449 
the way back this is not the magnetic
version<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:21.900> this<00:03:22.019> case<00:03:22.380> so<00:03:22.769> it's<00:03:22.920> not<00:03:23.100> going

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
version of this case so it's not going

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.850 
version of this case so it's not going
to<00:03:23.640> hold<00:03:23.820> your<00:03:24.060> smart<00:03:24.390> cover<00:03:24.630> in<00:03:24.870> place<00:03:25.110> over

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
to hold your smart cover in place over

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
for the iPad 2 for what it is I'm gonna

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.780 
for the iPad 2 for what it is I'm gonna
give<00:03:56.100> it<00:03:56.130> a<00:03:56.489> three<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.030> a<00:03:57.090> half<00:03:57.300> out<00:03:57.720> of<00:03:57.780> five

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
give it a three and a half out of five

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.490 
give it a three and a half out of five
29.99<00:03:59.790> is<00:04:00.180> a<00:04:00.209> bit<00:04:00.420> expensive<00:04:00.630> but<00:04:01.080> you<00:04:01.380> know

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
29.99 is a bit expensive but you know

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.770 
29.99 is a bit expensive but you know
what<00:04:01.680> all<00:04:01.920> these<00:04:02.130> back<00:04:02.730> shields<00:04:03.239> usually<00:04:03.600> run

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
what all these back shields usually run

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.840 
what all these back shields usually run
right<00:04:04.019> around<00:04:04.140> there<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:05.370> I<00:04:05.459> think<00:04:05.519> these

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
right around there and I think these

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.310 
right around there and I think these
things<00:04:06.180> for<00:04:06.360> what<00:04:06.510> they<00:04:06.630> are<00:04:06.660> should<00:04:06.930> be<00:04:07.080> more

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
things for what they are should be more

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.830 
things for what they are should be more
around<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.680> 15<00:04:08.100> to<00:04:08.250> 20<00:04:08.550> dollar<00:04:08.730> mark<00:04:09.090> but<00:04:09.420> hey

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
around the 15 to 20 dollar mark but hey

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.390 
around the 15 to 20 dollar mark but hey
it<00:04:09.989> is<00:04:10.019> what<00:04:10.140> it<00:04:10.440> is<00:04:10.590> that's<00:04:10.920> how<00:04:11.040> much<00:04:11.190> they

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
it is what it is that's how much they

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.610 
it is what it is that's how much they
charge<00:04:11.430> so<00:04:12.030> be<00:04:12.299> it<00:04:12.450> but<00:04:13.049> if<00:04:13.170> you<00:04:13.260> are<00:04:13.380> looking

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
for a minimum level of protection that's

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.140 
for a minimum level of protection that's
not<00:04:16.380> going<00:04:16.500> to<00:04:16.590> protect<00:04:16.919> against<00:04:17.310> drops<00:04:17.580> it'll

not going to protect against drops it'll

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.180 
not going to protect against drops it'll
do<00:04:18.330> scratch<00:04:18.720> protection<00:04:19.590> but<00:04:19.769> that's<00:04:19.950> about
