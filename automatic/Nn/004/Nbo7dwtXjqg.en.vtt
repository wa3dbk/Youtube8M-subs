00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:15.219
 the ceramic slab is an excellent choice for a counter 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:19.880
 In addition to its beauty the ceramic tile resists heat 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.750
 humidity 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.009
 and the spots 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.149
 as in all slab installation projects the planning 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.460
 and the preparation of the surface are the keys to success 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:31.720
 in this demonstration 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.150
 we will teach you how to prepare a substrate 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.039
 install the support board 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:39.670
 and endorsing a kitchen counter with a joint edge between 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.530
 before starting protect the space card of damages and mortar that 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.329
 may fall 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.329
 Covering them with plastic coatings a quarter of a century 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.950
 also places a blanket on the floor 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.610
 The countertop slabs should be placed on a surface that this level 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.560
 that is solid and that is resistant to moisture 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.710
 if you endorse from the front edge the base should also be what 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.050
 thick enough to support the edge you have chosen 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.500
 the minimum requirement this to the pot three quarters of an inch with degree of 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.369
 exterior 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.990
 which is placed with one and a quarter inch screws for drywall if the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.749
 counter that based on two years already has an installed surface is better 

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.840
 remove it and start with a base 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.830
 and support board we have 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.790
 measure and cut the opening through the sink 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.100
 if you are installing a new sink 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.780
 you may come with a template 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.030
 If you are going to reuse the previous sink measure the opening after 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.160
 take away 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.750
 make sure the sink placement left enough space 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.170
 for the tap on the wall behind the counter 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.299
 also, if possible, adjust the location so that when it is 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.159
 slab cutting the slabs to the left and right of the sink 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.410
 be the same size and be balanced 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.450
 after making the cut cut an initial hole of three eighths of 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.979
 inch inside the cut 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.509
 near one of the corners and uses a saw return to remove the 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.339
 cutout 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:12.239
 to install the support board 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.419
 measure and mark the pieces passing you in the dimensions of the counter and the 

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:18.329
 splash guard 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.279
 make sure there are no junctions that cross the heights for the sink 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.949
 to cut the support board 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:29.399
 Mark the cut lines on both sides of the panel with a pencil pen 

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:31.619
 type with a carbon marker 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:36.529
 aldine still by straight with the line of the side of the panel and passes the marker 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:38.519
 of carbide several times 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.629
 happens as many times as you do not need to break the surface 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.129
 Do the same on the other side of the panel 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.229
 place the support board on a flat surface 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.229
 pressure on the side of the cutting line confirms my knees 

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:53.040
 with the other hand 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.740
 slightly raise the board as if to break it along the points 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.639
 marked 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.829
 Some types of support boards can leave a sharp edge along 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.989
 of the cutting line therefore careful to handle the cut panel 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.500
 Dry sections of the support board on top of the pla and 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:10.980
 good 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.419
 covering the surface 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:17.879
 make sure that the edges of the support board in the play book phase remain 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.839
 perfectly flush 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:24.579
 leave spaces of an eighth of an inch between adjacent panels using 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.639
 3 and a half inch separators 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:31.909
 also leaves a space of an eighth of an inch on the back of the 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.319
 counter for expansion 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.979
 using the existing clipping as a guide marks the perimeter of the opening by 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:41.979
 the sink on the bottom side of the support board 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:44.940
 if you are going to use a wide sink 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.010
 like us 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.290
 cut the pieces of the support board so that they fit around it 

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:54.689
 cut out the use of a circular saw with a blade 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:58.799
 before the dry cut and ends at the corners with the dance saw 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:02.799
 Now we are ready to install the support board 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.200
 mix the modified thin-layer mortar with latex according to the 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:09.199
 instructions in the techniques section 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:14.819
 using a square octave notched trowel 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.779
 applies a uniform layer of mortar to the playbook and rocks until grooves are obtained 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.569
 straight and vertical 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:24.949
 Place the pieces of the support board on the mortar 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.990
 remember to leave spaces in an octave detected in the unions 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.069
 uses nail dividers 16 p 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:35.770
 but do not introduce them into the plan 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.790
 also remember to leave a space of 1 cent inch in the back 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.189
 of the counter for the expansion 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:45.749
 fasten the panels with the support board screws 

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:50.139
 place them 4 inches from the center and a half inch from the edge 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.400
 all around each panel 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.840
 You may find it easier to start with the screws hitting them 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.080
 lightly with a hammer to start its production 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.530
 Insert the screws until the heads that come flush with the 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.110
 surface 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.099
 To avoid breaking a corner, keep the screws two inches from the 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:09.749
 board corners 

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:13.800
 place the stoves every six inches in both directions in the field 

00:05:13.799 --> 00:05:14.779
 sing hero 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:18.539
 Spread the mortar in the groove of the support board for the protector 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:19.790
 against splashes 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.300
 and putting in place 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.509
 leaving an eighth of an inch of space above the counter 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.940
 fastening with screws
