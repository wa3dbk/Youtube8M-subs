00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.660
 hello friends welcome to news 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.999
 amazing another day more 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.180
 Today I come to give you the news about a 

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:12.250
 discovery of a pyramid that has 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.880
 a Portuguese in the middle of the ocean 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:20.400
 Atlantic submerged the dimensions of 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.400
 this pyramid would be more or less 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.230
 I 'm not just drawing here 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:33.070
 the base would have 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.070
 about 8000 square meters 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.260
 In the height 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.630
 from the base they would be about 60 meters 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.940
 the fact of having eight thousand meters 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.340
 square at its base would mean that 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.600
 has a base like a soccer field 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.600
 Wide 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.489
 and good friends as was being discussed 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.670
 A Portuguese sailor has found this 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.310
 pyramid 60 meters high and 8000 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.070
 square meters in its base pretty much 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.480
 like a football field or maybe a little 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.520
 bigger 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.800
 This sailor named Diocletian 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.790
 Silva located the structure in the 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.160
 Azores islands 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.070
 What is a Portuguese archipelago of 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.880
 nine islands 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.800
 and it was helped with a bathymetric chart a 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.350
 procedure showing the relief of the 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.240
 seabed and provides information 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.240
 additional surface navigation 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.450
 and I ask will be this discovery 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.930
 the start of other discoveries 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.659
 that indicate that in that place is the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.350
 famous atlantida or it will simply be a 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.020
 isolated discovery of a clinic 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.930
 in the middle of the goshawks in any case 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.020
 the Portuguese Navy and the government 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.270
 Portuguese and of course the community 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.929
 clear scientific are already interested in 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.850
 the event and see what the 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.180
 following research on these 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:18.280
 pyramids that this man has found 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:22.520
 I christian iv century to see if we continue 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:26.750
 finding convincing evidence that 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.760
 that pyramid really exists and if 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.120
 someone goes down to see them then better than 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.830
 best 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.450
 thank you very much for watching another video of 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.450
 amazing news we are
