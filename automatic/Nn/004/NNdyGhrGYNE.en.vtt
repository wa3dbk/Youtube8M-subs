00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:03.380
 I am professional scored points 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.010
 and is part of the fuck you team 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.010
 didactic support in biological and health disciplines 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:13.329
 in this class will be approached a biological introduction 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.839
 what is biological 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:21.439
 biology is the science that studies life or living things 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.309
 on various aspects such as its chemical constitution 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.399
 the mechanisms that regulated their vital activities 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:32.480
 the structure of their bodies 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.670
 the biodiversity of organisms and the relationships between them and their environment 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.430
 the study of living beings is a very broad area 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.490
 and to make it more efficient and easy we can study living things in 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.780
 various levels of organization 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.330
 as their being the fundamental units living beings 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.410
 the tissues 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.410
 which is a set of stamps related to the same function 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.489
 the organs 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.489
 which is a set of tests related to the same function 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.570
 the systems 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.570
 which is a set of organs related to the same function 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.420
 the organism 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.080
 which is a set of all of us working in an integrated way to 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.900
 life maintenance 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.200
 the population 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.130
 which is a set of organisms 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.380
 of the same species living in the same place 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.210
 the community that is a set of populations that live in the same place 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.960
 the ecosystem 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.990
 who are the members of a community interacting in thesis and with the factors 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.710
 abiotic in the lookout 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.819
 and to the biosphere that the planet's peace that occurs in rhythm 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.630
 but what is life? 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.790
 eye to bake the x 1 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.650
 What is the living organism? 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.610
 the question seems well all 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.370
 the man has life 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.700
 but why 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.860
 because most of its chemical construction based on carbon elements 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.850
 and genius 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.030
 what this genius is and has a genius 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.600
 fox all fill 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.820
 which bind together to form organic compounds such as carbohydrates 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.979
 episodes of proteins and those of monkeys 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.909
 because the man 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.990
 has a body consisting of heavens 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.840
 who performs in its interior a series of actions for synthesis and degradation 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.949
 of compounds 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:20.379
 to build the structure of their skies and provide energy for a series of 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:21.919
 petares processes 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:24.919
 this set of reactions called metabolites 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:27.469
 man is constant 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.150
 because they react near 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.169
 issuing appropriate responses to each type of boy 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:35.069
 man perform and production 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.999
 transmits its executed characteristics 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:41.279
 and also in the course of time may undergo changes 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:44.279
 adapting to the environment or 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.400
 therefore a living being is defined as a highly organized chemical system 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.340
 which is maintained at the expense of gas and energy 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.560
 and that can multiply transmitting its characteristics but with 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.560
 adapting to the environment 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.489
 Living beings need a constant supply of energy to build and 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.900
 reconstruct the structure of your body and to extract energy to sustain the 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.169
 metabolites 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:15.120
 necessary to produce structures of living things and provide 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:17.709
 energy to sustain these pitarch processes 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.709
 are fed from food 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.129
 living beings are classified in two categories in such a way that 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:27.159
 get food 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:28.429
 to otoc fux 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:29.799
 and even others 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.209
 buses are producing their own food 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.209
 from simple organic substance energy 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.199
 an example of process to the point is the photosynthesis carried out by the plants 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.040
 with absorption of carbon dioxide and water 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.709
 and the use of energy on -1 from the south to produce their own food 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.899
 organic compounds such as blackout 

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:54.609
 the photosynthesis performed by some bacteria to taste and platelets 

00:03:55.779 --> 00:04:00.959
 the inmates are direct or indirect consumers of the producers 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.439
 using the organic matter accumulated in their bodies to obtain 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:08.489
 of raw material to produce its body structure in sustaining with 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.469
 metabolism energy 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:11.389
 therefore 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:15.259
 autopsies produce their own food peter others not 

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:18.799
 and feed on other living things or materials produced by them 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.840
 ends here this reading authorship on biology 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.230
 A hug to everyone
