been so many advances even in the past
few<00:01:26.009> years<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:27.360> people<00:01:28.290> are<00:01:28.950> aware<00:01:29.369> how<00:01:29.869> more

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
few years that people are aware how more

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.450 
few years that people are aware how more

especially<00:01:34.920> as<00:01:34.979> baby<00:01:35.250> boomers<00:01:35.789> I'm<00:01:36.390> really

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
especially as baby boomers I'm really

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.570 
especially as baby boomers I'm really
gonna<00:01:36.780> want<00:01:37.050> augmentation<00:01:37.830> pretty<00:01:38.039> soon<00:01:38.340> as

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
gonna want augmentation pretty soon as

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.370 
gonna want augmentation pretty soon as
we<00:01:38.729> start<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.180> decay<00:01:39.539> we're<00:01:40.080> gonna<00:01:40.200> be

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
we start to decay we're gonna be

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.270 
we start to decay we're gonna be
demanding<00:01:41.009> more<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.670> more<00:01:41.789> augmentation<00:01:43.280> I'd

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
demanding more and more augmentation I'd

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.350 
demanding more and more augmentation I'd
like<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.610> have<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> better<00:01:45.000> memory

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
like to have a better memory

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.249 
like to have a better memory
maybe<00:01:45.869> with<00:01:46.110> memory<00:01:47.039> chips<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:48.119> probably<00:01:48.929> want

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
maybe with memory chips I probably want

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.719 
maybe with memory chips I probably want
to<00:01:49.289> be<00:01:49.410> taller<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.039> could<00:01:50.190> play<00:01:50.340> for<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.610> NBA

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
to be taller so I could play for the NBA

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.930 
to be taller so I could play for the NBA
I<00:01:51.330> just<00:01:51.750> turned<00:01:51.929> 50<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.590> memory<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.640> sort

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
I just turned 50 so memory is like sort

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:04.050 
I just turned 50 so memory is like sort
of<00:01:54.030> an<00:01:54.149> issue<00:01:55.160> I'm<00:01:56.160> happy<00:01:56.460> Who<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.789> am

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.960 

but<00:02:05.060> I<00:02:05.149> actually<00:02:05.240> don't<00:02:05.540> need<00:02:05.689> anything<00:02:06.049> I

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
but I actually don't need anything I

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.630 
but I actually don't need anything I
mean<00:02:07.970> if<00:02:08.300> I<00:02:08.390> could<00:02:08.599> fly<00:02:08.869> maybe<00:02:09.229> would<00:02:09.500> be<00:02:09.649> okay

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.089

a lot of momentum behind them and so we
