00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.790
 the PlayStation 3 controller does not have official support for running backup 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.829
 so you need to download a driver to enable it 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:11.850
 currently the best option 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.120
 It is death beyond today that you find to find a way but here 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.449
 after completing the installation 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.449
 the control of playstation 3 2 know 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.489
 I was program select the option of management of entries 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.279
 then click on the option available in other 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.390
 you can also opt for a bluetooth connection 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.650
 selecting gross pairing 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.650
 that's why he was here 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.660
 open again the last day 8 make sure the dualshock 3 it is known as the 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.750
 game controller connected 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.490
 if the central lights are not fishing it was the signal that he 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.250
 is probably working 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.300
 the program lets you do and control vibration and directed to fap 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.820
 three in various ways 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.869
 alerting the directional buttons you like 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.049
 you can even undo or control the cbot 360 so that it 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.120
 works on one of them that are compatible with the mythical peripheral 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.119
 from microsoft 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.729
 already the use of the control of tops 360 is too simplistic 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.160
 You were already with what you saw. 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.070
 everything you need to do as Italo it is ready to be 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.140
 used 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.440
 who owns the wi-fi version of the cables 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.040
 have to get the largest microsoft title which is sold separately 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.659
 an important detail 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.859
 even if you have to leave box 360 tips that brings a battery 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:59.159
 rechargeable via USB cable bce will not recognize the festival as a controller 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.880
 when you connect bug runs because I was only thinking about energy and 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.160
 does not give votes 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.050
 to set up in future areas just plug the adapter into the usb port 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.390
 and wait until one of the stadiums all automatically 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:18.149
 after this, just as the executive handles the peripheral you are ready 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:21.149
 to play 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.359
 We hope to have helped per cent.
