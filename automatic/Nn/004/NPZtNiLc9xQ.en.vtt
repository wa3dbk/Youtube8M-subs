and I went on head and did what uh swaps
are<00:00:20.760> three<00:00:20.970> suggested<00:00:21.689> which<00:00:22.380> was<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.769> have

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
are three suggested which was to have

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.929 
are three suggested which was to have
the<00:00:25.019> kind<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.410> throttle<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:26.010> boats<00:00:26.310> have

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
the kind of throttle that boats have

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.980 
the kind of throttle that boats have
will<00:00:27.900> on<00:00:28.080> wards<00:00:28.560> what<00:00:28.680> have<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.869> so<00:00:30.869> we're

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
will on wards what have you so we're

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.510 
will on wards what have you so we're
going<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.230> do<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.890> reason<00:00:32.160> being<00:00:32.309> is

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
going to do that and the reason being is

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.010 
going to do that and the reason being is
because<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:33.510> one<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.809> reason<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.140> was

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
because but one of the reason it was

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.959 
because but one of the reason it was
because<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.320> thing<00:00:37.620> right<00:00:37.800> here<00:00:37.829> broke<00:00:38.250> will

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
because this thing right here broke will

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.180 
because this thing right here broke will
the<00:00:39.360> old<00:00:39.690> one<00:00:39.840> broke

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
the old one broke

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.029 
the old one broke
so<00:00:41.360> with<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:43.020> now<00:00:43.430> this<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.610> stationed

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
so with this so now this is stationed

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.290 
so with this so now this is stationed
stationary<00:00:47.039> right<00:00:47.550> here<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.620> throttle

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
stationary right here and the throttle

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.779 
stationary right here and the throttle
which<00:00:51.300> I'm<00:00:51.480> uses<00:00:51.870> right<00:00:51.989> here<00:00:52.309> now<00:00:53.309> one<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
which I'm uses right here now one of the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.750 
which I'm uses right here now one of the
reasons<00:00:54.059> why<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.239> had<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.949> was<00:00:55.949> at<00:00:56.100> first<00:00:56.309> to

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
reasons why I had it was at first to

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.029 
reasons why I had it was at first to
where<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.030> push<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.390> because<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.780> wanted<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
where you push it because I wanted the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.189 
where you push it because I wanted the
passenger<00:00:59.969> which<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.719> right<00:01:00.870> here<00:01:01.050> which

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
passenger which is right here which

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.939 
passenger which is right here which
would<00:01:01.320> be<00:01:01.379> right<00:01:01.559> here<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.399> be<00:01:02.550> able<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:03.949> adjust

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
would be right here to be able to adjust

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.990 
would be right here to be able to adjust
the<00:01:05.189> throttle<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:07.740> same<00:01:08.010> thing<00:01:08.280> if<00:01:08.760> you

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
the throttle and the same thing if you

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.530 
the throttle and the same thing if you
have<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.990> driver<00:01:10.290> over<00:01:10.619> here<00:01:11.270> to<00:01:12.270> be<00:01:12.360> doing

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
have the driver over here to be doing

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.969 
have the driver over here to be doing
the<00:01:12.630> same<00:01:12.659> thing<00:01:13.110> but<00:01:13.290> if<00:01:13.409> you're<00:01:13.530> riding<00:01:13.740> by

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
the same thing but if you're riding by

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:14.510 
the same thing but if you're riding by
yourself

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
yourself

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.999 
yourself
why<00:01:14.820> don't<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.259> still<00:01:16.259> have<00:01:16.290> access<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.890> it

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
why don't you still have access to it

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.620 
why don't you still have access to it
too<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.369> figured<00:01:17.759> well<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:17.909> just<00:01:18.090> make<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.540> in

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
too so I figured well I just make it in

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.690 
too so I figured well I just make it in
the<00:01:18.689> middle<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.020> know<00:01:19.280> one<00:01:20.280> other<00:01:20.430> thing<00:01:20.670> that

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
the middle you know one other thing that

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.090 
the middle you know one other thing that
was<00:01:21.180> made<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.990> little<00:01:22.229> panel<00:01:22.560> piece<00:01:22.920> right

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
was made this little panel piece right

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.800 
was made this little panel piece right
here<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.810> my<00:01:24.869> op<00:01:25.860> meter<00:01:26.689> never<00:01:27.689> I

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
here and this is my op meter never I

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.450 
here and this is my op meter never I
could<00:01:27.840> get<00:01:28.140> my<00:01:28.290> battery<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.890> thoughts<00:01:29.250> on

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
could get my battery is thoughts on

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.460 
could get my battery is thoughts on
their<00:01:29.579> back<00:01:29.729> here<00:01:29.970> for<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.420> electric<00:01:30.960> start

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
their back here for the electric start

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.210 
their back here for the electric start

doesn't be the only way I'm a half the
throttle<00:02:29.130> broken<00:02:29.790> down<00:02:29.910> into<00:02:30.620> four<00:02:31.620> different

where you could pull it out this way
control<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.660> manually<00:02:46.050> like<00:02:46.770> if<00:02:46.920> you're

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
control it manually like if you're

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
we're gonna call these games aside to

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.020 
we're gonna call these games aside to
cut<00:03:41.489> those<00:03:41.610> out<00:03:41.850> too<00:03:42.390> I<00:03:42.570> got<00:03:42.989> it

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
cut those out too I got it

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.470 
cut those out too I got it
and<00:03:45.030> at<00:03:45.840> first<00:03:46.050> you<00:03:46.560> know<00:03:46.980> I<00:03:47.010> wanted<00:03:47.480> through

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
and at first you know I wanted through

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.560 
and at first you know I wanted through
different<00:03:48.840> stages<00:03:49.019> -<00:03:49.800> well<00:03:51.019> -<00:03:52.459> 550<00:03:53.459> then<00:03:53.700> 100

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
different stages - well - 550 then 100

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.100 
different stages - well - 550 then 100
but<00:03:55.410> I<00:03:55.880> didn't<00:03:56.880> have<00:03:56.970> enough<00:03:57.180> clearance<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.930> do

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
but I didn't have enough clearance to do

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.410 
but I didn't have enough clearance to do
to<00:03:58.620> break<00:03:58.800> it<00:03:58.920> down<00:03:58.950> but<00:03:59.610> um<00:03:59.820> I<00:04:00.000> think<00:04:00.120> that's

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
to break it down but um I think that's

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.479 
to break it down but um I think that's
all<00:04:00.570> right<00:04:00.600> I<00:04:00.780> need<00:04:01.709> to<00:04:01.800> go<00:04:01.950> anywhere<00:04:02.280> between

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
all right I need to go anywhere between

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.220 
all right I need to go anywhere between
50<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:03.180> zero<00:04:03.660> out

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
50 and zero out

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.940 
50 and zero out
manually<00:04:04.650> do<00:04:04.800> it<00:04:05.180> be<00:04:06.180> annoying<00:04:06.390> but<00:04:06.690> just<00:04:07.680> is

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
manually do it be annoying but just is

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.800 
manually do it be annoying but just is
this<00:04:08.700> is<00:04:08.819> why<00:04:08.940> we<00:04:09.060> connect<00:04:09.299> the<00:04:09.420> throttle

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
this is why we connect the throttle

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.119 
this is why we connect the throttle
cable<00:04:09.959> somewhere<00:04:10.500> right<00:04:10.680> here

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
cable somewhere right here

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:12.860 
cable somewhere right here
you<00:04:11.640> guys<00:04:11.730> gonna<00:04:11.970> good<00:04:12.209> enough<00:04:12.420> to<00:04:12.569> show<00:04:12.810> that

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.650 
throttle cable cuz I mentioned I only
need<00:04:15.599> like<00:04:17.660> 7/8<00:04:18.660> of<00:04:18.930> an<00:04:19.079> inch<00:04:19.400> to<00:04:20.400> go<00:04:21.150> from<00:04:21.389> zero

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
need like 7/8 of an inch to go from zero

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.620 
need like 7/8 of an inch to go from zero
to<00:04:21.720> four<00:04:21.900> throttle<00:04:22.500> so<00:04:23.060> so<00:04:24.060> yeah<00:04:24.300> that's<00:04:24.510> it
