00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.040
 irene parallel because latrine 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.679
 two parallel lines 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:11.259
 angle x 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:15.879
 in terms of the angle zetas and the angle in is equal 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.199
 we already have parallels then we can 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.720
 and I have a zeta 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.140
 publish it and in this opposition they will win 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.679
 the same would go for the psoe delimiting fins 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.710
 then here we have a triangle 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.620
 with interior angle of equizeto a dior death that is 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.710
 with our own the Chamorro Peronism we know that the angle this year 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.640
 is the sum of the interior tony discarding the here do 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.220
 or marmosets the sum of x 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.440
 i are not asking then 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.850
 that we finish betis in function of the ipc then it means that we must leave 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.140
 the bank x 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.480
 they do not detect you are left remaining 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.020
 then x3 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.210
 it is said that it corresponds 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.190
 to the alternative 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.190
 another possibility of going to work 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.190
 by the first central angles until we place it in that position that 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.470
 from the starting point 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.840
 and if here we have that I have look 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.270
 we can name 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.710
 that angle that is the supplement 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.810
 left united then 180 - iquique 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.320
 counting we do not have the three members of the clan higgins c hicks 180 lying 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.220
 the sum of these three some 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.890
 Kim Jong-il 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.060
 It does not matter 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.109
 to the sum momo interest of whatever angle has 180 degrees 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.900
 here we can then simplified 180 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.620
 and how we want to determine 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.620
 at an angle x we ​​clear victims equality 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.529
 i 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:11.869
 iceta 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:14.099
 negative and obviously we arrived 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.709
 to the same result that is the alternative that
