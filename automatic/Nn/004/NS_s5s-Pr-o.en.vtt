and<00:02:27.049> do<00:02:27.230> you<00:02:27.290> think<00:02:27.319> that<00:02:27.560> surfing<00:02:28.040> has<00:02:28.189> really

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
and do you think that surfing has really

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:29.619 
and do you think that surfing has really
helped<00:02:28.760> with<00:02:28.849> their<00:02:29.000> confidence<00:02:29.390> oh

helped with their confidence oh
definitely<00:02:30.349> I<00:02:31.129> think<00:02:31.219> surfing's<00:02:32.030> just

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
definitely I think surfing's just

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.929 
definitely I think surfing's just
because<00:02:33.230> because<00:02:33.829> it's<00:02:34.040> been<00:02:34.189> dominated<00:02:34.760> by

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:34.939 
because because it's been dominated by

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:36.940 
because because it's been dominated by
meals<00:02:35.239> for<00:02:35.599> so<00:02:35.780> long<00:02:35.959> and<00:02:36.290> I<00:02:36.349> think<00:02:36.379> that<00:02:36.769> they

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
meals for so long and I think that they

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.250 
meals for so long and I think that they
you<00:02:37.400> know<00:02:37.430> because<00:02:38.000> they<00:02:38.239> can<00:02:38.540> surf<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:39.079> gives

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
you know because they can surf it gives

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.629 
you know because they can surf it gives
them<00:02:39.409> this<00:02:39.530> confidence<00:02:40.069> that<00:02:40.219> they<00:02:40.310> can<00:02:40.340> do

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:40.639 
them this confidence that they can do

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.839 
them this confidence that they can do
anything<00:02:40.849> they<00:02:41.359> set<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:41.989> line<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.609> what<00:02:43.609> is<00:02:43.730> it

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849
