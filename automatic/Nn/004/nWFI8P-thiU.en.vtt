00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:18.390
 the representatives of the energies the 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.670
 great rider from Paraguay who is 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.740
 celebrating here today in ball king which 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.009
 is the style what is the technique that 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:30.390
 it is really used in Paraguay for 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:32.669
 taming it for riding and for 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.590
 master of these examples of these 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.130
 beautiful equine enclaves but we started 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.590
 here with Mr. Juan Franco explains a 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.260
 little how is the lifestyle of the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.210
 gaucho of the Paraguayan cowboy how 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.200
 would call in Paraguay for us 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.200
 that we do not know this topic 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.910
 I'm sorry to the same man who was the Lord of 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:02.260
 three earrings to children seven branches and 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.260
 the coral rosary 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.090
 if we are going to accompany 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.080
 of party and we also use of page 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.679
 we see a differentiation between 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:24.219
 cultures for example a one posture 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:26.140
 most typical riding chair as is this 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:29.560
 that Mr. Wang has here is a 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.909
 steel horse we will see a typical chair 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.310
 however we see some 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.039
 features in this mount in this 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.140
 horse as it is called the horse of 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.390
 bamboo on the bamboo horse and the rider does not 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.880
 it's called mario cáceres mario cáceres del 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.880
 paraguay rules 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.740
 is that the wool comes out of the low sheep 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.740
 in salt 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.960
 in the rider 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:01.310
 and this that all I imagine that of the 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.310
 traditional of the Paraguayan countryside 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.600
 what is the relationship of the riders 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.240
 Paraguayans with the riders of the Pampas 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.830
 for example somehow baby me that 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:24.020
 I'm not Venezuelan I've seen some 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:24.020
 similar characteristics and now no longer 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.720
 and one of the highlights in the 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.070
 rider is always the roast that 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.070
 it also shares features 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.780
 so that when it's free time 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.780
 bending the drum 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.750
 a gallop 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.450
 so you are hs 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.430
 I already know 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.820
 what is the exhibition that is done 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.900
 usually on the frames in the 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.500
 Paraguayan fairs 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.500
 to rent 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.870
 what do you think he has prepared what is 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.940
 at least the itinerary that starts 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:35.010
 to do here the animals doing 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.010
 by the way 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.709
 and so let's do let's see the view 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.480
 carlos tocayo carlos keeps streets in 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:56.370

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.060
 particularities 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.709
 from what part of Paraguay 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:19.289
 this man from where the department is worth 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:22.830

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.220
 Spanish

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.160

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.340

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.919
 dance to dance hs

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.800
 gallop 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.189
 do not 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:06.920
 but we in Venezuela have a 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:08.810
 sport that is the national sport 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.460
 protected by the government in that 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.960
 Venezuelan that is called the pennyroyal of 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.020
 bulls that the horse is used for 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.180
 master a bit to knock down a bull in 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.770
 race is not more or less and the horse 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.600
 also found has an importance 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.920
 quite big as it is for you 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.870
 in Paraguay so thank you very much 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.150

 Thank you 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.720

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:36.949
 230 units 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:48.520

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.150
 coins 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:58.620
 and so the function follows the beat of the 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:02.580
 I win for happy notes 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.580

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.620
