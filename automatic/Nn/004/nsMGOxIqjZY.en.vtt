to the left in order to start a section

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.930 
to the left in order to start a section
of<00:00:16.410> color<00:00:16.590> later<00:00:16.859> then<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.340> started<00:00:17.760> on<00:00:17.880> a

loop on the back turning to the right is
a<00:00:22.859> little<00:00:23.220> easier<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.640> understand<00:00:24.119> it's<00:00:24.390> best

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
a little easier to understand it's best

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
that we're carrying we need the first

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.440

stitch before our next color to be

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.969 
stitch before our next color to be
regular<00:01:09.450> stitches<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.409> we're<00:01:10.530> going<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.770> count

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
regular stitches so we're going to count

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.740 
regular stitches so we're going to count
back<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.490> stop<00:01:11.760> at<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:11.939> first<00:01:12.210> regular

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
back and stop at the first regular

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.820 
back and stop at the first regular
stitch<00:01:14.900> here's<00:01:15.900> where<00:01:16.140> yellow<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.500> going<00:01:16.530> to

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
stitch here's where yellow is going to

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.149 
stitch here's where yellow is going to
begin

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
begin

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.420 
begin
so<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.299> being<00:01:18.540> regular<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.799> under<00:01:20.189> a

so this is being regular and under a
regular<00:01:21.150> under<00:01:21.930> regular<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:23.340> one<00:01:23.549> would<00:01:23.700> be

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
regular under regular this one would be

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.340 
regular under regular this one would be
under<00:01:24.150> but<00:01:24.299> we<00:01:24.390> want<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.630> start<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:24.990> regular

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
under but we want to start on a regular

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.230 
under but we want to start on a regular
stitch<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:26.130> we're<00:01:26.220> going<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.729> do<00:01:26.970> this

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
stitch so we're going to just do this

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.069 
stitch so we're going to just do this
next<00:01:27.659> stitch<00:01:29.960> so<00:01:30.960> regular<00:01:31.460> that<00:01:32.460> stitch<00:01:33.079> then

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
next stitch so regular that stitch then

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.399 
next stitch so regular that stitch then
we<00:01:34.320> do<00:01:34.470> our<00:01:34.500> twist<00:01:35.360> but<00:01:36.360> we<00:01:36.479> pick<00:01:36.780> back<00:01:37.020> up<00:01:37.079> our

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
we do our twist but we pick back up our

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.350 
we do our twist but we pick back up our
red<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:39.920> do<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> regular<00:01:41.280> stitch<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.180> that's

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
red and do a regular stitch so that's

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.660 
red and do a regular stitch so that's
our<00:01:42.509> first<00:01:42.810> regular<00:01:43.170> stitch<00:01:43.740> tacking<00:01:44.520> that

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
don't put in another twist so that's

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.119 
don't put in another twist so that's
just<00:02:28.930> gonna<00:02:29.109> cause<00:02:29.200> tangles<00:02:29.769> you<00:02:29.859> don't<00:02:30.010> need

and we continue with our yellow turning

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.160 
and we continue with our yellow turning
to<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.730> left<00:02:42.909> means<00:02:43.239> thinking<00:02:43.689> ahead<00:02:43.989> we

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
to the left means thinking ahead we

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.500 
to the left means thinking ahead we
already<00:02:44.530> need<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.799> start<00:02:45.099> carrying<00:02:45.430> this<00:02:46.180> red

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
already need to start carrying this red

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.660 
already need to start carrying this red
yarn<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.739> left<00:02:48.010> because<00:02:48.189> it's<00:02:48.430> going<00:02:48.609> to

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
yarn to the left because it's going to

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.009 
yarn to the left because it's going to
start<00:02:48.849> here<00:02:48.939> so<00:02:49.299> I<00:02:49.359> have<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.540> think<00:02:49.720> about<00:02:49.810> it

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
start here so I have to think about it

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.229 
start here so I have to think about it
way<00:02:50.139> over<00:02:50.170> here<00:02:50.639> which<00:02:51.639> is<00:02:51.670> part<00:02:52.030> of<00:02:52.150> what

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
way over here which is part of what

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.009 
way over here which is part of what
makes<00:02:52.450> this<00:02:52.599> difficult<00:02:54.389> so<00:02:55.389> this<00:02:55.659> is<00:02:55.810> going<00:02:55.959> to

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
makes this difficult so this is going to

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.409 
makes this difficult so this is going to
be<00:02:56.079> red<00:02:56.319> and<00:02:57.220> regular<00:02:59.069> under<00:03:00.069> regular<00:03:00.879> under

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:01.419 
be red and regular under regular under

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.030 
be red and regular under regular under
regular<00:03:02.139> so<00:03:02.349> this<00:03:02.500> one's<00:03:02.680> going<00:03:02.859> to<00:03:02.919> be<00:03:02.980> a

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
regular so this one's going to be a

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.190 
regular so this one's going to be a
regular<00:03:03.340> stitch<00:03:03.579> shall<00:03:03.760> we<00:03:03.819> go<00:03:03.939> ahead<00:03:04.060> do<00:03:05.049> our

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
regular stitch shall we go ahead do our

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:14.819 
regular stitch shall we go ahead do our
twist<00:03:06.120> pick<00:03:07.120> back<00:03:07.299> up<00:03:07.359> the<00:03:07.689> yellow<00:03:13.799> make<00:03:14.799> a
