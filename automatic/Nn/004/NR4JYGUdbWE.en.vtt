these animals are clearly gliding and
they're<00:02:29.319> and<00:02:29.560> they're<00:02:29.680> actually<00:02:29.829> doing

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
they're and they're actually doing

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.910 
they're and they're actually doing
better<00:02:30.519> than<00:02:30.760> than<00:02:31.659> just<00:02:31.719> a<00:02:32.019> regular<00:02:32.439> glide

they're<00:02:33.189> actually<00:02:33.549> getting<00:02:33.790> some<00:02:34.000> pretty

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
they're actually getting some pretty

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.330 
they're actually getting some pretty
good<00:02:34.269> distance<00:02:34.829> so<00:02:35.829> I<00:02:35.859> would<00:02:36.129> say<00:02:36.310> that

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
good distance so I would say that

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.110 
good distance so I would say that
they've<00:02:36.670> done<00:02:36.849> remarkably<00:02:37.450> well<00:02:39.000> they<00:02:40.000> have

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
they've done remarkably well they have

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.449 
they've done remarkably well they have
complete<00:02:40.599> control<00:02:40.780> they<00:02:41.680> can<00:02:41.889> turn<00:02:42.099> they<00:02:42.400> can

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
complete control they can turn they can

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.569 
complete control they can turn they can
even<00:02:42.700> pull<00:02:42.909> 180<00:02:43.450> degrees<00:02:43.930> they<00:02:44.829> can<00:02:45.040> take<00:02:45.400> off

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
even pull 180 degrees they can take off

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.399 
even pull 180 degrees they can take off
in<00:02:45.760> one<00:02:45.939> direction<00:02:45.969> and<00:02:46.510> land<00:02:46.810> in<00:02:47.079> the

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
in one direction and land in the

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:48.750 
in one direction and land in the
opposite<00:02:47.859> direction

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
opposite direction

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.700 
opposite direction
they're<00:02:49.150> pretty<00:02:49.359> spectacular

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.770
