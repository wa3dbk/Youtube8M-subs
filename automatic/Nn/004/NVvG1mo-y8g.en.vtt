00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.990
 hello everyone with dos 13 today 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.150
 before you is a new video on replay from 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.130
 my clan members want in advance 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.519
 apologize for the fact that I have nasal 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.180
 voice in general 8 says that I always 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.930
 video 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.400
 nasal voice but now I catch a cold 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.700
 but even so for your sake anyway 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.860
 I record this video unless of course you 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.450
 I like to look more accurately, not even 100 pieces 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.399
 and watch and listen to me like that 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.260
 close the video well, and the rest I 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.820
 I want to wish you more health now 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.890
 autumn 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.160
 dress as warm as possible 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.570
 year save also when from 13 so today 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.370
 we replay it from Maive ie Player 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.539
 from my clan name of his vital it 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.390
 playing on mxr 445 card shot hit in 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.640
 principle in a good team as in 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.979
 top first now i ride on 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.680
 and all the second, too, I get very often in 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.110
 top and know somehow a lot of sevens 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.680
 divorced on the server that is what is not 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.150
 the battle is 15 by 15 alone sevens of course 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.100
 it happens that you get to the eight 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.560
 nine never even hit 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.020
 my and here but in any case seven 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.240
 divorced very very much but in general 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.009
 certainly not such an ideal team so 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.430
 like an enemy and we have art 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.369
 it already says something but since 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.130
 Only one card is not a fact that it is 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.259
 will precisely shoot at us here 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.970
 vitali gently pulls up on this one 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.770
 standard mound 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.780
 for the first shooting remember 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.659
 surely here often pass the same 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.060
 to the city, well, and while they drive through here 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.939
 no matter how often you look at 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.369
 Vitali uses it to shoot him and 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.219
 already filled 1500 kind however saw only 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.340
 that fell from the shoulders next to the art does not sleep 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:03.869
 Generally mxm 445 donatiki such cardboard 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:08.399
 tank if it hits him straight from the art 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.440
 ogrebet from google how much of course 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.180
 it's a tank pumped I did not 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.220
 pass it for free experience when 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.069
 rocked to amx 50b 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.040
 generally know the tank 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.400
 quite good that is, it is well balanced 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.159
 icons and you do not bend and at the same time 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.170
 does not remain worse than others, that is, in general 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.939
 I had the impression of him 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.719
 rather positive and with what 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:34.159
 negative I don’t know how they saw but 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:34.549
 if he started swinging then rather 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.950
 Total 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:41.049
 and they liked them too, well, or at least 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:45.469
 would he treat him with patience 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:47.650
 score 45 little by little 46 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:50.389
 becomes ie allies as always 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.129
 are gradually being given well by the vital now 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:56.750
 will drag carry on the standard of the genre 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.730
 again see the city broke through but 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.769
 retreat far away and you can 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.510
 take advantage of disguise somehow 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.250
 stand first behind the bushes enlighten 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.650
 enemies who come up but only later 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.939
 perform any actions at all yet 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.419
 there are a lot of allies here 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:13.189
 will be able to cover us therefore this is 2 more 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:17.500
 the second reason is that 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:19.849
 does not go far worth 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.269
 For some time, of course, Vitali waited 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.859
 but I, too, are so so in character that 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.769
 I don't want to wait for very long, of course 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:29.349
 if it is very much needed to win 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.939
 then I am waiting 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.659
 somehow very much a competent game and but in 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:38.829
 In general, too, I am going forward to merge 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:42.680
 posing well and the like here but 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:44.209
 once he got distracted by t29 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.639
 of course now he is likely 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.189
 looks here and the second time to get out already 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:50.989
 not worth it but it goes to the right to the third 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:53.540
 which is not particularly good overview though 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:57.560
 a distance of 300 meters we should 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:00.229
 highlight the way the gun at the amx m4 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.439
 45 fine i think i really like 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:06.139
 its penetrability is 212 units and here it is again 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:09.019
 now I ride IS-7 well though 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:12.319
 find penetration is enough in 175 millimeters 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:15.409
 since let's say you are from 6 to the eighth 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:18.920
 level i have the same weapon soon you 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:21.290
 waiting for the video on isu second 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.650
 a little spoiler and wait already masters 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.150
 but got honestly the fight that 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.410
 I think how master something special not 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:32.150
 different ordinary normal fight at the very 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.520
 so I’ll wait to play something 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.070
 really worth it and probably will 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.720
 as always a full review here 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.910
 meanwhile let's go back to the fight all 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.540
 okay the score is 910 a little bit certainly not 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.760
 our favor 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:48.890
 however, the enemy’s art has already been slain on the sly. 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.030
 merges the enemies we see on the minimap 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.420
 that t-43 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.460
 and there are some more medium tanks 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.930
 break through the bottom probably not right now 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.150
 stand on the capture must try 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.680
 quicker 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.570
 dismantle the enemies that are in the city 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.730
 who somehow stand by and then 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.040
 go back to base to shoot down 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.840
 Capturing here such situations when you 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.530
 find yourself when you need to 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:15.110
 seems to be back and seemingly here yet 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.850
 Enemies remained sure to try 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.590
 kill all enemies first because 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.750
 sooner or later they can come and 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.850
 call us to the rear that is you and shoot down 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.710
 capture really can not well, of course 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.230
 you don't shoot anything here 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.430
 meanwhile, vitalia notices all this 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.690
 of course beautiful 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:35.690
 in general, the player is pretty literate 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:39.400
 Well, it remains to kill the panther of course 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:42.260
 also remains i said too loud 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:46.040
 since we only have 500 hp 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:49.820
 very neatly do it all the more 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:52.040
 if now you can not knock there 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.270
 capture by the way is very strange that the enemies 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.810
 do not get on capture ok here 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:59.510
 our capture is just beginning 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.850
 bases need this something they long thought 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.080
 I would be there 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:06.200
 panther there who else they stayed 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.570
 panther m10 it and t-43 would just stand 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.630
 on capture hid somehow behind the house of 2 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:13.280
 quite possibly they would have managed to capture 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.470
 the base because I had a lot 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.970
 plums when of course I had time 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.010
 come back but due to the fact that here 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.390
 we still have to drive down 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.250
 almost close 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.320
 very much put and still bring down 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.570
 That's it in such situations, I often 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.730
 merged but everything is much better then 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.300
 there is something to sacrifice is not worth it 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:34.190
 can be neat 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:38.129
 shoot remains 337 sq. already 162 and 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:39.840
 Of course you should not be substituted fight immediately 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:42.150
 can be seen in the results of good 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:47.669
 inflicted before I can of course some 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:50.190
 there are no special achivok but without our contribution 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:50.750
 Tank in this battle can be victory then 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.509
 it was not 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:56.870
 it remains to move out to take t-43 and in general 

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:59.280
 the battle is over here 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:03.060
 agony this is probably still one 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:06.840
 a shot that's all special to shoot something and 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.310
 will not succeed let's quietly 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.750
 watch now on your screens 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.419
 will be the outcome of this fight 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:14.219
 well and you had gas 13 friends in no way 

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:15.960
 case do not get sick as I said 

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:17.400
 put your finger up under this video and 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.199
