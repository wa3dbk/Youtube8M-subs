it's<00:01:02.520> only<00:01:02.640> necessary<00:01:02.850> for<00:01:03.510> bucket<00:01:03.840> servers

it's only necessary for bucket servers

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.070 
it's only necessary for bucket servers
but<00:01:05.010> if<00:01:05.939> you're<00:01:06.240> having<00:01:06.390> issues<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.810> it

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
but if you're having issues with it

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.980 
but if you're having issues with it
running<00:01:07.670> then<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.820> need<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.180> or<00:01:09.420> if<00:01:09.869> you're

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
running then you need that or if you're

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.190 
running then you need that or if you're
having<00:01:10.170> issues<00:01:10.260> with<00:01:10.439> mod<00:01:11.630> compatibility<00:01:12.630> you

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
having issues with mod compatibility you

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.649 
having issues with mod compatibility you
need<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.590> anyway<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:14.700> install<00:01:15.240> your<00:01:15.330> server

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
need that anyway so install your server

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.850 
need that anyway so install your server
you<00:01:15.810> just<00:01:16.020> kind<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.170> write<00:01:16.350> install<00:01:16.650> server

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
you just kind of write install server

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.020 
you just kind of write install server
and<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.220> going<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> accomplish<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.790> red

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
and it's going to accomplish this red

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.030 
and it's going to accomplish this red
thing<00:01:18.060> all<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.810> gotta<00:01:18.960> do<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.380> hit<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.860> three

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
thing all you gotta do is hit the three

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.399 
thing all you gotta do is hit the three
dots<00:01:20.159> go<00:01:20.909> into<00:01:21.030> your<00:01:21.150> desktop<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.810> find<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
dots go into your desktop and find the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.469 
dots go into your desktop and find the
server<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.460> you've<00:01:23.610> made<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.970> then

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
server you that you've made and then

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.510 
server you that you've made and then
you're<00:01:24.630> going<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.780> open<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.259> there<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:26.369> then

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
you're going to open in there and then

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.010 
you're going to open in there and then
you're<00:01:26.790> not<00:01:26.850> opening<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.450> click<00:01:27.570> open<00:01:27.720> and

you're not opening and click open and

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.080 
you're not opening and click open and

then click OK install server it's

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.219 
then click OK install server it's
usually<00:01:30.390> doesn't<00:01:30.600> take<00:01:30.630> any<00:01:30.840> more<00:01:31.020> than<00:01:31.200> a

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
usually doesn't take any more than a

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.410 
usually doesn't take any more than a
minute<00:01:31.500> it'll<00:01:32.430> gets<00:01:32.579> like<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.850> first<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.240> a

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
minute it'll gets like the first like a

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.539 
minute it'll gets like the first like a
little<00:01:34.259> bit<00:01:34.439> I'm<00:01:34.979> usually<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.310> little<00:01:35.460> bit

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
little bit I'm usually a little bit

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.499 
little bit I'm usually a little bit
further<00:01:35.729> than<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:35.970> then<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.270> was<00:01:36.390> go

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
further than that and then it was go

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.749 
further than that and then it was go
full<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:37.170> should<00:01:37.320> finish<00:01:37.530> I'm<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.490> pretty

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
full you should finish I'm a pretty

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.710 
full you should finish I'm a pretty
decent<00:01:39.329> computer<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.200> hopefully<00:01:41.450> it<00:01:42.450> wouldn't

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
decent computer so hopefully it wouldn't
