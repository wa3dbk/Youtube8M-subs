00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.300
 return 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.690
 a newspaper that today takes us to a tree house perched on a tree 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.290
 it is in the French ardennes about 35 kilometers from 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.509
 Charleville-mezieres 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.710
 getaway in the heart of nature with its lines are 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.500
 the time is still a little hesitant 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.830
 but going to the top we see his childhood dream is a happiness that is 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.060
 deserved 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.289
 michel and daniel come from the Lille region for these townsmen no need to 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.760
 run to the end of the world to feel disoriented just open indoor 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.270
 and stretch your ear 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.510
 according to them it is the change of scenery is the nature is the case now are 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.250
 so much to watch 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.500
 our company is great 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.650
 a woman 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.690
 no one around no proximity 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.510
 ask for more 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.570
 for a smooth break the appetizer is delivered at the end of a 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.229
 rope 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:59.229
 to taste at 16 meters high the nose in the leaves 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.340
 we could not clear the cost for parents 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.920
 with comfort 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.980
 despite these little touches in the cabins comfort is minimal Monday 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.649
 dry toilets so as not to descend to earth 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.010
 and open windows on civilians and civics 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.810
 it reminds us of a record in the world of childhood 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.810
 the account but on this side of the world 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.200
 it's time to see the darkness 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.340
 and also his witness the French are more than calm 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.229
 a lot of calm of nature 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:31.340
 we do not understand 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.080
 if no problem to gurgle you have all the woes of nature what 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.850
 you destroy 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.340
 consequence of this decision 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.350
 they are perched at 8 13 and 16 meters nestled in the heart of oaks 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.509
 centenarians at the edge of forest views of the countryside 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.040
 the hut allows to abandon his habits for a night or two 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.210
 they come to get 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.630
 retirement is a place that is% if it's 100% benchmarks are the benchmarks 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.440
 usual 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.869
 so there is no water or electricity in the huts 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.700
 so suddenly we are in direct contact with the rest of the 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.099
 nation in the lineup have sided with not even curtain for 4% e of 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.319
 700 curtain but waking up directly by a 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.689
 by the sun 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:17.109
 the search for authenticity ecological awareness or fashion effect 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:19.029
 no matter what motivations 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:22.959
 for two years the formula seduces if we learn things a little more autonomous 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.589
 you should not even quote here could not just disastrous 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:27.790
 for economic reasons 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.839
 in fact that's fine what other more urgent issues 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:33.919
 the experience is apparently a good memory to all those who try it 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:38.489
 to get off the beaten track it will cost you at least 80 5 euros the nest 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.729
 for two the price of a parenthesis in the daily
