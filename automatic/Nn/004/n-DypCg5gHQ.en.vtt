after that I did 315 first single felt

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.110 
after that I did 315 first single felt
pretty<00:02:27.959> good<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:28.440> I'm<00:02:28.560> up<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.829> 3<00:02:29.069> 35<00:02:29.790> for<00:02:30.090> a

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
pretty good so I'm up to 3 35 for a

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.270 
pretty good so I'm up to 3 35 for a
single<00:02:30.540> which<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.410> also<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.800> heaviest<00:02:32.040> I've

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
single which is also the heaviest I've

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.430 
single which is also the heaviest I've
benched<00:02:33.120> this<00:02:33.330> offseason

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
benched this offseason

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.680 
benched this offseason
with<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.560> slight<00:02:34.860> pause<00:02:35.330> so<00:02:36.330> I'm<00:02:36.420> thinking

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
with a slight pause so I'm thinking

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.110 
with a slight pause so I'm thinking
fresh<00:02:37.020> I<00:02:37.230> could<00:02:37.380> probably<00:02:37.590> hit<00:02:37.740> 345<00:02:38.520> if<00:02:39.000> I

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
fresh I could probably hit 345 if I

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.940 
fresh I could probably hit 345 if I
didn't<00:02:39.360> do<00:02:39.450> 300<00:02:39.870> for<00:02:39.960> five<00:02:40.110> reps<00:02:40.350> prior<00:02:40.740> to

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
didn't do 300 for five reps prior to

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.360 
didn't do 300 for five reps prior to
this<00:02:41.120> so<00:02:42.120> I'm<00:02:42.300> thinking<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.960> should<00:02:43.220> maybe<00:02:44.220> a

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
this so I'm thinking I should maybe a

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.420 
this so I'm thinking I should maybe a
temp<00:02:44.670> 350<00:02:45.120> pause<00:02:45.540> in<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.020> near<00:02:46.860> future<00:02:46.890> maybe

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
temp 350 pause in the near future maybe

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.430 
temp 350 pause in the near future maybe
in<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.700> month<00:02:47.880> or<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.210> when<00:02:48.420> i<00:02:48.480> head<00:02:48.630> around<00:02:48.810> 220
