smell each bottle you get they're two

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.190 
smell each bottle you get they're two
milliliters<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.969> product<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.960> that's

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
milliliters of a product and that's

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.770 
milliliters of a product and that's
roughly<00:00:49.800> about<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.399> same<00:00:50.670> as<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> foundation

this<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.260> 30<00:00:52.469> milliliters<00:00:52.829> -<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.850> it's<00:00:54.030> a

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
this is 30 milliliters - so it's a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.470 
this is 30 milliliters - so it's a
pretty<00:00:54.300> good<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.289> convenient<00:00:56.100> size<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:57.120> how<00:00:57.449> I

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
pretty good and convenient size so how I

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.650 
pretty good and convenient size so how I
use<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.500> pump<00:00:59.250> one<00:00:59.520> pump<00:00:59.879> onto<00:01:00.120> my<00:01:00.390> hand

using<00:01:01.559> my<00:01:01.920> two<00:01:01.980> fingers<00:01:02.430> dot<00:01:03.149> five<00:01:03.420> dots<00:01:03.719> so

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
using my two fingers dot five dots so

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.190 
using my two fingers dot five dots so
forehead<00:01:05.129> nose<00:01:05.489> chin<00:01:05.519> one<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.420> each<00:01:06.600> cheek<00:01:06.630> and

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
forehead nose chin one on each cheek and

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.640 
forehead nose chin one on each cheek and
then<00:01:07.409> I'll<00:01:07.560> show<00:01:07.890> rub<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.880> with<00:01:09.150> my<00:01:09.930> fingers

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
so obviously you can use a brush but

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.710 
so obviously you can use a brush but
then<00:01:13.650> product<00:01:14.430> goes<00:01:14.640> onto<00:01:14.820> your<00:01:15.060> brush<00:01:15.299> and

sort<00:03:32.980> of<00:03:33.069> gives<00:03:33.340> me<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.579> nice<00:03:33.970> hydrating<00:03:34.660> base

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
sort of gives me a nice hydrating base

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.680 
sort of gives me a nice hydrating base
so<00:03:35.410> on<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.829> superdrug<00:03:36.370> website<00:03:36.849> this<00:03:37.150> retails

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
so on the superdrug website this retails

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.559 
so on the superdrug website this retails
for<00:03:37.840> over<00:03:38.290> twelve<00:03:38.799> pounds<00:03:39.400> I<00:03:39.519> think<00:03:40.120> that<00:03:40.359> is

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
for over twelve pounds I think that is

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.589 
for over twelve pounds I think that is
pretty<00:03:41.109> expensive<00:03:41.530> for<00:03:41.889> a<00:03:42.129> primer

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
pretty expensive for a primer

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.059 
pretty expensive for a primer
considering<00:03:43.599> a<00:03:43.780> foundation<00:03:44.290> like<00:03:44.470> this<00:03:44.500> cost

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
considering a foundation like this cost

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.030 
considering a foundation like this cost
about<00:03:45.400> seven<00:03:46.359> eight<00:03:46.599> pounds<00:03:47.109> so<00:03:47.379> honestly<00:03:48.010> I

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
about seven eight pounds so honestly I

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.309 
about seven eight pounds so honestly I
probably<00:03:48.549> won't<00:03:49.000> purchase<00:03:49.510> this<00:03:49.629> again<00:03:49.989> as<00:03:50.260> I

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
probably won't purchase this again as I

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.379 
probably won't purchase this again as I
don't<00:03:50.949> feel<00:03:51.250> it's<00:03:51.489> a<00:03:51.669> must

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
don't feel it's a must

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:55.140 
don't feel it's a must
need<00:03:52.599> product<00:03:53.169> and<00:03:53.500> I<00:03:53.829> don't<00:03:53.889> use<00:03:54.430> this<00:03:54.609> every

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
need product and I don't use this every

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.050 
need product and I don't use this every
day<00:03:55.180> I<00:03:55.660> rarely<00:03:56.379> use<00:03:56.560> it<00:03:56.919> I<00:03:56.949> use<00:03:57.250> it<00:03:57.400> on<00:03:57.430> very

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
day I rarely use it I use it on very

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.479 
day I rarely use it I use it on very
special<00:03:58.359> occasions<00:03:58.629> and<00:03:59.290> I<00:03:59.739> just<00:04:00.069> like<00:04:00.280> the

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
special occasions and I just like the

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.059 
special occasions and I just like the
way<00:04:00.609> it<00:04:00.730> feels<00:04:00.970> on<00:04:01.269> my<00:04:01.299> skin<00:04:01.419> it's<00:04:02.230> not<00:04:02.560> because

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
way it feels on my skin it's not because

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:04.979 
way it feels on my skin it's not because
I<00:04:03.310> think<00:04:03.430> it<00:04:03.790> will<00:04:03.879> help<00:04:04.120> my<00:04:04.389> makeup<00:04:04.720> stay

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
I think it will help my makeup stay

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.110 
I think it will help my makeup stay
longer<00:04:05.290> or<00:04:05.680> anything<00:04:06.160> so<00:04:06.519> that's<00:04:06.730> a<00:04:06.970> little

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
longer or anything so that's a little

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.420 
longer or anything so that's a little
bit<00:04:07.269> of<00:04:07.419> downside<00:04:08.049> on<00:04:08.290> that<00:04:08.470> there<00:04:09.099> are<00:04:09.220> many

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
bit of downside on that there are many

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.809 
bit of downside on that there are many
primers<00:04:10.239> out<00:04:10.389> there<00:04:10.840> but<00:04:11.440> I<00:04:11.650> have<00:04:11.739> not<00:04:12.400> tried

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
primers out there but I have not tried

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.300 
primers out there but I have not tried
anything<00:04:13.269> else<00:04:13.629> other<00:04:13.959> than<00:04:14.290> just<00:04:14.560> using

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
anything else other than just using

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.550 
anything else other than just using
moisturizer<00:04:15.630> now<00:04:16.630> that<00:04:16.840> I've<00:04:16.959> tried<00:04:17.289> this

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
moisturizer now that I've tried this

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.759 
moisturizer now that I've tried this
which<00:04:18.039> is<00:04:18.280> apparently<00:04:18.760> a<00:04:19.090> close<00:04:19.900> second<00:04:20.530> to

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
which is apparently a close second to

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.190 
which is apparently a close second to
the<00:04:21.280> Lynette<00:04:21.640> primer<00:04:22.090> so<00:04:22.599> I've<00:04:22.690> heard<00:04:22.930> I

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
the Lynette primer so I've heard I

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.530 
the Lynette primer so I've heard I
probably<00:04:23.620> won't<00:04:24.130> be<00:04:24.490> trying<00:04:24.820> out

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
probably won't be trying out

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.480 
probably won't be trying out
of<00:04:25.660> makeup<00:04:26.020> Primus<00:04:26.470> because<00:04:26.860> I<00:04:26.890> just<00:04:27.280> don't

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
of makeup Primus because I just don't

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.090 
of makeup Primus because I just don't
use<00:04:27.880> this<00:04:28.150> one<00:04:28.390> so<00:04:28.870> this<00:04:29.050> is<00:04:29.230> not<00:04:29.470> a<00:04:29.710> must-have

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
use this one so this is not a must-have

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.550 
use this one so this is not a must-have
product<00:04:30.520> for<00:04:30.700> me<00:04:30.850> but<00:04:31.420> this<00:04:31.570> is<00:04:31.690> my<00:04:31.870> opinion

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
product for me but this is my opinion

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
have quite dry skin I think this would
