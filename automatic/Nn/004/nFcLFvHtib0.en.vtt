you if you don't fight him skip jumping
that's<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:46.630> begin<00:01:46.869> of<00:01:46.900> the<00:01:46.990> game<00:01:47.200> though<00:01:47.470> many

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
that's the begin of the game though many

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.859 
that's the begin of the game though many
combos<00:01:48.070> just<00:01:48.850> come<00:01:49.330> to<00:01:49.390> do<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:49.570> same<00:01:49.690> thing

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
combos just come to do the same thing

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:58.800

over<00:01:49.960> and<00:01:50.080> over<00:01:50.200> again<00:01:55.710> yeah<00:01:56.710> I<00:01:57.330> think<00:01:58.330> it<00:01:58.540> when

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
over and over again yeah I think it when

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.749 
over and over again yeah I think it when
it<00:01:58.899> gets<00:01:58.930> to<00:01:59.080> like<00:01:59.229> five<00:01:59.440> percent<00:01:59.830> he<00:02:00.399> gets<00:02:00.640> you

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
it gets to like five percent he gets you

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.430 
it gets to like five percent he gets you
like<00:02:01.320> because<00:02:02.320> some<00:02:02.490> stage<00:02:03.490> free<00:02:03.909> it<00:02:04.210> does

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
like because some stage free it does

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.830 
like because some stage free it does
little<00:02:05.440> thing<00:02:05.680> he<00:02:05.830> does<00:02:05.979> here<00:02:06.570> he<00:02:07.570> does<00:02:07.690> it

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840
