 computer he and without internet everywhere 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.189

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.370
 take 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:46.160
 how to log a friend to your server via 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.260
 hamachi give him he should go shorter 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.510
 join the network enter the existing 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.720
 network here's my network let's say everything to me 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:58.630
 as a friend creates a network I give him my own and 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:03.440
 drink and 25 208 100 at the end just write: 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:05.150
 2620 port but see now I'll show you coffee 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.310
 there must be such an api I give him 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.530
 let's say and my friend can go on 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.600
 server like me 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.030
 how to open the port and to play well with 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.519
 friend through port this 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.160
 easy i will add a link to the description there 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.720
 watch my videos as I discovered myself 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.850
 ports 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.080
 you can open not necessarily not 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.840
 necessarily need the same model 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.180
 router like me you can open 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.360
 go in general on anything on any 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.120
 on any router model you can open 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.310
 that's like it all said wipe 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.410
 because local connection as on 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.910
 local network play through the computer and 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.550
 there is also through hamachi 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:47.180
 and here is my live channel on it if that 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.250
 will be prescribed stop but 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.740
 server trampoline principle you can play 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.960
 craftbukkit server is created similarly 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.900
 just download craftbukkit yourself and 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.120
 create but think video lesson was helpful 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.080
 good luck to you and see you soon 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.080
