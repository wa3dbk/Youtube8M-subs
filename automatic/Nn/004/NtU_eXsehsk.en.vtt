solar flare the large cme you're up from

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.349 
solar flare the large cme you're up from
the<00:00:14.160> Sun<00:00:14.630> now<00:00:15.630> in<00:00:15.960> x<00:00:16.470> 1.2<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:18.210> all<00:00:18.330> that

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
the Sun now in x 1.2 is it all that

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.640 
the Sun now in x 1.2 is it all that
massive<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.199> terms<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.650> X<00:00:19.949> flares<00:00:20.310> but<00:00:20.990> it<00:00:21.990> has

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
massive on terms of X flares but it has

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.640 
massive on terms of X flares but it has
a<00:00:22.680> large<00:00:23.430> cme<00:00:24.240> which<00:00:24.960> i'll<00:00:25.140> show<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.380> here<00:00:25.590> in

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
a large cme which i'll show you here in

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.970 
a large cme which i'll show you here in
a<00:00:25.740> second<00:00:26.160> but<00:00:26.820> it's<00:00:27.810> facing<00:00:28.349> right<00:00:28.619> at<00:00:28.800> earth

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
a second but it's facing right at earth

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.099 
a second but it's facing right at earth
it's<00:00:29.880> like<00:00:29.970> looking<00:00:30.330> right<00:00:30.599> down<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.840> barrel

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
it's like looking right down the barrel

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.740 
it's like looking right down the barrel
of<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.410> gun<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.949> they're<00:00:32.210> saying<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.540> due

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
of a gun and they're saying this is due

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.180 
of a gun and they're saying this is due
from<00:00:34.079> interaction<00:00:34.770> between<00:00:36.260> 1943<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.410> 1944

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
from interaction between 1943 and 1944

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.770 
from interaction between 1943 and 1944
as<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.370> can<00:00:41.460> see<00:00:41.730> right<00:00:42.350> here<00:00:43.350> x<00:00:43.730> 1.2<00:00:44.780> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
as you can see right here x 1.2 the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.090 
as you can see right here x 1.2 the
latest<00:00:46.170> flare<00:00:48.800> look<00:00:49.800> at<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.010> latest<00:00:50.190> updates

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
latest flare look at the latest updates

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.889 
latest flare look at the latest updates
and<00:00:53.539> they<00:00:54.539> say<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.170> x<00:00:55.410> 1.2<00:00:55.980> was<00:00:56.129> detected

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
and they say that the x 1.2 was detected

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:03.039 
and they say that the x 1.2 was detected
at<00:00:57.899> around<00:00:58.340> 1830<00:00:59.340> UTC<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:01.160> that<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.489> erupted

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
at around 1830 UTC and that it erupted

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.880 
at around 1830 UTC and that it erupted
from<00:01:04.049> interaction<00:01:04.769> between<00:01:05.129> 1943<00:01:06.000> 1944<00:01:06.890> so

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
from interaction between 1943 1944 so

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.609 
from interaction between 1943 1944 so
and<00:01:08.610> yes<00:01:09.150> there<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.930> coronal<00:01:10.439> mass<00:01:10.470> ejection

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
and yes there is a coronal mass ejection

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.530 
and yes there is a coronal mass ejection
that<00:01:11.460> came<00:01:11.640> from<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:12.560> it's<00:01:13.560> right<00:01:14.070> here<00:01:14.540> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
that came from this it's right here the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.690 
that came from this it's right here the
CM<00:01:15.900> e<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.170> was<00:01:16.290> let<00:01:16.470> loose<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.549> all

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
CM e that was let loose and that is all

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.300 
CM e that was let loose and that is all
directed<00:01:18.299> toward<00:01:18.659> Earth<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.710> right<00:01:20.280> now

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
directed toward Earth so right now

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.789 
directed toward Earth so right now
January<00:01:21.270> seventh<00:01:21.720> we<00:01:21.869> were<00:01:21.990> expecting<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.680> get

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
January seventh we were expecting to get

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.620 
January seventh we were expecting to get
hit<00:01:23.100> by<00:01:23.729> an<00:01:23.850> incoming<00:01:24.409> wave<00:01:25.409> as<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.799> was<00:01:26.630> this

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
hit by an incoming wave as it was this

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.700 
hit by an incoming wave as it was this
will<00:01:28.110> definitely<00:01:28.380> be<00:01:28.770> heading<00:01:29.400> our<00:01:29.549> way<00:01:30.710> and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
will definitely be heading our way and

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.649 
will definitely be heading our way and
we'll<00:01:32.250> take<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.430> quick<00:01:32.700> look<00:01:32.939> at<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> CME

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
we'll take a quick look at the CME

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.600 
we'll take a quick look at the CME
projection<00:01:34.200> models<00:01:34.530> here<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.009> see<00:01:35.579> if

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
projection models here and see if

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.289 
projection models here and see if
they've<00:01:35.820> got<00:01:35.970> anything<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.600> tap<00:01:37.020> for<00:01:41.150> the<00:01:42.150> days

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
they've got anything on tap for the days

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.380 
they've got anything on tap for the days
ahead<00:01:42.509> off<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.520> this<00:01:44.520> should<00:01:44.729> be<00:01:44.850> exactly

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
ahead off of this this should be exactly

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.760 
ahead off of this this should be exactly
what<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.780> approaching<00:01:46.259> us<00:01:46.670> today<00:01:47.670> on<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.329> 7th

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
what is approaching us today on the 7th

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.190 
what is approaching us today on the 7th
and<00:01:49.770> if<00:01:50.460> they've<00:01:50.610> updated<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.360> should<00:01:52.049> see

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
and if they've updated it should see

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.469 
and if they've updated it should see
another<00:01:52.409> one<00:01:52.590> come<00:01:52.799> off<00:01:52.950> any<00:01:53.159> second<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:54.390> they

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
another one come off any second so they

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.149 
another one come off any second so they
may<00:01:54.689> not<00:01:54.869> have<00:01:55.020> updated<00:01:55.439> but<00:01:55.619> that's<00:01:55.860> what<00:01:56.070> is

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
may not have updated but that's what is

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.889 
may not have updated but that's what is
hitting<00:01:56.399> us<00:01:56.520> today<00:01:58.939> and<00:01:59.939> we<00:02:00.659> will<00:02:00.810> have

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
hitting us today and we will have

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.319 
hitting us today and we will have
another<00:02:01.200> one<00:02:01.409> coming<00:02:01.799> our<00:02:01.920> way<00:02:02.130> I'll<00:02:03.000> leave

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
another one coming our way I'll leave

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.450 
another one coming our way I'll leave
