yarn the end of my ball is coming up
it's<00:00:37.800> gotten<00:00:38.040> really<00:00:38.160> short<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:39.300> can<00:00:39.930> keep

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
it's gotten really short I can keep

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.530 
it's gotten really short I can keep
knitting<00:00:40.620> for<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.070> while<00:00:41.219> because<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.910> want<00:00:42.450> to

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
knitting for a while because I want to

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.660 
knitting for a while because I want to
leave<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> tail<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.920> long<00:00:44.129> enough<00:00:44.160> for<00:00:44.399> me<00:00:44.579> to

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
leave a tail just long enough for me to

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.240 
leave a tail just long enough for me to
weave<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.180> with<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.450> tapestry<00:00:45.690> needle<00:00:46.100> but<00:00:47.100> it's

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
weave in with a tapestry needle but it's

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.010 
weave in with a tapestry needle but it's
better<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.579> err<00:00:47.820> on<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.030> side<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.329> little<00:00:48.750> too

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
better to err on the side of little too

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.330 
better to err on the side of little too
long<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.590> tail<00:00:49.770> because<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.100> can<00:00:50.219> always

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
long of a tail because you can always

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.430 
long of a tail because you can always
trim<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.700> then<00:00:51.270> tune<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.690> down<00:00:51.750> until<00:00:52.320> you've

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
trim it then tune it down until you've

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.200 
trim it then tune it down until you've
got<00:00:52.620> just<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.039> little<00:00:53.070> bit<00:00:53.280> which<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.000> going<00:00:54.120> to

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
got just a little bit which is going to

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.090 
got just a little bit which is going to
be<00:00:54.300> really<00:00:54.600> difficult<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.110> weave<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.530> later<00:00:55.829> if

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
be really difficult to weave in later if

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.979 
be really difficult to weave in later if
that<00:00:56.489> ever<00:00:56.640> accidentally<00:00:57.270> happens<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.870> you

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.689 
it's okay you can use a crochet hook to
kind<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.960> help<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.320> weave<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.559> those<00:01:01.800> ends<00:01:02.070> but

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
kind of help you weave in those ends but

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.070 
kind of help you weave in those ends but
I<00:01:02.730> like<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.090> leave<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.270> tail<00:01:03.539> that's<00:01:03.750> at<00:01:03.899> least

six<00:01:06.619> which<00:01:07.619> will<00:01:07.770> be<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> lot<00:01:08.340> easier<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.820> use<00:01:08.939> a

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
six which will be a lot easier to use a

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.600 
six which will be a lot easier to use a
tapestry<00:01:09.299> needle<00:01:09.619> so<00:01:10.619> I'm<00:01:11.040> going<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.369> pick<00:01:11.520> up

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.160 
new balls join in between the needles it
just<00:01:21.540> gives<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.020> sort<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.710> added<00:01:23.250> instability

more stitches I'm going to stop here

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.960 
more stitches I'm going to stop here
again<00:02:11.680> I<00:02:11.710> can<00:02:11.920> always<00:02:12.040> trim<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:12.370> up<00:02:12.490> if<00:02:12.700> it's<00:02:12.850> in

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
again I can always trim it up if it's in

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.490 
again I can always trim it up if it's in
my<00:02:13.000> way<00:02:13.330> or<00:02:13.540> when<00:02:13.720> I'm<00:02:13.810> ready<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.140> weave<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.410> in

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
my way or when I'm ready to weave it in

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.190 
my way or when I'm ready to weave it in
and<00:02:14.740> so<00:02:15.610> what<00:02:15.880> I<00:02:15.910> do<00:02:16.060> this<00:02:16.540> is<00:02:16.660> probably<00:02:17.020> the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
and so what I do this is probably the

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.530 
and so what I do this is probably the
simplest<00:02:17.530> method<00:02:18.010> of<00:02:18.130> changing<00:02:18.370> joining<00:02:19.360> a

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
simplest method of changing joining a

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.020 
simplest method of changing joining a
new<00:02:19.750> ball<00:02:19.960> of<00:02:20.050> yarn<00:02:20.200> I<00:02:20.440> just<00:02:21.100> stop<00:02:21.730> knitting

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
with this one I pick up the end of the

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.420 
with this one I pick up the end of the
new<00:02:24.850> ball<00:02:25.210> of<00:02:25.390> yarn<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:25.960> I<00:02:26.650> start<00:02:27.130> knitting

with<00:02:27.730> this<00:02:27.880> one<00:02:28.090> there's<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.480> little<00:02:28.780> more<00:02:28.900> to

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
with this one there's a little more to

with this one there's a little more to
it<00:02:29.140> than<00:02:29.320> that<00:02:29.350> so<00:02:29.650> I'll<00:02:29.740> show<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:29.980> some<00:02:30.280> of

around because nothing's anchoring it so

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.700 
around because nothing's anchoring it so
I'm<00:03:03.460> going<00:03:03.610> to<00:03:03.640> anchor<00:03:04.090> that<00:03:04.120> new<00:03:04.540> yarn<00:03:04.840> drape

going<00:05:14.630> to<00:05:14.660> feel<00:05:14.840> part<00:05:15.080> of<00:05:15.169> the<00:05:15.260> same<00:05:15.440> fabric

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
going to feel part of the same fabric

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.560 
going to feel part of the same fabric
and<00:05:16.160> when<00:05:16.550> you're<00:05:16.700> done<00:05:16.880> with<00:05:17.150> your<00:05:17.180> knitting

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
and when you're done with your knitting

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.050 
and when you're done with your knitting
project<00:05:18.020> you<00:05:18.380> can<00:05:18.560> weave<00:05:18.830> these<00:05:19.100> ends<00:05:19.520> in<00:05:19.700> on

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
project you can weave these ends in on

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.790 
project you can weave these ends in on
the<00:05:20.270> wrong<00:05:20.419> side<00:05:20.720> of<00:05:20.840> the<00:05:20.930> work<00:05:21.110> and<00:05:21.289> therefore

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
the wrong side of the work and therefore

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.070 
the wrong side of the work and therefore
it'll<00:05:22.310> be<00:05:22.430> secure<00:05:22.850> you<00:05:23.419> don't<00:05:23.600> have<00:05:23.720> to<00:05:23.870> tie<00:05:24.050> a

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
it'll be secure you don't have to tie a

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.920 
it'll be secure you don't have to tie a
knot<00:05:24.610> and<00:05:25.610> you<00:05:25.880> can<00:05:25.910> continue<00:05:26.539> knitting<00:05:26.690> with

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
knot and you can continue knitting with
