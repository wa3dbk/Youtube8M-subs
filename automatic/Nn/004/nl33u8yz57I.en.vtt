00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.229
 I know that the principles of traditional Christianity 

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:12.779
 claimed that the Christmas lottery really drifted from the art of soria 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:13.619
 arrive 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:15.729
 iloilo in certain 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:19.879
 the theologians of the early church who formulated austerity 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.730
 as the formal doctrine you wanted magical 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.649
 it was Christian they talked 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.619
 latin hello tino 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.009
 masters and me 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.200
 they lived the Roman Empire and decreased Greek culture like the rest of the 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:37.050
 people 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.890
 and like any payment also for example 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.510
 but nevertheless 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.610
 I did not have the trinity I do not say about the philosophy of life 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.340
 no one 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.370
 absolutely nobody can find a doctrine of pedestrian activity 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.870
 v reports ready 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.550
 neither those of the network in what unites us 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.620
 neither savater philosopher and like them 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.450
 in his philosophy is that I had nothing even remotely similar that could 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.780
 to potentially be a source of origin 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.780
 for trinity 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.100
 the affiliates of the service found her admired in the bible 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.400
 the violence since there is only one god 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.670
 the goal he gave to the world and everything that exists 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.570
 also 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.870
 affirms that the father who saw Jesus to the world 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.610
 also points out that Jesus Christ 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.440
 the son of the father 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.940
 it is god himself 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.370
 and also affirms that the holy pitu 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.900
 whom jesus in vigo from the father so the return to heaven these 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.780
 wines 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.549
 the spokesperson for the trinity of the early church was simply a way 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.670
 logic must put all these biblical teachings 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.800
 whores combined 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.890
 then I buy you to derive from pagan philosophy in vienna 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.530
 the Christmas lottery was l 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.140
 by a mother the catalyst 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.630
 in the formulation of the different distinct distinctive approximations 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.889
 Christian to philosophy 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:17.409
 a very influential church father 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:18.579
 San Roque 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.930
 develops a current of thought about the philosophical question 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.519
 traditional such as the natural ones to overcome 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:31.759
 and the nature of the gun day which is in its essence dependent on the 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:33.529
 doctrine of the trinity 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:37.199
 and in his time the doctrine of the trinity was based 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.799
 as an end clearly showed it 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.309
 teachings 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:45.329
 of the bible is clear then 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.010
 the trinity is not derived from Greek philosophy but is born from the pages 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.760
 from the bible
