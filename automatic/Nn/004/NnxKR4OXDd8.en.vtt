 I put the carrots first I left them 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.519
 let it drop on the tree let them boil 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.640
 for a couple of minutes and I added the 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:53.220
 potatoes in this water I also put a little 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.150
 of salt and here I will leave until 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.150

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.879
 soften 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.270
 I see it and I piquÃ© my tomatoes along with the 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.250
 onion 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.350
 I'm going to put them in the glass of the 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.430
 blender together with the can of the 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.000
 chipotle chiles with a little water 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.730
 to bring to liquefy 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.920
 once our meat is already well 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.470
 fried 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.640
 let's add the tomato that already 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:37.170
 we liquefy along with the chipotle peppers 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.170
 I'm going to pass it through a strainer 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:44.360
 I'm going to season with salt I'm going to add 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.360
 also chicken broth 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.290
 or the chicken consommÃ© 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:57.880
 and let's leave here season 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.950
 about a couple of minutes or so 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.190
 well, our potatoes and our 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.280
 carrots are already going to drain the 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.890
 to add them to our meat 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.440
 peas are already soft I'm going to turn off 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.550
 I'm going to drain them to add them 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.550
 also to the meat 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.849
 our tomato and in change of color 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.300
 I'm going to add the vegetable that is already 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:24.300
 cooked 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:32.550
 If you want a more mincemeat more 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:36.240
 dry do not add so much water to us 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:39.539
 at home we like the minced picadillo 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.740
 but if you like it dry do not 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.740
 add so much water 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.659
 if you are also going to put 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:53.189
 condiments and condiments I put them 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:53.189
 and right now at this time 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:05:01.700
 and let the tomato sauce 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:04.470
 for about 5 minutes or less 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:07.590
 to pay and serve 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:11.450
 I'm going to add my condiments 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.450
 I'm going to add the nail 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.510
 I'm going to add a little bit of 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.510
 cinnamon 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.949
 and I'm going to add a little bit of 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.949
 ground cumin 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.420
 and we're going to leave here for about 5 minutes 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.560
 this is how our picadillo was left 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.080
 It's very tasty, I tried it, it's a bit 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.080
 pico cited if you want me not to 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.420
 pique so much that add two or three 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.120
 chipotle chilies I add all the 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.639
 latita 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.160
 and the seasonings also remember are 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:59.050
 to your liking if you do not want to add them 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.820
 there is a problem to me if I like it 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.830
 season the picadillo 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.740
 and if they want a little more 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.160
 dry do not add water at the time of 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.160
 liquefy 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.390
