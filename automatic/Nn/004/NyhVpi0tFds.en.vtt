00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:17.110
 Hello, my name is Momoko this time will be the video for the movement of the finger should be doing every day 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:21.710
 The dream movement is as important as playing a song, and the reason is a dreamy tension 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:23.050
 Create a patchy condition to practice the song by loosening it 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:30.490
 Will 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:33.350
 Unlike finger movement, the movement of the finger is not complicated and the shape and power of the finger firmly 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:41.329
 It is easy to be aware of attachments etc. 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:42.940
 But there are quite a few people who usually don't do it because they don't have time for practice but it's a song 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.430
 Practice questions 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:50.050
 I got down 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:54.520
 There are quite a few things that practice does not go well 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:57.410
 Because it is good in Ube city range not so every day 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.020
 Before practice the song 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.730
 To continue 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.430
 To your wife 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:07.150
 I hope you can tell me 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.060
 So specifically 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.460
 And say subordinates, such the movement of the finger, such as the 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.540
 It's very easy but 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.230
 First of all, right hand 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:27.070
 A said Hey now 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:27.070
 Does not come first right hand but I do not have to shell charcoal was one hand you have that smartphone 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:44.630
 ana langlet 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.300
 wh 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.280
 wh 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.110

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.110
 ana 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.110
 car 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.570
 Ah ah ah 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.570
 Hmm 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.570
 Hmm 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.820
 I'm waiting 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.069
 Have 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.069
 me 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.020
 Hmm 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.020
 wh 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
 re 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.290
 bap N 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.150
 In a feeling of saying 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.940
 a 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:43.640
 I think it better to surrender 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:48.770
 I've ignored the tempo for a while now 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:53.380
 As I said earlier, from the shape of Aichi and Aichi 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:55.230
 I think it would be nice to be aware of the tempo 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.400
 Store W 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.260
 I hope I'll be using to take woman 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.810
 Emmet's 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:07.730
 At first it is quite slow 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.730
 63 g is better 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.360
 The 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:18.330
 I think it's too slow 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:21.390
 People who think that something is easy to put on them and say they are boring 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.910
 In fact, slow Omg 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.990
 It's difficult, but rather than faster 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.990
 About 63 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.849
 It's hard to fit a great tape 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.239
 anaal 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.620
 At first everyone was able to catch a store 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:04.790
 I am Eechotto doing to endure 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:09.250
 If you can do that, you will gradually accelerate the tempo 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.250
 104 there is the power of the gray people 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:25.410
 It is the form of the second finger 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:25.410
 After that, it's too much power whether it's round properly 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.650
 Whether you 're playing that violently 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:37.050
 I think I should see it properly 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.370
 It seems so after 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.820
 As do also left body 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.820
 And 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:58.900
 I can not do it now, but I think it would be good to listen to both hands together 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:05:01.139
 If you think that this is the only thing I think is not enough, I arrange by myself and Yu- Stakat Town 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.139
 2 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:10.860
 Not radar degree 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:12.150
 I think that or kicking and still good play on the melody 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.940
 is not it 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:20.070
 Because it may be short time 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:25.849
 If you can continue to practice the song every day before practice 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:27.909
 I think my fingers are floating and it is easy to play songs 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:27.909
 a 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:36.900
 This time I used the piano keyboard differently last time 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.080
 It will be the exercise of the finger 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.550
 This ends with this 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:48.460
 I feel it, but again next time 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:52.020
 I will continue posting videos, so I think if you can see this time I look to the end 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.020
 Thank you for
