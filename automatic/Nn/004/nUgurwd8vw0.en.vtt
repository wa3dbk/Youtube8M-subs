00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.200
 very good everyone must come to a new 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.000
 live most legendary miles of board in 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.830
 both of us today we have the assault rifle 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.470
 jay cocks legendary also known 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.940
 like the hammer buster and with this rifle 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.289
 of assault let's start the guide of 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.350
 assault rifles one of the guide 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.330
 chemical that has cost me the most after 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.340
 from that of the rocket launchers by only 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.230
 one from the north although it could 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.340
 equate to one of the rifles of 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.169
 assault that I've been here getting 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.050
 that it's been from the life series that 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.489
 good as I will discuss later I arrive and 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.010
 of the hours it took me to get it 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.780
 well we are already getting the hammer 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.300
 buster we will tell you in debt 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.890
 after completing the mission the scourge 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.569
 a mission that we will find ourselves a bit 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.909
 before the main mission where the 

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:50.679
 angels fear to enter that the 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:54.579
 we will find the mission is secondary 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:56.559
 in an echo shot near the remoxy bar and 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.179
 will send us to make a kind of 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.010
 mission getting the clues to 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:01.479
 find a haunted weapon but that's not 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.429
 it's important how important we are going to 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:06.250
 have to fight against several bosses in 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:07.990
 this mission and one of them will be marginal 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.310
 and marginal and it's going to be this boss who 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.120
 I'm here right now facing me 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.200
 someone 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.790
 air battle a bit epic and nothing this 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.260
 is going to be the boss who does not release the hummer 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.900
 buster here you see germana on all the 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.330
 first it took me several attempts the 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.120
 truth is that it has a very high probability 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.400
 very very very low to release it but good 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.710
 It is not as difficult as the seriousness 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.170
 and faith the truth is that is that it is already 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.950
 that is already another thing is that other 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.340
 world 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.980
 well here melamed affair over with a 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.170
 price and pretty good with you was 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.390
 the damage but anyway not 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.150
 it matters too much because I did not want a 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.490
 super good weapon an assault rifle 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.680
 Czechs that I loved not because 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.950
 I love Czech weapons but 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.950
 it's not that it's something super, it's not that 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.540
 have as much consistency as for 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.910
 considered a good soul a good 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.350
 legendary here you see that you have a good 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.630
 base damage to be a 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.539
 an assault rifle but still it's not going to 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.650
 be a strong enough damage 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:15.200
 as to make up for all its shortcomings 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.000
 to start as you already know clearly 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.920
 It's a weapon to Ieco so it's not going to have 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.650
 a fire I do not say we're going to have to go 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.540
 pressing the trigger thing that is going to 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.180
 difficult enough against enemies in 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.569
 movement and against difficult enemies 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.130
 like bosses at high levels and with 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.140
 which we will have to go hiding and 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.360
 gaining life so we're going to have to 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.700
 to be 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.440
 a little struggling with the gun we are not going to 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.700
 have to be fighting for 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.890
 get right and have a soul 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.290
 consistent here you see that from far away if 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.840
 dais in the head and is the sideways does 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.240
 pretty hurt but of course between 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.250
 little not have few gains but 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.540
 that you have to go giving it little by little and 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.180
 that actually does not have that much precision 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.590
 how should I have to be a weapon 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:05.440
 jacobs I do not know is like more no no no just 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.730
 to like me like I did not like it 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.260
 with assault rifle the assault rifle 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.410
 in this game they are quite valid in the 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.989
 most but this one in particular for everything 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.400
 how difficult it is to get it does not deserve 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.130
 so much the pain 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.780
 well here they ask me simply level 50 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.760
 that level 50 with any weapon 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.950
 legendary they usually die pretty 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.959
 easily but you see that it is costing 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.920
 quite even pointing well in the 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.300
 head because I have enough 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.340
 accuracy in the series of 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.810
 sniper challenge is made 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.240
 sometimes I'm a little nervous and see 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.950
 I got the hummer mastering from 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.780
 good image and despite some moments 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.190
 where I'm a little bit with the 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.770
 Tembleques I usually have 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.750
 pretty accurate and you see that although the 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.760
 I have and although I usually give in the head 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.850
 is that I take good advantage of this 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.270
 weapon as much as critics and for 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.880
 a lot that also has 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.350
 in other characters skills that you 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.300
 raise critics like zero at zero 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.940
 the weapons that make good critics 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.410
 they have enough damage but not even then 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.690
 are you going to make a good profit this weapon 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.490
 good but so right now I'll have 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.260
 that record a little lower because now 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.480
 my family will almost not be able to lift 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.810
 much the voice but good we continue with the 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:21.320
 tail that you already see that is not very easy 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.780
 take advantage of this weapon that's why 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.270
 those various things do not enter that what is 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.090
 difficult to aim while you move that 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.160
 it is a weapon there are echoes and it already has a little 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.130
 more of difficulty because of giving it to 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.310
 shoot with it with the click of the mouse or 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.010
 be with the trigger of him 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.680
 the control will be more difficult to aim and 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.540
 go giving the trigger I do not know is a soul 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.000
 quite complex for the little 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.710
 beneficial that is the extra damage that 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.140
 he has because he does not have too much 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.810
 hurt to be a legendary jay cocks 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.270
 We have thought that with the majority of Jay 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.610
 cocks of this game when they have put it 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.540
 legendary you have done too little 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.610
 damage to the deficiencies they have I do not know 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:06.670
 that cause what your motto since because no 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.500
 is one is if I take you more than one 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.260
 shot is that it is not a jacobs 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.850
 here you see that not even now 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.990
 we are at level 80 but not even 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:20.530
 level 50 kills either one or two and two 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:23.950
 so I do not know I do not know what to say no no I 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.840
 I liked it too, this seemed like a 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.640
 phenomenal idea when oysters a 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.730
 jump infusion arrive with sure that 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.380
 it is must be very good good precision 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.600
 good damage to the head but a little 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.700
 complex to use but 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.070
 the only thing he had of the three things was 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.950
 what complex to use because we're going 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.660
 damage does not have it just and it is not that 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.750
 have too much good precision you see 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.100
 then yes you are trying to shoot 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.290
 while moving but neither is it 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.230
 do too much damage or that the certain 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.730
 too many bullets not just for me 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.230
 precision but also because the 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.150
 gun precision 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.160
 well here you see that here at a distance 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.140
 trying to find enough cadence and 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.580
 pretty shot in the head but I can not 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.000
 do any of those things or have 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.260
 that slow it down or you have to give 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.790
 fewer guys in the head because no 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.920
 you can go with enough profit not 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.410
 you have the head with this sister I do not know 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.610
 what is still a very fat boss 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.170
 we go characteristics of the weapon of 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.120
 insult quite low because already 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.400
 you have seen the boss is next but 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.930
 I have not put a 2 because it is difficult to 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.480
 get weapons and that has left in three 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.760
 and it has alarm at low levels what 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:31.690
 I see a little more useful against bosses in 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.420
 normal mode but in p 8 mode it does not 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.280
 I will use any 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.290
 not too good does not have any 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.720
 element because it's a arm there are echoes and it's 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.610
 a pretty complex to use I see it more 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.440
 useful against big enemies not against 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.270
 Bosses usually tend to be bigger 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.940
 the bosses because they will have a critic 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:50.330
 rather bigger but against enemies 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.330
 normal 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.510
 and well this has been all because there 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.430
 liked the video something has already been served 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.750
 you know you can give a comment if 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.040
 have any suggestions and subscribe 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.370
 for more in the description of the video 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.630
 I'll leave the channel twitter link 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.740
 so you can pass me the photos of 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.570
 the legendary ones I'm getting 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.890
 with my methods and so on later 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.810
 You can make a compilation with all 

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.100
 them and doing was a video with them and 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.420
 I have enough but that is not because 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.490
 the cuts but that my brother is a 

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:16.730
 capo as they have a good day and until 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.730
 the next 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.300
 all right
