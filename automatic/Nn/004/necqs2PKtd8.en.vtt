other parts so but they are the
articulation<00:00:34.480> is<00:00:34.570> pretty<00:00:34.720> much<00:00:34.840> the<00:00:34.989> same<00:00:35.110> as

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
articulation is pretty much the same as

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.299 
articulation is pretty much the same as
to<00:00:35.559> like<00:00:35.710> zero<00:00:36.010> just<00:00:36.820> normal<00:00:37.210> one<00:00:37.360> and<00:00:38.309> there's

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
to like zero just normal one and there's

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.549 
to like zero just normal one and there's
really<00:00:39.699> no<00:00:39.960> restriction<00:00:40.960> to<00:00:41.140> with<00:00:41.229> all<00:00:41.440> the

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
there were no solid lines to actually

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.580 
there were no solid lines to actually
follow<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:12.630> here's<00:01:13.630> how<00:01:13.810> it<00:01:13.930> looks<00:01:14.140> like<00:01:14.290> with

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
follow and here's how it looks like with

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:22.440

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
all of his swings boosters etc all

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.330 
all of his swings boosters etc all
deployed<00:01:25.810> out<00:01:26.080> he<00:01:26.530> does<00:01:26.710> bulk<00:01:26.950> up<00:01:27.100> a<00:01:27.160> little

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
deployed out he does bulk up a little

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.860 
deployed out he does bulk up a little
bit<00:01:27.550> it<00:01:27.790> might<00:01:28.000> take<00:01:28.210> up<00:01:28.330> some<00:01:28.480> more<00:01:28.600> shelf

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
bit it might take up some more shelf

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.170 
bit it might take up some more shelf
space<00:01:28.960> or<00:01:29.710> overall<00:01:30.040> it's<00:01:30.700> awesome<00:01:31.060> this

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
space or overall it's awesome this

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.860 
space or overall it's awesome this
Factory<00:01:31.870> does<00:01:32.230> go<00:01:32.410> up<00:01:32.560> a<00:01:32.800> lot<00:01:33.420> especially<00:01:34.420> if

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
Factory does go up a lot especially if

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.550 
Factory does go up a lot especially if
you've<00:01:34.990> done<00:01:35.170> some<00:01:35.380> painting<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:37.350> guess<00:01:38.350> a

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
you've done some painting and I guess a

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.560 
you've done some painting and I guess a
significant<00:01:39.100> part<00:01:39.340> that<00:01:39.550> everyone<00:01:40.000> should<00:01:40.180> at

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
significant part that everyone should at

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.790 
significant part that everyone should at
least<00:01:40.690> try<00:01:41.230> to<00:01:41.290> paint<00:01:41.590> is<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:42.070> tail<00:01:42.520> wing<00:01:43.210> part

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
least try to paint is the tail wing part

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.130 
least try to paint is the tail wing part
here<00:01:44.800> as<00:01:45.420> normally<00:01:46.420> that<00:01:46.510> would<00:01:46.600> be<00:01:46.690> all<00:01:46.870> blue

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
here as normally that would be all blue

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.730 
here as normally that would be all blue
so<00:01:47.950> that<00:01:48.130> white<00:01:48.340> has<00:01:48.490> also<00:01:48.670> been<00:01:48.909> painted<00:01:49.740> and

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
so that white has also been painted and

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.710 
so that white has also been painted and
all<00:01:51.070> this<00:01:51.220> was<00:01:51.400> painted<00:01:51.670> using<00:01:51.909> dental

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
all this was painted using dental

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.010 
all this was painted using dental
markers<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.530> white<00:01:53.710> Orange<00:01:57.810> that'll<00:01:58.810> be<00:01:58.930> it

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
markers the white Orange that'll be it
