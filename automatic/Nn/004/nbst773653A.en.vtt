00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.000
[Gentle Acoustic Guitar]

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
In Flanders fields the poppies blow
Between the crosses, row on row,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
That mark our place; and in the sky
The lark, still bravely singing, fly

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Scarce heard amid the guns below.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We are the Dead. Short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Loved and were loved, and now we lie
In Flanders fields.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
[Gentle Acoustic Guitar]

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Millions of people were killed and wounded, both physically and mentally, in the First World War.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The Poppy Appeal in Scotland started in 1921,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
to help families left behind and men wounded in the war to end all wars.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
But of course, wars did not end. More than 50 million were killed in the Second World War.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
British service personnel have been involved in conflicts every year, since the end of the Second World War.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Now as much as ever, Poppyscotland raises money to help brave men and women

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
who put themselves at risk, in the line of duty.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
As wars have gone from black and white to colour, Poppyscotland have always been there.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Take up our quarrel with the foe:

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
To you from failing hands, we throw
The torch; Be yours to hold it high.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
If ye break faith with us who die

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
In Flanders fields.
