00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.210
 hello everyone with you viper 29 09 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.880
 and today we will talk about the second branch 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.690
 medium tanks of France namely its 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.940
 top tank of the tenth level and mix 30 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.119
 let's look at his approximate tth 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.279
 We have a gun 105 millimeters ammunition 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.060
 forty-seven shells are pretty good 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.029
 such a gun stands at the leopard but about 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.519
 plus or minus the same should not be but 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.189
 which means we will have good dmp angles 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.370
 vertical pickup minus 8 and plus 20 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.570
 also comfortable enough but also damage from 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.629
 320 like Soviet tanks up to 390 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.430
 numbers with these yet accurate information 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.100
 no but maybe soon 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.469
 there will be a whole gun must be very 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.539
 good and comfortable enough accurate 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.690
 and so on now about booking 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.270
 tank and but in general it looks like leopards 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.030
 Skye but also his almost exactly 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.640
 no 80 millimeters is the maximum 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.890
 thickness in the forehead of the hull and tower but in 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.920
 the tower still has a mask of 150 millimeters and 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.479
 shells are only possible in it from 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.760
 there will not be any eights 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.770
 the whole tank will be very 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.930
 to make good but also for some 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.330
 ricochets can only hope in the most 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.030
 the most extreme cases are now mobility 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.340
 there will be a relatively light 37 tons 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.820
 the engine costs 720 horse 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.189
 forces but and the power density is 19 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.130
 with half horses on that enough 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.079
 good performance well and I think that the tank 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.509
 will accelerate very quickly to 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.000
 sixty five kilometers per hour but also 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.520
 while not losing speed when cornering 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.500
 I think this is very good quality for 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.570
 medium tank if all these 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.970
 characteristics will remain the same 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.360
 and they will not be changed to the exit of this tank 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.119
 which will be around 2015 then we 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.810
 we will get another leopard- like tank 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.719
 what are now leopard 1 and stb 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.180
 one of the top tanks in general tank 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.280
 will be for skill players again 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.350
 there is no armor and you will have to play very 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.110
 neatly but if accuracy is 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.300
 let 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.880
 it will be another symbiosis of average 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.190
 tank and poteshki even for these modest 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.870
 characteristics you can understand that of yourself 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.970
 will represent the tank well and in my 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.610
 look it will be good enough and 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.860
 interesting to many players on this i 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.200
 say goodbye don't forget to sign up for 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.920
 channel put like and wait for the next 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.920
 video bye
