tree<00:00:09.240> actually<00:00:09.420> grows<00:00:09.929> in<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.440> couple<00:00:10.740> of

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
tree actually grows in a couple of

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.620 
tree actually grows in a couple of
stages<00:00:11.099> now<00:00:11.519> you<00:00:11.580> can<00:00:11.700> see<00:00:11.880> Anna<00:00:12.059> actually

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
stages now you can see Anna actually

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.509 
stages now you can see Anna actually
have<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.780> time-lapse<00:00:13.500> that<00:00:13.769> took<00:00:14.160> quite<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.400> bit

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
have a time-lapse that took quite a bit

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.910 
have a time-lapse that took quite a bit
of<00:00:14.580> time<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:15.089> actually<00:00:15.210> create<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.800> can

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
of time to actually create and you can

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.620 
of time to actually create and you can
see<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.100> Lightning<00:00:17.699> actually<00:00:18.180> hitting<00:00:18.420> the

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
see the Lightning actually hitting the

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.240 
see the Lightning actually hitting the
zap-apple<00:00:19.050> what<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.560> can<00:00:19.800> do<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.220> can

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
zap-apple what you can do is you can

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.000 
zap-apple what you can do is you can
actually<00:00:20.400> find<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.180> seed<00:00:21.570> or<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> sapling

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
actually find a seed or a sapling

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.009 
actually find a seed or a sapling
basically<00:00:23.430> scattered<00:00:23.880> around<00:00:23.970> your<00:00:24.779> world

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
basically scattered around your world

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.529 
basically scattered around your world
and<00:00:25.230> what<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.310> need<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.580> do<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.730> get<00:00:27.029> bone<00:00:27.300> meal

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
and what you need to do is get bone meal

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.339 
and what you need to do is get bone meal
and<00:00:27.869> then<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.880> basically<00:00:29.880> simply<00:00:30.660> summon<00:00:31.260> it

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
and then you basically simply summon it

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.410 
and then you basically simply summon it
like<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.679> do<00:00:32.040> eight<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> normal<00:00:33.030> tree<00:00:33.239> and

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
like you do eight to a normal tree and

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.080 
like you do eight to a normal tree and
then<00:00:33.750> all<00:00:33.930> start<00:00:34.260> growing<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.160> lightning

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
then all start growing and lightning

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.360 
then all start growing and lightning
will<00:00:36.210> strike<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.230> zapping<00:00:37.860> apples

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
will strike it and the zapping apples

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.910 
will strike it and the zapping apples
will<00:00:38.670> begin<00:00:39.270> now<00:00:40.079> that's<00:00:40.500> pretty<00:00:40.739> much<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
will begin now that's pretty much the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.680 
will begin now that's pretty much the
whole<00:00:41.100> process<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:42.030> then<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.270> can<00:00:42.390> see<00:00:42.540> the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
whole process and then you can see the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.630 
whole process and then you can see the
flower-like<00:00:43.110> shapes<00:00:43.290> like<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.950> can<00:00:44.129> see<00:00:44.340> here

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
flower-like shapes like you can see here

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.450 
flower-like shapes like you can see here
that<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.629> beginning<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.680> fruit<00:00:47.160> all

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
that is the beginning of the fruit all

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.130 
that is the beginning of the fruit all
right<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.059> here's<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.480> nice<00:00:48.629> little<00:00:48.690> close-up

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
right and here's a nice little close-up

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.040 
right and here's a nice little close-up

complete we actually can climb up or
were<00:01:15.840> actually<00:01:16.530> harvest<00:01:17.070> these<00:01:17.220> apples<00:01:17.790> by

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
were actually harvest these apples by

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.399 
were actually harvest these apples by
clicking<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.509> them<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.140> they<00:01:19.259> would

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
clicking on them and that they would

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.499 
clicking on them and that they would
simply<00:01:19.830> drop<00:01:20.130> like<00:01:20.369> normal<00:01:20.759> sort<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.270> any

simply drop like normal sort of that any

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.440 
simply drop like normal sort of that any
let<00:01:21.990> any<00:01:22.259> ordinary<00:01:22.950> block<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:24.090> let's<00:01:24.270> go<00:01:24.299> so

you can actually collect one worry in
survival<00:01:26.610> motor<00:01:26.790> will<00:01:27.210> fall<00:01:27.450> down<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.930> let's

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
survival motor will fall down and let's

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.350 
survival motor will fall down and let's
go<00:01:28.350> jump<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.890> click<00:01:29.220> him<00:01:29.430> let's<00:01:29.909> go<00:01:30.060> out<00:01:30.180> other
