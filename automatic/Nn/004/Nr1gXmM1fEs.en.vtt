00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
wait to get some use out of my Vita cuz

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.719 
wait to get some use out of my Vita cuz
that<00:01:07.409> thing<00:01:07.650> has<00:01:07.770> been<00:01:07.890> neglected<00:01:08.159> for<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.670> long

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
that thing has been neglected for a long

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.789 
that thing has been neglected for a long
time<00:01:09.119> now<00:01:09.360> there's<00:01:09.600> hardly<00:01:09.750> any<00:01:10.140> games<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
time now there's hardly any games on the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.830 
time now there's hardly any games on the
Vita<00:01:11.000> honestly<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.060> think<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.360> Vita<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.659> kind

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
Vita honestly I think the Vita is kind

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.310 
Vita honestly I think the Vita is kind
of<00:01:12.960> dying<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:14.820> hopefully<00:01:15.180> maybe<00:01:15.750> Assassin's

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
of dying so hopefully maybe Assassin's

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.890 
of dying so hopefully maybe Assassin's
Creed<00:01:16.530> 3<00:01:16.560> liberation<00:01:17.400> will<00:01:17.549> revive<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.689> Vita

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
Creed 3 liberation will revive the Vita

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.730 
Creed 3 liberation will revive the Vita
or<00:01:19.790> whatever<00:01:20.840> because<00:01:21.840> they<00:01:22.229> are<00:01:22.409> coming<00:01:22.619> out

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
or whatever because they are coming out

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.719 
or whatever because they are coming out
with<00:01:22.799> some<00:01:23.070> more<00:01:23.220> Vita<00:01:23.580> games<00:01:25.189> in<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.520> next

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
with some more Vita games in the next

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.130 
with some more Vita games in the next
couple<00:01:26.880> months<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.450> mean<00:01:27.659> they're<00:01:27.810> coming<00:01:28.049> out

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
couple months I mean they're coming out

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.590 
couple months I mean they're coming out
with<00:01:28.790> PlayStation<00:01:29.790> all-stars<00:01:30.000> they're

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
with PlayStation all-stars they're

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.270 
with PlayStation all-stars they're
coming<00:01:30.869> out<00:01:30.960> with<00:01:30.990> black<00:01:31.259> ops<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.680> classified

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
coming out with black ops you classified

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.429 
coming out with black ops you classified
which<00:01:32.610> I'm<00:01:33.329> not<00:01:33.570> really<00:01:33.720> looking<00:01:34.049> forward<00:01:34.290> to

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
which I'm not really looking forward to

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.840 
which I'm not really looking forward to
because<00:01:34.770> that's<00:01:35.070> probably<00:01:35.310> not<00:01:35.549> going<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.729> be

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
because that's probably not going to be

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.640 
because that's probably not going to be
that<00:01:35.970> great<00:01:36.240> but<00:01:36.390> if<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.810> good<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.110> will<00:01:37.259> pick

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
that great but if it is good I will pick

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.130 
that great but if it is good I will pick
it<00:01:37.680> up<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.579> um<00:01:38.759> hopefully<00:01:39.180> Assassin's<00:01:39.930> Creed

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
it up but um hopefully Assassin's Creed

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.719 
it up but um hopefully Assassin's Creed
through<00:01:40.380> liberation<00:01:40.979> will<00:01:41.159> be<00:01:41.280> well-received

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
through liberation will be well-received

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.300 
through liberation will be well-received
with<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.240> Vita<00:01:42.420> community<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:44.220> know

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
with the Vita community and you know

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.679 
with the Vita community and you know
hopefully<00:01:44.549> it'll<00:01:44.820> give<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.149> Vita<00:01:45.329> another

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
hopefully it'll give the Vita another

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.889 
hopefully it'll give the Vita another
