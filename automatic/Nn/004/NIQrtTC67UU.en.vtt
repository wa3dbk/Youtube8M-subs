iron<00:04:34.320> wrapping<00:04:34.950> outwards<00:04:35.340> again<00:04:35.520> so<00:04:36.150> it<00:04:37.139> would

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
iron wrapping outwards again so it would

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.640 
iron wrapping outwards again so it would
stay<00:04:37.650> like<00:04:38.270> that<00:04:39.270> so<00:04:39.990> it<00:04:40.080> just<00:04:40.229> kind<00:04:40.410> of<00:04:40.440> falls
