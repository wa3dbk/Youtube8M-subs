00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.300
 after the Jurassic Park about recreating 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.199
 all dream dinosaurs 

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:10.539
 they spent 100 million of our planet 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:12.509
 years old 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.939
 who wouldn't she take a look 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:17.939
 this dream was not fulfilled 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.189
 until recently 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.069
 came to the aid of paleontology 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:27.099
 genetics 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:28.949
 new dinosaur hunters 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.749
 armed with science 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.480
 looking for their dna among descendants 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.480
 reptiles 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.610
 an expedition inside the ancestor will discover those 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.480
 traits dream investigated and not 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.050
 single precipitation 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.050
 2 5 cop father may well grow teeth 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.730
 sure we see that they have the beginnings of the same 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.730
 a dinosaur-like tail he might 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.730
 the similarity is not only in the layers and 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.050
 teeth but we have important 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.510
 which means we can get real 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.310
 another dinosaur 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.310
 although in an unusual way 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.150
 on recycling it comes technology 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.010
 develop mad obstacles that no 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.010
 except ethical 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.590
 can science bring back the dinosaur 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.280
 but dinosaurs are coming back 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.000
 recreation of dinosaurs can 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.790
 turn out to be bad but there is money 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.790
 but is it possible to implement it 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.650
 this will require a source of their dorenko 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.870
 oddly enough it may well be found 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.150
 authorities say they need extraordinary 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.009
 caution 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.030
 it is very easy to bring foreign dna 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.980
 from the air your gloss silly clothes 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.330
 g nice 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
 the first is to spoil the whole experiment 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.789
 but the trouble is that dna is unstable 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.729
 while the remains are turning to stone 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.740
 bacteria 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.820
 precipitation temperature drops and 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.700
 solar radiation 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.429
 are destroyed and 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:20.539
 it is believed that more than a couple of million years 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:22.539
 dna is not saved 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:25.349
 that is to recreate a dinosaur 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.929
 We can not 

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:30.279
 and nevertheless recently reappeared 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:33.279
 hope 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.840
 it resembles bone tissue 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.840
 typical for pregnant birds 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:43.659
 but also asked her assistant Jennifer 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.929
 smoke mayer perform an unusual operation 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:49.459
 in front of them was a mark and cloth 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.430
 persons she is this incredible 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.019
 discover to her 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.370
 the son was a petrified skeleton this 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.439
 is impossible 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.359
 he described the points 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.409
 other bone areas 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.729
 turned out to be a bachelorette party 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:07.040
 the author of the poem showed vessels 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.470
 it was incredible i even said i don't believe 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.470
 look again and again 

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:17.809
 give back at the moment everything is possible 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.429
 if so 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:22.579
 can we recreate the living 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:23.390
 dinosaur 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.310
 if 1 is irrefutable 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.959
 a way to prove that the birds happened alone 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.959
 precipitation 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.079
 need to turn the coalition 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.099
 development reversed and create dinosaurs 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.009
 bird prize 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:43.970
 Spartak himself it sounds fantastic 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.970
 but considering how much they have in common, this is not so 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.799
 complicated 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.489
 I myself would have a gene bird set very much like 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.819
 set of dinosaurs scribes trying 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.609
 now it has been applied only by its system. 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:58.549
 of use
