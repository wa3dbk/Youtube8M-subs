00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.649
 if you can't play at all 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:09.809
 guitar to plump you teach hi 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.910
 my name is morphine all my life I play on 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.620
 guitar playing brought me a lot 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.690
 free beer of the day i will teach you to play 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.949
 the guitar just frets and the guitar 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.680
 are counted from pegs 1 lat 2 fret 3 4 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.010
 the strings on the guitar are considered the bottom 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.410
 thin string 1 then 2 3 and so on until 6 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.090
 so let's start now we will play 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.739
 first chord the first chord is called 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:38.610
 up to c 5 string 3 fret 4 string 2 fret 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.649
 second string 1 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.930
 notice not one finger not 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.530
 touched another string if 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.840
 there will be a very ugly sound 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.120
 I can start with what's right 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.940
 put a hand to hand 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:59.250
 each finger should be positioned correctly 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.609
 on one fret and you automatically 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.739
 hands will be in the correct position 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.060
 remember this position she will always 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.000
 you have a right hand 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.580
 and contrary to her, place your fingers on the guitar 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.369
 on the strings means there will be a sharp sound 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.350
 there will be a softer sound well i 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.229
 somewhere in the middle I play 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.210
 let's start learning some sorting 5 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.060
 string 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.909
 third string first two then again 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.470
 the third string is a simple brute but sounds 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.700
 fine 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.340
 pay attention so that the fingers do not 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.490
 touched the neighboring strings clamp chord 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.490
 c 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:45.660
 then carry this finger on 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.930
 third string 2 fret play the same 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.930
 bust 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.630
 so we found the most simple 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.630
 chord sequence which 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.340
 can play acoustic guitar 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.000
 play one brute once 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.990
 this one without pausing right away 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.280
 go to the second year 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.280
 without pausing, go back 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.709
 do not pause come back 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.150
 not to lose the rhythm I advise 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.470
 knock off his foot 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.300
 nothing terrible if at first there will be 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.690
 you can get brute first we 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.610
 just fucking 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.500
 let's start with the fact that we remember a little bit 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.540
 this search and this sequence 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.250
 chords and a couple of days and by play if u 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.350
 you have difficulty squeezing 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.600
 chords try to carry your guitar 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.310
 to the master if this is the old guitar the 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.000
 master will help you will be much 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.060
 simpler 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.190
 add two chords first chord first 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.500
 string and the second string is clamped on 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.420
 first fret the third string is clamped on 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.950
 second fret 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.770
 it sounds right there, very beautiful simple 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:03.950
 chord brute force changes slightly instead 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.950
 5 strings and play 4 and me these chords 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:11.520
 you get used no me their dick knows how 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.150
 say by the way these chords are chords 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:18.320
 songs which is on my channel 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.320
