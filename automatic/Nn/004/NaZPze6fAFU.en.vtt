00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.990
 finally happened after almost 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.300
 year and several dozen test versions 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.590
 microsoft company showed the final 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.570
 windows 10 version 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.820
 we have already installed the latest build and 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.560
 ready to give you 15 reasons why 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.210
 you just have to start using 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.210
 new operating system version 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.990
 cedar approves main feature windows 10 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.710
 according to 99 percent of users 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.750
 return start menu 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.820
 welcome home son now this 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.780
 the window is a mixture of windows 7 and 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.399
 windows 8 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.559
 that is, there is a classic list here 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.989
 programs and live tiles that are another year 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.910
 back of us all terribly annoying search 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.920
 microsoft engineers decided that their 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.539
 voice assistant cortana is so 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.309
 cool it's time to move it with 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.379
 mobile devices and personal 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.480
 computers so starting from windows 10 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.930
 card she replaced the standard train in 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.730
 system 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.289
 although if you use Russian or 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.870
 Ukrainian then do not rush to rejoice 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.059
 data assistant does not support them yet 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.280
 so for now we are content with the usual 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.449
 search but it is more pleasant wrapper 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.670
 microsoft edge 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.770
 microsoft edge final name of the new 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.720
 browser companies which are some more 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.850
 months ago everyone called the project 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.920
 spartan is so to say a stone in the garden 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.900
 internet explorer or last nail 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.189
 in the coffin novelty received 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.200
 some cool chips 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.420
 creating notes directly on web pages 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.790
 integration with cortana the ability to download 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.619
 google chrome and much more if 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.600
 seriously then the browser is really 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.880
 cool here uses a new engine 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.630
 chakra which is designed to work with 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.670
 javascript 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.860
 modern applications run in windows 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.869
 earlier in the eight all programs 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.090
 divided into two categories for the worker 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.130
 table and modern they were like with 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.110
 different worlds now everything is different this 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.820
 moment tiled applications can 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.070
 run in classic mode and 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.470
 use them fully without dancing with 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.869
 tambourines and the most pleasant now all windows 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.060
 cast shadows yes howling sex 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.560
 but what's the difference if epics are beautiful 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.780
 virtual desktops 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.640
 do you need such a function at all of course yes 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.560
 possible for users while her 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.450
 the importance is not so noticeable but here are the owners 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.280
 tablets with a large screen diagonal 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.240
 should appreciate this 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.009
 innovation 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.959
 virtual desktops are one's 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.039
 kind of analog without tops on android on 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.840
 each individual screen 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.790
 You can group applications for different 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.650
 tasks for example on the first all programs 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.150
 for work on the second for entertainment 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.219
 to create a new table and or 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.599
 switch between already created need 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:24.780
 press a special button on the panel 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.939
 tasks and direct x 12 general direct x 12 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.200
 This is an exclusive for windows 10 which 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.450
 should increase productivity 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.310
 the system is just 6 only here there is one 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.170
 moment it may not be available for 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.530
 of all devices though dawn not worry 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.989
 worth 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.709
 will not receive direct x only very old 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.810
 video cards 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.489
 command line earlier paste text into 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.109
 the command line was only possible when 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.939
 help copy paste this 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.310
 annoyed everyone now starting with windows 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:49.260
 10 pro teams support work with 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.909
 counter in the updated standard 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.099
 applications program users 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.720
 windows insider noticed that practically 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.730
 in each new build developers 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.650
 updated or added some new 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.299
 standard applications in this way in 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.750
 in the end we got a cool mail 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.700
 customer 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.169
 convenient calendar improved gallery 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.909
 maps and more 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:07.829
 notification center is a very cool topic 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.450
 notification center this window is something 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.709
 resembles a curtain in smartphones with 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.659
 various notifications and 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.609
 switches you can control wi-fi 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.530
 enable / disable do not disturb 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.449
 and so on is very convenient that now everything 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.549
 menschen and even from third-party applications 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:22.799
 displayed in one place settings 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.840
 windows 8 system settings suffered 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.519
 somehow a split personality there were 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.440
 modernity settings and which often 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.329
 the old school panel appeared 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.549
 The controls have now corrected this moment. 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.959
 and in fact today and the panel 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.549
 control can be generally forgotten 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.010
 unless you need to tweak something 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.780
 very strange and incomprehensible to him 20 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.239
 split the screen into several parts 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.220
 could have been in windows 8 but in the top ten 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.989
 this topic is finally improved now 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.150
 the display can be divided immediately into four 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.159
 parts and open at the same time modern 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.989
 applications and classic applications to 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.000
 the system itself suggests what 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.129
 programs running video recording in 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.840
 Xbox also appeared in the top ten 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.849
 Xboxbox app with very cool 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.709
 chip video recording and record 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.269
 screencast is possible not only in games and 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.040
 being in other programs for example 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.750
 nothing prevents to open chrome and 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.669
 show your friends how fascinating you are 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.349
 flipping through facebook tape 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:11.970
 go to the desktop as a video recording 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.349
 free update is interrupted 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.000
 I think one of the key factors 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.470
 which will force the majority 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.419
 users go to windows 10 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.159
 will be exactly the possibility of free 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.940
 updates get OSes on 

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:22.620
 freebie can 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.630
 owners of windows 7 windows 8 and 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.550
 windows insider program members 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.410
 but if you have windows xp or don't let 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.450
 God of course windows vista you have to 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.700
 lay out the ecosystem windows pro 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.600
 phone and windows rt can forget now 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.280
 on all devices 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.680
 operating system will be called 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.360
 just windows in our case also with 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.610
 prefix 10 only here for now and 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.680
 tablets will be windows 10 pro ilhom 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.960
 and for smartphones about ten minutes mobile for 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.430
 the internet of things and the yukiko continuum 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.990
 a function called continuum 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.270
 recognized to fix a global problem 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.800
 system eightes impossible in the same way 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.540
 convenient to use on the tablet and 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.400
 computer everywhere had something 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.050
 now I donate to Windows myself 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.510
 when you work at the keyboard and 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.190
 mouse and when you move your finger across the screen in 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.260
 depending on this and adjusts 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.270
 the interface is generally running windows 10 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.750
 cool thank you satya done now 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.750
 my best friend
