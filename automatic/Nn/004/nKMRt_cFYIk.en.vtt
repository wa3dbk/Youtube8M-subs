building<00:02:17.160> out<00:02:17.340> his<00:02:17.550> frame<00:02:17.940> physically<00:02:18.690> and

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
building out his frame physically and

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.800 
building out his frame physically and
not<00:02:19.920> figuring<00:02:20.459> out<00:02:20.580> who<00:02:20.819> he<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.000> as<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.420> player<00:02:21.660> I

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
not figuring out who he is as a player I

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.500 
not figuring out who he is as a player I
think<00:02:22.230> ultimately<00:02:22.590> it's<00:02:23.550> about<00:02:23.670> hustle<00:02:24.300> it's

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
think ultimately it's about hustle it's

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.509 
think ultimately it's about hustle it's
about<00:02:24.690> being<00:02:25.019> physical<00:02:25.500> being<00:02:25.739> in<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.220> paint

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
about being physical being in the paint

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.790 
about being physical being in the paint
