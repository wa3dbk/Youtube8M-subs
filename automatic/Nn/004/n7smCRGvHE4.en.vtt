00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.759 
embedded using gravity forms which is a
great<00:00:20.330> plugin<00:00:20.600> if<00:00:20.840> you<00:00:20.900> want<00:00:21.020> to<00:00:21.109> put<00:00:21.230> forms<00:00:21.619> on

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
your WordPress website but the default

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.409 
your WordPress website but the default
formatting<00:00:25.369> of<00:00:25.519> this<00:00:25.669> form<00:00:25.939> is<00:00:26.089> completely

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:31.999 
like this in a previous tutorial but

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:33.250 
like this in a previous tutorial but

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
standing of the submit button is the

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.349 
standing of the submit button is the
default<00:00:38.960> that<00:00:39.289> comes<00:00:39.649> with<00:00:40.190> gravity<00:00:41.120> forms

I'm<00:00:43.640> using<00:00:43.940> which<00:00:44.210> is<00:00:44.359> a<00:00:44.390> parallax<00:00:44.899> Pro<00:00:45.469> theme

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
I'm using which is a parallax Pro theme

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.849 
I'm using which is a parallax Pro theme
by<00:00:46.160> studiopress<00:00:46.329> and<00:00:47.350> you<00:00:48.350> see<00:00:48.559> at<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:48.800> moment

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
by studiopress and you see at the moment

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.639 
by studiopress and you see at the moment
it's<00:00:49.160> black<00:00:49.430> with<00:00:50.149> white<00:00:50.570> writing<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:51.590> I'm

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
it's black with white writing and I'm

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.009 
it's black with white writing and I'm
gonna<00:00:51.739> hover<00:00:51.980> over<00:00:52.340> it<00:00:52.370> it<00:00:52.609> turns<00:00:52.789> pink<00:00:53.149> with

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
gonna hover over it it turns pink with

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.000 
gonna hover over it it turns pink with
white<00:00:54.460> writing<00:00:55.460> still<00:00:56.030> and<00:00:56.600> that<00:00:57.199> formatting

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
white writing still and that formatting

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.829 
white writing still and that formatting
is<00:00:58.219> because<00:00:58.579> this<00:00:58.850> color<00:00:59.059> theorem<00:00:59.359> using<00:00:59.539> it

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
is because this color theorem using it

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:02.680 
is because this color theorem using it
is<00:01:00.019> basically<00:01:00.410> black<00:01:00.769> and<00:01:01.359> you<00:01:02.359> go<00:01:02.480> to<00:01:02.539> the

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
is basically black and you go to the

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.229 
is basically black and you go to the
bottom<00:01:03.050> it's<00:01:03.379> got<00:01:03.559> pink<00:01:03.980> elements<00:01:04.610> with<00:01:04.790> it<00:01:04.910> so

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
bottom it's got pink elements with it so

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.390 
bottom it's got pink elements with it so
this<00:01:05.690> is<00:01:05.870> a<00:01:05.900> default<00:01:06.290> styling<00:01:06.890> that<00:01:07.100> has<00:01:07.250> been

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
this is a default styling that has been

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.580 
this is a default styling that has been
taken<00:01:07.820> up<00:01:07.940> by<00:01:08.090> gravity<00:01:08.630> forms<00:01:08.900> what<00:01:09.500> we're

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.410 
taken up by gravity forms what we're
going<00:01:09.710> to<00:01:09.770> do<00:01:09.829> is<00:01:09.950> going<00:01:10.070> to<00:01:10.159> change<00:01:10.369> this<00:01:10.610> so

so<00:01:53.539> that's<00:01:53.689> what<00:01:53.780> we<00:01:53.840> need<00:01:53.960> to<00:01:54.110> do<00:01:54.259> so<00:01:55.250> now<00:01:55.399> we

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
so that's what we need to do so now we

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.450 
so that's what we need to do so now we
go<00:01:55.759> into<00:01:56.030> appearance<00:01:56.119> and<00:01:56.960> editor<00:01:57.469> to<00:01:58.130> open<00:01:58.369> up

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
go into appearance and editor to open up

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.209 
go into appearance and editor to open up
the<00:01:58.640> CSS<00:01:59.119> style<00:01:59.420> sheet<00:01:59.750> for<00:02:00.409> this<00:02:00.560> theme<00:02:00.860> i

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
the CSS style sheet for this theme i

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.730 
the CSS style sheet for this theme i
will<00:02:01.700> need<00:02:01.850> to<00:02:02.060> find<00:02:02.359> the<00:02:02.570> styling<00:02:03.140> for<00:02:03.350> former

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
will need to find the styling for former

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.730 
will need to find the styling for former
seven<00:02:04.090> so<00:02:05.090> I'm<00:02:05.149> just<00:02:05.270> gonna<00:02:05.509> do<00:02:06.049> ctrl<00:02:06.500> F

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
seven so I'm just gonna do ctrl F

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.660 
seven so I'm just gonna do ctrl F
they're<00:02:07.549> gonna<00:02:07.729> look<00:02:08.000> for<00:02:09.310> underscore<00:02:10.310> seven

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
they're gonna look for underscore seven

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.660 
they're gonna look for underscore seven
because<00:02:10.880> I<00:02:10.940> know<00:02:11.380> styling<00:02:12.380> code<00:02:12.890> has<00:02:13.190> up<00:02:13.370> on<00:02:13.519> it

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
because I know styling code has up on it

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.050 
because I know styling code has up on it
and<00:02:14.170> here<00:02:15.170> we<00:02:15.200> go

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
and here we go

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.910 
and here we go
this<00:02:17.060> is<00:02:17.629> all<00:02:17.989> styling<00:02:18.650> for<00:02:18.739> the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
this is all styling for the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.640 
this is all styling for the
different<00:02:19.220> elements<00:02:19.790> of<00:02:19.970> this<00:02:20.959> form<00:02:21.319> and<00:02:21.590> we

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
different elements of this form and we

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.250 
different elements of this form and we
did<00:02:21.860> all<00:02:21.950> this<00:02:22.250> in<00:02:22.520> a<00:02:22.670> previous<00:02:23.090> tutorial

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
did all this in a previous tutorial

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.070 
did all this in a previous tutorial
which<00:02:24.260> there<00:02:24.620> was<00:02:24.739> a<00:02:24.770> link<00:02:24.980> for<00:02:25.569> but<00:02:26.569> what<00:02:26.930> we

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
which there was a link for but what we

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.970 
which there was a link for but what we
want<00:02:27.319> is<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:29.420> code<00:02:29.870> here<00:02:30.380> specifically

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
want is this code here specifically

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.960 
want is this code here specifically
because<00:02:31.130> this<00:02:31.430> is<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:32.080> code<00:02:33.080> for<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:34.459> submit

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
because this is the code for the submit

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.059 
because this is the code for the submit
button<00:02:35.319> and<00:02:36.319> this<00:02:36.530> is<00:02:36.590> what<00:02:36.680> we've<00:02:36.800> done<00:02:36.830> so

or<00:02:46.940> solid<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:47.569> this<00:02:48.290> color<00:02:48.620> here<00:02:48.860> which<00:02:49.069> is

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
or solid and this color here which is

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.870 
or solid and this color here which is
the<00:02:49.580> blue<00:02:49.910> color<00:02:51.130> so<00:02:52.130> we<00:02:52.190> just<00:02:52.340> need<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.519> add<00:02:52.670> to

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
the blue color so we just need to add to

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.540 
the blue color so we just need to add to
this<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.239> change<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:53.890> so<00:02:54.890> there's<00:02:55.069> nothing<00:02:55.220> in

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
this to change it so there's nothing in

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.880 
this to change it so there's nothing in
here<00:02:55.790> that<00:02:56.209> tells<00:02:56.239> us<00:02:56.840> what<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.470> color<00:02:57.709> of<00:02:57.799> the

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
here that tells us what the color of the

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.259 
here that tells us what the color of the
button<00:02:58.010> is<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.489> also<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.760> color<00:02:59.030> of<00:02:59.150> the

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
button is and also the color of the

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.670 
button is and also the color of the
hover<00:02:59.420> button<00:02:59.750> because<00:03:00.049> that's<00:03:00.230> already

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
hover button because that's already

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.059 
hover button because that's already
styled<00:03:01.400> somewhere<00:03:02.269> else<00:03:02.510> for<00:03:03.319> standard

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
styled somewhere else for standard

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.640 
styled somewhere else for standard
buttons<00:03:04.519> with<00:03:04.940> this<00:03:05.060> theme<00:03:05.450> but<00:03:06.080> we<00:03:06.290> can<00:03:06.470> go

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
buttons with this theme but we can go

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.140 
buttons with this theme but we can go
and<00:03:06.860> write<00:03:06.980> some<00:03:07.130> code<00:03:07.280> in<00:03:07.430> who<00:03:07.580> here<00:03:08.000> and

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
and write some code in who here and

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.600 
and write some code in who here and
overwrite<00:03:08.450> this<00:03:08.630> so<00:03:09.380> first<00:03:10.250> off<00:03:10.400> we<00:03:10.519> want

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
overwrite this so first off we want

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.770 
overwrite this so first off we want
background<00:03:12.580> which<00:03:13.580> specifies<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.450> color<00:03:14.690> of

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
background which specifies the color of

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.320 
background which specifies the color of
the<00:03:14.840> background<00:03:15.019> and<00:03:15.730> you<00:03:16.730> want<00:03:16.880> this<00:03:17.000> to<00:03:17.180> be<00:03:17.299> a

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
the background and you want this to be a

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.460 
the background and you want this to be a
pink<00:03:17.690> color<00:03:18.380> and<00:03:19.269> I<00:03:20.269> know<00:03:20.569> that<00:03:20.959> this<00:03:21.140> pink

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
pink color and I know that this pink

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.530 
pink color and I know that this pink
color<00:03:21.799> is<00:03:24.670> this<00:03:25.670> code<00:03:25.910> so<00:03:26.060> it's<00:03:26.150> going<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.329> copy

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
color is this code so it's going to copy

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.570 
color is this code so it's going to copy
in

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
in

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.450 
in
okay<00:03:29.420> so<00:03:29.750> that's<00:03:30.050> in<00:03:30.290> theory<00:03:30.590> should<00:03:31.190> change

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
okay so that's in theory should change

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.490 
okay so that's in theory should change
the<00:03:31.640> background<00:03:32.060> color<00:03:32.300> from<00:03:32.540> black<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:33.080> pink

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
the background color from black to pink

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.790 
the background color from black to pink
on<00:03:34.280> this<00:03:34.460> button<00:03:36.160> so<00:03:37.160> refresh<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:37.700> homepage

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
on this button so refresh the homepage

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.910 
on this button so refresh the homepage
and<00:03:39.800> it<00:03:39.950> has<00:03:40.130> just<00:03:40.460> great<00:03:41.560> but<00:03:42.560> now<00:03:42.740> when<00:03:42.890> I

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
and it has just great but now when I

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.980 
and it has just great but now when I
hover<00:03:43.070> over<00:03:43.340> it<00:03:43.370> nothing<00:03:43.700> happens<00:03:43.780> so<00:03:44.780> we<00:03:44.840> need

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
hover over it nothing happens so we need

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.800 
hover over it nothing happens so we need
to<00:03:45.110> set<00:03:45.380> a<00:03:45.410> hover<00:03:45.830> background<00:03:46.700> color<00:03:46.970> now<00:03:47.240> to

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
to set a hover background color now to

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.380 
to set a hover background color now to
be<00:03:47.930> a<00:03:47.960> lighter<00:03:48.260> pink<00:03:48.740> color<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.550> your<00:03:49.970> sources

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390

white but I wanted it to be a bolder
thicker<00:05:24.919> white<00:05:26.860> so<00:05:28.960> this<00:05:29.960> is<00:05:30.020> the<00:05:30.349> styling<00:05:31.039> for

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
thicker white so this is the styling for

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.020 
thicker white so this is the styling for
the<00:05:31.479> non<00:05:32.479> hover<00:05:32.719> button<00:05:33.050> so<00:05:33.229> we<00:05:33.319> just<00:05:33.439> need<00:05:33.590> to

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
the non hover button so we just need to

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:40.119 
the non hover button so we just need to
do<00:05:35.030> a<00:05:35.680> front<00:05:36.680> wait<00:05:38.379> and<00:05:39.379> now<00:05:39.560> we<00:05:39.620> can<00:05:39.979> either

00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:40.129 
do a front wait and now we can either

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:42.399 
do a front wait and now we can either
write<00:05:40.340> bold<00:05:40.639> in<00:05:40.909> here<00:05:41.240> or<00:05:41.509> we<00:05:41.629> can<00:05:41.659> write<00:05:41.960> the

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:42.409 
write bold in here or we can write the

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:44.890 
write bold in here or we can write the
number<00:05:42.620> 900<00:05:43.310> in<00:05:43.400> here<00:05:43.729> which<00:05:44.210> represents<00:05:44.360> a

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
number 900 in here which represents a

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.950 
number 900 in here which represents a
thicker<00:05:45.650> darker<00:05:46.099> font<00:05:47.000> so<00:05:47.569> I'm<00:05:47.659> gonna<00:05:47.780> use

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
thicker darker font so I'm gonna use

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.070 
thicker darker font so I'm gonna use
nine<00:05:48.169> hundred<00:05:49.449> board<00:05:50.449> will<00:05:50.659> do<00:05:50.750> the<00:05:50.870> same

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
nine hundred board will do the same

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:58.019 
nine hundred board will do the same
effect<00:05:51.819> I'll<00:05:52.819> update<00:05:53.000> that<00:05:56.229> fresh<00:05:57.229> this<00:05:57.349> page

00:05:58.019 --> 00:05:58.029 
effect I'll update that fresh this page

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:06.189 
effect I'll update that fresh this page
see<00:05:59.029> that<00:05:59.180> Texas<00:05:59.629> got<00:05:59.810> bolder<00:06:00.319> now<00:06:05.020> so<00:06:06.020> when<00:06:06.139> we

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199 
see that Texas got bolder now so when we

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.570 
see that Texas got bolder now so when we
hover<00:06:06.349> over<00:06:06.529> it<00:06:06.770> we<00:06:06.919> want<00:06:07.069> the<00:06:07.129> text<00:06:07.310> to<00:06:07.430> go

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
hover over it we want the text to go

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.200 
hover over it we want the text to go
from<00:06:07.729> white<00:06:07.939> to<00:06:08.539> a<00:06:09.279> darker<00:06:10.279> gray<00:06:10.520> color<00:06:10.879> so<00:06:11.090> we

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
from white to a darker gray color so we

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.610 
from white to a darker gray color so we
add<00:06:11.479> that<00:06:11.779> now<00:06:12.050> so<00:06:12.949> we've<00:06:13.069> got<00:06:13.219> the<00:06:13.310> color<00:06:14.620> so

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
add that now so we've got the color so

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.010 
add that now so we've got the color so
again<00:06:15.650> this<00:06:16.009> actually<00:06:16.520> there's<00:06:16.669> no

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
again this actually there's no

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.179 
again this actually there's no
indication<00:06:18.020> here<00:06:18.349> of<00:06:18.469> the<00:06:18.560> color<00:06:18.800> of<00:06:18.889> the<00:06:18.979> font

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:19.189 
indication here of the color of the font

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:20.589 
indication here of the color of the font
because<00:06:19.370> again<00:06:19.639> that<00:06:19.669> styles<00:06:20.180> somewhere<00:06:20.479> else

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:20.599 
because again that styles somewhere else

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:22.540 
because again that styles somewhere else
when<00:06:20.750> the<00:06:20.839> theme<00:06:21.080> styling<00:06:21.650> general<00:06:22.370> themes
