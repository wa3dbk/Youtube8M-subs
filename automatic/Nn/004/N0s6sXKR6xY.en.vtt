00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
record on my new server or on my actual

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.840 
record on my new server or on my actual
server<00:01:20.570> on<00:01:21.290> a<00:01:21.350> new<00:01:21.680> plugin<00:01:22.189> you<00:01:22.520> know<00:01:22.640> that

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
server on a new plugin you know that

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.690 
server on a new plugin you know that
could<00:01:22.970> be<00:01:23.060> our<00:01:23.240> very<00:01:23.510> own<00:01:23.600> maybe<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:24.680> yeah<00:01:25.159> I

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
could be our very own maybe so yeah I

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.370 
could be our very own maybe so yeah I
was<00:01:26.240> thinking<00:01:26.330> maybe<00:01:26.630> like<00:01:26.900> the<00:01:27.049> survival

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
was thinking maybe like the survival

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.539 
was thinking maybe like the survival
game<00:01:27.500> show<00:01:27.650> and<00:01:27.830> it's<00:01:27.950> really<00:01:28.130> good<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:28.430> stuff

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
game show and it's really good and stuff

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.910 
game show and it's really good and stuff
but<00:01:28.970> it<00:01:29.090> was<00:01:29.180> kind<00:01:29.390> of<00:01:29.450> getting<00:01:29.630> a<00:01:29.689> little<00:01:29.720> old

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
but it was kind of getting a little old

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
might add into the server because right

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.499 
might add into the server because right
now<00:01:49.100> you<00:01:49.159> see<00:01:49.400> those<00:01:49.520> black<00:01:49.790> and<00:01:49.850> yellow

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
now you see those black and yellow

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.020 
now you see those black and yellow
checkered<00:01:51.110> spots<00:01:51.710> that's<00:01:51.979> spots<00:01:52.400> for<00:01:52.640> plugins

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
checkered spots that's spots for plugins

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.030 
checkered spots that's spots for plugins
that<00:01:53.210> can't<00:01:53.570> really<00:01:53.840> go<00:01:54.020> there<00:01:54.259> because<00:01:54.500> of

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
that can't really go there because of

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.700 
that can't really go there because of
the<00:01:55.369> servers<00:01:55.759> like<00:01:56.439> incapability<00:01:57.439> of<00:01:57.530> like

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
the servers like incapability of like

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.399 
the servers like incapability of like
just<00:01:58.189> more<00:01:59.119> stuff<00:01:59.329> added<00:01:59.930> to<00:02:00.020> it<00:02:00.110> because<00:02:00.290> of

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
just more stuff added to it because of

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:01.870 
just more stuff added to it because of
RAM<00:02:00.680> issues<00:02:01.070> but<00:02:01.310> that<00:02:01.340> is<00:02:01.549> not<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.759> case

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
RAM issues but that is not the case

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.120 
RAM issues but that is not the case
anymore<00:02:02.119> we<00:02:02.390> have<00:02:02.540> a<00:02:02.570> lot<00:02:02.990> more<00:02:03.020> RAM<00:02:03.380> now<00:02:03.590> which

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
anymore we have a lot more RAM now which

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.800 
anymore we have a lot more RAM now which
means<00:02:04.369> it's<00:02:04.520> a<00:02:04.610> lot<00:02:04.729> faster<00:02:05.210> and<00:02:05.240> there<00:02:05.570> will

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
means it's a lot faster and there will

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.289 
means it's a lot faster and there will
be<00:02:05.840> a<00:02:05.990> lot<00:02:06.200> more<00:02:06.229> slots<00:02:06.710> I<00:02:06.890> tell<00:02:07.070> you<00:02:07.220> so<00:02:07.820> yeah<00:02:08.269> I
