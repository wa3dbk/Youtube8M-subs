00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.710
 project of a palette or lollipop with 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.420
 stylized foods I will use 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.000
 inexpensive and easy materials 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.890
 find as a circumference of 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.900
 anime or deco x of 12 centimeters of 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:30.830
 diameter paint cold paper tape 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.920
 a stick of height 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:37.239
 anime very little scratched silicone gun 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.239
 and a brush 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.990
 let's start with this beautiful 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.610
 project that I know you will love 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.250
 this will help them decorate their pacifier 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.320
 it was centerpieces or children's parties 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.450
 as I told you I'm going to use a 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.489
 Circumference of anime or icopor of 12 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.400
 centimeters in diameter but you 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.629
 can make the size you want 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.730
 we have our cylinders our 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.260
 circumference of 12 centimeters 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.059
 look, we have our tall stick 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.930
 I previously already painted it so that 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:09.280
 it looks so natural and we stick it in here 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.799
 the middle of our circumference 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.550
 in this way we are going to place the 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.250
 painting 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.230
 to be able to seal our striped anime 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.110
 in our previous video I would 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.200
 I explained how we grate the anime for 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.940
 be able to make the textured piece 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.780
 We place the whole piece throughout the 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.030
 circumference 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.040
 I'm using the color in this case 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.200
 purple because I cheered up scratched at the 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.610
 I painted purple and yellow and 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.010
 I want it to suit me with what I'm 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.860
 working but you can perform 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.910
 the color you want this project is very 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.520
 I know I will help you 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.340
 very much they will like it and it's easy 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.340
 elaborate are easy to find pieces 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.760
 in all countries reported by the 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.480
 unicef or the anime we already put all the 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.670
 painting 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.140
 let's place our grated anime 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.670
 think that it is painted purple and 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.710
 yellow 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.590
 yellow purple cap remind 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.240
 paint it with whatever you want is from your 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.759
 preferably as the 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.670
 circumference that support elaborate of the 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:14.000
 size we want we always place it 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.610
 that the piece is left with a lot 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.520
 anime striped so that they emerge 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.530
 Perfect texturized 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.970
 the painting we put it remember 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.360
 so you can paste our anime 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.330
 striped to make it 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.990
 we place and we leave 2 minutes to remove 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.990
 our piece 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.910
 and it's been 2 minutes we're going to 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.710
 remove the excess of our food 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.240
 stylized 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.620
 see how he is doing we are giving him 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.379
 slowly 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.720
 and he sticks us that painting 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.310
 remember this anime put the 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.040
 scratched in another previous video les 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.560
 we explain how to grate the anime so that 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.319
 we left the textured piece look at what 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.060
 beautiful is staying we can make it 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.459
 to the size you want to suck 10 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.010
 centimeters in diameter of 15 of 20 of 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.470
 30 depends what you want we are going to 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.330
 remove a little here the anime to be able to 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.370
 Keep working 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.600
 I had previously painted the 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.340
 but you can go 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.680
 removing the edges and also place 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.930
 the striped anime and so we have all the 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.360
 piece textured also by the part 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.580
 from behind that is your preference 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.200
 how are we going to elaborate it in our 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.870
 paper tape will finish 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.510
 decorate our plug or palette 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.030
 we put silicon to hit the 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.970
 back side 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.240
 It is a simple and very practical project 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.190
 beautiful to hit the back 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.590
 so that we are decorated like this 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.910
 our party well decorated so that 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.500
 our fact to be able to place them in 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.050
 our pacifier the centerpieces 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.190
 Look how nice we have to remember that the 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.410
 you can perform by the color of your 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.080

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.430
 for decorating the pacifier 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.730

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.450
