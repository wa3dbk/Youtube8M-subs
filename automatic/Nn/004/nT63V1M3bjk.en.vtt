00:05:38.769 --> 00:05:38.779 
course you remember that hostgator had

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:41.409 
course you remember that hostgator had
these<00:05:38.990> digits<00:05:39.529> here<00:05:39.770> so<00:05:40.099> all<00:05:40.460> you<00:05:40.819> would<00:05:41.029> have

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
these digits here so all you would have

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.300 
these digits here so all you would have
to<00:05:41.689> do<00:05:41.870> is<00:05:42.050> you<00:05:42.169> would<00:05:42.289> have<00:05:42.499> to<00:05:42.710> change<00:05:42.949> that

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
to do is you would have to change that

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.390 
to do is you would have to change that
number<00:05:43.550> to<00:05:43.789> the<00:05:44.659> four<00:05:45.499> digits<00:05:46.240> like<00:05:47.240> that<00:05:47.629> so

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
number to the four digits like that so

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.529 
number to the four digits like that so
but<00:05:49.400> we're<00:05:49.580> not<00:05:49.729> going<00:05:49.879> to<00:05:49.999> do<00:05:50.210> it<00:05:50.360> because

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:50.539 
but we're not going to do it because

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:53.050 
but we're not going to do it because
we're<00:05:50.900> dealing<00:05:51.259> with<00:05:51.289> Bluehost<00:05:51.949> right<00:05:52.490> now<00:05:52.699> so

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
we're dealing with Bluehost right now so

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.409 
we're dealing with Bluehost right now so
we<00:05:53.719> just<00:05:53.900> have<00:05:54.050> NS<00:05:54.409> one<00:05:54.650> here<00:05:54.979> so<00:05:55.219> now<00:05:55.909> after

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419 
we just have NS one here so now after

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:59.350
