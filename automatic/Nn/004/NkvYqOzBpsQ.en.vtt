how I record on boom beach now first off
I<00:00:13.740> want<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.009> start<00:00:14.190> off<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.700> say<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:15.420> this

I want to start off and say that this

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.830 
I want to start off and say that this
method<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.349> I<00:00:16.410> use<00:00:16.550> isn't<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:18.029> best<00:00:18.300> method

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
method that I use isn't the best method

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.470 
method that I use isn't the best method
that<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.110> could<00:00:19.259> possibly<00:00:19.680> use<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:21.029> I'm<00:00:21.330> not

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
that you could possibly use and I'm not

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.790 
that you could possibly use and I'm not
saying<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:22.020> it's<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.320> highest<00:00:22.529> quality

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
saying that it's the highest quality

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.300 
saying that it's the highest quality
that<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.220> could<00:00:23.369> possibly<00:00:23.550> use<00:00:23.820> but<00:00:24.449> for<00:00:25.109> me

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
that you could possibly use but for me

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.339 
that you could possibly use but for me
it's<00:00:26.310> worked<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.630> know<00:00:27.750> what<00:00:28.050> they<00:00:28.170> say

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
it's worked and you know what they say

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.950 
it's worked and you know what they say
if<00:00:28.560> it's<00:00:28.740> not<00:00:28.920> broken<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:30.090> know<00:00:30.179> don't<00:00:30.420> fix<00:00:30.779> it

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
if it's not broken you know don't fix it

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.400 
if it's not broken you know don't fix it
I<00:00:31.170> use<00:00:31.800> two<00:00:32.129> programs<00:00:32.790> when<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.090> record<00:00:33.629> one<00:00:34.170> is

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
I use two programs when I record one is

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.189 
I use two programs when I record one is
airserver<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.970> what<00:00:36.239> mirrors<00:00:36.750> my

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
airserver that is what mirrors my

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:39.590 
airserver that is what mirrors my
phone's<00:00:37.589> display<00:00:37.949> onto<00:00:38.549> my<00:00:38.670> computer<00:00:38.729> monitor

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
phone's display onto my computer monitor

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.619 
phone's display onto my computer monitor
so<00:00:40.229> that<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.409> can<00:00:40.530> see<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.190> wider<00:00:42.000> view<00:00:42.299> but

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
so that I can see it in wider view but

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.619 
so that I can see it in wider view but
also<00:00:42.839> i<00:00:43.110> use<00:00:43.650> a<00:00:43.680> second<00:00:44.250> program<00:00:44.640> called<00:00:45.180> fraps

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
also i use a second program called fraps

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.890 
also i use a second program called fraps
and<00:00:45.960> fraps<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.979> what<00:00:47.190> records<00:00:47.790> that<00:00:48.239> display

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
and fraps is what records that display

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.579 
and fraps is what records that display
on<00:00:49.199> my<00:00:49.350> computer<00:00:49.830> monitor<00:00:50.809> both<00:00:51.809> airserver

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:52.589 
on my computer monitor both airserver

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:55.490 
on my computer monitor both airserver
and<00:00:52.769> preps<00:00:53.309> are<00:00:53.610> not<00:00:53.790> free<00:00:54.239> programs<00:00:54.869> but

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
and preps are not free programs but

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.490 
and preps are not free programs but
there<00:00:55.799> are<00:00:55.830> workarounds<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.729> that<00:00:57.199> you<00:00:58.199> can

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
there are workarounds to that you can

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.740 
there are workarounds to that you can
pay<00:00:58.860> money<00:00:59.100> for<00:00:59.250> airserver<00:01:00.030> but<00:01:00.390> it's<00:01:00.540> not

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
pay money for airserver but it's not

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.320 
pay money for airserver but it's not
exactly<00:01:01.199> required<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.949> download<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.729> free<00:01:02.970> trial

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
exactly required I download a free trial

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.100 
exactly required I download a free trial
for<00:01:03.839> air<00:01:03.960> sober<00:01:04.439> which<00:01:04.949> lasts<00:01:05.369> about<00:01:05.430> one<00:01:05.850> week

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
for air sober which lasts about one week

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.350 
for air sober which lasts about one week
but<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.860> only<00:01:08.070> catch<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.730> that<00:01:08.910> I<00:01:08.940> have<00:01:09.210> to

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
but the only catch is is that I have to

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.540 
but the only catch is is that I have to
register<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.810> new<00:01:10.020> email<00:01:10.200> address<00:01:10.410> and<00:01:11.100> go<00:01:11.340> on

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
register a new email address and go on

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.570 
register a new email address and go on
at<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.940> airserver<00:01:12.300> website<00:01:12.870> and<00:01:13.580> basically

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
at the airserver website and basically

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.540 
at the airserver website and basically
refresh<00:01:15.180> my<00:01:15.420> trial<00:01:15.810> for<00:01:16.140> another<00:01:16.920> week<00:01:17.190> so

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
refresh my trial for another week so

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.240 
refresh my trial for another week so
basically<00:01:18.300> every<00:01:18.630> week<00:01:18.840> I'm<00:01:19.080> making<00:01:19.500> another

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
basically every week I'm making another

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.720 
basically every week I'm making another
email<00:01:20.640> address<00:01:21.120> and<00:01:22.610> registering<00:01:23.610> with

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
email address and registering with

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.290 
email address and registering with
airserver<00:01:24.540> again<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:26.040> link<00:01:26.970> will<00:01:27.150> be<00:01:27.270> in

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
airserver again so that link will be in

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.580 
airserver again so that link will be in
the<00:01:27.480> description<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.230> can<00:01:28.350> download

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
the description so you can download

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.340 
the description so you can download
airserver<00:01:29.250> if<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.790> would<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.270> choose<00:01:30.600> there

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
airserver if you would so choose there

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.920 
airserver if you would so choose there
are<00:01:31.500> plenty<00:01:31.800> of<00:01:31.980> other<00:01:32.159> mirroring<00:01:32.930> programs

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
are plenty of other mirroring programs

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.600 
are plenty of other mirroring programs
out<00:01:34.200> there<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.620> the<00:01:34.770> internet<00:01:35.100> i<00:01:35.310> use

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
out there on the internet i use

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.240 
out there on the internet i use
airserver<00:01:36.120> but<00:01:36.780> there<00:01:36.930> are<00:01:36.960> definitely<00:01:37.950> other

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
airserver but there are definitely other

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.000 
airserver but there are definitely other
alternatives<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.420> may<00:01:40.290> or<00:01:40.440> may<00:01:40.560> not<00:01:40.590> cost

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
alternatives that may or may not cost

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.580 
alternatives that may or may not cost
money<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.430> I've<00:01:42.240> looked<00:01:42.630> for<00:01:42.900> better<00:01:43.050> ones<00:01:43.260> that

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
money I I've looked for better ones that

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.410 
money I I've looked for better ones that
don't<00:01:43.770> cost<00:01:43.980> money<00:01:44.280> but<00:01:44.400> this<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.210> one

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
don't cost money but this is the one

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.240 
don't cost money but this is the one
that<00:01:45.810> seems<00:01:46.260> to<00:01:46.470> get<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.710> best<00:01:46.830> result

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
that seems to get the best result

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.969 
that seems to get the best result
perhaps<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.510> program<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.020> also<00:01:49.350> costs

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
perhaps is a program that also costs

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.730 
perhaps is a program that also costs
money<00:01:50.190> and<00:01:50.330> unlike<00:01:51.330> airserver<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.380> trial

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
money and unlike airserver the trial

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.719 
money and unlike airserver the trial
version<00:01:52.860> isn't<00:01:53.750> very<00:01:54.750> good<00:01:55.200> it's<00:01:55.650> it<00:01:56.130> it's

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
version isn't very good it's it it's

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.899 
version isn't very good it's it it's
very<00:01:56.880> restricted<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.500> went<00:01:59.490> ahead<00:01:59.640> and

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
very restricted so I went ahead and

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.880 
very restricted so I went ahead and
bought<00:02:00.120> fresh<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:01.080> not<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.380> expensive

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
bought fresh it's not that expensive

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.570 
bought fresh it's not that expensive
over<00:02:02.460> program<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.540> it's<00:02:04.080> very<00:02:04.530> affordable<00:02:05.250> for

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
over program so it's very affordable for

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.070 
over program so it's very affordable for
a<00:02:05.610> lot<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.880> people<00:02:06.030> though<00:02:06.630> if<00:02:06.780> you're<00:02:06.930> not

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
a lot of people though if you're not
