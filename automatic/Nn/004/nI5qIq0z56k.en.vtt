00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.510
 the gsm network constantin video about that 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.800
 new call of duty advanced thighter in the 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.289
 today there is little to get new weapons 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.759
 or weapons technologies 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.289
 we have officially confirmed 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.029
 So this is a real one this time 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.669
 official source namely gameinformer 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.739
 So has a game set in quasi over game 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.149
 informer that announced and therefore 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.009
 we have as official information 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:31.539
 about new weapons and unfortunately still 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.160
 get no name for the weapons 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.360
 that's not so bad right now because of that 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.830
 Weapons are not there anyway 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.120
 the market and therefore we are taking 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.310
 not so much help 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.300
 we just got pictures and one 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.340
 description of the weapons 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.140
 the images are a leaf I was 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.520
 Make sure you get the strike 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.540
 but all linked without exaggeration 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.610
 So you can calm down times 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.020
 look first as a plasma 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.250
 Weapon announced this is here 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.300
 Of course, there was already energy 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.550
 a video over it is the case 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.140
 amazon in the description it was is 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.480
 A plasma weapon, so to speak 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.940
 virtually any plasma rays or 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.170
 anything in there is also there 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.400
 picture in the description there you can 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.989
 seen not so much on it that 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.850
 Tettnang's high-tech weapon can do that 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.840
 you think so too yes I am too 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.890
 really very curious how that 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.450
 works and if they are for it 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.369
 would give multiplayer 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.810
 so if that would happen, i hope so 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.520
 that not so that's me one 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.020
 fun weapon is not too much like it is now 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.490
 is strong and not that there 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.139
 actually always with the laser somehow 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.060
 So did I hope that they the 

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:23.229
 really balanced and general 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.600
 I think I do not think so great though 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.060
 because people are in herne with plasma 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.319
 Things are going on but I want to go now 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.729
 not here in person will be the new call 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:32.979
 of duty so I want to talk about the 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.539
 first wait but I think it stops 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.670
 not so mega I think now 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.929
 currently in the description of the plasma 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.969
 understood us that is similar 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.450
 like the suv in black ops 2 clearly that 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.399
 I believe 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.429
 in the campaign there is such a thing 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.170
 mission if you are such a person 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.359
 convoy had to defend because you have yes 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.770
 somehow a high tech suv the 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:53.049
 somehow through walls could watch the 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.179
 also so plasma collisions has excluded 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.759
 So there is that a similar effect 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.259
 will have and I hope that has not 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.909
 so strong it was in the campaigns in 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.740
 black ops 2 this suv was natural 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.119
 pretty strong but if you are in the now 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.490
 install multiplayer I think that it 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.899
 then something is left so balanced 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.220
 takes the plasma what else do we have one 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.869
 but I'm new high-tech weapon 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.730
 somehow interesting find that 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.100
 I think now quite averse if the 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.380
 the 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.540
 the player came in and that a 3d 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.770
 printer weapon I'm only at the beginning 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.600
 thought that this weapon just one 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.760
 3d printer would have been pressed though 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.190
 if you are not cool enough and though 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.110
 this weapon has a small 3d printer 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.870
 some inside, so to speak, so to speak 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.300
 and in this 3d printer then press the 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.810
 Ammunition for the weapon so presses quasi 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.270
 So the bullets stop the ammunition 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.620
 printing this printer virtually and thereby 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.180
 would of course only rarely after 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.350
 do not load in maybe what so 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.690
 I do not know by name yet 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.610
 what if you have to go to country 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.520
 you almost always just press it again 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.560
 so you have the 9 the new matter or 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.690
 what these weapons so what the bullets 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.040
 installed by simply refill 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.630
 but so the weapons must be quasi 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.250
 Regenerate yourself again and again 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.540
 that's definitely what i find 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.710
 pretty interesting and only 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.200
 really interesting such a funny one 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.730
 I think of an idea and that's what I find 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.980
 even very funny if that is in the 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.810
 multiplayer in it I would have remembered 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.730
 not whether whether one so the Sun from so 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.680
 as a player would find really good 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.210
 because somehow that with the reload 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.380
 Of course, it costs a bit of time 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.070
 but then you have a full one too 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.690
 magazine 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.100
 and if this weapon then always one 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.870
 All of us need to get busy again 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.330
 to have charged and you can quasi 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.980
 do nothing about that again around the 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.390
 again to recharge that can too 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.590
 just not be a bit annoying 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.970
 opponents come but one still has 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.890
 no full magazine times that long 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.750
 where else you just need to land 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.500
 So that could possibly happen 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.000
 be a problem 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.150
 on the funny man, yes , such a 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.770
 display i believe 173 out of 200 then 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.540
 it could be that this weapon 200 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.590
 shot and then I think that 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.120
 In any case, they will do little harm 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.410
 i have my 200 shot is more than one 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.910
 mg and that does not look very special now 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.280
 hard to get out of the gun that looks like this 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.290
 assault rifle an assault rifle with 200 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.850
 shot then it will be safe 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.380
 and a minor damage have like 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.940
 I can not imagine otherwise 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.630
 if you are 200 then yes 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.430
 damn much 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.410
 or that they are really that extreme 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.690
 slowly reloaded but i just think 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.070
 that the damage in the extremely low 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.200
 it is held that you are like many 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.640
 balls need yes these are the new ones 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.260
 weapons technologies we have so far 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.400
 I have also announced 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.570
 pretty curious if we have more 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.370
 i could get myself pretty 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.930
 well imagine and I'm pretty much there 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.700
 curious if we have something in multiplayer 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.380
 'm going to be over the 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.510
 All new weapons have talked come 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.850
 we on his old weapon namely the 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.900
 fun 12 that was already when I can 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.610
 I would not remember it 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.750
 were black ops was the belief that was 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.030
 namely in the multiplayer but in the 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.290
 campaign also all the fun 12 was yes 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.300
 everywhere in call of duty actually 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.770
 somewhere and that is also the 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.330
 First weapon really with names 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.220
 it was announced that somehow 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.160
 in advanced or fall and that will be 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.050
 to give an interview with the audio service 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.060
 and in this interview he had 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.660
 shortly the spas 12 recorded so as 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.640
 example 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.740
 we have changed how the weapons 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.910
 So it was right on it 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.710
 he also said that is not now 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.530
 Guess that sounds like it's almost 12 years old 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.450
 was really fun 12 and dieter short 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.920
 and that means whole now 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.870
 not what 12 again in call of duty 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.740
 it is awarded transpower 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.240
 of course do not believe in it 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.190
 multiplayer or in single player though 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.710
 maybe even real multiplayer 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.690
 if you still show this weapon and 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.700
 so will be in any case also from the 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.200
 sound pretty cool so it sounds 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.160
 much better than the boss of the 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.970
 The rider had that kind of thing 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.540
 bit compared 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.740
 so jashari audio effects weapons too 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.200
 be overworked 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.030
 and that's how it all works 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.040
 pretty good of the new call of duty im 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.380
 Of course, everything is almost automatic 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.850
 to be like that also with big but in such a way 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.360
 At the moment I really do not think so 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.920
 pretty good 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.120
 I'm curious how that with the 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.610
 all new high tech things in the 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.460
 multiplayer will look and write 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.290
 your opinion on plasma whole in 3d 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.970
 printer completely and the fun meet 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.140
 multiplayer and when it drove her 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.940
 I have myself a thumb after 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.300
 look up and that's it for today skin 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.300
 wanted to
