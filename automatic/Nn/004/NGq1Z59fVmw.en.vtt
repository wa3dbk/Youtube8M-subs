00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.269
 macity net.it shows me how it is 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.910
 It is possible to manage a home automation system 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.519
 complete with apple watch apple watch in 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:19.820
 this case is connected to a gateway 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:24.320
 external of viva is the vira ed 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.670
 which can connect to 1200 devices 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.609
 through the z wave protocol 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.929
 wireless protocol and through wifi e 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.840
 clearly through applications 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.219
 furniture you can connect to your home 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.850
 alarm lighting systems 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.809
 thermostats security systems 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.910
 sprinklers management systems 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.950
 of energy and all through of 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.610
 mobile applications for control 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.500
 direct of your iphone in this case 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.309
 but the application we have to see 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.750
 which is called vi ramake allows you to 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.780
 manage your gateway directly 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.420
 from apple watch indeed on board 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.729
 you will really find a range of 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.740
 devices listed in a list that 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.090
 are the ones we installed in 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.930
 home lamps commanded sockets and also the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.900
 possibility to manage directly 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.520
 of the scenario macros by pressing 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.729
 this button we enter inside 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.040
 of the list of rooms in which it is divided 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.729
 in the home and inside it 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.920
 we find the lamp and device sockets 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.350
 installed in this case we have the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.540
 lamp which in the cooking area where there 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.270
 we find at this moment that he can 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.520
 be directly turned on or pushed 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.439
 from the apple watch screen we can 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.939
 also control the coffee machine 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.140
 programming it terrarium awakening 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.210
 morning 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.560
 or simply by turning on the 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.659
 pushing back through the socket 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.479
 controlled directly with a button 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.280
 on the apple watch screen 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.469
 but here we see the switch on and 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.979
 switching off our base of 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.659
 charging to which a lamp is connected 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.610
 but to note that we can impart i 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.170
 our commands also with the voice indeed 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:18.459
 to sitting at the icon with the microphone 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:21.220
 here you can launch a command or in 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:25.510
 this case in English is practically the 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.090
 gateway will turn off the lamp thanks to the 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.430
 command that comes from iphone and iphone 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.870
 from apple watch choosing from the list 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.790
 present on the products we can activate 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.930
 alarms to launch scenarios and all with 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.930
 the pressure of a simple button
