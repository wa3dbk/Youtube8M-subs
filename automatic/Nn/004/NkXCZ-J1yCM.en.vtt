00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.430 
can't agree on is that the Dark Knight
totally<00:01:12.950> makes<00:01:13.159> any<00:01:13.430> other<00:01:13.729> Batman<00:01:14.090> movie

Fletcher's performance was good

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.599 
Fletcher's performance was good
it<00:01:45.320> doesn't<00:01:45.740> change<00:01:45.799> Nicholson's

performance in Tim Burton's Batman it's

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.669 
performance in Tim Burton's Batman it's
still<00:01:49.729> what<00:01:49.969> it<00:01:50.090> was<00:01:50.299> and<00:01:50.810> more<00:01:51.140> to<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:51.469> point

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
still what it was and more to the point

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.289 
still what it was and more to the point
it's<00:01:52.039> still<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.399> same<00:01:52.609> performance<00:01:52.939> people

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
it's still the same performance people

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.080 
it's still the same performance people
were<00:01:53.509> raving<00:01:53.719> about<00:01:54.170> before<00:01:54.829> the<00:01:54.979> Dark<00:01:55.189> Knight

were raving about before the Dark Knight
now<00:01:57.079> I<00:01:57.110> can<00:01:57.380> see<00:01:57.590> that<00:01:57.799> maybe<00:01:57.979> in<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.490> lives<00:01:58.670> of

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
now I can see that maybe in the lives of

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.569 
now I can see that maybe in the lives of
his<00:01:58.939> ledges<00:01:59.360> performance<00:01:59.899> Jack<00:02:00.799> seems<00:02:01.220> a

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
his ledges performance Jack seems a

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.730 
his ledges performance Jack seems a
little<00:02:01.970> over<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.479> top<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:03.110> fee<00:02:03.259> a<00:02:03.290> trickle

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
little over the top and fee a trickle

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.550 
little over the top and fee a trickle
however<00:02:04.369> he<00:02:05.000> was<00:02:05.149> acting<00:02:05.539> in<00:02:05.689> a<00:02:05.780> film<00:02:05.960> that<00:02:06.439> was

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
however he was acting in a film that was

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.380 
however he was acting in a film that was
Tim<00:02:06.799> Burton's<00:02:07.250> vision<00:02:07.610> of<00:02:07.759> Batman<00:02:08.119> not

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
Tim Burton's vision of Batman not

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.050 
Tim Burton's vision of Batman not
Nolan's<00:02:08.929> if<00:02:09.289> you<00:02:09.979> put<00:02:10.190> Jack's<00:02:10.459> performance

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
Nolan's if you put Jack's performance

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.699 
Nolan's if you put Jack's performance
Jack<00:02:11.390> Nicholson's<00:02:11.750> performance<00:02:12.170> in<00:02:12.380> The<00:02:12.470> Dark

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
Jack Nicholson's performance in The Dark

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.070 
Jack Nicholson's performance in The Dark
Knight<00:02:12.800> it<00:02:13.700> wouldn't<00:02:14.090> work<00:02:14.269> with<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.780> tone<00:02:15.050> of

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
Knight it wouldn't work with the tone of

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.199 
Knight it wouldn't work with the tone of
the<00:02:15.349> rest<00:02:15.500> of<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.709> film<00:02:15.950> but<00:02:16.640> I<00:02:16.700> feel<00:02:16.940> within

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
the rest of the film but I feel within

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.140 
the rest of the film but I feel within
the<00:02:17.300> context<00:02:17.810> of<00:02:17.900> Burton's<00:02:18.349> Batman<00:02:19.150> Jack

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
the context of Burton's Batman Jack

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.270 
the context of Burton's Batman Jack
Nicholson<00:02:20.630> was<00:02:20.750> perfect<00:02:21.290> as<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.590> Joker<00:02:21.860> I

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
Nicholson was perfect as the Joker I

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.240 
Nicholson was perfect as the Joker I
think<00:02:23.180> also<00:02:23.390> due<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.019> relatively<00:02:24.890> subdued

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
think also due to the relatively subdued

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.640 
think also due to the relatively subdued
performance<00:02:26.030> of<00:02:26.150> Heath<00:02:26.300> Ledger<00:02:26.569> I<00:02:26.900> think

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
performance of Heath Ledger I think

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.259 
performance of Heath Ledger I think
people<00:02:27.920> forget<00:02:28.069> that<00:02:28.459> Jack's<00:02:28.730> Joker<00:02:29.120> was

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
people forget that Jack's Joker was

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.809 
people forget that Jack's Joker was
still<00:02:29.540> violent<00:02:30.019> and<00:02:30.170> uncaring<00:02:30.860> you<00:02:31.400> only<00:02:31.610> have

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
still violent and uncaring you only have

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.380 
still violent and uncaring you only have
to<00:02:31.970> remember<00:02:32.350> that<00:02:33.350> kill<00:02:33.709> with<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.010> pen<00:02:34.390> just
