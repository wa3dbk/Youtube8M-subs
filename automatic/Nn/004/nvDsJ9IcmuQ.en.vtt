00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.160 

one<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:08.910> most<00:00:09.090> common<00:00:09.480> questions<00:00:09.660> I'm

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
one of the most common questions I'm

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.410 
one of the most common questions I'm
asked<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:10.920> how<00:00:11.400> do<00:00:11.460> you<00:00:11.640> photograph<00:00:12.150> people

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
asked is how do you photograph people

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.610 
asked is how do you photograph people
wearing<00:00:12.960> glasses

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
wearing glasses

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.339 
wearing glasses
this<00:00:14.280> needn't<00:00:14.700> be<00:00:14.820> too<00:00:15.030> much<00:00:15.210> of<00:00:15.389> an<00:00:15.480> issue<00:00:15.599> in

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:16.349 
this needn't be too much of an issue in

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.439 
this needn't be too much of an issue in
fact<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:16.949> find<00:00:17.339> the<00:00:17.519> biggest<00:00:17.759> problem<00:00:18.329> with

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
fact I find the biggest problem with

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.839 
fact I find the biggest problem with
glasses<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.619> ones<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:20.009> go<00:00:20.159> dark<00:00:20.489> in<00:00:20.699> the

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:20.849 
glasses is the ones that go dark in the

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.089 
glasses is the ones that go dark in the
Sun<00:00:21.089> these<00:00:21.989> act<00:00:22.289> like<00:00:22.470> neutral<00:00:22.919> density

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.099 
Sun these act like neutral density

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.329 
Sun these act like neutral density
filters<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:23.970> look<00:00:24.089> like<00:00:24.269> sunglasses<00:00:25.069> so<00:00:26.069> on<00:00:26.310> a

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:26.339 
filters and look like sunglasses so on a

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:28.519 
filters and look like sunglasses so on a
sunny<00:00:26.640> day<00:00:26.729> we<00:00:27.509> end<00:00:27.659> up<00:00:27.810> by<00:00:27.960> having<00:00:27.989> to<00:00:28.380> wait

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
sunny day we end up by having to wait

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.769 
sunny day we end up by having to wait
around<00:00:28.710> thirty<00:00:29.220> minutes<00:00:29.669> or<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.029> for<00:00:30.239> them<00:00:30.630> to

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
around thirty minutes or so for them to

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.370 
around thirty minutes or so for them to
clear<00:00:31.019> before<00:00:31.319> we<00:00:31.559> can<00:00:31.829> shoot<00:00:32.840> it's<00:00:33.840> all<00:00:34.080> about

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
clear before we can shoot it's all about

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.800 
clear before we can shoot it's all about
the<00:00:34.590> angle<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.010> reflectance<00:00:35.610> if<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.420> take<00:00:36.660> this

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:36.810 
the angle of reflectance if I take this

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.400 
the angle of reflectance if I take this
tennis<00:00:37.230> ball<00:00:37.470> and<00:00:37.650> throw<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:37.950> straight<00:00:38.370> down

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
tennis ball and throw it straight down

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.110 
tennis ball and throw it straight down
it<00:00:40.410> hits<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.890> floor<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.400> bounces<00:00:41.850> straight

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
it hits the floor and bounces straight

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.840 
it hits the floor and bounces straight
back<00:00:42.360> if<00:00:42.900> I<00:00:43.410> throw<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.740> at<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.950> wall<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.730> would

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
back if I throw it at a wall it would

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.300 
back if I throw it at a wall it would
also<00:00:45.030> bounce<00:00:45.420> straight<00:00:45.720> back<00:00:46.050> but<00:00:46.830> if<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.070> throw

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 
also bounce straight back but if I throw

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.410 
also bounce straight back but if I throw
it<00:00:47.490> out<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.820> front<00:00:47.970> of<00:00:48.210> me<00:00:48.300> like<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:50.090> it<00:00:51.090> hits

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
it out in front of me like this it hits

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.780 
it out in front of me like this it hits
the<00:00:51.600> floor<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.140> bounces<00:00:52.829> off<00:00:52.980> at<00:00:53.130> exactly<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
the floor and bounces off at exactly the

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.860 
the floor and bounces off at exactly the
same<00:00:53.970> angle<00:00:54.240> light<00:00:55.170> does<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.560> same<00:00:56.420> okay<00:00:57.420> so

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
same angle light does the same okay so

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.860 
same angle light does the same okay so
here<00:00:58.140> we<00:00:58.290> have<00:00:58.470> Ashley<00:00:58.710> wearing<00:00:59.280> her<00:00:59.400> glasses

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
here we have Ashley wearing her glasses

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.770 
here we have Ashley wearing her glasses
now<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.350> first<00:01:01.590> question<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:02.220> would<00:01:02.640> ask<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:03.120> do

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
now the first question I would ask is do

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.989 
now the first question I would ask is do
you<00:01:03.930> wear<00:01:04.079> your<00:01:04.110> glasses<00:01:04.259> all<00:01:04.829> the<00:01:04.859> time<00:01:04.999> if

00:01:05.989 --> 00:01:05.999 
you wear your glasses all the time if

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:08.840 
you wear your glasses all the time if
the<00:01:06.299> answer's<00:01:06.689> no<00:01:06.719> then<00:01:07.409> problem<00:01:07.859> solved<00:01:08.340> take

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
the answer's no then problem solved take

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.779 
the answer's no then problem solved take
them<00:01:09.030> off<00:01:09.179> but<00:01:10.020> if<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.289> answer<00:01:10.469> is<00:01:10.740> yes<00:01:11.069> then

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:11.789 
them off but if the answer is yes then

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:14.630 
them off but if the answer is yes then
we<00:01:11.999> have<00:01:12.149> to<00:01:12.299> live<00:01:12.450> with<00:01:12.630> them<00:01:13.280> we<00:01:14.280> need<00:01:14.490> to

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
we have to live with them we need to

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.309 
we have to live with them we need to
think<00:01:14.850> about<00:01:15.149> where<00:01:15.420> we<00:01:15.569> place<00:01:15.869> our<00:01:16.079> light

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:16.319 
think about where we place our light

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:18.620 
think about where we place our light
source<00:01:16.679> if<00:01:16.979> it's<00:01:17.549> here<00:01:17.969> then<00:01:18.329> I'm<00:01:18.420> going<00:01:18.600> to

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
source if it's here then I'm going to

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.209 
source if it's here then I'm going to
get<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> huge<00:01:19.200> reflection<00:01:19.829> which<00:01:20.039> will

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:20.219 
get a huge reflection which will

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:22.910 
get a huge reflection which will
obliterate<00:01:20.490> Ashley's<00:01:21.299> eyes<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:22.530> light<00:01:22.740> is

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
obliterate Ashley's eyes the light is

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.629 
obliterate Ashley's eyes the light is
bouncing<00:01:23.429> back<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:24.179> like<00:01:24.359> the<00:01:24.539> tennis<00:01:24.749> ball

00:01:25.629 --> 00:01:25.639 
bouncing back just like the tennis ball

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:28.249 
bouncing back just like the tennis ball
it's<00:01:26.639> the<00:01:26.789> most<00:01:27.060> natural<00:01:27.359> thing<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:27.899> the<00:01:28.049> world

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
it's the most natural thing in the world

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.559 
it's the most natural thing in the world
to<00:01:28.499> see<00:01:28.710> reflections<00:01:29.159> in<00:01:29.520> glasses<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.420> we

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:30.569 
to see reflections in glasses but we

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.760 
to see reflections in glasses but we
must<00:01:30.990> see<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.590> eyes<00:01:33.079> so<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.259> first<00:01:34.499> thing<00:01:34.740> to

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
must see the eyes so the first thing to

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.129 
must see the eyes so the first thing to
do<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.520> move<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.060> light<00:01:36.240> further<00:01:36.659> around

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:37.139 
do is to move the light further around

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:39.889 
do is to move the light further around
to<00:01:37.950> make<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.249> angle<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.819> reflectance<00:01:39.420> much

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
to make the angle of reflectance much

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.379 
to make the angle of reflectance much
more<00:01:40.200> shallow<00:01:40.499> so<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.459> light<00:01:41.670> reflects<00:01:42.179> over

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:42.389 
more shallow so the light reflects over

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:46.969 
more shallow so the light reflects over
there<00:01:42.959> and<00:01:43.229> not<00:01:43.829> into<00:01:44.159> my<00:01:44.279> camera<00:01:45.619> now<00:01:46.619> if

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
there and not into my camera now if

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.149 
there and not into my camera now if
Ashley<00:01:47.819> gently<00:01:48.329> turns<00:01:48.630> her<00:01:48.869> head<00:01:48.929> we<00:01:49.770> can<00:01:49.950> move

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
Ashley gently turns her head we can move

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.940 
Ashley gently turns her head we can move
any<00:01:50.490> reflection<00:01:51.240> we<00:01:51.420> do<00:01:51.659> have<00:01:51.959> right<00:01:52.709> to<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
any reflection we do have right to the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.699 
any reflection we do have right to the
edge<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.310> her<00:01:53.399> glasses<00:01:53.670> as<00:01:54.350> she<00:01:55.350> moves<00:01:55.590> her

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
edge of her glasses as she moves her

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.370 
edge of her glasses as she moves her
head<00:01:56.009> from<00:01:56.399> side<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.759> side<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.569> up<00:01:58.109> and<00:01:58.319> down

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
head from side to side and up and down

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.010 
head from side to side and up and down
you<00:01:59.249> can<00:01:59.429> see<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.849> reflection<00:02:00.029> moving<00:02:03.020> okay

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
you can see the reflection moving okay

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.050 
you can see the reflection moving okay
actually<00:02:04.139> a<00:02:04.349> nice<00:02:04.649> big<00:02:04.920> smile<00:02:05.189> that's<00:02:05.549> lovely

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
actually a nice big smile that's lovely

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.620 
actually a nice big smile that's lovely
great<00:02:06.709> by<00:02:07.709> using<00:02:08.009> small<00:02:08.550> movements<00:02:09.119> we<00:02:09.479> will

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
great by using small movements we will
