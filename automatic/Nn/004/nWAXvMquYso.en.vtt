 Russian t-90 and American image 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.160
 a person not an initiate might think 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.009
 what are the machines of different classes 390 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.970
 47 tons much lighter than American 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.680
 against 64 it is much more compact at 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.350
 looks not so impressive 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.530
 however, in the global arms markets these 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.950
 cars direct competitors this is due 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.600
 and in similar combat potential 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.910
 today evaluate the security of the machine 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.570
 simple comparison of the thickness of the armor can not 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.059
 need to know what it is in armor 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.260
 and brahms used depleted uranium 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.120
 she t-90 built-in dynamic protection 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.730
 according to the Americans frontal armor 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.289
 and brahms proved its reliability in 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.059
 during the wars in iraq 91 and 2003 she 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.519
 withstand hitting the Soviet 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.679
 125 caliber armor piercing shells 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.989
 millimeters it does not say that 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:03.290
 what we are talking about this masks shot with 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.649
 armament is still seventy third year 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.170
 moreover 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:10.439
 modern shells on games 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.689
 did not shoot frontal armor then 90 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.780
 test time fired newest 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.219
 sabot cumulative shells 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.840
 equal in effectiveness by the most 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:22.750
 modern projectile 120 mm 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.750
 guns and brahms able to 200 meters 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.670
 the tank was fired six shells 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.109
 after that the car came under its own power 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.500
 to the observation deck 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:34.750
 then, without repairing the bartco and 90 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.969

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:42.579
 the armor is not pierced damaged only

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.679
 during the fighting in iraq in 2003 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.130
 March and Brahms made their way from rpg-7 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:53.579
 grenades even the very first samples in 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.250
 iraq revealed a weak spot and brahms 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.899
 tank auxiliary power unit 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.610
 ensuring the work of all electronics in 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.159
 the moment when the main engine 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.399
 drown out it is easy to hit 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.940
 from large-caliber machine gun at t-90 in 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:12.099
 force is under the main armor 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.430
 besides 390 even in standard 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.629
 performance are equipped with a complex 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.420
 opto-electronic curtain suppression 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:23.240
 this system takes away enemy missiles 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.760
 abrams side of such equipment 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.110
 dueling situations an american tank is unlikely 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.080
 whether will be able to resist 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.050
 guided missile t-90 launched 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.500
 through the throat the barrel cannon is working 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.580
 distance of 95 kilometers 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.990
 firing accuracy in this case 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.270
 approaching absolute 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.340
 rocket can shoot from place and 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.370
 movements to the same for its use 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.030
 no special skills required

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.140

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.170
 tungsten 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.360
 in no way inferior to its competitor 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.640
 American projectile core from 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.200
 depleted uranium 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.840
 similar shells were developed and 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.090
 us but they are extremely harmful for the crew 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.880
 their mass production was postponed 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.590
 for a rainy day 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.020
 the tank must be able to destroy not only 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.220
 armored targets but also as they say 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.650
 military tanks dangerous living force ie 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.600
 rocket launchers and tour calculations in this before 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.060

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.019
 shells include shrapnel 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.540
 remote blasting 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.209
 you can blow it right over your heads 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.940
 enemy soldiers or even near combat 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:42.180
 helicopters like shells from Abrams 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.250
 no for a long time not without the help of western 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.709
 military journals it was thought that 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.800
 electronics and optical devices of ours 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.900
 tanks mildly not perfect on 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.600
 actually complex fire control 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.370
 t-90 is not inferior to NATO 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.590
 analogues more 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.630
 this tank belongs to the unofficial 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.209
 record of accuracy and rate of fire 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.560

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.950
 located at ranges 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.930
 from one and a half to two and a half 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.049

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.910

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.360
 t-90 has the longest hand in

 tank world early options t-90 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.400
 Abrams inferior in mobility with 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.470
 the appearance of a thousand strong engines our 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.009
 the tank is almost on par with brahms 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.169
 therefore the most important indicator 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.129
 and on terrain, these two tanks in general 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.319
 cannot be compared 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:50.879
 at the arms exhibition in abu dhabi 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:53.939

 Abram immediately sleep lost a caterpillar on

 the usual slope of the exhibition tankodrome 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:01.529
 and ours on competitive tests passed 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.869
 almost three thousand kilometers along

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:11.580
 competitor he showed himself perfectly and 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:15.779
 we enter the march through the Indian desert Tar 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.699
 heat exceeding 50 degrees is indispensable 

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:21.300
 demand in the combat technology of the future 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:23.610
 high informatization of machines near 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.370
 future on the t-90 will install a new 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.409
 satellite navigation equipment such 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.689
 way and bronze lose your 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:33.809
 last advantage over our 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:35.399
 tanks today t-90 

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:36.330
 superior to brahms by most 

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:39.529
 indicators 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.930
 but their correspondence competition ends 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:43.620
 possibilities of their modernization are practically 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.180
 exhausted 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.590
 and the battlefield will soon be released tanks 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.590
 next generation
