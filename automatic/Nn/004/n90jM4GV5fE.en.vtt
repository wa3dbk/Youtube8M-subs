00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.569
 today I want to show you how to activate 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.179
 the administrator account on windows 8 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.480
 then first we recall the 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.170
 screen by pressing the windows key 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.820
 on the keyboard or simply 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.539
 approaching the lower corner a 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.840
 left 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.619
 here we are once we go down to 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.220
 right 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.650
 we open our bar we're up 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.560
 search 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.510
 let 's look for the command prompt with cfd 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.660
 at one of the commands you see we click it 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.879
 with the right button and we do run like 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.100
 administrator 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.910
 here it is, this is our hero 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.670
 commands now what are we going to write 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.870
 to activate the administrator account 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.469
 just 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:05.939
 then let's write the et 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:13.110
 space user space administrator space 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:13.700
 slash in contrast to active two points of 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.180
 s 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.790
 we press send here is how you see it there 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.560
 an outgoing command execution cycle 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.080
 we have activated a point at a 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.600
 administrator 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.829
 now when we go on 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.290
 login screen 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.460
 we will find a new account 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.290
 administrators and from there we can 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.460
 carry out all the operations that 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.450
 we want 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.680
 if we want to disable it instead 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:50.369
 we will rewrite the same thing 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:51.540
 the other species otherwise active 2 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.560
 points 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.509
 no execution as an exit we have 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.920
 turned off so he sang it 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.369
 administrators 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.259
 the procedure is very simple so if 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.740
 you need to activate it to do 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:10.170
 run programs that maybe come 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.989
 blocked or you need 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.530
 permits for anything for this 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.770
 simple 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.050
 procedure and you can do all that 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.819
 what do you want 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.709
 anything 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.010
 this was a brief guide to the magazine 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.730
 view you have questions write in 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.220
 comments 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.640

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.640
