00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:22.680
 hello friends welcome back and he 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:25.760
 shoot back at 8pm and 8pm 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.760
 is shot back 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:33.870
 yes there are some news that 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:38.340
 go short times by specifically on the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.140
 super test was object 777 we brought 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.290
 have only really meant bad 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.360
 and now they have that 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.190
 practically a little ammann so the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.670
 closing rate and the single time 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.750
 bit improved stabilization was 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:59.120
 improves when the speed is around 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:03.239
 two degrees increased and the driving resistance 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:09.119
 something is reduced then we still have that 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.799
 Changes in the cards from 9.7 to 9.8 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.470
 and that is what we see here is that 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.689
 map karelien what has been changed here 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.580
 we see a passage here 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.700
 there is one here he is just the rock 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.270
 right now and here we have one now 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.509
 right by passage no 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.640
 diarrhea but by driving and me 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.170
 mine that the driveways are not 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.049
 more so steep are or may be 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.670
 a little gentler so that one 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:42.479
 several ask because the bottom still 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.149
 still not so far is ever 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.360
 the card and was the one because that was 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.149
 here is this song river 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.610
 Dried dried and it became 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.759
 made it passable here that one 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:01.680
 can also drive down from the top 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:03.420
 the green you have the mountains well here 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.259
 that's a bit flatter here 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.259
 a passage in it 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.010
 who made the flat passage though 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.660
 they that mountain that even so 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.819
 if you can start without going from here 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.720
 one drove in here one would from 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.440
 shot at here 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.930
 it is possible to drive about it more 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.470
 possible tactical possibilities possible 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.470
 direct tactics 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.280
 and what is here 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.140
 here the driveway was made gentler 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.300
 so it's easier to get up here and 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.650
 Here, too, I think so that looks like that 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.870
 as if you were here again 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.450
 come up otherwise you always slipped 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.860
 just down and did not come up and 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:50.480
 also anyway making it the 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:53.420
 Siegfried Line 7 0.8 There is a month 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.880
 is dark what would have been here in detail 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:00.890
 changed 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:02.630
 So there is a level is the street 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.940
 been raised a bit and now 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.640
 Here are so like that so here 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.060
 more or less coverage has at both 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.060
 pages 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.980
 this delle here I think was 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.690
 bulged accurately and this hill away 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.000
 made from the hill you could quite 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.500
 cut well as here in the 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.299
 city 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.530
 so that's natural 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:29.030
 Enlightenment possibilities also dropped 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.390
 if you keep looking this is 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.070
 actually pretty bright I do not know 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.340
 which is pretty much here 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:41.049
 exactly as it was before 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:47.660
 if you look here too pretty 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:53.030
 the whole houses are pretty much the same 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:59.049
 he does not see anything changed 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.049
 exactly what but something was changed 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:06.980
 So in the city was never so much money 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.340
 mainly here i believe and west 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.340
 is missing 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.160
 the best what we like you so 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.320
 these hills where made the way and it 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.239
 only gives a few more or less 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.190
 flatter height that is to drive here 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.710
 no heavy tanks more clearly 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.580
 because here as well as the artillery now 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.190
 very easy 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.820
 The hill does not bother at all now 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:35.210
 The city was expanded here both 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:43.040
 pages too deep for me and we see 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:45.680
 but that has a bit on it 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.410
 it has been flattened here 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:53.360
 bit shallower made all this 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:56.360
 added bumps so we're here like that 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.690
 one has a kind of limitation here 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.670
 start up and there is the level you can 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:08.840
 maybe also all cover from the 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:13.160
 It seems that exploiting the city exists here 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:15.170
 Another hill can be seen with the 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.000
 maybe scout or with the fast 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.480
 medium behind it very quickly 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.480
 slip 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:36.530
 here is a bit of faith in detail 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.530
 I became a bit softer because 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.810
 come here but stay in undingen 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:47.760
 so very often panzer hanging which 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:50.900
 Newcomers to this driveway is almost 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.900
 stayed the same 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.650
 only this one has been shortened so that 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.290
 you can boot up here and not 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.570
 definitely have to boot up here yes 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:08.460
 probably a bit of rock 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:11.160
 bit shortened and then you can too 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.260
 Look here that the forest believes 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:18.350
 Once again it was just chewed through 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:20.760
 even fewer trees here even less 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.900
 possibility i know this is so good 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.900
 I have
