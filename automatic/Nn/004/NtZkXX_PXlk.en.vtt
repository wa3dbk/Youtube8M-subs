00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
if you press a button so what you have

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.220 
if you press a button so what you have
to<00:00:25.980> do<00:00:26.189> all<00:00:26.609> example<00:00:27.269> with<00:00:27.390> this<00:00:27.539> monitor<00:00:27.810> you

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
to do all example with this monitor you

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.179 
to do all example with this monitor you
know<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.529> buttons<00:00:28.859> are<00:00:29.039> on<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.250> back<00:00:30.679> so<00:00:31.679> you

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
know the buttons are on the back so you

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.319
