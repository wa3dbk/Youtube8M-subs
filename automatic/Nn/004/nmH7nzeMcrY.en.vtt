00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.080
 presented the new glove receiver 3 2 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:20.810

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:25.110
 high-end glove a price of 85 euros 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.779
 a large specialized for for the 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.910
 wetlands and soft ground 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.189
 with a 2 aquatec foam that is a 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.010
 very good quality foam 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:39.390
 it's the only foam especially rain 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.219
 designed for rock rain so 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.850
 a foam with a good grip on 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.710
 wetlands 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.730
 however, it will still be necessary 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.030
 moisten the foam for who is 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.399
 really good grip 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.010
 otherwise at the level of the cut found 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:02.670
 the cuts are therefore with the fingers after 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:07.409
 formed at the natural area of the hand on 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.259

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.600

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.990

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:26.310
 body of the glove we are up to this 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:28.109
 level that will make a full bandage 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.919
 it is directly integrated with the 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:37.829

 the profuse area on the top of the glove 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.380

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:49.380
 flexibility 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:02:01.390
