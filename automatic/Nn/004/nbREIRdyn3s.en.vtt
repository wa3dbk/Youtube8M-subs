up<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.349> down<00:02:19.470> very<00:02:20.220> nice<00:02:20.489> and<00:02:21.560> I<00:02:22.560> like<00:02:23.129> the

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
up and down very nice and I like the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.940 
up and down very nice and I like the
fact<00:02:23.519> that<00:02:23.640> these<00:02:23.970> joints<00:02:24.629> at<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.590> knee<00:02:25.799> you

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
fact that these joints at the knee you

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.729 
fact that these joints at the knee you
can<00:02:25.980> spin<00:02:26.370> them<00:02:26.489> all<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.670> way<00:02:26.760> around<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.739> up

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
can spin them all the way around and up

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.930 
can spin them all the way around and up
and<00:02:29.010> down<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.790> she's<00:02:30.090> got<00:02:30.269> like<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:30.930> ratcheted

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
and down and she's got like a ratcheted

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.900 
and down and she's got like a ratcheted
foot<00:02:32.940> articulation<00:02:33.780> here<00:02:34.519> which<00:02:35.519> is<00:02:35.730> really

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
foot articulation here which is really

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.410 
foot articulation here which is really
nice<00:02:36.209> on<00:02:36.599> both<00:02:37.440> feet<00:02:37.769> and<00:02:38.190> they<00:02:38.640> also<00:02:38.670> spin

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
nice on both feet and they also spin

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.150 
nice on both feet and they also spin
around<00:02:39.510> as<00:02:39.840> well<00:02:40.019> so<00:02:40.319> that's<00:02:40.530> just<00:02:40.769> another

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
around as well so that's just another

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.289 
around as well so that's just another
nice<00:02:41.489> feature<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:43.220> they<00:02:44.220> are<00:02:44.400> they<00:02:44.849> are<00:02:45.060> kind

like these figures I'm glad I picked

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.710 
like these figures I'm glad I picked
them<00:03:01.410> up<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:02.810> here's<00:03:03.810> her<00:03:04.049> gun<00:03:04.910> which<00:03:05.910> see

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
them up and here's her gun which see

where<00:03:06.870> you<00:03:06.930> get<00:03:07.049> the<00:03:07.140> peg<00:03:07.410> each<00:03:07.709> package<00:03:08.220> comes

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
where you get the peg each package comes

with a peg and a little grenade there

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.559 
with a peg and a little grenade there
and<00:03:11.489> I<00:03:11.579> just<00:03:11.609> put<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.090> one<00:03:12.239> on<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.389> back

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
and I just put that one on the back

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.420 
and I just put that one on the back
she's<00:03:12.780> got<00:03:12.959> two<00:03:13.590> pegs<00:03:13.799> there<00:03:14.069> it<00:03:14.160> can<00:03:14.250> go<00:03:14.340> on

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
she's got two pegs there it can go on

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.390 
she's got two pegs there it can go on
either<00:03:14.549> side<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.950> it's<00:03:16.950> got<00:03:17.069> this<00:03:17.220> like

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
either side and it's got this like

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.390 
either side and it's got this like
mechanical<00:03:17.940> robot<00:03:18.299> arm<00:03:18.510> thing<00:03:18.840> here<00:03:19.079> and<00:03:19.410> be

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
mechanical robot arm thing here and be

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.490 
mechanical robot arm thing here and be
real<00:03:20.609> careful<00:03:20.849> with<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.180> feels<00:03:21.359> like<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.630> could

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
real careful with it feels like it could

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.080 
real careful with it feels like it could
be<00:03:22.680> somewhat<00:03:23.040> fragile<00:03:23.310> so<00:03:23.639> if<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:23.819> get<00:03:23.970> this

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
be somewhat fragile so if you get this

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.379 
be somewhat fragile so if you get this
figure<00:03:24.450> be<00:03:25.019> careful<00:03:25.380> with<00:03:25.500> this<00:03:25.620> arm<00:03:25.889> and<00:03:26.389> it

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
figure be careful with this arm and it

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.650 
figure be careful with this arm and it
spins<00:03:27.690> around<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:28.290> elbow<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:28.829> it<00:03:29.160> has<00:03:29.660> elbow

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
spins around the elbow and it has elbow

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.819 
spins around the elbow and it has elbow
articulation<00:03:31.170> where<00:03:31.709> moves<00:03:31.980> up<00:03:32.099> and<00:03:32.220> down<00:03:32.310> and

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
articulation where moves up and down and

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.030 
articulation where moves up and down and
the<00:03:34.829> wrist<00:03:35.040> here<00:03:35.880> on<00:03:36.030> this<00:03:36.209> one<00:03:36.389> doesn't<00:03:36.780> it

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
the wrist here on this one doesn't it

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.280 
the wrist here on this one doesn't it
doesn't<00:03:38.040> move<00:03:38.190> it's<00:03:38.639> molded<00:03:39.030> together<00:03:39.290> just

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
doesn't move it's molded together just

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.539 
doesn't move it's molded together just
so<00:03:41.130> you<00:03:41.190> know<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:43.290> gun<00:03:43.530> it's<00:03:44.220> kind<00:03:44.459> of

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
so you know and the gun it's kind of

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.449 
so you know and the gun it's kind of
nice<00:03:44.730> in<00:03:45.090> there<00:03:45.389> it's<00:03:46.319> the<00:03:46.590> hands<00:03:46.799> are<00:03:47.010> rubbery

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
nice in there it's the hands are rubbery

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.900 
nice in there it's the hands are rubbery
a<00:03:47.489> little<00:03:47.730> bit<00:03:48.109> so<00:03:49.340> you're<00:03:50.340> not<00:03:50.549> gonna<00:03:50.730> have

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
a little bit so you're not gonna have

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.789 
a little bit so you're not gonna have
too<00:03:51.090> much<00:03:51.209> of<00:03:51.269> a<00:03:51.389> hard<00:03:51.569> time<00:03:51.780> getting<00:03:52.590> her<00:03:52.769> to

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
too much of a hard time getting her to

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.390 
too much of a hard time getting her to
grip<00:03:53.209> that<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:54.419> pistol<00:03:54.810> there<00:03:54.989> is<00:03:55.139> a<00:03:55.200> gun<00:03:55.410> so

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
grip that the pistol there is a gun so

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.750 
grip that the pistol there is a gun so
it<00:03:56.459> is<00:03:56.549> really<00:03:56.790> nice<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:58.489> same<00:03:59.489> thing<00:03:59.669> with

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
it is really nice and same thing with

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.940 
it is really nice and same thing with
the<00:03:59.880> arm<00:04:00.030> here<00:04:00.419> this<00:04:01.260> one's<00:04:01.470> a<00:04:01.530> little<00:04:01.829> more

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
the arm here this one's a little more

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.009 
the arm here this one's a little more
durable<00:04:02.130> and<00:04:02.400> this<00:04:02.549> particular<00:04:02.790> one<00:04:03.239> here<00:04:03.419> has

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
durable and this particular one here has

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.870 
durable and this particular one here has
the<00:04:04.669> joint<00:04:05.669> here<00:04:06.090> and<00:04:06.950> it<00:04:07.950> does<00:04:08.130> spin<00:04:08.430> all<00:04:08.639> the

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
the joint here and it does spin all the

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.879 
the joint here and it does spin all the
way<00:04:08.910> around<00:04:09.269> so<00:04:09.540> that<00:04:10.079> gives<00:04:10.290> it<00:04:10.380> a<00:04:10.440> nice<00:04:10.590> touch

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
gun itself is very detailed to this it's

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.380 
gun itself is very detailed to this it's
an<00:04:32.570> overall<00:04:32.870> nice<00:04:33.170> figure<00:04:33.590> and<00:04:34.240> she's<00:04:35.240> got

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390

some nice hip no no mid thigh

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.020 
some nice hip no no mid thigh
articulation<00:04:39.220> that's<00:04:40.220> okay<00:04:40.550> doesn't<00:04:40.790> take

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
articulation that's okay doesn't take

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.310 
articulation that's okay doesn't take
away<00:04:41.150> from<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.480> figure<00:04:41.780> but<00:04:41.930> does<00:04:42.050> have<00:04:42.200> the

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
away from the figure but does have the

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.710 
away from the figure but does have the
hip<00:04:42.500> articulation<00:04:42.710> and<00:04:43.640> then<00:04:43.910> here<00:04:44.390> in<00:04:44.600> the

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
hip articulation and then here in the

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.710 
hip articulation and then here in the
waist<00:04:44.960> and<00:04:45.770> has<00:04:46.760> the<00:04:47.090> middle<00:04:47.570> waist

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
waist and has the middle waist

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.180 
waist and has the middle waist
articulation<00:04:47.930> can<00:04:48.470> pretty<00:04:48.590> much<00:04:48.680> spinner<00:04:49.040> all

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
articulation can pretty much spinner all

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.310 
articulation can pretty much spinner all
the<00:04:49.250> way<00:04:49.340> around<00:04:49.610> so<00:04:49.880> I'm<00:04:50.750> assuming<00:04:51.080> there's<00:04:51.230> a

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
the way around so I'm assuming there's a

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.050 
the way around so I'm assuming there's a
ball<00:04:51.530> joint<00:04:51.740> up<00:04:51.980> in<00:04:52.100> there<00:04:52.310> and<00:04:54.910> in<00:04:55.910> this

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
ball joint up in there and in this

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.280 
ball joint up in there and in this
position<00:04:56.480> here<00:04:56.630> just<00:04:56.780> about<00:04:56.960> any<00:04:57.140> way<00:04:57.230> you

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
position here just about any way you

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.650 
position here just about any way you
want

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
want

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.260 
want
so<00:04:59.660> yeah<00:05:00.440> really<00:05:00.710> nice<00:05:00.950> figure<00:05:01.280> really<00:05:02.000> well

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270
