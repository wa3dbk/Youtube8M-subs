00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.309
 hello everyone, rusalin is with you 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.990
 video channel devoted to modeling of 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.190
 Today's polymer clay master 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.100
 class we will create with you 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.140
 suspension run jars inside which 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.470
 there will be colored sand stones 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.660
 jellyfish and of course the blue water itself 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.000
 for work we will use 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.000
 glamor polymer clay 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.279
 a series of natures is an imitation of natural 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.649
 materials epoxy you 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.320
 use blade 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:40.950
 Meadows which I do the previous lesson 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.920
 tweezers glass jar and stained glass 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.050
 blue paint 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:50.910
 I try to work with plastic still old 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.910
 Sample 2010 release 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.559
 nonetheless I mash it and work with 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.710
 without any problems 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.710
 a series of natures is an imitation of natural 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.850
 materials in this case imitation 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.939
 stone 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.730
 I took 2 different shades to create 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.690
 as 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:14.660
 light or dark and now we form 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:17.390
 small balls they must be different 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.270
 sizes of different shapes some of them 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.490
 must oblong like real ones 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.340
 sea ​​pebbles you know that in 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.869
 nature does not have two identical 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.350
 pebbles all will not differ from each other 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.619
 friend 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.780
 Pebbles in my very small sizes 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.210
 it's literally two to five 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.210
 millimeters look also I will 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.420
 use polymer clay from the series 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.090
 glam series glamor comes with sparkles or 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.060
 mother of pearl use to create 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.119
 sand i will 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:53.660
 700 and the termite number in this case 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:57.950
 I don't crush the plastic I pinch off 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:02.960
 take a piece of the blade and cut the blade 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:06.259
 plastic into small pieces of pebble and 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.830
 sand we need to put a brass 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.989
 wardrobe on common while our blanks 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.120
 burned oven prepare and 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.750
 We look at the last one using disposable 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.100
 syringes 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.680
 I am two to one 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.650
 combining in one tank epoxy 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.799
 hardener resin epoxy resin 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.570
 it is a chemical compound when working with 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.570
 she should not forget about measures 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:36.080
 safety and work in disposable 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:40.190
 Gloves we combine two liquids in 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.860
 single container and wooden stick or 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.519
 spatula we mix very thoroughly 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.519
 two components 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.650
 then we take the stained blue paint 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.819
 or blue and literally dripping 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.519
 one drop 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:03.959
 paints as produced epoxy 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:07.890
 resin and mix the resin thoroughly with 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:13.439
 paint to avoid costs and weight 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:15.810
 became uniform after firing first 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:19.980
 we will need to accommodate 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:23.540
 jars of sand and then on top already 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.540
 put pebbles 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:50.079
 I mixed a little pebbles with sand 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:53.200
 Now I take and I can around 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:57.269
 and pour a little tinted like 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.269
 strong resin in a jar 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.780
 now i will take jellyfish i do them in 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.049
 previous lesson and a reference to 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.169
 for this lesson you now see below these 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.829
 jellyfish i place chopsticks first one 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.950
 jellyfish 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.120
 and share a little tinted 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.360
 epoxy resin 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.850
 and then post the second floor if you 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.850
 want you can post some 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.940
 shells seaweed fish and some 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:41.990
 other elements for the seabed i 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.620
 put 2 jellyfish and gave epoxy 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.430
 resins 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.830
 now we leave our stock dry 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.130
 heat and the main thing exactly on the sheet 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.800
 dollars in full crystallization moment 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.340
 after the resin dries we need 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.150
 take a button and stick on 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:04.430
 quick-drying glue cork we screw 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:07.220
 calm for reliability I always screw in 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.229
 2 pins pins can be fixed the hood 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.950
 you can fix the connecting rings 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:15.460
 run through them chains and on this 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:18.530
 our amazing pendant that will 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.220
 remind of the sea orite wherever you are 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.310
 were 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:27.100
 ready with you was rusalin and to new 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.100
 meetings on my video channel to all bye
