that I can be involved with you know
like<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> Reaper<00:01:30.509> us<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.020> as<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.290> cuz<00:01:31.409> i

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
like a Reaper us like that as you cuz i

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.920 
like a Reaper us like that as you cuz i
am<00:01:31.560> using<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.400> now<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.390> support<00:01:33.780> is

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
am using it now and the support is

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.480 
am using it now and the support is
really<00:01:34.140> good<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:34.619> like<00:01:34.680> search<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.310> stuff

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
really good for like search and stuff

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.069 
really good for like search and stuff
but<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.759> think<00:01:36.090> like<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.450> lot<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.750> people<00:01:36.840> are

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
but I think like a lot of people are

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.170 
but I think like a lot of people are
using<00:01:37.259> UAV<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:37.950> isn't<00:01:38.310> really<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.970> necessary

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
using UAV so isn't really that necessary

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.359 
using UAV so isn't really that necessary
to<00:01:39.659> use<00:01:39.900> support<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.740> mean<00:01:40.890> I'm<00:01:40.979> not<00:01:41.100> trying<00:01:41.159> to

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
to use support I mean I'm not trying to

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.620 
to use support I mean I'm not trying to
discourage<00:01:41.759> people<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.240> use<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.540> because

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
discourage people to use it because

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.510 
discourage people to use it because
obviously<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.619> really<00:01:43.829> helpful<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.369> for

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520

glowed<00:02:37.530> out<00:02:37.650> so<00:02:37.800> much<00:02:37.950> so<00:02:38.370> much<00:02:38.400> is<00:02:38.700> because<00:02:38.810> as

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
glowed out so much so much is because as

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.270 
glowed out so much so much is because as
opposed<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.380> ac-130<00:02:40.890> where<00:02:41.160> you're

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
opposed to the ac-130 where you're

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.070 
opposed to the ac-130 where you're
constantly<00:02:41.430> have<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:41.850> be<00:02:42.060> in<00:02:42.240> it<00:02:42.360> either<00:02:42.600> pay

constantly have to be in it either pay

far<00:02:52.290> I've<00:02:52.560> been<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.800> know<00:02:52.890> experimenting<00:02:53.550> a

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
far I've been you know experimenting a

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.550 
far I've been you know experimenting a
fair<00:02:53.760> bit<00:02:53.910> i<00:02:53.970> also<00:02:54.210> do<00:02:54.510> like<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.840> UAV<00:02:55.320> the

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
fair bit i also do like the UAV the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.320 
fair bit i also do like the UAV the
predator<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.340> overwatch<00:02:56.880> if<00:02:57.120> you're<00:02:57.240> not

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
predator and the overwatch if you're not

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.030 
predator and the overwatch if you're not
that<00:02:57.420> good<00:02:57.570> to<00:02:57.630> get<00:02:57.720> in<00:02:57.840> kill<00:02:57.990> streaks<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.380> would

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
that good to get in kill streaks I would

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.980 
that good to get in kill streaks I would
also<00:02:59.100> recommend<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.700> or<00:03:00.210> even<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.690> attacker

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
also recommend that or even the attacker

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.630 
also recommend that or even the attacker
look<00:03:01.230> up<00:03:01.320> to<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.560> aah<00:03:01.920> tix<00:03:02.160> over<00:03:02.370> watching<00:03:02.520> the

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
look up to the aah tix over watching the

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.850 
look up to the aah tix over watching the
ac-130<00:03:03.210> I<00:03:03.480> mean<00:03:04.050> it<00:03:04.140> really<00:03:04.230> just<00:03:04.440> depends<00:03:04.770> on

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
ac-130 I mean it really just depends on

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.110 
ac-130 I mean it really just depends on
the<00:03:04.920> way<00:03:05.070> you<00:03:05.100> like<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.400> play<00:03:05.520> obviously<00:03:05.850> I'm

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
the way you like to play obviously I'm

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.270 
the way you like to play obviously I'm
not<00:03:06.150> only<00:03:06.600> going<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.900> be<00:03:07.020> obviously<00:03:07.920> i'm<00:03:08.160> going

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
not only going to be obviously i'm going

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.010 
not only going to be obviously i'm going
to<00:03:08.340> start<00:03:08.490> uploading<00:03:08.850> this<00:03:09.030> support<00:03:09.840> and

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
to start uploading this support and

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.990 
to start uploading this support and
specialist<00:03:10.440> gameplays<00:03:10.890> as<00:03:11.040> well<00:03:11.190> but<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:11.580> mean

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
specialist gameplays as well but I mean

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.340 
specialist gameplays as well but I mean
it<00:03:12.090> really<00:03:12.210> just<00:03:12.390> depends<00:03:12.840> on<00:03:12.930> what<00:03:13.050> you<00:03:13.230> like

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
it really just depends on what you like

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.900 
it really just depends on what you like
to<00:03:13.530> use<00:03:13.710> but<00:03:13.890> I'm<00:03:14.040> just<00:03:14.250> finding<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:14.670> this

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
to use but I'm just finding that this

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.850 
to use but I'm just finding that this
kill<00:03:15.120> streak<00:03:15.360> in<00:03:15.480> particular<00:03:15.780> really<00:03:16.650> does

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
kill streak in particular really does

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.199 
kill streak in particular really does
help<00:03:17.010> out<00:03:17.220> especially<00:03:17.400> on<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.820> small<00:03:18.060> apps

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
help out especially on the small apps

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.460 
help out especially on the small apps
like<00:03:18.360> this<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:18.810> mean<00:03:18.840> all<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.230> maps<00:03:19.380> are

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
like this and I mean all the maps are

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.170 
like this and I mean all the maps are
pretty<00:03:19.680> small<00:03:19.890> so<00:03:19.950> your<00:03:20.730> Reaper<00:03:21.060> will

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
pretty small so your Reaper will

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.850 
pretty small so your Reaper will
generally<00:03:21.600> just<00:03:21.840> get<00:03:22.020> a<00:03:22.050> lot<00:03:22.230> of<00:03:22.260> kills<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.740> so

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
generally just get a lot of kills and so

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.440 
generally just get a lot of kills and so
are<00:03:22.980> your<00:03:23.070> predator<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.640> gentle<00:03:24.209> just<00:03:24.390> a

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
are your predator and gentle just a

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.050 
are your predator and gentle just a
really<00:03:24.690> good<00:03:24.720> Kerchak<00:03:25.140> set<00:03:25.290> up<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.500> use<00:03:25.650> and

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
really good Kerchak set up to use and

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.800 
really good Kerchak set up to use and
you<00:03:27.060> know<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.240> definitely<00:03:27.360> would<00:03:27.660> also

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
you know it definitely would also

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.900 
you know it definitely would also
recommend<00:03:28.050> you<00:03:28.320> guys<00:03:28.440> using<00:03:28.620> support<00:03:29.070> for<00:03:29.340> for

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910

know like a lot of people are using the

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.190 
know like a lot of people are using the
UAV<00:03:38.490> regardless<00:03:39.030> you<00:03:39.240> know<00:03:39.330> in<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.900> assault

UAV regardless you know in the assault

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.770 
UAV regardless you know in the assault
so<00:03:40.470> it's<00:03:40.920> not<00:03:41.040> so<00:03:41.250> necessary<00:03:41.400> but<00:03:41.940> anyway<00:03:42.660> guys

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780

like<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.450> use<00:03:45.630> I<00:03:45.660> mean<00:03:45.930> so<00:03:46.140> far<00:03:46.320> I'm<00:03:46.440> just

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
like to use I mean so far I'm just

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.930 
like to use I mean so far I'm just
finding<00:03:46.800> this<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:47.160> be<00:03:47.190> a<00:03:47.280> really<00:03:47.640> effective

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
finding this to be a really effective

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.000 
finding this to be a really effective
killstreak<00:03:48.600> because<00:03:48.959> it's<00:03:49.410> really<00:03:49.739> it's<00:03:49.830> not

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
killstreak because it's really it's not

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.710 
killstreak because it's really it's not
that<00:03:50.280> hard<00:03:50.459> to<00:03:50.520> get<00:03:50.760> I<00:03:50.790> mean<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.150> is<00:03:51.450> a<00:03:51.480> little

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
that hard to get I mean it is a little

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.940 
that hard to get I mean it is a little
bit<00:03:51.840> of<00:03:51.959> to<00:03:52.080> get<00:03:52.200> but<00:03:52.380> once<00:03:52.560> you're<00:03:52.739> in<00:03:52.830> your

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
bit of to get but once you're in your

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.070 
bit of to get but once you're in your
Reaper<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.700> most<00:03:53.970> likely<00:03:54.209> easily<00:03:54.720> get<00:03:54.900> your<00:03:55.050> a

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
Reaper you most likely easily get your a

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.650 
Reaper you most likely easily get your a
pavelow<00:03:55.380> and<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.980> cave<00:03:56.220> was<00:03:56.400> just<00:03:56.730> ridiculous

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
pavelow and the cave was just ridiculous

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.660 
pavelow and the cave was just ridiculous
it's<00:03:57.780> kind<00:03:57.930> of<00:03:57.989> like<00:03:58.110> a<00:03:58.280> chopper<00:03:59.280> gunner<00:03:59.370> but

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
it's kind of like a chopper gunner but

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.860 
it's kind of like a chopper gunner but
obviously<00:03:59.940> you<00:04:00.060> don't<00:04:00.209> have<00:04:00.300> to<00:04:00.420> be<00:04:00.510> in<00:04:00.600> it<00:04:00.720> so

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
obviously you don't have to be in it so

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.810 
obviously you don't have to be in it so
obviously<00:04:01.739> this<00:04:01.890> for<00:04:02.130> wasn't<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.430> best<00:04:02.610> I

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
obviously this for wasn't the best I

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.160 
obviously this for wasn't the best I
mean<00:04:02.850> if<00:04:03.060> I<00:04:03.120> joined<00:04:03.450> right<00:04:03.690> at<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.840> start<00:04:04.080> I

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
mean if I joined right at the start I

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.540 
mean if I joined right at the start I
could<00:04:04.350> have<00:04:04.440> maybe<00:04:04.560> gotten<00:04:04.800> 40<00:04:05.190> kills<00:04:05.400> or

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
could have maybe gotten 40 kills or

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.290 
could have maybe gotten 40 kills or
something<00:04:05.760> like<00:04:05.820> that<00:04:05.910> which<00:04:06.090> would<00:04:06.239> have

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
something like that which would have

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.060 
something like that which would have
been<00:04:06.360> awesome<00:04:06.540> but<00:04:06.750> how<00:04:07.320> many<00:04:07.410> journals<00:04:07.830> what

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070
