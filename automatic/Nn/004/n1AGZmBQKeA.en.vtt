00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
here all kinds of nasties oh okay now I

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.999 
here all kinds of nasties oh okay now I
gotta<00:01:55.250> decide<00:01:55.700> what<00:01:56.090> am<00:01:56.179> I<00:01:56.270> going<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:56.479> do

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
gotta decide what am I going to do

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.070 
gotta decide what am I going to do
because<00:01:58.009> once<00:01:58.880> I<00:01:59.030> strain<00:01:59.390> this<00:01:59.539> paint<00:01:59.869> up

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
because once I strain this paint up

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.389 
because once I strain this paint up
probably<00:02:00.619> going<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:00.800> put<00:02:00.920> it<00:02:01.009> back<00:02:01.160> in<00:02:01.310> this

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
probably going to put it back in this

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.540 
probably going to put it back in this
bucket<00:02:01.640> but<00:02:02.000> for<00:02:02.179> right<00:02:02.300> now<00:02:03.190> what<00:02:04.190> I<00:02:04.250> can<00:02:04.399> do

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
bucket but for right now what I can do

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.350 
bucket but for right now what I can do
with<00:02:04.700> this<00:02:04.850> bucket<00:02:05.740> is<00:02:06.740> I<00:02:08.649> can<00:02:09.649> clean<00:02:09.979> it<00:02:10.130> out

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
with this bucket is I can clean it out

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.270 
with this bucket is I can clean it out
that's<00:02:11.360> just<00:02:11.600> a<00:02:11.690> crummy<00:02:11.930> little<00:02:12.860> paint<00:02:13.100> brush

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
that's just a crummy little paint brush

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.400 
that's just a crummy little paint brush
here<00:02:13.750> might<00:02:14.750> as<00:02:14.840> well<00:02:14.900> get<00:02:15.020> all<00:02:15.170> this<00:02:15.350> paint

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410

out<00:02:15.860> so<00:02:16.130> that<00:02:16.250> I<00:02:16.310> can<00:02:16.490> use<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:16.880> it's<00:02:17.540> surprising

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
out so that I can use it it's surprising

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.080

how much paint you can get out of a
bucket<00:02:20.300> like<00:02:20.569> this<00:02:20.600> now<00:02:21.560> I<00:02:21.590> usually<00:02:22.069> would<00:02:22.520> let

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
bucket like this now I usually would let

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.360 
bucket like this now I usually would let
it<00:02:22.819> sit<00:02:23.060> like<00:02:23.240> this<00:02:23.300> for<00:02:23.510> I<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:24.830> know<00:02:24.950> tilt<00:02:25.250> it

back into this bucket that way I've
strained<00:05:29.180> it<00:05:29.360> twice<00:05:30.610> usually<00:05:31.610> a<00:05:31.850> good<00:05:32.000> idea<00:05:32.060> to

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
strained it twice usually a good idea to

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.440 
strained it twice usually a good idea to
strain<00:05:32.930> your<00:05:33.080> paint<00:05:33.290> twice<00:05:33.680> and<00:05:34.370> that's<00:05:35.180> how

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
strain your paint twice and that's how

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.870 
strain your paint twice and that's how
you<00:05:35.540> can<00:05:35.780> do<00:05:35.930> it<00:05:36.080> with<00:05:36.230> two<00:05:36.260> buckets<00:05:36.790> now<00:05:37.790> if

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
you can do it with two buckets now if

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
you can do it with two buckets now if
you<00:05:38.000> have<00:05:38.090> a<00:05:38.120> third<00:05:38.390> bucket

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
you have a third bucket

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.810 
you have a third bucket
you<00:05:39.440> got<00:05:39.620> another<00:05:39.860> bucket<00:05:40.100> like<00:05:40.340> this<00:05:40.550> you

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
you got another bucket like this you

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.750 
you got another bucket like this you
could<00:05:40.970> you<00:05:41.720> can<00:05:41.870> clean<00:05:42.110> out<00:05:42.260> your<00:05:42.470> bag<00:05:42.650> put<00:05:43.640> it

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
could you can clean out your bag put it

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.520 
could you can clean out your bag put it
into<00:05:44.000> a<00:05:44.030> third<00:05:44.240> bucket<00:05:44.510> take<00:05:44.840> that<00:05:45.050> dump<00:05:45.410> it

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
into a third bucket take that dump it

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.140 
into a third bucket take that dump it
down<00:05:45.590> into<00:05:45.860> the<00:05:45.920> third<00:05:46.100> bucket<00:05:46.340> so<00:05:46.970> there's

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
down into the third bucket so there's

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.850 
down into the third bucket so there's
different<00:05:47.300> ways<00:05:47.540> to<00:05:47.900> do<00:05:48.050> it<00:05:48.080> but<00:05:48.410> before<00:05:48.620> I

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860
