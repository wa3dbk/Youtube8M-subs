00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:13.030
 on pc and consoles is the battlefield 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.030
 long ago a fixed size in the 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.400
 Shoulder area since spring 2011 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.000
 Apple owners can now also in 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.000
 to overthrow the war 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.510
 technology 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.870
 battlefield bad company 2 oriented 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.060
 to the versions already on pc 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.160
 and consoles appeared accepts 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.229
 the control over the soldier preston 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.880
 marlowe one of four members of the 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.920
 so-called bad company 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.170
 as soon as you get through a total of 14 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.660
 missions through mountains ice deserts and 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.580
 jungle areas depending on how good you are 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.500
 you can estimate your game arts 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.920
 from one of three levels of difficulty 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.479
 choose 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.550
 You are not always on foot 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.680
 occasionally also on the way 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.630
 the tax of a military truck or 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.740
 a tank the story is in 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.640
 atmospheric in-game 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.640
 told between sequences 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.859
 The mission is very straightforward 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:52.439
 you do not have much freedom of movement 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:54.869
 a case shows you always to where you put your 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.119
 next task to do next 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.649
 the protector colleague belongs to the master 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.560
 destroying certain targets for example 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.750
 aim with C4 explosives for use 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.619
 The gameplay is usually something 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.450
 stable 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.920
 because they often fight a small one 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.569
 adversary group after another 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.039
 also the interaction with the environment 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.840
 stays on the track 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.430
 because apart from a few barrels and 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.900
 enemy vehicles goes in 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.900
 fire is nothing to break 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.020
 the control works very intuitively 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.150
 and the same as other apple 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.610
 shoot already knows two virtual 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.320
 analog sticks to move and aim 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.240
 a tip on the screen leaves you 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.070
 firing pressed the symbol below 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.450
 right on the screen you can also in 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.820
 squat and by accruing 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.930
 occasionally appear sneaking up 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.910
 also symbols in the middle of the 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.010
 screen through a tab collects her 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.420
 So used on the ground weapons 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.310
 large-caliber standing around 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.020
 machine guns or deposited the 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.880
 explosive from one euro goals 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.400
 more symbols tabs leave you 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.560
 Hand grenades throw after loading or that 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.880
 Use the telescope to have the control 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.180
 the developers are really good 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.180
 hinbekommen 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.180
 graphically, battlefield bad company 2 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.470
 unfortunately not completely convincing 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.940
 Although the missions provide visual 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.830
 quite varied and also the 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.900
 Explosion smoke and completion effects 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.030
 are nice for that are the 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.590
 textures relatively blurred and optical 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.900
 Highlight one searches in vain 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.790
 we would also be the soundtrack 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.500
 at best, call it solid 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.930
 so are the sound effects and funksprÃ¼che 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.760
 Although very intentional 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.170
 abstaining from background music has 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.190
 but not for additional 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.530
 atmosphere taken care of 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.730
 on the contrary often came to us 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.730
 Soundscape very mau before 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.720
 also the multiplayer mode does not have us 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.730
 convinced on just two cards 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.410
 you are allowed through team of the match 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.880
 fumbling menus click around you 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.590
 then with just three 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.780
 to duel other friends 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.630
 the ego shooter offers competition like this 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.010
 nova 2 or modern combat 2 meanwhile 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.010
 simply much more 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.460
 our conclusion as much as we are pleased 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:02.530
 that ea the battlefield series on the 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.270
 apple platform has brought more than 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.870
 unfortunately a solid shooter is still 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.490
 did not get out of it 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.500
 both technology atmosphere and 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.069
 Multiplayer mode still provide plenty 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.069
 potential for improvement
