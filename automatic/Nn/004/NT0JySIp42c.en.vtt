here<00:02:49.040> that<00:02:49.280> match<00:02:49.489> was<00:02:49.880> every<00:02:50.390> bit<00:02:50.420> as<00:02:50.660> dull<00:02:51.260> as

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
here that match was every bit as dull as

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.470 
here that match was every bit as dull as
I<00:02:52.220> remember<00:02:52.580> it<00:02:52.700> being<00:02:52.850> when<00:02:53.060> we<00:02:53.150> watched<00:02:53.360> it

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
I remember it being when we watched it

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.729 
I remember it being when we watched it
live<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:53.900> part<00:02:54.140> of<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:54.290> may<00:02:54.440> have<00:02:54.560> been<00:02:54.709> I

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
live and part of that may have been I

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.199 
live and part of that may have been I
think<00:02:54.830> Undertaker<00:02:55.190> punk<00:02:55.670> was<00:02:55.819> right<00:02:56.030> before

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209

invested in that match just a divas
matches<00:03:07.640> it<00:03:07.760> for<00:03:07.940> but<00:03:08.420> they<00:03:08.540> don't<00:03:08.720> they<00:03:08.930> don't

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
matches it for but they don't they don't

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.599 
matches it for but they don't they don't
do<00:03:09.380> that<00:03:09.530> a<00:03:09.590> lot<00:03:09.739> like<00:03:09.890> I<00:03:09.980> don't<00:03:10.130> expect<00:03:10.459> the

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
do that a lot like I don't expect the

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.610 
do that a lot like I don't expect the
Divas<00:03:11.079> Invitational<00:03:12.079> to<00:03:12.170> be<00:03:12.260> a<00:03:12.290> buffer

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
Divas Invitational to be a buffer

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.110 
Divas Invitational to be a buffer
between<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.980> main<00:03:13.130> events<00:03:13.430> I<00:03:13.549> think<00:03:14.000> they'll

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
between the main events I think they'll

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.599 
between the main events I think they'll
just<00:03:14.150> go<00:03:14.510> one<00:03:14.720> main<00:03:14.900> event<00:03:15.140> after<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.440> other

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
just go one main event after the other

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.460 
just go one main event after the other
maybe<00:03:16.609> between<00:03:16.880> two<00:03:17.660> of<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:17.930> four<00:03:18.230> they'll

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
maybe between two of the four they'll

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.710 
maybe between two of the four they'll
have<00:03:18.620> a<00:03:18.650> buffer<00:03:19.070> but<00:03:19.359> there's<00:03:20.359> also<00:03:20.540> the

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
have a buffer but there's also the

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.569 
have a buffer but there's also the
question<00:03:21.049> of<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.320> Triple<00:03:21.709> H<00:03:21.799> Brian<00:03:22.100> mesh<00:03:22.370> they

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
question of the Triple H Brian mesh they

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.190 
question of the Triple H Brian mesh they
go<00:03:22.760> immediately<00:03:23.120> into<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:23.660> main<00:03:23.840> event<00:03:23.870> after

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
go immediately into the main event after

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.930 
go immediately into the main event after
that<00:03:24.470> or<00:03:24.709> do<00:03:24.859> they<00:03:24.980> have<00:03:25.220> their<00:03:25.459> match<00:03:25.670> in<00:03:25.850> the

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
that or do they have their match in the
