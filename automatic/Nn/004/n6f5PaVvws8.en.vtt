so my first big thought that I did with
or<00:01:43.630> was<00:01:43.750> it<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:44.170> Munich<00:01:44.770> force<00:01:45.100> our<00:01:45.310> Grand

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
or was it the Munich force our Grand

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.580 
or was it the Munich force our Grand

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
Prix we handed second which was really

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.830 
Prix we handed second which was really
exciting<00:01:48.130> so<00:01:48.220> that<00:01:48.369> was<00:01:48.490> our<00:01:48.580> first<00:01:48.910> sort<00:01:49.720> of

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
exciting so that was our first sort of

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.290 
exciting so that was our first sort of
big<00:01:49.990> men<00:01:50.340> did<00:01:51.340> her<00:01:51.430> and<00:01:51.580> a<00:01:51.640> few<00:01:51.820> other<00:01:51.970> shows

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
fast she's sort of big long slow moving

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.460 
fast she's sort of big long slow moving
more<00:03:35.030> so<00:03:35.360> when<00:03:35.510> you<00:03:35.600> really<00:03:35.810> have<00:03:35.990> to<00:03:36.110> kick<00:03:36.320> her

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
and if you get a little long she can get

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.400 
and if you get a little long she can get
a<00:03:37.970> little<00:03:38.120> flatten<00:03:38.480> sometimes<00:03:38.870> has<00:03:39.020> real<00:03:39.230> so

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
a little flatten sometimes has real so

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.590 
a little flatten sometimes has real so
she<00:03:39.470> can<00:03:39.740> go<00:03:39.920> fast<00:03:40.100> but<00:03:40.730> she<00:03:40.880> likes<00:03:41.060> turning

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
she can go fast but she likes turning

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.120 
she can go fast but she likes turning
tighter<00:03:41.840> is<00:03:42.110> better<00:03:42.320> for<00:03:42.590> her<00:03:42.709> than<00:03:42.740> long

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
tighter is better for her than long

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.590 
tighter is better for her than long
Alice<00:03:43.520> because<00:03:43.850> sometimes<00:03:44.209> she'll<00:03:44.360> end<00:03:44.510> up

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
Alice because sometimes she'll end up

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.600 
Alice because sometimes she'll end up
having<00:03:44.870> do<00:03:45.770> you<00:03:45.860> think<00:03:46.070> that's<00:03:46.370> why<00:03:46.550> this

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
having do you think that's why this

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.240 
having do you think that's why this
course<00:03:47.060> suited<00:03:47.450> her<00:03:47.600> I<00:03:47.840> think<00:03:48.620> that<00:03:48.800> was<00:03:49.040> a<00:03:49.070> big

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
course suited her I think that was a big

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.250 
course suited her I think that was a big
factor<00:03:49.459> and<00:03:50.000> there<00:03:50.300> were<00:03:50.390> some<00:03:50.630> long<00:03:50.840> gallops

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
factor and there were some long gallops

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.710 
factor and there were some long gallops
but<00:03:51.590> a<00:03:51.830> lot<00:03:52.100> of<00:03:52.130> it<00:03:52.310> was<00:03:52.459> lines<00:03:52.880> with<00:03:53.209> specific

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
but a lot of it was lines with specific

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.320 
but a lot of it was lines with specific
strides<00:03:54.050> and<00:03:54.950> then<00:03:55.550> the<00:03:55.700> really<00:03:55.910> tight<00:03:56.120> turn

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
strides and then the really tight turn

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.720 
strides and then the really tight turn
back<00:03:56.540> on<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:57.230> last<00:03:57.350> line<00:03:57.650> which<00:03:57.890> I<00:03:58.040> think<00:03:58.280> was

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
back on the last line which I think was

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.070 
back on the last line which I think was
really<00:03:58.880> good<00:03:59.150> for<00:03:59.330> her<00:03:59.450> because<00:03:59.570> she<00:03:59.780> can<00:03:59.930> turn

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
really good for her because she can turn

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.970 
really good for her because she can turn
really<00:04:00.260> fast

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
really fast

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.339 
really fast
and<00:04:01.730> in<00:04:02.120> the<00:04:02.300> first<00:04:02.690> round<00:04:02.900> there<00:04:03.200> was<00:04:03.319> a

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
and in the first round there was a

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.740 
and in the first round there was a
quadruple<00:04:03.920> combination<00:04:04.580> which<00:04:04.819> we<00:04:05.269> rarely

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
quadruple combination which we rarely

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.770 
quadruple combination which we rarely
see<00:04:06.069> what<00:04:07.069> were<00:04:07.159> you<00:04:07.310> expecting<00:04:08.060> from<00:04:08.450> her

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
see what were you expecting from her

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.559 
see what were you expecting from her
with<00:04:09.709> that<00:04:09.890> she's<00:04:10.819> a<00:04:10.879> horse<00:04:11.120> that<00:04:11.209> I<00:04:11.330> have<00:04:11.420> so

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
with that she's a horse that I have so

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.000 
with that she's a horse that I have so
much<00:04:11.690> trust<00:04:12.049> and<00:04:12.319> I<00:04:12.530> wasn't<00:04:12.890> too<00:04:12.980> concerned

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
much trust and I wasn't too concerned

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.759 
much trust and I wasn't too concerned
about<00:04:13.430> it<00:04:13.580> she's<00:04:14.000> really<00:04:14.360> really<00:04:14.390> scoping<00:04:15.019> and

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
about it she's really really scoping and

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.120 
about it she's really really scoping and
just<00:04:16.810> totally<00:04:17.810> able<00:04:17.959> to<00:04:18.260> do<00:04:18.410> it<00:04:18.560> so<00:04:18.769> it<00:04:18.799> wasn't

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
just totally able to do it so it wasn't

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.680 
just totally able to do it so it wasn't
really<00:04:19.310> something<00:04:19.489> I<00:04:19.880> don't<00:04:20.060> like<00:04:20.180> to<00:04:20.570> get

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
really something I don't like to get

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.540 
really something I don't like to get
sort<00:04:21.049> of<00:04:21.139> too<00:04:21.440> much<00:04:21.560> in<00:04:21.739> my<00:04:21.769> head<00:04:21.979> about<00:04:22.100> it<00:04:22.220> so

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
sort of too much in my head about it so

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.280 
sort of too much in my head about it so
I<00:04:22.580> sort<00:04:23.300> of<00:04:23.360> didn't<00:04:23.570> want<00:04:23.690> to<00:04:23.750> overthink<00:04:24.110> it

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
I sort of didn't want to overthink it

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.189 
I sort of didn't want to overthink it
and<00:04:24.350> she<00:04:25.220> definitely<00:04:25.729> can<00:04:25.970> do<00:04:26.120> it<00:04:26.270> so<00:04:26.540> she
