 so bad said hello to everyone today I bring you 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:18.730
 a variety of spicy chicken wings 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.610
 very rich with a Thai touch and like 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:26.580
 always very easy to prepare 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.580
 we feel like we started 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:35.530
 ingredients for four people 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:40.800
 a kilo of chicken wings I cut them 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.800
 in two but you can leave them whole 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.200
 we put them in a bowl and add a 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:54.390
 teaspoon of salt 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.390
 a little bit of ground black pepper 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.860
 a splash of dark soy sauce for 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.860
 give color and we mix everything well 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.820
 we put them in a tray and what 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:23.210
 we bake at 200 degrees centigrade 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.210
 for 10 minutes or until golden brown 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:32.150
 we turn them over and return them to 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:36.270
 bake another 10 minutes in between 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:39.900
 We prepare the sauce in a pan with a 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.990
 fry of vegetable oil fry two 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.920
 garlic cloves and a spoonful of 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.920
 grated ginger 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:55.979
 when it starts to smell good we add 5 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.979
 spoonfuls of happiness sauce 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.799
 the juice of a lime 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.870
 two tablespoons of honey 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.910
 and a tablespoon and a half of soy sauce 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.910
 slight 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.390
 we mix everything well and we let it 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.390
 reduce 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:31.040
 we put out the fire and took out half of 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.040
 the sauce to a bowl 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.299
 we remove the wings from the oven and the 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.080
 We put in the pan with the sauce that 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.980
 remains 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:46.280
 we mix them well we put them back 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:50.330
 in the tray and put them in the oven 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:54.610
 at full power for one minute to 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.610
 that the sauce will dry tells me 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:02.790
 this is how you can finish the 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:06.360
 recipe in this step but if you want a 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.510
 even more intense flavor we return them to 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.980
 put in the pan and mix them with 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.980
 the rest of the sauce 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:28.250
 We put them on the plate with a little 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:32.360
 sesame seeds on top 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:35.320
 here I have cut onion and cilantro 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.320
 to decorate 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:43.440
 we accompany them with some segments of lime 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:48.680
 to throw it over just before 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.680
 eat and they're ready to serve 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.360
