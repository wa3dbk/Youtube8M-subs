00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
together then you have to construct

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.370 
together then you have to construct
that's<00:01:33.150> where<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> fiction<00:01:33.810> comes<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.259> you

that's where the fiction comes in you

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.429 
that's where the fiction comes in you
construct<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.070> plot<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:36.060> Volker<00:01:36.689> really<00:01:37.290> is

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
construct the plot this Volker really is

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.469 
construct the plot this Volker really is
a<00:01:37.470> real<00:01:37.799> character<00:01:38.159> that's<00:01:38.880> not<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.180> real<00:01:39.450> name

that's<00:02:22.740> very<00:02:22.920> true<00:02:23.130> in<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.550> book<00:02:27.890> I'd<00:02:28.890> see<00:02:29.130> one

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
that's very true in the book I'd see one

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.600 
that's very true in the book I'd see one
of<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.460> prime<00:02:29.730> motivations<00:02:30.450> for<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.870> book<00:02:31.110> is

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
of the prime motivations for the book is

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.670 
of the prime motivations for the book is
this<00:02:32.610> notion<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.870> history<00:02:34.320> our<00:02:34.620> history

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
this notion that the history our history

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.630 
this notion that the history our history
is<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:36.060> vastly<00:02:36.630> important<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.440> that<00:02:37.470> each<00:02:38.310> day

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
is so vastly important and that each day

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.330 
is so vastly important and that each day
the<00:02:39.090> we<00:02:39.630> live<00:02:39.840> even<00:02:40.050> as<00:02:40.260> children<00:02:40.340> certainly

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
the we live even as children certainly

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.460 
the we live even as children certainly
as<00:02:41.580> adults<00:02:41.850> but<00:02:42.090> even<00:02:42.360> as<00:02:42.480> children<00:02:42.510> that

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
as adults but even as children that

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.800 
as adults but even as children that
you're<00:02:44.040> reflecting<00:02:44.430> your<00:02:44.820> day<00:02:45.210> can<00:02:45.450> reflect

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
you're reflecting your day can reflect

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.310 
you're reflecting your day can reflect
and<00:02:46.200> tie<00:02:46.410> in<00:02:46.740> to<00:02:47.250> very<00:02:47.490> established<00:02:48.330> historic

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
and tie in to very established historic

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.100 
and tie in to very established historic
moments<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.130> so<00:02:51.030> that<00:02:51.210> when<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.540> know<00:02:51.810> who

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
moments and so that when you know who

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.740 
moments and so that when you know who
you<00:02:52.290> are<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.740> what's<00:02:52.920> come<00:02:53.190> before<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:54.300> you

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
you are and what's come before you you

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.200 
you are and what's come before you you
might<00:02:55.020> have<00:02:55.200> an<00:02:55.380> opportunity<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:56.220> see<00:02:56.760> what's

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
might have an opportunity to see what's

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.510 
might have an opportunity to see what's
coming<00:02:57.420> down<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.810> line<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:59.100> think<00:02:59.370> for

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
coming down the line and I think for

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.880 
coming down the line and I think for
kids<00:02:59.790> there's<00:03:00.060> this<00:03:00.390> huge<00:03:00.720> blind<00:03:01.170> spot<00:03:01.440> what's

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
kids there's this huge blind spot what's

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.040 
kids there's this huge blind spot what's
tomorrow<00:03:02.100> going<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.790> be<00:03:02.940> like<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.750> think<00:03:03.960> if

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050
