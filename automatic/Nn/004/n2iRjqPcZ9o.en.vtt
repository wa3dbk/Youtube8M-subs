 Hello again in today's lesson 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.960
 I will show how to create partitions on hard 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.630
 drive on the new on the old of the difference 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:20.670
 which using the acronis disk program 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:22.580
 director further we install 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.250
 acronis disk director program 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.230
 after installation, run it hard 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.320
 drive and naturally had to be 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.320
 connected also run the program 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.390
 the program is running see our hard 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.080
 hard disk drive 1 days 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.060
 initialized click on it 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.280
 click on the initialize tab 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.489
 it usually happens with new hard 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:11.160
 disks that are not yet licensed 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:16.590
 call initialize click ok 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.590
 apply pending operation continue 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:26.410
 now we need to create sd partitions 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.979
 and so on, that is our desire 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:33.340
 task now ask 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:39.330
 create section c and d go to 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.330
 tab create there click on next 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:51.000
 press dory again here 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.800
 drive c we are creating as the main and 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.800
 the system will be active on it 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:07.620
 the main and active hero here we 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.350
 choose the size of the file system 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:14.580
 naturally we put the interface we select 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:26.030
 the size in this case is enough for us 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:26.030
 50 grams 50 complete them 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:35.909
 it remains to create a free space for names 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:38.560
 Tom we will take further again further and 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:42.040
 naturally now we will have a second 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.310
 hard drive d is logically file 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.930
 mts system that is 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:53.109
