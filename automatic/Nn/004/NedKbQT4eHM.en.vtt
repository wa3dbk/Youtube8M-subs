00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.809
 hello you love today I want you 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.070
 show a comparison video and that of 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.900
 the naked palette 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.930
 I know this is a video which currently 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.820
 probably very often circulated around 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.800
 youtube but i thought so because that 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.140
 palette has just come out and 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.660
 she is currently sold out everywhere and 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.919
 certainly sold again in january 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.680
 I think that maybe that 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.210
 one or the other, a house like that 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.770
 would like to see and hold the same 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.140
 compared to the other two palettes 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.329
 yes as I said I was the same 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.420
 at the beginning of december at edfu ago 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.780
 the seams three palettes presented and 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:50.220
 that came now on the 20th of friday 29 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.320
 and 20 on the 20th they have on and yes after 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.150
 only one week delivery time what i 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.770
 was pretty cool and I wanted to 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.840
 the palette actually only in january 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.180
 Buy february but there were ten 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.640
 percent on the nails palette age ago 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.110
 and I had in the newsletter 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.930
 1 20 percent discount code and thought 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.579
 I beat myself for 30 percent less 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.380
 I prefer to do it now because I like it myself 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.820
 or so and would have bought later 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.850
 I'll definitely get the discount 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.180
 yes very short to pack that is 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.580
 just like the made two 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.659
 palette which i find very good because they 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.210
 really stop first 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.549
 snap closure and thus exhibit 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.560
 very well protected is otherwise otherwise 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.100
 it's just this plastic outer packaging 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.630
 a yes so large golden tone I would 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.400
 that's what they mean with this one 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.830
 golden writing and this relief what 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.840
 I think that's pretty nice 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.690
 otherwise the other palettes too 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.880
 can be found in the inside of the 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.030
 inside a great mirror like that 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:02:00.049
 pretty good on the go then the 12th 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:02:02.800
 12 12 the two attacks colors and 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.440
 brush has two sides 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.110
 so it is an eyeshadow brush 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.210
 a narrower and a little wider today 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.860
 These are synthetic brushes 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.720
 also a bit fluid and 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.430
 I now have until now first the 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.350
 tried bigger and from the actually 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.020
 well is not that bad will 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.530
 then show with the time yes as I said 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.650
 there are twelve different colors as usual 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.690
 for 46 euros and down costs 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.880
 then an eyeshadow something at 3 eur 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.980
 80 and I actually pretty good 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.080
 especially because the quality of the 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.240
 Pretty simply is 1a and you can see 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.000
 now here are the first ones 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.830
 sounds are again relatively neutral and 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.710
 that the palette altogether very pink 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.290
 is heavy and I think that's it 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.510
 especially on the eye very blatant so 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.040
 Who does not like these rosettes now ? 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.480
 quite as well there is with this 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.410
 palette does not return so necessarily 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.600
 to become happy 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.790
 but I think that is a very neutral one 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.730
 and beautiful everyday palette is with the 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.790
 you have really good lux schmid can 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.830
 the hero to do that is strange that is 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.910
 a new one is not quite it is 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.950
 take care of it 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.380
 it is also sonnes and helau again 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.040
 Highlight of the sound can be found here 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.720
 in the foreground the so rosé tones of the and 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.239
 burnout I'll show you the switches 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.440
 same again and then there is 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.750
 nice neutral tones like limit and now 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.280
 these are also dependent again into 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.800
 musée continuous or a bit 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.480
 raging load i find myself then we have 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.060
 with tricks and so one is quite 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.450
 special tones is the slope to 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.330
 small apricot weft resourceful there 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.739
 also really nice mapping tones 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.780
 So I think so nice in the 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.480
 outside winter can give like layer or 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.010
 Factory and Max Schott is also included 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.410
 So I find that really nice 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.150
 So are those sounds cafe I find the 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.400
 also have this pink stop are ob 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.880
 It's a bit like a cappuccino 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.590
 the height look like and then 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.140
 since is also a very dark gray 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.970
 The brown ones are also good for darkening 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.910
 is and then again 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.030
 highlight from the pulle 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.600
 do the blackout of this darker black 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.930
 with red room palette has one 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.580
 Mixture of matte difficult tones and 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.410
 they can also be buttery soft again 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.350
 wear on so I think if you already 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:25.010
 so swatch it is really in order i 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:28.940
 can show you that they are 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.110
 because I do not crumble and me 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.060
 I'm really, really, really 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.830
 thrilled by the doors in general so the 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.750
 Quality is good as ever 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.850
 can blend super and synonymous 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.980
 apply and I also think that the 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.740
 even without a base on the eyes so right 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.780
 yes come to validation but yes do one 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.220
 this is the second of me like that 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.750
 a little frostier can be 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.850
 a bit difficult to apply 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.450
 but otherwise I actually had 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.190
 consistently good pigmentation 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.250
 Experienced to often he wears is also like that 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.890
 a bit weird to say so meager 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.920
 the sz because you can not see the form 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.600
 immediately so strong but otherwise 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.550
 she is actually good throughout 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.980
 pigmented by the quality too 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.960
 really as good as the others 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.670
 pallets I am a very big one 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.650
 had the public area fan 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.200
 palettes and actually use since then 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.950
 on almost only and yes maybe times 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.160
 for comparison 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.870
 I thought yes yes only the third corner 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.270
 palette do you need them because they are yes 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.919
 just like the others but if 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.580
 you keep that side by side 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:33.500
 the same so I think that's it 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.880
 that the that the difference already 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.140
 pretty amazing is you can already see 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.419
 that this is really true 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.070
 right rosé tones are and are not 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.040
 such dark colors are included as 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:46.460
 For example, in the corner two pallets 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:48.050
 or in the naked 1 range what 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.210
 maybe similar is this first one 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.270
 ton strange wise and bright do 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.010
 keep both palettes in there but otherwise 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.230
 I think that sounds already 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.140
 Clearly different if you look 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:03.290
 I would have to decide now too 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.730
 I do not know if I would say that 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.020
 the first and the second palette 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.030
 you would not necessarily need both now 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.529
 them but rather that a 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.169
 perhaps 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:12.819
 choose one of the first two and then 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.799
 the third still he takes as a supplement 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:16.539
 that's really nice rosé tones are 

00:06:14.799 --> 00:06:18.339
 where I just find that this third 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:20.889
 range not think skin type for each 

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:22.629
 I think that there are some types 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:23.169
 So have a few problems 

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:25.209
 could 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.189
 and then I would really be there for that 

00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:28.989
 an everyday look that always give everyone 

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:30.639
 I would rather then first 

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:33.219
 or grab the second palette 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:34.449
 and I do not know yet 

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:36.939
 I really can not really 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:39.399
 say which palette is my favorite 

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:41.319
 Of course I like the third one at the moment 

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:43.509
 super easy because it is new and 

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:45.249
 It's exciting and you have to hang around a bit 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:46.839
 That's why playing can be a challenge 

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:48.819
 I really like them very much at the moment 

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:50.859
 but i like it when i feel like it 

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:53.469
 would have to decide is still mine 

00:06:50.859 --> 00:06:59.499
 favorite because there is just this beautiful 

00:06:53.469 --> 00:07:00.909
 masks sounds in there are those yes stop 

00:06:59.499 --> 00:07:02.639
 These are also such friendly sounds 

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:05.259
 they always go and do that 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:08.139
 but do not angle the indie game 

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:11.049
 in money in a variety of eyelets 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:12.909
 shading very well , yes, I think 

00:07:11.049 --> 00:07:14.649
 just mix it well here 

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:17.679
 matte and the sugary eyeshadow and 

00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:20.049
 also from the dark in the light tones 

00:07:17.679 --> 00:07:21.699
 and yes of course you should go for that 

00:07:20.049 --> 00:07:23.289
 Price considering whether you really all 

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:24.969
 three years I have been with the 

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:26.469
 first two so satisfied and use 

00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:28.329
 I really do it every day so I 

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:30.309
 I said that in the third one 

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:32.049
 Nice addition see if you want 

00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:33.789
 then you can leave me that one there 

00:07:32.049 --> 00:07:35.169
 If I have a tutorial with nimble times 

00:07:33.789 --> 00:07:36.459
 such general make up look with 

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:40.269
 if you want to do make- up 

00:07:36.459 --> 00:07:42.929
 We're looking forward to seeing you soon 

00:07:40.269 --> 00:07:42.929
 and see you soon
