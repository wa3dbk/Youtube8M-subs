00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
function of that

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.560 
function of that
we're<00:02:03.340> going<00:02:03.460> to<00:02:03.520> continue<00:02:03.789> to<00:02:03.999> go<00:02:04.119> up<00:02:04.149> to<00:02:04.479> the

as<00:02:15.719> you<00:02:16.230> can<00:02:16.319> see<00:02:16.530> we<00:02:16.680> have<00:02:16.799> a<00:02:16.829> nice<00:02:17.099> even<00:02:17.700> level

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
as you can see we have a nice even level

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.030 
as you can see we have a nice even level

your<00:02:20.219> skier<00:02:20.700> your<00:02:21.480> ears<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.900> hear<00:02:22.200> when<00:02:22.829> you're

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
your skier your ears to hear when you're

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.349 
your skier your ears to hear when you're
getting<00:02:23.489> over<00:02:23.609> the<00:02:23.790> top<00:02:24.000> you're<00:02:24.209> going<00:02:24.299> to

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
getting over the top you're going to

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.059 
getting over the top you're going to
hear<00:02:24.569> that<00:02:24.599> I<00:02:24.959> draw<00:02:25.230> up<00:02:25.349> straining<00:02:25.739> a<00:02:25.859> little

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
hear that I draw up straining a little

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.069 
hear that I draw up straining a little
bit<00:02:26.219> so<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:26.819> can<00:02:27.030> get<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.209> point<00:02:27.480> stop<00:02:27.870> at

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
bit so you can get that point stop at
