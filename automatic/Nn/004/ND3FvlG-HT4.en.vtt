and<00:02:04.110> then<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.500> top<00:02:04.740> once<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.759> have<00:02:05.880> done<00:02:06.119> that

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
and then the top once you have done that

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.389 
and then the top once you have done that
you<00:02:06.899> pry<00:02:07.200> away<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.770> then<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.069> move<00:02:08.250> it

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
you pry away and then you move it

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.750 
you pry away and then you move it
upwards<00:02:09.060> this<00:02:09.450> actually<00:02:09.899> goes<00:02:10.370> down<00:02:11.370> first

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
upwards this actually goes down first

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.040 
upwards this actually goes down first
and<00:02:12.030> then<00:02:12.090> from

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
and then from

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.950 
and then from
flat<00:02:13.590> against<00:02:14.010> door<00:02:14.280> panel<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.180> now<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.360> remove

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
flat against door panel so now I remove

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.430 
flat against door panel so now I remove
this

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
this

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.130 
this
there<00:02:16.770> is<00:02:16.890> tab<00:02:17.130> there<00:02:17.460> has<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.330> go<00:02:18.480> in<00:02:18.750> in<00:02:18.990> the

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
there is tab there has to go in in the

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.890 
there is tab there has to go in in the
bottom<00:02:19.440> first<00:02:19.710> and<00:02:20.210> here<00:02:21.210> is<00:02:21.390> your<00:02:21.630> tweeter

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
bottom first and here is your tweeter

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.070 
bottom first and here is your tweeter
you<00:02:22.740> remove<00:02:23.100> that<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.550> harness<00:02:23.840> leave<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:24.990> to

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
you remove that the harness leave it to

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.240 
you remove that the harness leave it to
the<00:02:25.170> side<00:02:25.350> there<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:25.620> when<00:02:25.980> you're<00:02:26.070> putting

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
the side there so when you're putting

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.320 
the side there so when you're putting
the<00:02:26.400> panel<00:02:26.700> back<00:02:26.820> on

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
the panel back on

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.310 
the panel back on
it<00:02:27.390> doesn't<00:02:28.080> accidentally<00:02:28.590> tuck<00:02:28.920> in<00:02:30.320> all

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
it doesn't accidentally tuck in all

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.920 
it doesn't accidentally tuck in all
right<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:31.500> now<00:02:31.860> here<00:02:32.400> we're<00:02:32.550> going<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.700> move

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
right so now here we're going to move

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.400 
right so now here we're going to move
another<00:02:33.930> bolt<00:02:34.290> which<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.860> hidden<00:02:35.130> behind<00:02:35.430> this

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
another bolt which is hidden behind this

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.370 
another bolt which is hidden behind this
lock<00:02:37.410> unlock<00:02:37.920> switch<00:02:38.250> if<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.780> notice<00:02:40.110> in<00:02:40.290> the

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
lock unlock switch if you notice in the

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.530 
lock unlock switch if you notice in the
middle<00:02:40.680> there<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.220> have<00:02:41.850> to<00:02:41.940> pry<00:02:42.180> what<00:02:42.420> your

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
middle there you have to pry what your

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.440 
middle there you have to pry what your
plastic<00:02:43.020> wedge<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:44.030> basically<00:02:45.030> comes<00:02:45.270> out

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
plastic wedge and basically comes out

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.290 
plastic wedge and basically comes out
pops<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.990> whole<00:02:46.170> switch<00:02:46.470> out<00:02:46.740> this<00:02:47.130> is<00:02:47.370> this

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
pops the whole switch out this is this

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.760 
pops the whole switch out this is this
is<00:02:48.510> actually<00:02:48.840> connected<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.260> what<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:49.500> called

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
is actually connected to what is called

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.230 
is actually connected to what is called
the<00:02:49.920> flat<00:02:50.160> wire<00:02:50.400> don't<00:02:50.880> pull<00:02:51.060> too<00:02:51.090> hard

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
the flat wire don't pull too hard

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.790 
the flat wire don't pull too hard
because<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.720> will<00:02:51.870> rip<00:02:52.140> once<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.590> does<00:02:52.770> that

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
because it will rip once it does that

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.070 
because it will rip once it does that
you're<00:02:53.520> basically<00:02:54.090> screwed<00:02:54.240> you<00:02:54.720> can<00:02:54.840> have<00:02:54.960> to

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
you're basically screwed you can have to

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.600 
you're basically screwed you can have to
change<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.470> whole<00:02:55.620> wiring<00:02:56.100> harness<00:02:56.430> for<00:02:56.550> the

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
change the whole wiring harness for the

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.320 
change the whole wiring harness for the
door<00:02:57.110> alright<00:02:58.110> so<00:02:58.350> here<00:02:58.710> is<00:02:58.740> another<00:02:59.100> t30<00:02:59.970> bolt

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
door alright so here is another t30 bolt

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.140 
door alright so here is another t30 bolt
I<00:03:00.680> removed<00:03:01.680> that<00:03:01.800> one<00:03:02.130> this<00:03:02.730> one's<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.030> little

I removed that one this one's a little
harder<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.600> get<00:03:03.750> so<00:03:04.020> I<00:03:04.050> used<00:03:04.320> my<00:03:04.410> magnet<00:03:04.920> take

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
harder to get so I used my magnet take

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.480 
harder to get so I used my magnet take
it<00:03:05.370> out<00:03:05.780> again<00:03:06.780> two<00:03:07.260> bolts<00:03:07.650> hold<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.310> door

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
it out again two bolts hold the door

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.000

hole to hold the whole door panel

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.400 
hole to hold the whole door panel
together<00:03:11.420> so<00:03:12.420> now<00:03:12.540> what<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.750> do<00:03:12.840> is<00:03:13.080> I<00:03:13.200> take<00:03:13.350> my

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
together so now what I do is I take my

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
because there's more of these flat wires

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.649 
because there's more of these flat wires
again<00:04:02.829> they<00:04:03.010> rip<00:04:03.190> very<00:04:03.459> easily<00:04:03.760> there's<00:04:04.450> two
