that's what I would do because I would

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.689 
that's what I would do because I would
buy<00:00:58.559> all<00:00:58.710> silver<00:00:59.100> with<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.399> that's<00:00:59.550> how

think<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.620> good<00:01:01.829> investment<00:01:02.370> advice<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.820> give

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
think is good investment advice to give

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.870 
think is good investment advice to give
to<00:01:03.000> anybody<00:01:03.559> unless<00:01:04.559> they<00:01:05.339> strongly<00:01:05.580> believe

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
to anybody unless they strongly believe

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.740 
to anybody unless they strongly believe
in<00:01:05.909> themselves<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.600> tell<00:01:06.810> them<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.049> put<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.590> 5050

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
in themselves I tell them to put it 5050

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.880 
in themselves I tell them to put it 5050
but<00:01:09.750> both<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.049> them<00:01:10.229> are<00:01:10.380> going<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.560> go<00:01:10.650> higher

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
but both of them are going to go higher

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.130 
but both of them are going to go higher
but<00:01:11.130> as<00:01:11.310> far<00:01:11.490> as<00:01:11.549> I'm<00:01:11.790> concerned<00:01:12.110> silver<00:01:13.110> is

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
but as far as I'm concerned silver is

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.890 
but as far as I'm concerned silver is
the<00:01:13.200> place<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.500> be<00:01:16.400> thank<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.520> i<00:01:18.360> buy

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
the place to be thank you i buy

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.020 
the place to be thank you i buy
according<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.590> gold<00:01:19.799> silver<00:01:20.250> ratio<00:01:20.729> and

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
according to the gold silver ratio and

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.109 
according to the gold silver ratio and
right<00:01:21.180> now<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:22.020> we're<00:01:22.860> up<00:01:22.950> at<00:01:23.100> about<00:01:23.220> sixty

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
right now I we're up at about sixty

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.960 
right now I we're up at about sixty
seven<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.600> think<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.460> silvers<00:01:26.460> value<00:01:26.820> is

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
seven I think is the silvers value is

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.160 
seven I think is the silvers value is
167th<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.140> golds<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:29.150> so<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.450> at<00:01:30.659> these<00:01:30.869> levels

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
167th of golds and so it at these levels

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.190 
167th of golds and so it at these levels
i<00:01:31.470> take<00:01:31.710> my<00:01:31.950> cash<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.670> i<00:01:32.729> split<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.180> like<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.600> t20

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
i take my cash and i split it like a t20

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.280

happen I think we could see silver at

happen I think we could see silver at
one<00:01:47.100> one-hundredth<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.729> gold's<00:01:48.060> value<00:01:48.450> if<00:01:49.290> we

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
one one-hundredth of gold's value if we

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.969 
one one-hundredth of gold's value if we
go<00:01:49.649> into<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.979> deflation<00:01:50.960> people<00:01:51.960> will<00:01:52.140> be<00:01:52.680> going

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
go into a deflation people will be going

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.399 
go into a deflation people will be going
toward<00:01:53.280> gold<00:01:53.610> as<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.000> crisis<00:01:54.630> hedge<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.229> not

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
toward gold as the crisis hedge and not

toward gold as the crisis hedge and not
as<00:01:55.590> many<00:01:55.829> towards<00:01:56.369> silver<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.509> just

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
as many towards silver and that just

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.270 
as many towards silver and that just

and mint it into coins there was about

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.660 
and mint it into coins there was about
12<00:03:33.180> times<00:03:33.480> more<00:03:33.630> silver<00:03:34.380> in<00:03:34.620> circulation<00:03:35.310> than

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
12 times more silver in circulation than

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.430 
12 times more silver in circulation than
gold<00:03:35.970> so<00:03:36.300> it<00:03:36.360> was<00:03:36.480> simply<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.959> free<00:03:37.200> market

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
gold so it was simply the free market

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.040 
gold so it was simply the free market
setting<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.070> price<00:03:38.340> equilibrium<00:03:39.330> based<00:03:39.810> on

setting a price equilibrium based on

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.300 
setting a price equilibrium based on
supply<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.560> demand<00:03:40.800> and<00:03:42.440> to<00:03:43.440> keep<00:03:43.860> them<00:03:44.100> both

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
in circulation and so the 12 to 1 ratio

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.150 
in circulation and so the 12 to 1 ratio
is<00:03:47.640> a<00:03:47.700> natural<00:03:48.360> ratio<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:49.080> then<00:03:49.650> there<00:03:50.040> were

about you know one twelfth of gold's

about you know one twelfth of gold's
value<00:05:07.440> in<00:05:07.560> 1980<00:05:08.070> it<00:05:08.250> was<00:05:08.340> one<00:05:08.520> sixteenth<00:05:09.120> and

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
value in 1980 it was one sixteenth and

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.839 
value in 1980 it was one sixteenth and
had<00:05:09.990> gone<00:05:10.169> from<00:05:10.349> about<00:05:10.530> 150th<00:05:11.490> to<00:05:11.700> one

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
had gone from about 150th to one

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:13.730 
had gone from about 150th to one
sixteenth<00:05:12.419> will<00:05:12.660> if<00:05:12.780> we're<00:05:12.960> at<00:05:13.050> one<00:05:13.229> sixtieth

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
sixteenth will if we're at one sixtieth

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.700 
sixteenth will if we're at one sixtieth
now<00:05:14.070> and<00:05:14.430> it<00:05:14.940> goes<00:05:15.120> to<00:05:15.330> one<00:05:15.810> tenth<00:05:16.110> of<00:05:16.289> gold's

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
now and it goes to one tenth of gold's

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.980 
now and it goes to one tenth of gold's
value<00:05:17.099> that<00:05:17.729> means<00:05:17.940> you've<00:05:18.150> got<00:05:18.330> six<00:05:18.630> times

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
value that means you've got six times

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.830 
value that means you've got six times
whatever<00:05:19.500> gold's<00:05:19.950> performance<00:05:20.460> was<00:05:20.640> x<00:05:21.090> 6<00:05:21.539> and

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
whatever gold's performance was x 6 and

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.420 
whatever gold's performance was x 6 and
so<00:05:22.289> the<00:05:22.410> winnings<00:05:22.710> are<00:05:22.830> that<00:05:22.950> much<00:05:23.130> bigger

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
so the winnings are that much bigger

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
so the winnings are that much bigger

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
silver since it's been four dollars an

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.700 
silver since it's been four dollars an
ounce<00:05:33.180> and<00:05:33.510> I<00:05:33.570> still<00:05:33.750> continue<00:05:34.260> to<00:05:34.320> add<00:05:34.470> to<00:05:34.680> my

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
ounce and I still continue to add to my

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.400 
ounce and I still continue to add to my
position<00:05:35.539> looking<00:05:36.539> at<00:05:36.690> the<00:05:36.780> ratio<00:05:36.990> right<00:05:37.260> now

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
position looking at the ratio right now

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.890 
position looking at the ratio right now
65<00:05:37.979> times<00:05:38.310> the<00:05:39.150> amount<00:05:39.210> of<00:05:39.419> silver<00:05:39.660> you<00:05:39.780> can

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
65 times the amount of silver you can

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.930 
65 times the amount of silver you can
buy<00:05:40.020> versus<00:05:40.380> one<00:05:40.530> ounce<00:05:40.650> of<00:05:40.830> gold<00:05:40.979> I<00:05:41.250> think

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
buy versus one ounce of gold I think

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.969 
buy versus one ounce of gold I think
that's<00:05:42.120> an<00:05:42.300> excellent<00:05:42.810> opportunity<00:05:43.410> but<00:05:43.919> you

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
that's an excellent opportunity but you

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:45.440 
that's an excellent opportunity but you
just<00:05:44.099> got<00:05:44.250> to<00:05:44.280> realize<00:05:44.700> on<00:05:44.940> the<00:05:45.090> way<00:05:45.210> down

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
just got to realize on the way down

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
just got to realize on the way down
it'll<00:05:45.840> go<00:05:46.260> a<00:05:46.500> lot<00:05:47.070> further<00:05:47.340> you<00:05:47.940> know<00:05:48.060> it'll

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
it'll go a lot further you know it'll

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.360 
it'll go a lot further you know it'll
outperform<00:05:49.470> on<00:05:49.560> the<00:05:49.650> downside<00:05:50.070> and<00:05:50.250> the

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
outperform on the downside and the

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.580 
outperform on the downside and the
upside<00:05:50.729> so<00:05:51.030> it's<00:05:51.479> a<00:05:51.570> lot<00:05:51.750> more<00:05:51.780> it's<00:05:52.349> a<00:05:52.410> higher

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
upside so it's a lot more it's a higher

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.159 
upside so it's a lot more it's a higher
risk<00:05:52.950> precious<00:05:53.760> metal<00:05:54.060> but<00:05:54.660> to<00:05:54.810> be<00:05:54.840> able<00:05:54.960> to

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
risk precious metal but to be able to

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:56.390 
risk precious metal but to be able to
buy<00:05:55.289> something<00:05:55.620> under<00:05:55.919> the<00:05:56.010> cost<00:05:56.220> of

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
buy something under the cost of

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.969 
buy something under the cost of
production<00:05:56.990> when<00:05:57.990> most<00:05:58.229> primary<00:05:58.530> silver

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
production when most primary silver

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.339 
production when most primary silver
producers<00:05:59.400> are<00:05:59.580> have<00:06:00.300> all-in<00:06:00.720> costs<00:06:01.169> in<00:06:01.260> the

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:01.349 
producers are have all-in costs in the

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:03.260 
producers are have all-in costs in the
low<00:06:01.770> 20<00:06:02.099> dollars<00:06:02.430> an<00:06:02.550> ounce<00:06:02.669> range<00:06:03.000> and<00:06:03.210> you

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
low 20 dollars an ounce range and you

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.540 
low 20 dollars an ounce range and you
can<00:06:03.390> buy<00:06:03.570> it<00:06:03.630> for<00:06:03.780> 18<00:06:04.500> some<00:06:04.770> dollars<00:06:05.130> I<00:06:05.160> think

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
can buy it for 18 some dollars I think

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.580 
can buy it for 18 some dollars I think
that's<00:06:05.700> an<00:06:05.849> excellent<00:06:05.940> opportunity<00:06:06.590> right

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
that's an excellent opportunity right

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.680 
that's an excellent opportunity right
now<00:06:07.620> you<00:06:07.800> might<00:06:08.130> have<00:06:08.310> about<00:06:08.430> 23<00:06:09.240> dollars<00:06:09.570> on

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
now you might have about 23 dollars on

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.480 
now you might have about 23 dollars on
the<00:06:09.780> downside<00:06:10.229> risk<00:06:10.530> on<00:06:10.740> silver<00:06:11.099> but<00:06:11.280> it<00:06:11.370> could

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
the downside risk on silver but it could

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.370 
the downside risk on silver but it could
easily<00:06:11.610> pop<00:06:12.150> to<00:06:12.360> twenty-five<00:06:12.780> thirty<00:06:13.020> dollars

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
easily pop to twenty-five thirty dollars

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.409 
easily pop to twenty-five thirty dollars
an<00:06:13.530> ounce<00:06:13.650> there's<00:06:14.610> a<00:06:14.669> lot<00:06:14.700> of<00:06:14.880> there's<00:06:15.210> a<00:06:15.270> very

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 
an ounce there's a lot of there's a very

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:17.390 
an ounce there's a lot of there's a very
high<00:06:15.539> concentration<00:06:16.380> to<00:06:16.830> pay<00:06:17.010> for<00:06:17.190> short

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
high concentration to pay for short

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.670 
high concentration to pay for short
positions<00:06:17.820> on<00:06:17.970> silver<00:06:18.390> so<00:06:18.690> if<00:06:19.020> we<00:06:19.320> do<00:06:19.500> see

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
positions on silver so if we do see

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.710 
positions on silver so if we do see
silver<00:06:20.039> move<00:06:20.190> past<00:06:20.430> 20<00:06:20.789> 21<00:06:21.270> you<00:06:21.390> can<00:06:21.570> see<00:06:21.690> a

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
silver move past 20 21 you can see a

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.200 
silver move past 20 21 you can see a
very<00:06:22.050> aggressive<00:06:22.860> short-covering<00:06:23.520> rally<00:06:23.550> and

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
very aggressive short-covering rally and

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.779 
very aggressive short-covering rally and
momentum<00:06:24.630> buying<00:06:24.840> so<00:06:25.460> something<00:06:26.460> that<00:06:26.610> to

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:26.789 
momentum buying so something that to

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:28.279 
momentum buying so something that to
kind<00:06:27.030> of<00:06:27.090> keep<00:06:27.210> an<00:06:27.360> eye<00:06:27.450> out<00:06:27.479> but<00:06:27.870> I<00:06:28.020> think

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:28.289 
kind of keep an eye out but I think

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:29.630 
kind of keep an eye out but I think
Silver's<00:06:28.620> got<00:06:28.800> a<00:06:28.830> lot<00:06:28.919> more<00:06:28.950> potential<00:06:29.370> than

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:29.640 
Silver's got a lot more potential than

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.149 
Silver's got a lot more potential than
gold<00:06:30.029> is<00:06:30.180> on<00:06:30.330> on<00:06:30.479> the<00:06:30.719> next<00:06:30.870> full<00:06:31.110> room<00:06:31.289> thank
