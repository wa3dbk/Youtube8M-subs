00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:08.210
 hello to all today new 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.469
 chapter of geography inhabit the city 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.889
 let's start with a small 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.420
 defining a city is first and foremost a 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.640
 place of high human density 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.529
 that is, there is a lot of 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.859
 populations 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.670
 it's also a built-up area with a lot 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.890
 buildings but also a space that 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.019
 focuses populations agricultural water 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.010
 so people who do not work 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.200
 not necessarily in agriculture notw to 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.690
 the small definition of another notebook 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.620
 a city ​​is a place of high density 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.559
 human being a built space that concentrates 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.510
 non- agricultural populations you can 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.629
 take a few minutes doing 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:59.039
 pause to write this definition in 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:01.320
 your notebook so only the organization 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.519
 of a city is above all a center 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:09.479
 city ​​that you have here materialize in 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.409
 red plays but also his suburbs so 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.409
 all around the city center 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.049
 everywhere to discover chicago 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.869
 third largest city of the states 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.009
 United 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.729
 it is located in the northeastern United States 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.729
 on the shores of michigan lake 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.060
 now let's explore several neighborhoods 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.840
 from the city 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.320
 first of all the city ​​center as we 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.799
 see here the downtown is incorporated 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.490
 first of all skyscrapers 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:54.890
 skyscrapers so modern buildings 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:58.850
 very high but also very wide streets 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.850
 with a lot of traffic 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.770
 there are also parks 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.950
 Buildings rather constitute office 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.120
 with few dwellings but there are 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.520
 also hotel banks shopping 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:21.470
 this type of neighborhood is called a cbd 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:23.170
 central business district continue 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.370
 our little tour of chicago 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.370
 we continue in the old quarter 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:36.590
 old neighborhood so with rather 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.590
 old buildings in poor condition and which 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.750
 mainly groups a population 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.840
 poor it is around the center 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.840
 city 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.870
 here we see the buildings not of the 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.360
 all the same features that this 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.260
 we saw before 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:03.860
 we see a main road and therefore 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.739
 our old neighborhoods that still 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:12.620
 recent years experiencing 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:15.140
 transformations with the return of a 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.720
 rather wealthy population rather young 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:27.110
 and who also wish to live in a center 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:32.600
 city ​​you see here some 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:37.060
 features let's go another corner 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:40.850
 from chicago and suburbs to the suburbs 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.410
 so are really around the fate of the 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:47.720
 downtown around neighborhoods 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:49.870
 ancient so far from the center we see 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.190
 the important transport network 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.900
 people living in the 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.680
 suburbs need easy access 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:01.160
 in the city center you see if all the 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.040
 main streets to access the center 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.860
 city ​​suburbs 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.379
 is mainly subdivision 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:13.129
 so what type of house do you find so 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:16.070
 in the suburbs of chicago with a 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:18.680
 need for these populations to have 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:22.359
 a car to access the city center 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.359
 especially to go to work 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:29.590
 otherwise the suburbs or offer 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:33.080
 space with construction 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.150
 typical infrastructure like the centers 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.270
 commercial for example when you have 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.300
 here but also 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.750
 another element that requires space 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:51.470
 the airport we see here so the airport 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:54.800
 of chicago and the space needed here 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:58.220
 so you have here so we see all the 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.479
 small planes versus space 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.479
 so from the airport 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.770
 it's time for us to conclude 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.930
 this little trick of chicago and I you 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.570
 give appointment in class you can 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.250
 obviously watched several times this 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.580
 video to complete all your 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.580
 news
