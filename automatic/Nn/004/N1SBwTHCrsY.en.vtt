00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:55.330
 the bmw m3 and that does not need to 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.980
 already hide on the old tracktest 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.610
 He belonged to over three of them 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.680
 fastest 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.830
 for the Bavarian athlete in the 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.800
 limousines outfit are 64 1750 euro 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.900
 due almost 2000 euros less than for 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.290
 the coupe 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.740
 Let's get to the performance of the m3 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.350
 runs electronically limited 250 and 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.010
 Sprint from 0 to 100 km h in 4.9 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.740
 second power 420 ps max 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.080
 torque 400 newtonmeter the engine 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.780
 v8 with almost 4000 cubic centimeters 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.780
 weight 1605 kilograms 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.939
 now it depends on which 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.469
 Richtzeit is the M3 at the track test 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:40.469
 burning premiere in the asphalt 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.140
 whether for the small left-hand bend after the 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.700
 start will take care of everything in connection 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.360
 second and third gear around the 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.360
 hope on the right 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.280
 The curve demands straight is important ever 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:08.490
 take more patrick with you 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:12.240
 can be better for the topspeed with 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.890
 100 81 71 km / h, the m3 is flashed 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.420
 then it's full in the iron and 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.420
 down to 60 kilometers per hour 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.230
 in selective he divides in 3 1 and his 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.750
 trump 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.130
 the neutral designed suspension 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.700
 understeer almost completely wrong 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.700
 increase 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.890
 Patrick is really fast on the way 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.890
 only a left-right combination 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:57.130
 the tension increases which time has the 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:03.580
 m3 managed the first house number is 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:05.910
 a 111 78 and what does the m3 ever do 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.910
 instead of 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.530
 Responds to every command 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.120
 really as accurate as it gives precise 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.670
 you the opportunity to play as on 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.860
 limit to drive the car at 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.020
 strike out corpses in to hit 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.760
 but get without it erupts as 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.830
 and time is lost but it 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.440
 that is so precise on the track 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.540
 that's traction , i believe a whole 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.480
 quite big point of time so him 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.480
 pushed far forward has 111 78 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.940
 fragrance brand without right has what the time 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.890
 from the m3 on this new track the terrain 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.560
 really worth it will show up though 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.240
 My personal assessment will be there 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.720
 some very many traces in the 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.720
 have steering wheel
