goes a little arrow

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.690 
goes a little arrow
I<00:05:58.560> guess<00:05:58.710> that's<00:05:58.890> supposed<00:05:58.950> to<00:05:59.130> be<00:05:59.190> in<00:05:59.490> arrow

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
I guess that's supposed to be in arrow

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.180 
I guess that's supposed to be in arrow
