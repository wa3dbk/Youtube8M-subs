00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
gonna be able to do that so he's gonna

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.269 
gonna be able to do that so he's gonna
now<00:00:19.080> lose<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.380> six<00:00:19.619> hoshi<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.010> he<00:00:20.070> set<00:00:20.250> up

now lose that six hoshi that he set up
that's<00:00:20.550> definitely<00:00:20.820> gonna<00:00:20.939> get<00:00:21.090> taken<00:00:21.240> out

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
hydrolysis attack it's just so hard to

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.870 
hydrolysis attack it's just so hard to
say<00:00:34.140> them<00:00:34.489> interesting<00:00:35.489> bringing<00:00:35.730> some

but it looks like this time jaedong and
it<00:01:00.629> looks<00:01:00.750> like<00:01:00.809> he<00:01:00.960> actually<00:01:01.050> might<00:01:01.260> save

it looks like he actually might save
that<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> tree<00:01:01.949> we'll<00:01:02.100> see<00:01:02.280> but<00:01:03.000> he<00:01:03.149> has<00:01:03.239> level

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
that a tree we'll see but he has level

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.789 
that a tree we'll see but he has level
one<00:01:03.600> carapace<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.140> time<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.530> shows<00:01:04.680> you

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
one carapace this time that shows you

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.289 
one carapace this time that shows you
the<00:01:04.860> difference<00:01:05.129> between<00:01:05.189> Karis<00:01:05.640> carapace

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
the difference between Karis carapace

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.410 
the difference between Karis carapace
and<00:01:06.360> spines<00:01:07.520> in<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.670> difference<00:01:09.000> basically

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
and spines in the difference basically

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.060 
and spines in the difference basically
kind<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.810> gap<00:01:10.080> where<00:01:10.320> if<00:01:10.439> he<00:01:10.799> did<00:01:10.950> not

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
kind of in the gap where if he did not

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.770 
kind of in the gap where if he did not
have<00:01:11.220> level<00:01:11.520> one<00:01:11.640> carapace<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.659> would

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
have level one carapace it would

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.300 
have level one carapace it would
probably<00:01:12.960> be<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> different<00:01:13.710> situation<00:01:13.799> here

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
probably be a different situation here

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.010 
probably be a different situation here
but<00:01:14.640> managing<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.030> fight<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.810> attack

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
but managing the fight that that attack

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.240 
but managing the fight that that attack
off<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.409> burrow<00:01:16.560> when<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.799> meantime<00:01:17.040> looks

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
off and burrow when the meantime looks

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.890 
off and burrow when the meantime looks
like<00:01:17.369> it's<00:01:17.460> doing<00:01:17.549> some<00:01:17.759> scouting<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.240> form

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
like it's doing some scouting that form

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.330 
like it's doing some scouting that form
out<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.140> field<00:01:19.290> checking<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.189> now

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
out in the field checking it and now

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.649 
out in the field checking it and now
account<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:21.000> little<00:01:21.180> bit<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.330> trouble<00:01:21.420> because

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
account a little bit of trouble because

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.910 
account a little bit of trouble because
he<00:01:21.930> hasn't<00:01:22.049> secured<00:01:22.350> his<00:01:22.530> third<00:01:22.680> expansion

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
he hasn't secured his third expansion

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.830 
he hasn't secured his third expansion
he's<00:01:23.580> dedicated<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.150> much<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.540> harass

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
he's dedicated so much to this harass

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.510 
he's dedicated so much to this harass
pushing<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.650> with<00:01:25.770> another<00:01:25.950> drop<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.430> we'll

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
pushing in with another drop and we'll

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.590 
pushing in with another drop and we'll
see<00:01:26.670> if<00:01:26.729> he<00:01:26.820> has<00:01:26.939> more<00:01:27.090> success<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.540> time

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
see if he has more success this time

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.240 
see if he has more success this time
looks<00:01:28.080> like<00:01:28.200> too<00:01:28.350> dark<00:01:28.530> tempo<00:01:28.770> dropping<00:01:29.130> but

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
looks like too dark tempo dropping but

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.410 
looks like too dark tempo dropping but
it<00:01:29.310> looks<00:01:29.460> like<00:01:29.549> there<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.790> sport<00:01:30.090> colony<00:01:30.360> in

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
it looks like there is a sport colony in

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.090 
it looks like there is a sport colony in
the<00:01:30.750> background<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.140> question<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.470> will<00:01:31.920> go

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
the background the question is will go

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.319 
the background the question is will go
up<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.340> time<00:01:32.490> but<00:01:32.610> those<00:01:32.759> drones<00:01:32.970> can<00:01:33.119> be<00:01:33.150> able

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
up in time but those drones can be able

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.520 
up in time but those drones can be able
to<00:01:33.390> make<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.570> on<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> meantime<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.079> looks<00:01:34.439> like

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
to make it on the meantime it looks like

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.200 
to make it on the meantime it looks like
he's<00:01:34.619> gonna<00:01:34.680> take<00:01:34.860> up<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.100> six<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.369> tree<00:01:35.549> now<00:01:35.700> so

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
he's gonna take up a six a tree now so

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.880 
he's gonna take up a six a tree now so
things<00:01:36.720> swing<00:01:36.990> back<00:01:37.170> into<00:01:37.350> his<00:01:37.470> favor<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:37.829> I

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
things swing back into his favor but I

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.350 
things swing back into his favor but I
worry<00:01:38.100> he<00:01:38.610> still<00:01:38.820> hasn't<00:01:38.970> put<00:01:39.180> down<00:01:39.329> that

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
worry he still hasn't put down that

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.760 
worry he still hasn't put down that
third<00:01:39.659> expansion<00:01:39.960> he<00:01:40.290> really<00:01:40.470> need<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.680> think

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
third expansion he really need to think

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.660 
third expansion he really need to think
about<00:01:40.890> putting<00:01:41.070> down<00:01:41.280> third<00:01:41.460> expansion

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
about putting down third expansion

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.280 
about putting down third expansion
before<00:01:42.090> Jay<00:01:42.210> Don<00:01:42.360> kind<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.049> gets<00:01:43.170> an

from resources in the long run but right

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.270 
from resources in the long run but right
now<00:01:48.930> he's<00:01:49.110> in<00:01:49.140> firm<00:01:49.409> control<00:01:49.439> visit<00:01:50.070> just

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280

you<00:02:35.599> cal<00:02:35.900> I<00:02:36.110> think<00:02:36.319> had<00:02:36.470> that<00:02:36.620> expansion<00:02:36.980> that

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
you cal I think had that expansion that

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.430 
you cal I think had that expansion that
had<00:02:37.910> genome<00:02:38.239> six<00:02:38.480> hatchery<00:02:38.840> at<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.049> inside

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
had genome six hatchery at the inside

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.289 
had genome six hatchery at the inside
six<00:02:40.099> o'clock<00:02:40.310> expansion<00:02:40.790> quite<00:02:41.030> easily

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
six o'clock expansion quite easily

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:42.789 
six o'clock expansion quite easily
earlier<00:02:41.780> on<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:41.930> you<00:02:42.110> don't<00:02:42.230> actually<00:02:42.319> cancel

the<00:02:42.860> hatchery<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.250> great<00:02:43.819> foresight<00:02:44.180> by

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
the hatchery a great foresight by

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.789 
the hatchery a great foresight by
jaedong<00:02:44.540> realizing<00:02:45.230> he<00:02:45.290> wasn't<00:02:45.620> gonna<00:02:45.709> be

jaedong realizing he wasn't gonna be
able<00:02:45.860> to<00:02:45.980> defend<00:02:46.099> it<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:46.459> decided<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.790> save

able to defend it and decided to save

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.850 
able to defend it and decided to save
the<00:02:47.090> resources<00:02:47.480> instead<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:48.110> consolidate

the resources instead and consolidate
his<00:02:48.890> forces<00:02:49.010> but<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:49.970> think<00:02:50.060> how<00:02:50.329> could<00:02:50.599> have

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
his forces but I think how could have

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.120 
his forces but I think how could have
easily<00:02:50.930> taken<00:02:51.260> that<00:02:51.500> hatchery<00:02:51.799> out<00:02:51.890> in<00:02:52.010> his

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
easily taken that hatchery out in his

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.039 
easily taken that hatchery out in his
first<00:02:52.370> attack<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:53.299> he<00:02:53.420> really<00:02:53.690> should<00:02:53.959> not

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
first attack and he really should not

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.330 
first attack and he really should not
have<00:02:54.230> lost<00:02:54.380> that<00:02:54.620> Weaver<00:02:54.769> and<00:02:55.010> that<00:02:55.099> was<00:02:55.310> very

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
have lost that Weaver and that was very

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.339 
have lost that Weaver and that was very
careless<00:02:56.000> micro<00:02:56.480> by<00:02:56.599> and<00:02:56.810> careless<00:02:57.170> play<00:02:57.260> by

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
careless micro by and careless play by

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.319 
careless micro by and careless play by
him<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.709> lose<00:02:57.860> that<00:02:57.890> we<00:02:58.160> were<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.519> as<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.090> result

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
him to lose that we were and as a result

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.539 
him to lose that we were and as a result
he<00:03:00.170> actually<00:03:00.319> feels<00:03:00.590> his<00:03:00.890> first<00:03:01.129> attack<00:03:01.340> and

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
he actually feels his first attack and

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.009 
he actually feels his first attack and
and<00:03:01.700> really<00:03:01.970> gave<00:03:02.150> jail<00:03:02.329> more<00:03:02.660> time<00:03:02.870> than

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
and really gave jail more time than

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.780 
and really gave jail more time than
genome<00:03:03.230> should<00:03:03.440> have<00:03:03.530> had<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:04.280> loud<00:03:04.519> yet<00:03:04.700> out

to<00:03:04.910> be<00:03:04.970> in<00:03:05.030> a<00:03:05.060> stronger<00:03:05.299> position<00:03:05.420> than<00:03:05.720> he

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
to be in a stronger position than he

considering<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.019> position<00:03:09.140> Jedi<00:03:09.470> was<00:03:09.590> it<00:03:09.620> but

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
considering the position Jedi was it but

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.110 
considering the position Jedi was it but
now<00:03:09.829> Jaden<00:03:10.099> was<00:03:10.250> exactly<00:03:10.579> what<00:03:10.730> counts<00:03:10.940> up<00:03:11.030> two

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
now Jaden was exactly what counts up two

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.550 
now Jaden was exactly what counts up two

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
and one together that shuttle gets taken

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.750 
and one together that shuttle gets taken
out<00:03:12.709> with<00:03:12.829> a<00:03:12.890> forestall<00:03:13.250> in<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.400> river<00:03:13.549> goes

out with a forestall in the river goes

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.250 
out with a forestall in the river goes
off<00:03:13.879> and<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.299> river<00:03:14.480> only<00:03:14.780> kills<00:03:14.989> to

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
off and the river only kills to

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.500 
off and the river only kills to
hydrolyse<00:03:15.769> so<00:03:16.190> this<00:03:16.340> is<00:03:16.430> gonna<00:03:16.579> hurt<00:03:16.790> cows<00:03:17.060> so

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
hydrolyse so this is gonna hurt cows so

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.080 
hydrolyse so this is gonna hurt cows so

can<00:05:26.130> see<00:05:26.280> as<00:05:26.400> those<00:05:26.580> three<00:05:26.789> evolution

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
can see as those three evolution

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.460 
can see as those three evolution
chambers<00:05:27.419> down<00:05:27.539> putting<00:05:27.960> down<00:05:28.139> a<00:05:28.169> Queen's

nest before even has a well I guess he
does<00:05:30.900> have<00:05:30.930> three<00:05:31.200> gases<00:05:31.410> at<00:05:31.710> this<00:05:31.830> point<00:05:32.039> so

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
does have three gases at this point so

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.159 
does have three gases at this point so
he<00:05:32.280> won't<00:05:32.610> be<00:05:32.669> too<00:05:32.970> to<00:05:33.780> hurt<00:05:33.930> in<00:05:33.990> the<00:05:34.050> meantime

he won't be too to hurt in the meantime

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:35.390 
he won't be too to hurt in the meantime
