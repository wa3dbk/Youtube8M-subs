this<00:04:32.970> LP<00:04:33.330> I<00:04:33.540> don't<00:04:34.440> feel<00:04:34.770> like<00:04:35.010> they<00:04:35.250> do<00:04:35.789> it

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
this LP I don't feel like they do it

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.360 
this LP I don't feel like they do it
particularly<00:04:36.300> well<00:04:36.810> or<00:04:37.110> approach<00:04:37.560> it<00:04:37.740> from<00:04:37.770> a

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
particularly well or approach it from a

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.550 
particularly well or approach it from a
unique<00:04:38.970> angle<00:04:39.419> the<00:04:39.750> riffs<00:04:39.990> really<00:04:40.380> aren't

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
unique angle the riffs really aren't

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.790 
unique angle the riffs really aren't
that<00:04:40.680> intricate<00:04:41.370> or<00:04:41.810> hard-hitting<00:04:42.810> I<00:04:43.139> mean<00:04:43.680> if

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
that intricate or hard-hitting I mean if

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.680 
that intricate or hard-hitting I mean if
I<00:04:43.889> want<00:04:44.070> an<00:04:44.160> amazing<00:04:44.940> riff<00:04:45.210> there<00:04:45.510> are<00:04:45.630> a

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
I want an amazing riff there are a

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.020 
I want an amazing riff there are a
number<00:04:45.720> of<00:04:46.020> Meshuga<00:04:46.680> records<00:04:47.160> I<00:04:47.520> could<00:04:47.639> be

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
number of Meshuga records I could be

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.020 
number of Meshuga records I could be
listening<00:04:48.810> to<00:04:49.169> instead<00:04:49.620> for<00:04:49.979> just<00:04:50.160> massive

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
listening to instead for just massive

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.560 
listening to instead for just massive
heaviness<00:04:51.360> and<00:04:51.780> just<00:04:52.400> dizzying<00:04:53.400> rhythms<00:04:54.389> that

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
heaviness and just dizzying rhythms that

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.570 
heaviness and just dizzying rhythms that
sometimes<00:04:55.560> fall<00:04:55.919> into<00:04:56.130> odd<00:04:56.220> time<00:04:56.550> signatures

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
sometimes fall into odd time signatures

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.909 
sometimes fall into odd time signatures
and<00:04:57.419> as<00:04:57.690> far<00:04:57.840> as<00:04:57.900> aggression<00:04:58.320> goes<00:04:58.710> I<00:04:58.889> just

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
and as far as aggression goes I just

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.060 
and as far as aggression goes I just
don't<00:04:59.280> think<00:04:59.520> this<00:04:59.669> album<00:04:59.880> is<00:05:00.270> all<00:05:00.449> that

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
don't think this album is all that

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.290 
don't think this album is all that
aggressive<00:05:02.070> it<00:05:02.250> just<00:05:02.430> has<00:05:02.550> this<00:05:02.760> kind<00:05:03.030> of<00:05:03.060> one

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
aggressive it just has this kind of one

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.719 
aggressive it just has this kind of one
level<00:05:03.750> of<00:05:03.930> aggression<00:05:04.470> and<00:05:04.590> it<00:05:04.740> maintains<00:05:05.340> it

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
level of aggression and it maintains it

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.830 
level of aggression and it maintains it
throughout<00:05:06.389> the<00:05:06.630> LP<00:05:07.110> and<00:05:07.490> after<00:05:08.490> a<00:05:08.520> while

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
throughout the LP and after a while

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.080 
throughout the LP and after a while
hearing<00:05:09.840> it<00:05:09.930> at<00:05:10.110> this<00:05:10.380> same<00:05:10.680> level<00:05:11.220> kinda

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
hearing it at this same level kinda

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.570 
hearing it at this same level kinda
makes<00:05:12.690> it<00:05:12.900> lose<00:05:13.139> what<00:05:13.500> little<00:05:13.800> flavor<00:05:14.070> adds

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
makes it lose what little flavor adds

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.159 
makes it lose what little flavor adds
and<00:05:15.210> you<00:05:15.330> know<00:05:15.450> it's<00:05:15.630> kind<00:05:15.810> of<00:05:15.870> a<00:05:15.960> shame

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
and you know it's kind of a shame

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:17.990 
and you know it's kind of a shame
because<00:05:16.410> I<00:05:16.830> thought<00:05:17.130> I<00:05:17.190> might<00:05:17.310> be<00:05:17.639> in<00:05:17.789> for

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
because I thought I might be in for

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.820 
because I thought I might be in for
something<00:05:18.180> different<00:05:18.690> with<00:05:19.229> this<00:05:19.380> LP

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
something different with this LP

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.550 
something different with this LP
especially<00:05:20.820> with<00:05:21.030> the<00:05:21.360> introductory<00:05:22.080> track

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
especially with the introductory track

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.180 
especially with the introductory track
which<00:05:22.800> was<00:05:22.979> just<00:05:23.160> so<00:05:23.400> slow<00:05:23.970> just<00:05:24.720> so<00:05:24.990> heavy<00:05:25.440> but

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
which was just so slow just so heavy but

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.950 
which was just so slow just so heavy but
after<00:05:26.520> that<00:05:26.669> I<00:05:26.940> just<00:05:27.180> kind<00:05:27.300> of<00:05:27.389> get<00:05:27.479> one<00:05:27.690> song

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
after that I just kind of get one song

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.290 
after that I just kind of get one song
after<00:05:28.200> another<00:05:28.620> that<00:05:28.979> just<00:05:29.729> feels<00:05:29.940> like<00:05:30.150> I'm

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
after another that just feels like I'm

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.690 
after another that just feels like I'm
listening<00:05:30.450> to<00:05:30.930> a<00:05:31.349> thrash<00:05:32.099> metal<00:05:32.520> record

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
listening to a thrash metal record

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
listening to a thrash metal record
that's<00:05:33.419> a<00:05:33.900> bit<00:05:34.200> louder<00:05:34.500> has<00:05:35.220> kind<00:05:36.150> of<00:05:36.180> a<00:05:36.300> modern

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
that's a bit louder has kind of a modern

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.589 
that's a bit louder has kind of a modern
shine<00:05:37.139> a<00:05:37.169> modern<00:05:37.740> production<00:05:38.310> to<00:05:38.490> it<00:05:38.639> but<00:05:38.940> has

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
shine a modern production to it but has

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.430 
shine a modern production to it but has
less<00:05:40.260> melody<00:05:40.770> less<00:05:41.610> songwriting<00:05:42.270> power<00:05:42.660> less

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
less melody less songwriting power less

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.070 
less melody less songwriting power less
variation<00:05:43.950> between<00:05:44.400> the<00:05:44.610> songs<00:05:44.940> I<00:05:45.479> definitely

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
variation between the songs I definitely

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.830 
variation between the songs I definitely
give<00:05:46.289> Lamb<00:05:46.830> of<00:05:46.860> God<00:05:47.160> credit<00:05:47.580> for<00:05:48.000> putting

give Lamb of God credit for putting
together<00:05:48.960> an<00:05:49.260> LP<00:05:49.680> where<00:05:50.070> they're<00:05:50.910> definitely

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
together an LP where they're definitely

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.500 
together an LP where they're definitely
using<00:05:52.590> more<00:05:52.830> guitar<00:05:53.190> solos<00:05:53.700> and<00:05:53.910> more<00:05:54.120> guitar

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
using more guitar solos and more guitar

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.480 
using more guitar solos and more guitar
leads<00:05:54.810> than<00:05:55.320> I've<00:05:55.620> heard<00:05:55.860> on<00:05:56.010> previous

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
leads than I've heard on previous

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.279 
leads than I've heard on previous
efforts<00:05:56.910> there<00:05:57.389> are<00:05:57.510> some<00:05:57.660> spots<00:05:57.960> where<00:05:58.169> the

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
efforts there are some spots where the

00:05:58.289 --> 00:05:59.779 
efforts there are some spots where the
guitar<00:05:58.410> leads<00:05:58.800> kind<00:05:59.039> of<00:05:59.130> build<00:05:59.280> up<00:05:59.400> into<00:05:59.639> some

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
guitar leads kind of build up into some

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:02.230 
guitar leads kind of build up into some
nice<00:05:59.940> harmonies<00:06:00.539> even<00:06:01.229> the<00:06:01.320> final<00:06:01.650> track<00:06:01.919> has

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
nice harmonies even the final track has

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.760 
nice harmonies even the final track has
string<00:06:03.240> sections<00:06:03.750> playing<00:06:04.110> against<00:06:04.530> the<00:06:04.620> Lamb

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
string sections playing against the Lamb

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.129 
string sections playing against the Lamb
of<00:06:04.800> gods<00:06:05.160> distorted<00:06:05.880> guitar<00:06:06.210> chords<00:06:06.660> that

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 
of gods distorted guitar chords that

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.820 
of gods distorted guitar chords that
feel<00:06:07.590> that<00:06:07.949> epic<00:06:08.910> feel<00:06:09.300> overall<00:06:10.020> I<00:06:10.199> just<00:06:10.620> think

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
feel that epic feel overall I just think

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.370 
feel that epic feel overall I just think
resolution<00:06:11.490> doesn't<00:06:11.820> throw<00:06:12.240> that<00:06:12.719> many<00:06:12.960> ideas

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
resolution doesn't throw that many ideas

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.700 
resolution doesn't throw that many ideas
out<00:06:13.740> there<00:06:14.070> it's<00:06:14.370> just<00:06:14.969> kind<00:06:15.570> of<00:06:15.659> 14<00:06:16.260> track

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
out there it's just kind of 14 track

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.950 
out there it's just kind of 14 track
headbang<00:06:17.160> fest<00:06:17.580> that<00:06:17.730> doesn't<00:06:18.690> leave<00:06:18.840> you

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
headbang fest that doesn't leave you

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.660 
headbang fest that doesn't leave you
with<00:06:19.110> much<00:06:19.260> to<00:06:19.500> think<00:06:19.680> about<00:06:19.950> after<00:06:20.160> it's<00:06:20.460> over

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.670 
with much to think about after it's over

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.370 
with much to think about after it's over
and<00:06:21.030> because<00:06:21.390> it<00:06:21.510> doesn't<00:06:21.780> offer<00:06:21.930> a<00:06:22.110> lot<00:06:22.350> of

the<00:06:46.050> style<00:06:46.260> of<00:06:46.500> music<00:06:46.650> that<00:06:46.950> these<00:06:47.130> guys<00:06:47.310> are

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
the style of music that these guys are

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.550 
the style of music that these guys are
playing<00:06:47.810> but<00:06:48.810> still<00:06:49.800> I<00:06:50.070> hate<00:06:50.430> hearing<00:06:50.730> heavy

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 
playing but still I hate hearing heavy

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.560 
playing but still I hate hearing heavy
guitars<00:06:52.560> that<00:06:53.130> really<00:06:53.730> aren't<00:06:53.940> heavy<00:06:54.150> at<00:06:54.360> all

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:54.570 
guitars that really aren't heavy at all

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.410 
guitars that really aren't heavy at all
it's<00:06:54.930> just<00:06:55.080> all<00:06:55.440> distortion<00:06:56.280> and<00:06:56.520> no<00:06:56.790> Rumble

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:57.420 
it's just all distortion and no Rumble

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.600 
it's just all distortion and no Rumble
it<00:06:57.720> just<00:06:57.900> feels<00:06:58.080> like<00:06:58.230> Lamb<00:06:58.770> of<00:06:58.800> God<00:06:59.100> wants<00:06:59.520> to

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
it just feels like Lamb of God wants to

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.200 
it just feels like Lamb of God wants to
leave<00:07:00.230> innovation<00:07:01.230> and<00:07:01.560> experimentation<00:07:02.430> to

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.210 
leave innovation and experimentation to

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.510 
leave innovation and experimentation to
all<00:07:03.480> the<00:07:03.930> other<00:07:04.140> bands<00:07:04.500> out<00:07:04.770> there<00:07:04.830> and<00:07:05.310> just

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 
all the other bands out there and just

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.460 
all the other bands out there and just
kind<00:07:05.730> of<00:07:05.760> play<00:07:06.150> things<00:07:06.420> by<00:07:06.630> the<00:07:06.690> book<00:07:06.810> and<00:07:07.260> if

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:07.470 
kind of play things by the book and if

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.860 
kind of play things by the book and if
that<00:07:07.590> works<00:07:07.830> for<00:07:08.130> them<00:07:08.340> that<00:07:09.120> works<00:07:09.420> for<00:07:09.660> them

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:09.870 
that works for them that works for them

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.920 
that works for them that works for them
but<00:07:10.830> it<00:07:11.130> doesn't<00:07:11.520> work<00:07:11.640> for<00:07:11.670> me<00:07:11.940> because<00:07:12.240> I

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:12.930 
but it doesn't work for me because I

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.750 
but it doesn't work for me because I
just<00:07:13.020> really<00:07:13.470> didn't<00:07:13.740> get<00:07:13.890> much<00:07:14.400> of<00:07:14.430> anything

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:14.760 
just really didn't get much of anything

people<00:07:17.010> like<00:07:17.340> it<00:07:17.790> but<00:07:18.150> it<00:07:18.420> doesn't<00:07:18.630> appeal<00:07:18.930> to

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:18.990 
people like it but it doesn't appeal to

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.040
