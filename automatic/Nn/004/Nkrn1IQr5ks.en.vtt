all<00:00:00.510> right<00:00:00.630> this<00:00:00.810> is<00:00:00.900> the<00:00:00.930> second<00:00:01.350> part<00:00:01.500> of<00:00:01.680> the

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
all right this is the second part of the

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.740 
all right this is the second part of the
video<00:00:01.890> I<00:00:02.370> just<00:00:02.879> kind<00:00:03.179> of<00:00:03.210> broke<00:00:03.389> it<00:00:03.570> up<00:00:03.629> into

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
video I just kind of broke it up into

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.059 
video I just kind of broke it up into
two<00:00:03.990> different<00:00:04.170> segments<00:00:04.740> because<00:00:04.920> it's

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
two different segments because it's

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.980 
two different segments because it's
they're<00:00:05.609> two<00:00:05.819> different<00:00:05.970> approaches<00:00:06.480> so<00:00:06.660> like

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
they're two different approaches so like

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.810 
they're two different approaches so like
in<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.290> last<00:00:07.500> one<00:00:07.770> you<00:00:08.280> know<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:08.400> went<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.610> all

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
in the last one you know I went to all

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.790 
in the last one you know I went to all
right<00:00:09.120> leg<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.570> so<00:00:09.900> something<00:00:10.230> that<00:00:10.260> really

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
right leg and so something that really

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.049 
right leg and so something that really
started<00:00:11.010> bothering<00:00:11.219> me<00:00:11.519> about<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.759> don't<00:00:11.940> know

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
started bothering me about I don't know

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.060 
started bothering me about I don't know
about<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.210> year<00:00:12.269> ago<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.870> was<00:00:13.410> getting<00:00:13.650> tired<00:00:13.830> of

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
about a year ago I was getting tired of

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.499 
about a year ago I was getting tired of
just<00:00:14.250> constantly<00:00:14.490> working<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.089> right<00:00:15.269> side

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
just constantly working the right side

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.000 
just constantly working the right side
of<00:00:15.599> my<00:00:15.719> body<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:16.080> was<00:00:16.230> never<00:00:16.379> working<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.830> left

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
of my body I was never working the left

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.769 
of my body I was never working the left
side<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.369> decided<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:18.029> do<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.330> technique

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
side so I decided to do this technique

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.990 
side so I decided to do this technique
and<00:00:19.050> at<00:00:19.230> first<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.920> couldn't<00:00:20.160> do<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.910> it

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
and at first I couldn't do it and it

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.240 
and at first I couldn't do it and it
took<00:00:21.119> me<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.300> couple<00:00:21.359> days<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:22.140> just<00:00:22.529> constantly

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
took me a couple days of just constantly

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.250 
took me a couple days of just constantly
persisting<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.060> doing<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.449> where<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:24.869> finally

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
persisting and doing it where I finally

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.779 
persisting and doing it where I finally
was<00:00:25.439> able<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.650> do<00:00:25.710> one<00:00:25.949> step<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.400> then<00:00:26.760> a

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
was able to do one step and then a

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.160 
was able to do one step and then a
couple<00:00:27.000> days<00:00:27.180> later<00:00:27.300> two<00:00:27.570> steps<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:27.990> now<00:00:28.140> I

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
couple days later two steps and now I

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.380 
couple days later two steps and now I
can<00:00:28.410> do<00:00:28.500> all<00:00:28.680> seven<00:00:29.099> steps<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:30.000> what<00:00:30.150> I'll<00:00:30.240> do

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
can do all seven steps so what I'll do

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.530 
can do all seven steps so what I'll do
is<00:00:30.420> since<00:00:30.750> we<00:00:30.840> have<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.080> bar<00:00:31.320> here<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:32.540> you

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
over the years I just found that instead

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.570 
over the years I just found that instead
of<00:01:04.049> just<00:01:04.140> working<00:01:04.350> one<00:01:04.739> side<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.159> my<00:01:05.250> body<00:01:05.430> I

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
of just working one side of my body I

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.950 
of just working one side of my body I
need<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.939> really<00:01:06.119> kind<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.450> work<00:01:06.510> both<00:01:06.900> sides

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
need to really kind of work both sides

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.140 
need to really kind of work both sides
kind<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.619> muscle<00:01:07.830> memory<00:01:08.130> some<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.850> my<00:01:08.939> late

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
kind of a muscle memory some of my late

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.789 
kind of a muscle memory some of my late
mother<00:01:09.450> flake<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.840> remembers<00:01:10.200> how<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.439> walk

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
mother flake and remembers how to walk

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:11.899 
mother flake and remembers how to walk
up<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.040> stairs<00:01:11.280> even<00:01:11.430> though<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:11.760> not

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
up the stairs even though it's not

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.980 
up the stairs even though it's not
normal<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:13.110> again<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.380> just<00:01:13.650> kind<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.830> push<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
normal so again I just kind of push and

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.390 
normal so again I just kind of push and
with<00:01:15.990> each<00:01:16.140> step<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.470> comes<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.220> know<00:01:17.310> it

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
with each step that comes up you know it

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.160 
with each step that comes up you know it
becomes<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.729> little<00:01:17.850> bit<00:01:17.970> more<00:01:18.170> difficult

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
becomes a little bit more difficult

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.399 
becomes a little bit more difficult
because<00:01:19.290> as<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.070> can<00:01:20.189> see<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.369> can<00:01:20.640> use<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
because as you can see I can use the

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.570 
because as you can see I can use the
landing<00:01:22.409> here<00:01:22.680> as<00:01:22.860> leg<00:01:23.490> brace<00:01:25.100> to<00:01:26.100> push<00:01:26.310> myself

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
landing here as leg brace to push myself

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.840 
landing here as leg brace to push myself
up<00:01:27.650> but<00:01:28.650> as<00:01:28.740> they<00:01:28.890> get<00:01:29.009> higher<00:01:29.189> up<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.549> stairs

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
up but as they get higher up the stairs

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.580 
up but as they get higher up the stairs
I<00:01:30.150> don't<00:01:30.329> have<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.659> ability<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.380> takes

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
I don't have that ability so it takes

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.640 
I don't have that ability so it takes
more<00:01:31.799> abs<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.390> grip<00:01:33.659> hand<00:01:34.229> strength<00:01:34.590> I

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
more abs and and in grip hand strength I

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.490 
more abs and and in grip hand strength I
mean<00:01:34.770> I'm<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.340> got<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.420> pretty<00:01:36.659> good<00:01:36.750> grip<00:01:37.320> on

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
mean I'm I got a pretty good grip on

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.319 
mean I'm I got a pretty good grip on
these<00:01:37.680> bars<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.369> my<00:01:38.460> hands<00:01:38.670> don't<00:01:38.909> slide

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
these bars so that my hands don't slide

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.770 
these bars so that my hands don't slide
down<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.049> again<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:40.920> use<00:01:41.009> my<00:01:41.130> face<00:01:41.610> as<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.509> do<00:01:42.570> it

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
down and again I use my face as I do it

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.670 
down and again I use my face as I do it
in<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> lot<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.079> my<00:01:43.229> videos<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:44.250> move<00:01:44.430> around

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
in a lot of my videos to move around

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.289 
in a lot of my videos to move around
so<00:01:46.680> again<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.189> pushing<00:01:47.670> through<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.000> heel

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
so again just pushing through that heel

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.480 
so again just pushing through that heel
then<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.110> shift<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.470> weight<00:01:49.680> forward<00:01:49.710> and

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
then I just shift the weight forward and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.520 
then I just shift the weight forward and
then<00:01:51.119> now<00:01:51.240> here<00:01:51.479> you'll<00:01:51.659> see<00:01:51.930> cuz<00:01:52.290> I'm<00:01:52.409> up

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
as like a Ledge once I get to a position

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.980 
as like a Ledge once I get to a position
or<00:01:58.590> now<00:01:59.369> I'm<00:01:59.520> up<00:01:59.640> here<00:01:59.670> safe<00:02:00.060> now<00:02:00.659> if<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.810> want<00:02:00.930> to

here and pull up and push it and pull
myself<00:02:05.280> up<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.850> whole<00:02:06.000> time<00:02:06.210> I'm<00:02:06.329> constantly

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
myself up the whole time I'm constantly

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.900 
myself up the whole time I'm constantly
pushing<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.259> through<00:02:07.320> my<00:02:07.469> feet<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.069> then<00:02:08.759> move

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
pushing it through my feet and then move

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.930 
pushing it through my feet and then move
myself<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.330> little<00:02:09.479> bit<00:02:09.569> close

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
myself a little bit close

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.360 
myself a little bit close
straighten<00:02:10.660> that<00:02:10.750> leg<00:02:10.990> out<00:02:11.170> all<00:02:11.560> my<00:02:11.830> movements

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
straighten that leg out all my movements

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.150 
straighten that leg out all my movements
you'll<00:02:12.520> see<00:02:12.700> on<00:02:13.060> our<00:02:13.450> straight<00:02:14.260> leg<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.980> I

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
you'll see on our straight leg and I

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.000 
you'll see on our straight leg and I
don't<00:02:15.220> ever<00:02:15.490> really<00:02:15.700> move<00:02:16.000> my<00:02:16.210> body<00:02:16.500> until<00:02:17.500> my

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
don't ever really move my body until my

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.320 
don't ever really move my body until my
legs<00:02:18.250> are<00:02:18.430> straight<00:02:18.670> because<00:02:18.910> I<00:02:19.030> just<00:02:19.180> don't

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
legs are straight because I just don't

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.750 
legs are straight because I just don't
have<00:02:19.450> confidence<00:02:20.050> that<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.410> muscles<00:02:20.830> or<00:02:21.610> that

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
have confidence that the muscles or that

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.300 
have confidence that the muscles or that
my<00:02:21.850> legs<00:02:22.090> and<00:02:22.270> I<00:02:22.330> bend<00:02:22.600> them<00:02:22.860> will<00:02:23.860> be<00:02:23.980> able<00:02:24.100> to

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
my legs and I bend them will be able to

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.370 
my legs and I bend them will be able to
support<00:02:24.670> me<00:02:24.850> so<00:02:25.000> before<00:02:25.390> I<00:02:25.420> make<00:02:25.690> any<00:02:25.930> movement

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
support me so before I make any movement

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.500 
support me so before I make any movement
to<00:02:26.440> advance<00:02:26.740> my<00:02:26.920> position<00:02:27.370> I<00:02:27.550> make<00:02:28.150> sure<00:02:28.360> that

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
to advance my position I make sure that

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.080 
to advance my position I make sure that
everything<00:02:28.960> is<00:02:29.110> straightened<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.220> locked<00:02:31.090> in

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
everything is straightened and locked in

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.510 
everything is straightened and locked in
so<00:02:34.090> it's<00:02:34.240> kind<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:34.450> like<00:02:34.600> a<00:02:34.660> bunch<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:35.020> checks

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
so it's kind of like a bunch of checks

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.630 
so it's kind of like a bunch of checks
instead<00:02:36.520> of<00:02:36.610> just<00:02:36.760> moving<00:02:37.830> I'll<00:02:38.830> get<00:02:39.010> here<00:02:39.310> cuz

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
instead of just moving I'll get here cuz

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.670 
instead of just moving I'll get here cuz
I'm<00:02:39.760> up<00:02:39.850> higher<00:02:40.060> I<00:02:40.330> gotta<00:02:40.720> put<00:02:40.900> my<00:02:40.930> thumb<00:02:41.650> out

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
I'm up higher I gotta put my thumb out

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.300 
I'm up higher I gotta put my thumb out
put<00:02:42.400> my<00:02:42.520> chin<00:02:42.820> on<00:02:42.850> it<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:44.530> pull<00:02:44.740> myself<00:02:44.890> in<00:02:45.280> a

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
put my chin on it to pull myself in a

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.690 
put my chin on it to pull myself in a
little<00:02:45.400> bit<00:02:45.580> closer<00:02:45.820> now<00:02:49.350> these<00:02:50.350> steps<00:02:50.710> I<00:02:51.010> tie

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
little bit closer now these steps I tie

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.180 
little bit closer now these steps I tie
myself<00:02:51.910> once<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:53.200> first<00:02:53.470> seven<00:02:53.830> steps<00:02:54.100> I

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
myself once the first seven steps I

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.650 
myself once the first seven steps I
think<00:02:54.340> I<00:02:54.370> was<00:02:54.490> able<00:02:54.580> to<00:02:54.700> do<00:02:54.880> each<00:02:55.030> step<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.450> 10

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
think I was able to do each step of 10

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.930 
think I was able to do each step of 10
seconds<00:02:56.140> and<00:02:56.320> then<00:02:56.800> doing<00:02:57.010> that<00:02:57.310> this<00:02:57.580> way<00:02:57.790> it

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
seconds and then doing that this way it

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.200 
seconds and then doing that this way it
took<00:02:58.150> me<00:02:58.240> like<00:02:58.420> 30<00:02:58.690> seconds<00:02:59.260> each<00:02:59.620> step<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:01.120> I

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
took me like 30 seconds each step and I

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.370 
took me like 30 seconds each step and I
think<00:03:01.360> that<00:03:01.450> was<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.630> fastest<00:03:02.170> time<00:03:02.350> ever

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
think that was the fastest time ever

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.540 
think that was the fastest time ever
made<00:03:02.740> it<00:03:02.830> up<00:03:02.950> was<00:03:03.100> like<00:03:03.220> six<00:03:03.550> or<00:03:03.700> seven<00:03:03.730> minutes

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
made it up was like six or seven minutes

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.800 
made it up was like six or seven minutes
on<00:03:06.550> the<00:03:06.700> average<00:03:07.030> I<00:03:07.120> don't<00:03:07.270> see<00:03:07.480> him

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
on the average I don't see him

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.290 
on the average I don't see him
I<00:03:07.840> don't<00:03:08.770> know<00:03:08.860> maybe<00:03:10.050> maybe<00:03:11.050> nine<00:03:11.410> minutes

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
I don't know maybe maybe nine minutes

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.770 
I don't know maybe maybe nine minutes
okay<00:03:13.300> now<00:03:13.870> I<00:03:14.370> got<00:03:15.370> two<00:03:15.520> steps<00:03:15.790> to<00:03:15.940> go<00:03:16.060> but<00:03:16.570> I<00:03:16.600> ran

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
okay now I got two steps to go but I ran

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.080 
okay now I got two steps to go but I ran
out<00:03:16.930> of<00:03:16.959> Bannister<00:03:17.350> so<00:03:17.770> we're<00:03:18.700> gonna<00:03:18.790> we<00:03:19.000> have

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
out of Bannister so we're gonna we have

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.620

to go to a different approach so again I

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.050 
to go to a different approach so again I
want<00:03:23.140> to<00:03:23.170> do<00:03:23.290> is<00:03:23.410> I'll<00:03:23.530> turn<00:03:23.709> my<00:03:23.830> hand<00:03:24.070> in<00:03:24.310> this

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
want to do is I'll turn my hand in this

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.600 
want to do is I'll turn my hand in this
way<00:03:25.300> so<00:03:25.840> that<00:03:25.870> I<00:03:26.020> can<00:03:26.230> push<00:03:26.470> into<00:03:26.680> it<00:03:26.860> if<00:03:27.400> I<00:03:27.520> were

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
way so that I can push into it if I were

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.729 
way so that I can push into it if I were
to<00:03:27.730> put<00:03:27.910> it<00:03:28.000> this<00:03:28.150> way<00:03:28.390> my<00:03:29.320> arm<00:03:29.500> obviously

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
to put it this way my arm obviously

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.229 
to put it this way my arm obviously
would<00:03:30.040> Bend<00:03:30.250> and<00:03:30.459> I'd<00:03:30.520> fall<00:03:30.760> down<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.030> stairs

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
would Bend and I'd fall down the stairs

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.840 
would Bend and I'd fall down the stairs
and<00:03:31.420> it<00:03:31.510> would<00:03:31.600> be<00:03:31.690> a<00:03:31.720> disaster<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:33.430> if<00:03:33.580> I<00:03:33.670> turn

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
and it would be a disaster so if I turn

what I got to do is I used a bit of

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.070 
what I got to do is I used a bit of
shell<00:04:24.060> what<00:04:24.180> not<00:04:24.330> kind<00:04:24.509> of<00:04:24.539> described<00:04:24.870> it<00:04:24.990> as
