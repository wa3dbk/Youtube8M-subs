00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.040
 pee 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.020
 or the souvenirs I hope you are in luxury 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.030
 because rubÃ©n master ibm we are 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.010
 unstoppable working in new 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.870
 contents and mechanics so that there is 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.390
 more interaction for all 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.340
 subscribers this guide had me 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.290
 asked for a while ago and I know that a 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.690
 many will find it unnecessary 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.910
 but it should be noted that while it rises 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.860
 is an easy champion to use their 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.170
 topics require discipline to 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.140
 get them all the juice so they are 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.700
 seeing the rise guide I will expose two 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.710
 master templates that in the 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.670
 investigations were just as 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.440
 effective 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.540
 the first is a template focused on 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.460
 utility we see characteristics 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.190
 spell destruction speed of 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.470
 movement and experience these masters 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.630
 they play a more balanced character and they are 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.270
 those we recommend for a passive raid 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.770
 in early game in the masters 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.660
 next we see a complete 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.670
 tilt of damage and there's not much that 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.470
 explain then this is for a raise more 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.260
 aggressive but requires more skill 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.630
 so that it works correctly 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.910
 in runes we will use penetration marks 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.220
 magical armor seals glyphs of 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.770
 magical and quintessential resistance 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.320
 week all flat in 5a essences 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.570
 we can also choose penetration 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.700
 magic in the order of skills 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.380
 we will alternate quye and double the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.840
 we will leave the last one in its final 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.640
 levels 6 11 and 16 in the items 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.350
 we will start with boots and 3 positions 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.630
 although if you prefer, you can 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.540
 start with two positions and use the edge 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.700
 of mana after we advance with tears and 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.850
 we build the rod of the ages because 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.590
 for of the ages and not first archangel 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.810
 this decision in the order is taken by 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.400
 what varieties offers you possibilities 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.160
 of survival and mana 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.229
 increasing every minute and this 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.929
 combined effect with tear gives you a lot 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.420
 more mana in the boots we can choose from 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.300
 sorcerer or hong jazz me preferably 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.430
 I recommend sorcerer to finish 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.040
 we will make of the frozen heart that we 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.480
 will give a lot of resistance on timbales and with 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.970
 cooling reduction we will release 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.740
 spells right and left the scepter 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.320
 abysmal makes your baby something serious 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.370
 and gives you more resistance at the end 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.799
 we can buy 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.620
 or archangel so that all the mana 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.720
 Accumulated bear fruit and if some 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.310
 they ask why so much mana this is 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.680
 because the rise abilities make 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.390
 damage based on the maximum mana now 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.390
 let's go to the game tips 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.460
 the passive root is a wonder every 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.470
 Once rise spells others 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.630
 spells reduce their cooling in a 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.030
 second this causes the raise to split 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.260
 skills to everyone and that's why 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.260
 send so much mana 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.280
 the root q is the spell that 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.079
 Following characterizes as an easy champion 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.360
 since it has a low cooling and a 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.709
 strong damage at all times of the game the 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.769
 cv will serve to harass your enemies 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.510
 and prevent the enemy farm like this is also 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.819
 advisable to launch the cv how many times 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.790
 possible since it will cool our 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.260
 skills the w is a skill that is 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.150
 excellent to ensure that your 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.069
 skills do not fail well also of 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.540
 have leaks and avoid being made 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.480
 focus this gives you time to 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.790
 reposition you is a skill 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.920
 where proximity with the objective to 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.319
 that causes more damage or also in a 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.430
 timba you can do multiple damages and 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.430
 you place it with wisdom 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.910
 the last great to enter the 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.459
 battles and ravage the targets 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.380
 softer so also the suction of 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.390
 spell makes you more difficult to 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.569
 kill and all your spells are involved 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:01.310
 50% area damage being ideal for 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.310
 kick multiple butts 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.630
 the root combo is executed at a 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.000
 very high speed and consists of w 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.070
 and again it is highly recommended 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.950
 the marks so that your speed 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:20.000
 increased to 20% and thus 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.000
 be more effective 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.790
 in the root timbales represents a 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.740
 vital damage charge and your position does not 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.630
 it necessarily has to be removed 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.760
 but it is also not advisable to start 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.550
 battles rather rise took a position 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.490
 central and helped from the last much damage 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.620
 with the w and the cv and you should not fear because 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.160
 unlike others to sin and roots 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.870
 it is highly resistant in conclusion 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.420
 root is a p carli and that is pretty 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.250
 Easy strong and fun and highly 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.100
 recommended for those who start 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.460
 and well this was a greeting to brave 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.470
 heart and the magical mystery of bicing and 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.950
 good i'm re good master until the 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.950
 next 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.090
