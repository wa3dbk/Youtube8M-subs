00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
Steven Jackson got hurt and it's a

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.030 
Steven Jackson got hurt and it's a
little<00:03:41.540> fishy<00:03:41.780> with<00:03:42.080> this<00:03:42.230> injury<00:03:42.590> he's<00:03:42.830> they

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
little fishy with this injury he's they

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.470 
little fishy with this injury he's they
said<00:03:43.340> he<00:03:43.459> could<00:03:43.670> have<00:03:43.760> come<00:03:43.940> back<00:03:44.180> but

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
said he could have come back but

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.390 
said he could have come back but
Richardson<00:03:44.780> was<00:03:45.049> playing<00:03:45.290> so<00:03:45.530> well<00:03:45.709> that<00:03:46.280> they

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
Richardson was playing so well that they

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.280 
Richardson was playing so well that they
didn't<00:03:46.700> see<00:03:46.850> the<00:03:46.970> need<00:03:47.150> to<00:03:47.360> rush<00:03:47.570> Jackson<00:03:48.080> back

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
didn't see the need to rush Jackson back

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.530 
didn't see the need to rush Jackson back
we'll<00:03:49.160> see<00:03:49.400> how<00:03:49.580> this<00:03:49.760> shakes<00:03:50.000> out<00:03:50.269> but

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
we'll see how this shakes out but

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.539 
we'll see how this shakes out but
Richardson<00:03:50.930> looked<00:03:51.380> good<00:03:51.650> he<00:03:51.830> did<00:03:52.010> fumble<00:03:52.280> at

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
Richardson looked good he did fumble at

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.430 
Richardson looked good he did fumble at
the<00:03:52.580> end<00:03:52.820> of<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:52.970> game<00:03:53.000> that<00:03:53.450> could<00:03:54.140> have<00:03:54.230> cost

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
the end of the game that could have cost

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.289 
the end of the game that could have cost
him<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.739> game<00:03:54.830> actually<00:03:55.250> but<00:03:55.610> it<00:03:55.730> didn't<00:03:56.060> so

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
him the game actually but it didn't so

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:57.820 
him the game actually but it didn't so
hopefully<00:03:56.660> that<00:03:56.840> won't<00:03:56.989> hurt<00:03:57.230> Richardson's

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
hopefully that won't hurt Richardson's

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.680 
hopefully that won't hurt Richardson's
value<00:03:58.220> but<00:03:58.640> I<00:03:58.670> think<00:03:58.940> he's<00:03:59.030> worth<00:03:59.209> an<00:03:59.360> that<00:03:59.390> in

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
value but I think he's worth an that in

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.660 
value but I think he's worth an that in
deeper<00:04:00.320> leagues<00:04:00.350> and<00:04:00.860> if<00:04:01.100> you<00:04:01.220> need<00:04:01.370> a<00:04:01.430> hand

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
playing the jets at home I think they

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.800 
playing the jets at home I think they
could<00:04:33.979> force<00:04:34.250> some<00:04:34.430> turnovers<00:04:34.460> and<00:04:35.270> if<00:04:35.630> Shawn

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
sixty-five percent of leagues we really

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:53.080 
sixty-five percent of leagues we really
liked<00:05:51.470> him<00:05:51.590> coming<00:05:51.919> into<00:05:52.099> the<00:05:52.190> year<00:05:52.370> he's<00:05:52.610> had
