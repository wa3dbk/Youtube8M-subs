00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.000
 other times the great mountains 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.730

 colors now and then a few code is now 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.000
 temperature should not fall to 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.590
 otherwise its important to get that now 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.720
 then a little postino elsewhere with you 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.370

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.140
 chores 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.940
 deleted when the file is first 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.590
 of the cupboard but they are not yet 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.170
 cooked enough 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.940
 come flocking stirring may either look 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.100
 once it is even fifteen minutes 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.140
 the assignment was treat them door 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.700
 classic or bran on the carcass 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.489
 went on the barbecue to do the rest 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.989
 so is not collected can be that 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.890
 is just a police on the barbecue 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.360
 grill baking carcass kidney and brown 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.010
 that it's a super I still come 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.959
 the bottom instead of we want to see 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.180
 actually classic cuisine also among the 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.130
 have mastered carcass fire and how 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.130

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.260
 as possible 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.670
 I think there is a very clear gap 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.470
 is between koen and the other five 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.720
 candidate are the five other candidates 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.130
 matched and 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.770
 cunha is really the start you had there 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.370
