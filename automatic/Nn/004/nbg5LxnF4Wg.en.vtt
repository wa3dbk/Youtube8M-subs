think that's the key for our young

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.870 
think that's the key for our young
players<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:33.420> try<00:02:33.990> step<00:02:34.260> up<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.710> I<00:02:34.740> hope<00:02:35.430> I'll

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
players to try step up and I hope I'll

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.740
