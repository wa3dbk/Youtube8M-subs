00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.700
 hi friends and you know you so much 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:08.290
 so many of you were such people who 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.150
 asked to re-sound the project street 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.990
 of course I'm with the kid 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:17.369
 Radislav's T-shirts will not get there but I am 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:23.020
 I remember and so in the hands of the project street 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:25.689
 a 24 inch sherpa and this is just a pit of one of 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.869
 students of the first stream of my training 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.930
 bike assembled from the hatch and the street project 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:35.589
 we build the project street is shit us the project 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:38.379
 street is generally complete and if 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:40.269
 examined it all fluently clean with 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.909
 technological point of view, everything is done 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:46.600
 very very good then there is no 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:51.519
 crooked seams no gross errors nothing 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.739
 there is no such plug made correctly 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:57.519
 I myself have such an exo store 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:01:00.219
 and here is a wonderful track too 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.799
 rods that we are more likely to catalog but 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.409
 also clear about the wound here 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:07.270
 integrated seatpost 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:14.049
 spanish carriage dropouts then you 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:17.170
 sleeve and frame weight I can't name 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:20.350
 uniquely correct because I personally 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.979
 himself entirely ramadi never weighed 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.929
 and there were a lot of letters not on the Internet 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.210
 that the weight of the temples does not match 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:31.240
 stated but I can not do anything 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.799
 tell why comment 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.130
 weight point 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.320
 I can’t ask questions about the forest 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:43.259
 manufacturability and some kind of mistakes i'm not 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:46.359
 noticed as regards geometry 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.299
 the bike is very similar to exactly suburban 

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:52.829
 suburban parkers barban 24 which was 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:55.149
 but not on equity because 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.740
 overfulfilled in such a way that push 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.469
 tire deep enough to 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.210
 seatpost can not be themselves and 5 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:04.210
 actually do not allow it 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.840
 I do not jumper and not the most 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.270
 forms 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.769
 but that on the other hand says flux 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.040
 feathers because they are not 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.240
 pooped in terms of technology only 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.600
 and 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.980
 not like this done on the same act not 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.340
 octane that we make perry short 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.290
 just fooled from them I don’t know with a hammer 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.820
 or somehow in such a way that not 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.460
 will remain flat enough 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.800
 move the wheel much deeper project 3 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.460
 such gross violations of technological 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.440
 no one is allowed in the rest of all 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.950
 In principle, not bad and as an alternative 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.400
 suburban this has a good frame if there 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.930
 correspondent to drive some kind of analogy with 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.580
 competitors the only competitor in 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.570
 this price category it turns out 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.350
 the same 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.600
 ogan as for star because of geometry 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.870
 in general, it is similar only in a ganga below and 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.460
 top tube and everything else 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.040
 about the same as for the price 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.570
 weight but by weight again while I myself 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.780
 I personally will not take it then we do not 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:08.130
 weighing on scales I can't exactly 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:12.240
 enlist the veil as for convenience 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.730
 ski lift steering angle 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.580
 feathers need to try here 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.180
 Now I am a little bit in the plus with hard 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.740
 a fork 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.630
 and it's really good this 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.150
 advantage which is not enough for example 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.080
 mutant what if you stick for example 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.790
 Beijing mutant with a rigid fork you 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.650
 lose weight because the carriage will be at zero 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.200
 or in the red you will constantly 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.930
 feel the bottom feathers here such 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:43.260
 problems will not be here either 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.090
 quality frame painted no such 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.400
 problems like sometimes war with 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.400
 paint that he swell there or 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.870
 cheeks such problems about guarantees 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:58.050
 guys you, too, not on fuck and 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.120
 overall whole if you choose between 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.990
 fate for us or which is more expensive 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.320
 frame 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:07.200
 I believe that the poet 3 you exost speaker 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.440
 and who are on par who 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.000
 let you in the midst of it all 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.080
 competitive market pick something under 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.080
 yourself under your wallet 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.310
 but in general with all the tricks and on this 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.370
 bike can be no 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.160
 There are no problems with this from the fact that of course 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.050
 I would like to point it out too close 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.880
 the arrangement of the feathers to each other that is not 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.490
 allows you to put a wide tire and 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.270
 push and deep in this plan also 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.639
 affect 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.860
 jumpers between feathers that on top of that 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.680
 below if they could be pushed 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.770
 closer to the carriage and seat post 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.600
 from above it would make it easier for 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.060
 2 hectares of her tires correction eights 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.669
 of cycling as for 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.530
 manufacturability bike more precisely frame 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:01.030
 made excellent no at all 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:04.360
 no complaints what else can 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.889
 add friends about tricks well i 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.840
 I'm trying to tell you in the video that I'm 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.690
 two hours all slept me training here 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.550
 groups and everything else is bullshit but I'm in this 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.310
 Season in general niochem it already noticed 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.889
 so look not at skating on 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.500
 technical side of the bike in this 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:22.979
 plan guys real respect all 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.979
 good friends
