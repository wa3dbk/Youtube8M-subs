00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 hi it's frederic I'm very 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.110
 happy to meet you today 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.259
 for a new video 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.260
 it's special valentine's day is special 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.780
 hama pearls so let's stop these are the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.730
 little beads that you iron with 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.100
 your iron and that makes you 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.960
 lots of little small figurines 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.660
 figures of little things super nice 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.279
 so if this video interests you I 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.119
 lets you watch the rest of the 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.279
 video that says valentine's day 10 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.529
 jolicoeur so today I decided 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.020
 to show you how to do very 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.020
 Easily hearts hama beads 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.190
 to do this you will need a 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.489
 plate a little will suffice since this 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.350
 are really tiny hearts and 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.620
 then of course you need fathers 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.360
 the pam therefore has beads to iron 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.920
 all the colours 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.600
 after you choose the colors that 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.789
 so you want if my colors are a 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.770
 little mixed it is my cat who has 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.649
 climbed on the box that did everything 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.110
 mix so that's why it's a 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.000
 little bit the bazaar but I'm going to them 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.530
 do it soon because I do not like the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.330
 everything when it's messy so here 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:16.860
 we will be able to use the colors that 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:20.400
 we want to go 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.110
 let's see that more closely then for 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.900
 place your pearls you can use 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.280
 a small clip like this one me 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.439
 that's what I'm going to do because I 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.540
 find it easier but you 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.840
 can just as easily use your 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.900
 fingers 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.570
 go to your pearls and follow me done 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.710
 exactly what I'm doing and otherwise bah 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.600
 listen I wish you a good 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.600
 watching we 'll see you later 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.000
 and here it is already finished you see 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:19.629
 it's nothing complicated now 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.870
 ironing so you put a paper 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:24.579
 greaseproof over your work and 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.849
 you put your iron 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:30.489
 cotton position and you iron by 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.950
 on it until the pearls is a 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.989
 little bit melted then there is to abuse 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.560
 and that's normal it's the steam of my 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:40.319
 iron he escapes though if you 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.150
 are young or very young 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.609
 ask your mom your dad to 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.799
 you make their way because it's 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:50.670
 really very very hot you would risk 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.670
 to burn you 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.310
 you can check from time to time 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:01.010
 if the pearls are well sticking there I 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:05.650
 notice it's not glued enough so 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.650
 I'm going to take another shot 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.810
 and here we start to see in transparency 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.110
 that pearls grounds so it's that 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.110
 its good 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:36.559
 here is the heart is now well 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:40.669
 stick we can detach it attention 

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:42.739
 it's very very hot we're going now 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.829
 to see together how it goes up 

00:04:42.739 --> 00:04:49.939
 necklace in Persian small hole here so 

00:04:45.829 --> 00:04:52.129
 to attach a ribbon to mount it in 

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:55.459
 necklace you will need a pair of 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:59.169
 scissors pair of pliers a small 

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:59.169
 ring and then some ribbon 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:06.230
 to start we go first 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:09.080
 tied our rings to the heart so for 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:14.440
 that you 're going to hold your rings with 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.440
 a clip and open it with the other clip 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.950
 and then you will be able to insert 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:38.040
 this ring in the heart 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.040
 no 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.590
 to insert more easily it takes 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.539
 to make a small hole in the pearl 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.520
 so I use my pliers all 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:50.449
 it's very easy it's lost 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.279
 easily 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:56.529
 and now I'll be able to 

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:56.529
 put my ring in my little heart 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.360
 and that's what it gives 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.810
 then you just have to take a 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:32.350
 ribbon to cut it to the size you 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:34.120
 would you like it after all 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.520
 simply insert the ribbon into 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.930
 the ring so here I'm sorry I'm 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.210
 a little out of scope but hey you 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:43.920
 understand how to do it 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.920
 it's not very complicated 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:56.410
 and finally you can do your ne so 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:58.300
 I make a simple knot of 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:02.770
 anyway it is in the neck so it 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:06.010
 will not see each other and here is your necklace 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:08.260
 and already finished I show you what 

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:10.060

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.450
 different colors with different 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.620
 ribbon that's it but I hope this 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.290
