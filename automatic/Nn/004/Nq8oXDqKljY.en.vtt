00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.610 
he plug it in it this is actually the
power<00:02:26.080> button<00:02:26.560> as<00:02:27.250> you<00:02:27.310> can<00:02:27.490> see<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:28.150> design

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
power button as you can see the design

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.220 
power button as you can see the design
itself<00:02:29.620> is<00:02:30.150> pretty<00:02:31.150> slim<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:31.840> looks<00:02:32.020> not<00:02:32.170> like

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
itself is pretty slim it looks not like

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
itself is pretty slim it looks not like
the<00:02:32.530> XPS<00:02:33.160> is<00:02:33.690> really<00:02:34.690> similar<00:02:34.990> to<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:35.530> that's

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
the XPS is really similar to it that's

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.580 
the XPS is really similar to it that's
really<00:02:36.430> nice<00:02:36.670> because<00:02:36.910> you<00:02:37.090> can't<00:02:37.510> not<00:02:38.260> really

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
really nice because you can't not really

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.260 
really nice because you can't not really
you're<00:02:38.770> kind<00:02:38.800> between<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.550> SPSS<00:02:40.060> and

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
you're kind between the SPSS and

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.150 
you're kind between the SPSS and
Inspiron<00:02:40.870> so<00:02:41.260> it's<00:02:41.470> a<00:02:41.530> really<00:02:41.770> nice<00:02:41.890> design

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
Inspiron so it's a really nice design

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.020 
Inspiron so it's a really nice design
and<00:02:42.550> I<00:02:42.580> really<00:02:42.790> think<00:02:42.910> overall<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:45.010> this<00:02:45.760> is<00:02:45.910> it

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
and I really think overall so this is it

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.340 
and I really think overall so this is it
right<00:02:46.150> here<00:02:46.300> and<00:02:46.570> it<00:02:46.690> does<00:02:46.870> get<00:02:47.050> a<00:02:47.080> little<00:02:47.200> bit

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
right here and it does get a little bit

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.350 
right here and it does get a little bit
fingerprints<00:02:47.980> on<00:02:48.130> it<00:02:48.160> but<00:02:48.880> it<00:02:48.940> wipes<00:02:49.240> off

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
fingerprints on it but it wipes off

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.840 
fingerprints on it but it wipes off
really<00:02:49.720> easy<00:02:49.960> is<00:02:50.560> just<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:50.920> really<00:02:51.280> nice<00:02:51.460> feel

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
really easy is just a really nice feel

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.520 
really easy is just a really nice feel
to<00:02:51.880> it<00:02:52.210> it's<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.660> really<00:02:52.990> nice<00:02:53.170> feel<00:02:53.440> to<00:02:53.470> it

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
to it it's a really nice feel to it

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.880 
to it it's a really nice feel to it
oh<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:58.060> also<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.570> battery<00:02:58.870> as<00:02:59.380> you<00:02:59.560> see<00:02:59.770> the

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
oh and also the battery as you see the

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.090 
oh and also the battery as you see the
batteries<00:03:00.310> right<00:03:00.610> here<00:03:01.410> it's<00:03:02.410> really<00:03:02.620> flush

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
batteries right here it's really flush

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.900 
batteries right here it's really flush
as<00:03:03.370> you<00:03:03.490> can<00:03:03.580> see<00:03:03.730> it's<00:03:03.850> really<00:03:04.120> flush<00:03:04.600> to<00:03:04.870> it

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
as you can see it's really flush to it

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.690 
as you can see it's really flush to it
it's<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:07.090> ventilation<00:03:07.390> port<00:03:08.020> right<00:03:08.530> here

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
it's a ventilation port right here

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.060 
it's a ventilation port right here
civilian<00:03:09.700> port<00:03:10.080> also<00:03:11.080> there's<00:03:11.830> ventilation

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
civilian port also there's ventilation

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.400 
civilian port also there's ventilation
ports<00:03:12.790> on<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.420> bottom<00:03:13.750> of<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:13.930> so<00:03:14.140> if<00:03:14.200> you<00:03:14.290> have

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
ports on the bottom of it so if you have

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.490 
ports on the bottom of it so if you have
an<00:03:14.500> air<00:03:14.680> cooler<00:03:15.330> for<00:03:16.330> your<00:03:16.480> laptop<00:03:16.660> there

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
an air cooler for your laptop there

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.200 
an air cooler for your laptop there
actually<00:03:17.890> go<00:03:18.040> outside<00:03:18.250> this<00:03:18.700> time<00:03:18.880> because

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
actually go outside this time because

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.080 
actually go outside this time because
sometimes<00:03:19.450> you<00:03:19.720> see<00:03:19.930> laptops<00:03:20.380> and<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:22.000> know

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
sometimes you see laptops and you know

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.550 
sometimes you see laptops and you know
people<00:03:22.450> buy<00:03:22.600> clothes<00:03:22.900> but<00:03:23.110> it<00:03:23.230> doesn't<00:03:23.470> really

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
people buy clothes but it doesn't really

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.560 
people buy clothes but it doesn't really
sit<00:03:24.010> where<00:03:24.310> it<00:03:24.430> can<00:03:24.550> actually<00:03:24.640> inside<00:03:25.240> this

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
sit where it can actually inside this

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.120 
sit where it can actually inside this
time<00:03:25.810> they<00:03:26.110> all<00:03:26.200> kind<00:03:26.440> of<00:03:26.470> thought<00:03:26.650> of<00:03:26.680> it<00:03:26.950> and

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
time they all kind of thought of it and

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.340 
time they all kind of thought of it and
actually<00:03:27.310> really<00:03:27.850> gets<00:03:28.030> inside<00:03:28.360> of<00:03:28.420> it<00:03:28.720> which

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
actually really gets inside of it which

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.850 
actually really gets inside of it which
i<00:03:29.470> think<00:03:29.530> is<00:03:29.710> pretty<00:03:29.860> cool<00:03:31.410> okay<00:03:32.410> so<00:03:32.590> I'm<00:03:32.740> going

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
i think is pretty cool okay so I'm going

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:51.130 
i think is pretty cool okay so I'm going
to<00:03:32.950> turn<00:03:33.100> it<00:03:33.220> on<00:03:35.970> boot<00:03:36.970> it<00:03:37.150> up

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.130 

but<00:03:51.680> John<00:03:51.890> here<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.220> boots<00:03:52.490> in<00:03:52.790> t2<00:03:53.060> log

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
but John here the boots in t2 log

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.620 
but John here the boots in t2 log
it<00:03:54.890> runs<00:03:55.190> glutes<00:03:55.850> are<00:03:56.000> really<00:03:56.360> quick

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
it runs glutes are really quick

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.270 
it runs glutes are really quick
initially<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.290> first<00:03:57.500> one<00:03:57.830> when<00:03:58.130> it's

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
initially the first one when it's

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.610 
initially the first one when it's
installing<00:03:58.730> all<00:03:58.820> the<00:03:58.970> programs<00:03:59.420> and<00:04:00.320> you're

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
installing all the programs and you're

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.200 
installing all the programs and you're
actually<00:04:00.890> setting<00:04:01.100> up<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.310> operating<00:04:01.790> system

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
actually setting up the operating system

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.670 
actually setting up the operating system
it<00:04:02.690> takes<00:04:02.870> a<00:04:02.960> little<00:04:03.140> bit<00:04:03.260> longer<00:04:03.440> just

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
it takes a little bit longer just

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.280 
it takes a little bit longer just
because<00:04:04.070> it<00:04:04.220> set<00:04:04.460> everything<00:04:04.820> up<00:04:04.940> on<00:04:05.120> it<00:04:05.330> but

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
because it set everything up on it but

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.030 
because it set everything up on it but
overall<00:04:06.620> it's<00:04:07.580> a<00:04:07.670> very<00:04:07.880> impressive<00:04:08.210> system

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
overall it's a very impressive system

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.800 
overall it's a very impressive system
screen<00:04:10.040> quality<00:04:10.520> I'm<00:04:10.670> that<00:04:10.910> I'm<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.210> glossy

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
screen quality I'm that I'm the glossy

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.990 
screen quality I'm that I'm the glossy
basic<00:04:12.470> glass<00:04:12.770> one<00:04:13.160> that<00:04:13.370> they<00:04:13.550> provide

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
basic glass one that they provide

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.120 
basic glass one that they provide
standard<00:04:14.810> and<00:04:15.050> it<00:04:15.140> really<00:04:15.410> looks<00:04:15.620> great<00:04:15.890> I

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
standard and it really looks great I

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.920 
standard and it really looks great I
mean<00:04:16.190> I<00:04:16.579> don't<00:04:16.880> really<00:04:17.150> see<00:04:17.420> the<00:04:17.510> point<00:04:17.690> in

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
mean I don't really see the point in

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.280 
mean I don't really see the point in
really<00:04:18.109> getting<00:04:18.320> high<00:04:18.560> gloss<00:04:18.799> anyways<00:04:20.290> this

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
really getting high gloss anyways this

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.480 
really getting high gloss anyways this
right<00:04:21.500> here<00:04:21.829> is<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:23.270> biometric<00:04:23.960> finger<00:04:24.500> the

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
right here is the biometric finger the

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.670 
right here is the biometric finger the
bottle<00:04:26.140> g-guys<00:04:27.460> zoom<00:04:28.460> it<00:04:28.580> in<00:04:29.290> this<00:04:30.290> right<00:04:30.470> here

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
bottle g-guys zoom it in this right here

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.650 
bottle g-guys zoom it in this right here
is<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:32.180> biometric<00:04:33.220> fingerprint<00:04:34.220> reader

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
is the biometric fingerprint reader

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.470 
is the biometric fingerprint reader
right<00:04:35.660> here<00:04:35.690> are<00:04:36.230> your<00:04:36.980> toolbars<00:04:37.820> basically

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
right here are your toolbars basically

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.180 
right here are your toolbars basically
it's<00:04:38.720> like<00:04:38.870> they're<00:04:39.260> kind<00:04:39.530> of<00:04:39.560> like<00:04:39.740> willyam

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
it's like they're kind of like willyam

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.430 
it's like they're kind of like willyam
like<00:04:40.760> gliding<00:04:41.270> I<00:04:41.300> mean<00:04:41.480> they're<00:04:41.600> just<00:04:41.630> tunston

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
like gliding I mean they're just tunston

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.920

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
which actually is really clear I mean

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.930 
which actually is really clear I mean
it's<00:06:00.090> not<00:06:00.210> too<00:06:00.419> bad<00:06:00.599> and<00:06:00.810> it's<00:06:00.990> not<00:06:01.110> too<00:06:01.229> shabby

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940

I<00:06:02.940> really<00:06:03.449> think<00:06:03.690> that<00:06:03.780> overall<00:06:04.229> this<00:06:04.409> system

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
I really think that overall this system

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.770 
I really think that overall this system
is<00:06:04.889> nice<00:06:05.099> it<00:06:05.400> is<00:06:05.430> a<00:06:05.759> little<00:06:06.120> bit<00:06:06.360> heavy<00:06:06.569> it's

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
is nice it is a little bit heavy it's

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.719 
is nice it is a little bit heavy it's
not<00:06:06.810> too<00:06:07.229> heavy<00:06:07.409> but<00:06:07.590> I<00:06:07.979> mean<00:06:08.130> you<00:06:08.280> can<00:06:08.430> now<00:06:08.550> see

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:08.729 
not too heavy but I mean you can now see

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:11.029 
not too heavy but I mean you can now see
that<00:06:08.759> you<00:06:09.090> maybe<00:06:09.509> had<00:06:09.750> a<00:06:09.780> thin<00:06:10.080> notebook<00:06:10.530> and

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 
that you maybe had a thin notebook and

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:12.409 
that you maybe had a thin notebook and
prints<00:06:11.310> there's<00:06:11.460> no<00:06:11.580> book<00:06:11.789> you<00:06:11.940> know<00:06:12.180> so

prints there's no book you know so

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.749 
prints there's no book you know so
there's<00:06:12.659> one<00:06:13.139> difference<00:06:13.520> maybe<00:06:14.520> I<00:06:14.639> will

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 
there's one difference maybe I will

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:16.640 
there's one difference maybe I will
count<00:06:15.090> or<00:06:15.300> two<00:06:15.449> so<00:06:15.690> you<00:06:15.750> you<00:06:16.050> feel<00:06:16.259> difference

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
count or two so you you feel difference

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.409 
count or two so you you feel difference
but<00:06:16.830> it's<00:06:17.070> nothing<00:06:17.430> too<00:06:17.639> much<00:06:18.860> but<00:06:20.419> that's

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
but it's nothing too much but that's

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:29.100 
but it's nothing too much but that's
pretty<00:06:21.570> much

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.170
