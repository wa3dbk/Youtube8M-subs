00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.820 
we prefer to use the circle hook it's a
little<00:03:59.550> bit<00:03:59.760> safer<00:04:00.150> for<00:04:00.870> you<00:04:01.080> and<00:04:01.110> the<00:04:01.560> fish

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
little bit safer for you and the fish

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.670 
little bit safer for you and the fish
the<00:04:02.459> hook<00:04:02.670> typically<00:04:03.360> hooks<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:04.019> fish<00:04:04.260> right

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
the hook typically hooks the fish right

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.040 
the hook typically hooks the fish right
in<00:04:04.890> the<00:04:05.010> jaw<00:04:05.220> and<00:04:05.519> not<00:04:05.760> in<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.000> throat<00:04:06.300> so<00:04:06.840> it's

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
in the jaw and not in the throat so it's

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.810 
in the jaw and not in the throat so it's
easier<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:07.620> get<00:04:07.830> the<00:04:07.890> hook<00:04:08.160> out<00:04:08.310> with<00:04:08.550> a<00:04:08.580> D

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
easier to get the hook out with a D

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.570 
easier to get the hook out with a D
hooking<00:04:09.209> device<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:09.780> also<00:04:10.650> it's<00:04:11.100> a<00:04:11.250> little

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
hooking device and also it's a little

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.759 
hooking device and also it's a little
harder<00:04:11.940> to<00:04:12.060> hook<00:04:12.209> you<00:04:12.480> too<00:04:12.750> so<00:04:13.200> whenever
