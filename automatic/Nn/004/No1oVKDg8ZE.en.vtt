00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.420
 hello a little idea today I 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.429
 did not have to make videos 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.719
 today and then in the end this morning 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.660
 in my mailbox there was 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.090
 what can that be? 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.410
 I simply did not wait anymore and 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.720
 it's just my cover 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.730
 jacquotte then jacquotte what is that 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.439
 it's a site that offers us 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.660
 send us free 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.740
 samples you register on the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.390
 site and you receive the Caribbean 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.210
 will feel as they see fit so 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.940
 it's a bit of the boxing principle but 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.559
 that samples and I find it nice 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.950
 in his basin to their free 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.480
 and I found it very very nice then 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.879
 in the small envelope 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.329
 we therefore associate a small pouch 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.020
 jacquotte here and we have a little paper 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.250

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.530
 what's in it because it makes a 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.090
 moment I'm registered I believe that 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.780
 it was late December I always had 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.850

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.800

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.879
