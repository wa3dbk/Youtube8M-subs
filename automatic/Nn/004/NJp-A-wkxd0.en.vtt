 Well, if you carry a valid amulet, 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.729
 more chances of finding an egg 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.399
 in the pokemon nursery for this serves 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.649
 what would be the amulet this that what 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.479

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.409

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.619
 the possibility of finding eggs from the 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.899
 daycare that means well that 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.599
 eggs that sometimes take a long time 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.939
 that we receive it in the nursery with 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.980
 this crutch will take a little bit 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.900
