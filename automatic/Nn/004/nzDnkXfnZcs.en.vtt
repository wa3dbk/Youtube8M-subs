00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:13.049

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.429
 with all men 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.410
 per cent 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.090
 so we actually have to make sure that those sheep are going to be replaced by the 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.419
 discussion 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:22.159
 continue the rotterdam 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:24.640
 okay then make sure that and away 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.670
 then you go somewhere under water goes a single place and that as a result 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.800
 and then gives you opening time 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.980

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.070

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.360

 breda pda goes away 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.230
 the chip 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.170
 then you get performance with his horse 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.250
 Almelo gave Assad and Abdullah Gul great pleasure 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.010
 have to allow walking, but that is difficult 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.989
 I know you can share parts in your interior 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.150
 is good there is now waiting for a systematic approach 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.020
 yes why is it then turks 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.010
 yes now it could be this would be 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.840
 the anwb 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.210
 that can buy can buy the lace 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.620
 also the owners have suggested 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.580
 the title the collection 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.380

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.620

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.160
 the church authority were at work 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.300
 just a bit 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.860
 but nothing has been lost about it 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.900
 but wait and see 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.830
 because they are standing 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.900
 j in the tour 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.560
 the stentor 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.560
 you can clear it through 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.560
 I think so 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.399
 I look outside 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.990

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.649
 pip the except scales nail the score this scheme 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.490
 motherwell 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.510
 but that is not worth it but oh well 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.619
 the 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.060
 though you have to think beyond a bag that comes with it 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.320
 purchase the costs thereof 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.070
 they look dead mollema knew on the way i can fill you and we are actually 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.780
 even though music should not have added just like that 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.810
 these turned out to be under water 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.409

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.409

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:33.560
 Yes 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.679
 find 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:37.410
 this does not matter 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.410
 add time 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:44.629
 but the craft they don't say is because they are pulled just like that 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:45.599
 you say completely 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.469

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:28.339

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:59.289
 what strikes 

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:00.479
