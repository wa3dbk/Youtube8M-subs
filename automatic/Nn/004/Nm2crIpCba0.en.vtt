in the first game and it is one quarter

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.460 
in the first game and it is one quarter
of<00:01:32.070> my<00:01:32.430> normal<00:01:32.970> quality<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.659> then<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.140> will

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
of my normal quality and then I will

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.170 
of my normal quality and then I will
only<00:01:34.590> showing<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.100> quarter<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.460> my<00:01:35.670> screen<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.150> I

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
only showing a quarter of my screen so I

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.429 
only showing a quarter of my screen so I
guess<00:01:36.329> it's<00:01:36.360> one<00:01:36.600> sixteenth<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.229> normal

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
guess it's one sixteenth of the normal

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.380 
guess it's one sixteenth of the normal
normal<00:01:37.920> quality<00:01:38.100> but<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> quality<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.270> not

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
normal quality but the quality is not

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.640 
normal quality but the quality is not
what<00:01:39.479> you're<00:01:39.600> watching<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.930> for<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.110> hilarity
