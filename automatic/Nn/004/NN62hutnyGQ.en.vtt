now<00:03:31.870> if<00:03:31.930> all<00:03:32.140> things<00:03:32.290> are<00:03:32.500> very<00:03:32.650> easy<00:03:32.950> to

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
now if all things are very easy to

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.980 
now if all things are very easy to
change<00:03:33.490> you<00:03:33.910> basically<00:03:34.330> are<00:03:34.450> going<00:03:34.690> to<00:03:34.780> just

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
change you basically are going to just

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.480 
change you basically are going to just
pull<00:03:35.260> one<00:03:35.290> off<00:03:35.770> as<00:03:36.130> so<00:03:37.740> pull<00:03:38.740> the<00:03:38.890> bottom<00:03:39.160> one

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490
