 missions the mountains that has followed 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.550
 and keeping good as to see what 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.950

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.990

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.040

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.270

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.410
 they are practically all children for 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:52.220
 that the ones welcomed in 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.480

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.480
 an item in special 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:03.320
 to see if it is to think about one of the 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:06.309
 materials treated with materials 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.309
 I fit all 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.790
 I'm not going to leave the finger here we're going to 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.790
 lie 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.400
 we have looked at what he has done 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.190
 then we will look at the amulet let's see 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.210
 First 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.210
 in space 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.840
 This here 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.850
 of 15 I have a legendary king who 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.159
 it is not clear either 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.210
 I'm very lucky and now 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.210
 we fill the inventory again 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.229
 i 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.229
 Clear 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.859
 she empty all joy 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.510
 for now we have not seen either one well 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:59.720
 all right 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:03.120
 good very good 1 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.500
 there under the whole be 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.500
 where to collect real 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.330
 God 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.040
 they could put materials and 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.040
 gems were collected alone 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.900
 if you're going to finish it almost always 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.420
 in search of the legendary match that will be 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.130
 what will it be 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.319
 It will not be a ring and it will be what I am 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.319
 looking will not be lucky let's see 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.870
 ah 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.099
 a stumble vending 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.430
 the amulet that is the same as the one that is 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.310
 more equal is mulet or only fits 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.910
 in act one can be 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.390
 I would have to 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.230
 I come to form a ring that you 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.989
 reduce 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.049
 in one the requirement of the seven 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.660
 sectors and the bonus needs three pieces 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.460
 contain 2 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.380
 and well, you always need a minimum of 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.480
 two so if you have two fingers you need 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.510
 two pieces or parties is not worth composing 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.660
 one piece is already 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.950
 would you be 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.950
 more or pedro that is already 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:35.450
 and come let's sell and the last 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.450
 the last wave 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:44.120
 although with the few that remain not 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.120
 we have 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:53.770
 a bit like boom bum worth 50 we have 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.000
 fallen two legendary and to top it all is the 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.650
 same 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.650
 well, good good 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.640
 good good percentage 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.600
 we'll see 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.260
 identify 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.549
 I look them well to sell because I think 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.549
 I'm going to depress 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.720
 a little bad and I do not do this 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.830
 and if this and only the heat that 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.830
 there are here in the 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:41.220
 in the bags of the first close-up 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.220
 act and bad too 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.660
 good afternoon 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.190
 he breaks them both sing to me well 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:58.870
 swimmers this has been all on my part 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.870
 fast and depressing 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:05.980
 of the guard 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.510
 until the first good tablet because I 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.130
 I am a father, assure to do the second part 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.050
 of this video and fifty and fifty 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.750
 they make a hundred here I have some 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.380
 how many and here I have the necessary 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.880
 to get to the 50 comments that 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.670
 come on my bags have been taken out in 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.170
 almost all acts in 1 2 3 4 5 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.070
 mainly 1 because he is helping 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.440
 to drip out that object 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.030
 I did not mention it to you but in the act 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.470
 about certain objects in all 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.990
 determined et cetera 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.950
 four in all the objects the bags and 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.360
 Well, there has been a bit of 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.370
 controversy these days because the 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.850
 bags is the best said the caches 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.380
 it seems that they were linked to the 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.790
 difficulty in which they opened instead 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.100
 of which were created and we already have 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.170
 patched seems to be then if you 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.310
 you get a normal bag because the 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.110
 odds that a legendary decides 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.610
 are going to be normal if you get in 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.560
 stormy and is for those of torment 6 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.400
 well after the sheet we're going to 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.340
 open to see what comes out 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.300
 well I'm already going there is a legendary 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:05.490
 over ring and it seems to me that there were 3 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:08.030
 it seems to me that from another legendary good 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.030
 we go well 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:15.729
 if I am able to see them here there is one and the 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:18.919
 another one because I do not know very well where 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:24.030
 but I'm going to get the gems better 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:26.080
 I say the gems the bags that I need 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.449
 there are at 100 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.750
 to we are and here we will continue opening 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:30.750
 the 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.949
 tell you that it is already opened also 25 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.990
 bags off camera and he dropped a 

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:42.120
 legendary and I have fallen for me 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.190
 it seems that two legendaries in 50 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.650
 bags just like the other with which 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:49.470
 well, it seems that the probability of 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:53.090
 get a legendary like that in a rough way 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.090
 because good to do a statistic 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:59.110
 the statistical generation with objects of 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:02.200
 little chance because it is not at all 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:04.080
 exact but good 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:07.139
 up to him 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:10.319
 the one that wanted another let's see it 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:16.050
 no this is not the one I wanted to do 3 and 3 1 

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:18.380
 that the pieces of that 3 24 well it happens to 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:21.850
 be 3 etc 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.850
 and let's see another legendary 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:28.499
 good these improve I come enough 

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:31.469
 well over with the poison damage that is 

00:07:28.499 --> 00:07:33.569
 what I wear to change my armor 

00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:35.770
 for vitality and ready and the ring we go 

00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:38.310
 Let's see 

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.310
 good 

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:43.580
 is not that much but good for 

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:46.340
 Well what I said 4% 

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.780
 approximately and well, this has 

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.820
 been everything and I hope it's enjoyed 

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:52.100
 this opening of bags 

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:55.240
 I stay here more for another day until 

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.240
 the next chao chao
