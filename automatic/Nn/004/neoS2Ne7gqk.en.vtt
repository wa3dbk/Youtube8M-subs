would<00:01:30.439> be<00:01:30.579> the<00:01:31.579> sliquifier<00:01:32.119> maybe<00:01:32.569> we'll

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:32.749 
would be the sliquifier maybe we'll

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:35.950 
would be the sliquifier maybe we'll
shoot<00:01:32.780> out<00:01:33.170> liquid<00:01:33.829> and<00:01:34.100> make<00:01:34.549> them<00:01:34.819> blow<00:01:35.780> up

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
shoot out liquid and make them blow up

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.419 
shoot out liquid and make them blow up
in<00:01:36.380> like<00:01:37.869> acid<00:01:38.869> turn<00:01:39.079> them<00:01:39.229> into<00:01:39.319> acid<00:01:39.829> or

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
in like acid turn them into acid or

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:43.859 
in like acid turn them into acid or
maybe<00:01:40.880> you<00:01:41.090> would<00:01:41.210> add<00:01:41.359> a<00:01:41.389> part<00:01:42.009> such<00:01:43.009> as<00:01:43.249> like

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
maybe you would add a part such as like

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.999 
maybe you would add a part such as like
something<00:01:44.869> that<00:01:44.899> would<00:01:45.139> make<00:01:45.200> them<00:01:45.560> freeze

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009

table<00:02:02.659> you're<00:02:03.139> gonna<00:02:03.289> have<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.829> either<00:02:04.310> put

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
table you're gonna have to either put

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.109 
table you're gonna have to either put
parts<00:02:05.299> onto<00:02:05.509> it<00:02:05.990> or<00:02:06.549> that's<00:02:07.549> the<00:02:07.729> only<00:02:07.969> way<00:02:08.090> I

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
parts onto it or that's the only way I

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.940 
parts onto it or that's the only way I
could<00:02:08.270> actually<00:02:08.569> see<00:02:09.020> it<00:02:09.140> is<00:02:09.289> putting<00:02:09.679> parts

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
could actually see it is putting parts

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.900 
could actually see it is putting parts
on<00:02:10.069> to<00:02:10.340> it<00:02:10.490> such<00:02:10.700> as<00:02:10.970> either<00:02:11.860> putting<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:13.220> I

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
on to it such as either putting a I

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.830 
on to it such as either putting a I
don't<00:02:14.780> know<00:02:14.959> a<00:02:15.670> tip<00:02:16.670> to<00:02:16.939> it<00:02:17.120> like<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.360> certain

different kind of tip and once

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.580 
different kind of tip and once
you<00:02:19.579> put<00:02:20.269> one<00:02:20.480> of<00:02:20.629> those<00:02:20.780> tips<00:02:21.079> on<00:02:21.260> you're<00:02:21.439> not

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
you put one of those tips on you're not

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.300 
you put one of those tips on you're not
able<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.310> go<00:02:22.760> to<00:02:22.819> another<00:02:23.269> tip<00:02:23.870> such<00:02:24.769> as<00:02:25.010> think

able to go to another tip such as think

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.759 
able to go to another tip such as think
of<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:25.549> as<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:26.030> upgrading<00:02:26.599> paths<00:02:26.989> if<00:02:27.349> you<00:02:27.590> go

of it as to upgrading paths if you go

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.099 
of it as to upgrading paths if you go
like<00:02:28.370> on<00:02:28.519> the<00:02:28.640> top<00:02:28.909> upgrading<00:02:29.569> path<00:02:29.780> you're

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:30.109 
like on the top upgrading path you're

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:32.349 
like on the top upgrading path you're
not<00:02:30.260> able<00:02:30.469> to<00:02:30.799> upgrade<00:02:30.980> any<00:02:31.579> to<00:02:31.879> the<00:02:32.000> bottom

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
upgrading path because you've already

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.140 
upgrading path because you've already

upgraded fully to the top upgrade path

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.819 
upgraded fully to the top upgrade path
another<00:02:38.150> thing<00:02:38.359> I<00:02:38.450> wanted<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.780> add<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:39.379> this<00:02:39.530> is

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
another thing I wanted to add to this is

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.690 
another thing I wanted to add to this is
a<00:02:39.969> what<00:02:40.969> if<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.209> add<00:02:41.650> every<00:02:42.650> single<00:02:43.159> tip<00:02:43.430> there

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
a what if you add every single tip there

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.530 
a what if you add every single tip there
is<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:44.329> be<00:02:45.019> like<00:02:45.230> a<00:02:45.879> multiple<00:02:46.879> wonder<00:02:47.209> weapon

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
is it be like a multiple wonder weapon

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.940 
is it be like a multiple wonder weapon
combined<00:02:47.989> so<00:02:48.469> basically<00:02:49.280> it's<00:02:50.030> like

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
combined so basically it's like

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.550 
combined so basically it's like
thundergun<00:02:51.950> winters<00:02:52.459> howl<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:54.549> sliquifier

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
thundergun winters howl and sliquifier

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.550 
thundergun winters howl and sliquifier
paralyzer<00:02:57.560> so<00:02:57.919> freezes<00:02:58.459> and<00:02:58.669> blows<00:02:59.000> them<00:02:59.209> away

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
paralyzer so freezes and blows them away

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.619 
paralyzer so freezes and blows them away
but<00:03:00.560> turns<00:03:01.069> them<00:03:01.280> into<00:03:01.370> acid<00:03:01.879> it's<00:03:02.090> either

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
but turns them into acid it's either

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:04.390 
but turns them into acid it's either
random<00:03:03.169> every<00:03:03.379> time<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:03.709> hit<00:03:03.799> him<00:03:03.950> or<00:03:04.159> maybe

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
random every time you hit him or maybe

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.300 
random every time you hit him or maybe
it<00:03:04.549> adds<00:03:04.700> every<00:03:05.209> single<00:03:05.510> effect<00:03:06.069> towards<00:03:07.069> each

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
it adds every single effect towards each

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.550 
it adds every single effect towards each
zombie<00:03:07.939> during<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:08.900> higher<00:03:09.049> rounds<00:03:09.439> because

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
zombie during the higher rounds because

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.879 
zombie during the higher rounds because
they<00:03:09.739> don't<00:03:09.919> die<00:03:10.159> right<00:03:10.430> away<00:03:10.750> maybe<00:03:11.889> every

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:12.889 
they don't die right away maybe every

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.259 
they don't die right away maybe every
effect<00:03:13.280> hits<00:03:13.609> that<00:03:13.879> zombie<00:03:14.329> to<00:03:14.569> kill<00:03:15.139> it

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
effect hits that zombie to kill it

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.089 
effect hits that zombie to kill it
another<00:03:17.269> thing<00:03:17.510> I<00:03:17.599> wanted<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:17.900> say<00:03:17.989> if<00:03:18.349> it<00:03:18.650> is<00:03:18.680> a

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
another thing I wanted to say if it is a

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.970 
another thing I wanted to say if it is a
buildable<00:03:19.909> I<00:03:20.319> don't<00:03:21.319> think<00:03:21.409> you're<00:03:21.650> going<00:03:21.950> to

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
buildable I don't think you're going to

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.119 
buildable I don't think you're going to
be<00:03:22.099> able<00:03:22.129> to<00:03:22.519> put<00:03:22.700> it<00:03:22.760> in<00:03:22.909> the<00:03:23.030> pack<00:03:23.359> a<00:03:23.389> punch

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
be able to put it in the pack a punch

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.559 
be able to put it in the pack a punch
that<00:03:25.129> makes<00:03:25.400> sense<00:03:25.609> because<00:03:25.849> the<00:03:26.209> sliquifier

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
that makes sense because the sliquifier

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.240 
that makes sense because the sliquifier
was<00:03:26.900> a<00:03:26.930> buildable<00:03:27.349> and<00:03:27.500> you<00:03:27.620> weren't<00:03:27.799> able<00:03:27.979> to

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
was a buildable and you weren't able to

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.330 
was a buildable and you weren't able to
pack<00:03:28.430> budget<00:03:29.290> but<00:03:30.290> i'm<00:03:30.409> pretty<00:03:30.620> much<00:03:30.769> bringing

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
pack budget but i'm pretty much bringing

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.809 
pack budget but i'm pretty much bringing
every<00:03:31.579> possibility<00:03:32.060> up<00:03:32.510> but<00:03:33.169> uh<00:03:33.430> we<00:03:34.430> do<00:03:34.639> know

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
every possibility up but uh we do know

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.860 
every possibility up but uh we do know
for<00:03:35.030> sure<00:03:35.209> it<00:03:35.359> is<00:03:35.479> a<00:03:35.510> staff<00:03:35.989> and<00:03:37.090> that's<00:03:38.090> pretty

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
for sure it is a staff and that's pretty

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.809 
for sure it is a staff and that's pretty
much<00:03:39.019> all<00:03:39.290> we<00:03:39.439> know<00:03:39.620> about<00:03:39.939> it<00:03:40.939> so<00:03:40.970> far<00:03:41.569> but<00:03:41.900> uh

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
much all we know about it so far but uh

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.080 
much all we know about it so far but uh

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:10.909 
months in advance have turned out to be

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.659 
months in advance have turned out to be
true<00:04:11.120> so<00:04:11.569> that's<00:04:11.900> my<00:04:12.109> proof<00:04:12.379> and<00:04:12.680> if<00:04:13.370> you<00:04:13.489> don't

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:13.669 
true so that's my proof and if you don't

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:15.999 
true so that's my proof and if you don't
believe<00:04:13.939> them<00:04:14.180> then<00:04:14.449> that<00:04:14.689> is<00:04:14.900> perfectly<00:04:15.889> fine

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:16.009 
believe them then that is perfectly fine

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.839 
believe them then that is perfectly fine
everybody's<00:04:16.849> opinion<00:04:17.329> but<00:04:17.709> it's<00:04:18.709> pretty<00:04:19.549> much

everybody's opinion but it's pretty much

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:22.120 
everybody's opinion but it's pretty much
whatever<00:04:20.180> they<00:04:20.479> say<00:04:20.720> is<00:04:20.900> probably<00:04:21.440> going<00:04:21.979> to
