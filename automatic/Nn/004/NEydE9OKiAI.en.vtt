 but a real commando should not 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.429
 only shoot well and fight but 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.130

 where to start well to start everything 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.390
 participants have memorized reading technique 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.320
 security 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.510
 they ask for some nuances 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.520
 which are incomprehensible then we explain 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.230
 what insurance system is insurance like 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.880
 move around the climbing wall if i 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.140
 lawyer party literally 20 minutes 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.140
 maybe he himself begins to move 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.120
 system holds almost 3 tons three 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.200
 you come up climbing wall you see such a thing 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.750
 eight is called 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.330
 and carbine device which slows down 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.980
 your fall comes and clings 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.980
 node meetings newcomer 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.840
 this knot taken in europe make everyone 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.120
 the world even if the former other warehouses 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.660
 european going for kids knot like 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.740
 like 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.280
 help which grandma knot of packs but 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:18.200
 if you crank it again 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:20.270
 you get type 8 justified that the shoes 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.750
 rock climbers 2 sizes smaller 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.330
 You also wear shoes with a tooth and for 4 and 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.310
 On 3 on 6 even sizes field such 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.320
 maniacs in general for what it is done 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.750
 so that people feel the rock better 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.850
 reliefs and a little hook which in 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.009
 there are ordinary big these boots in general 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.979
 it is impossible to take 2 sizes smaller then 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.290
 already more duck how to cope the field you 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.200
 it turns out a matter of habit first and second 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.090
 specificity of shoes that is, it is like ballet flats 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.980
 yes they have a curved shape and 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.630
 it turns out that the pressure is the most 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.360
 the main happens on the thumb and 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.620
 that is, we climb on the thumb all and 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.690
 smoothly unloading reloads on everything 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.250
 four fingers the rest is actually 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.810
 can hurt during the first two 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.630
 weeks then killed stretched 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.579
 takes shape 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:11.739
 climber and we all want to climb without 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:13.599
 everyone will be fine 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.800
 ready for the thread you can work we must 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.620
 try this exercise called 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.370
 sagged like this move on 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.069
 horizontals 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.140
 no more than two meters to children for pro 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.540
 allow a meter and a half this is already possible 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.640
 two meters case the fall should a little way 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.950
 Does smearing insurance for a cycle has 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.440
 active area which is convenient to take 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.330
 We now have a passive that all 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.380
 still not take the hookah just not working 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.930
 up the underside of the working man climbs 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.330
 kicking here with his hands but stick 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.549
 the main load must personally if the legs 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.650
 work means everything else with us 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.140
 will hold and here I want to 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.330
 further to be and special forces but special forces 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.069
 you need to not only shoot well but also 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.760
 fight well and climb rocks 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.260
 because it is useful in the city here 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.760
 Do you understand little such a thing that you 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.769
 came right now to do it 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.510
 climbing you will climb that is 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.549
 you will be the power of you will be agility 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.069
 flexibility if we talk about from the 15th not 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.049
 engaged in more mountaineering technique it 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.090
 way a rope using a special 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.489
 climbing equipment is climbing 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.230
 rope is the transportation of ammunition 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.450
 this here is just a sweep of the building when we 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.220
 dive headfirst this monica is different but 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.290
 if you look away from the left 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.359
 sides of the climbing wall up also with guys 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.100
 engaged in technology and cynicism ip inspect 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.470
 after climbing you can try and 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.769
 shake too thought just rise by 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.769
 the rope 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:52.870
 it was hard for me so they gave me another 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:54.000
 more difficult tasks fighters are afraid 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.709
 habits 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.910
 and very much now you yourself 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.340
 tied to the ropes we are with you 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.350
 Were at the beginning of training I want you 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.330
 It turns out you immediately see if you do not 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.549
 again you don't hand over the knot this eight 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.290
 meetings, let's go before people climbed old 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:11.650
 used alabaster different there 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.510
 powders but nothing better than magnesia and 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.630
 not found in the end it turns out that now 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.519
 abolished alabaster type because 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.500
 climbing wall hooks on the climbing wall property 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.360
 spoil they need to wash a nickname twins 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.850
 become slippery so now and 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.800
 internationally accepted that we use 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.270
 or dry or liquid magnesia which 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.850
 as it turns out like water 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.040
 rub hands it dries out and hands dry 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.990
 in about 50 minutes approximately 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.580
 i only moved horizontally you you 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.720
 you will go up the movement will be others 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.760
 monica awkwardly 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.680
 and your first task first first 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.080
 training for eating as high as possible 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.760
 as many times as possible 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.860
 would the body get used to the new task that you 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.500
 on a bit of the entire load on all parts of the body 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.120
 what if i fall i catch yours 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.180
 insurance top is called 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:05:10.240
 but for the length of 2. if where was 150 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:12.550
 kilogram hands start to hurt after already 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.950
 in the middle and up from honestly a little 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.870
 scary yourself pro in eat 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.070
 more difficult route skip overhang 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.890
 Here is a pink track 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.250
 all you can pull well let's 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.250
 started 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.900
 come down already come up for the third time 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.450
 all the same in the middle is scary all the same 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.880
 self-preservation instinct works now 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.280
 left the most difficult wall with the eaves 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.340
 that is, it is a complete overhang of the ceiling 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:58.680
 exits I think 85 that you don't 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.680
 can handle 2 percent of the window sounds 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.620
 today passed the driver's and two 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:22.110
 vertical walls passionate with cornice 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:25.699
 I could not conquer but next 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.699
 since I will definitely succeed
