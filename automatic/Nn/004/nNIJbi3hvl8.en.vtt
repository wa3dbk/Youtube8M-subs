00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello today we will consider 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.309
 neospy and version 40 about it 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.250
 Spy tracking software 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.269
 computer allows network 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.980
 administrators to control actions 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.830
 users remotely 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.750
 using any web browser program 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.850
 set to extra mode 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.740
 stealth allows you to choose 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.500
 Why specifically monitor whether 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.740
 keyboard separate windows printer mail 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.900
 agent browser and in other words she 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.460
 keeps track of all the actions that were 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.559
 produced on computer 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.739
 for that period of time when she worked 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.960
 the program keeps track of everything from the keys 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.910
 pressed on the keyboard to the documents 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.610
 which you printed on the printer 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.860
 also take screenshots are logged 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.660
 sites that have been visited since 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.239
 computer and more 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.230
 the program transfers all data directly 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.250
 administrator start with installation 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.770
 the program is installed pretty 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.739
 just like most ordinary 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.550
 programs window appears click 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.440
 run 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.510
 pops up the installation window if you 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.130
 Want to check whether the new version has been released 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.390
 programs click the appropriate 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.910
 a button 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.940
 but we don't need that at the moment 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.460
 for the version we downloaded the last one 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.530
 button further here is a short 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.020
 description of the program that she is from herself 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.510
 presents and brief instructions 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.120
 we press the button further because with 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.300
 the program we will meet now 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.160
 by myself 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.620
 next is the license agreement 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.110
 which we must confirm 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.360
 be sure to tick well as in 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.700
 all other programs confirm that 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.940
 use the program for legal purposes 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.920
 click the check mark and the button next 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.530
 next window you can change the directory 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.190
 installation program, all items are clear 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.270
 but perhaps explain the last point 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.850
 register reports in explorer 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.800
 windows that means reports that 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.080
 The created program will appear in 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:04.360
 windows explorer and will be displayed 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.360
 in the system we press the install button 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.870
 setting going will give 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.519
 quickly in the window that opens us 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.290
 warn of what will happen 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.280
 automatic tuning made 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.549
 firewall 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.980
 if there is one press the yes button 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:24.290

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.519
 if there are, press yes and 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:33.739
 waiting for the firewall window to pop up 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.620
 allow manual access to all networks 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.189
 installation is complete we press the button 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.480
 to complete 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.480
 and the program starts 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.740
 as the program 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.440
 some intuitive interface 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.990
 understandable but let's still consider 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.300
 This small menu is responsible for the selection. 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.300
 There are different color palettes for the program. 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.730
 palettes but keep the standard these colors 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.430
 the program does not affect the work 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.890
 before we start tracking we go 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.560
 in tracking settings what are we here 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.840
 see there are such useful things 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.050
 like admin password click 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.920
 tick here enter the password which 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.560
 will you come up 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.990
 naturally they themselves tick and 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.420
 open blocked six months here 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.490
 we enter the password for what this is needed 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.650
 password password will not give third-party 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.750
 users can enter the program 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.910
 also change the standard combination 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.990
 keys which displays the program and 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.450
 stealth mode 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.220
 if you don't want to keep track of one of 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.250
 proposed directories you can 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.740
 easily turn them off that is if you don't 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.610
 want to follow the messages and secu and 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.760
 mail agent 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.420
 you just remove the checkmarks opposite 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.000
 corresponding labels 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.370
 message clip history is also possible 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.280
 disable if you do not want to follow 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.500
 the printer is also disconnected for connection 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.220
 You can also disconnect to the Internet 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.220
 and so on 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.790
 if you want to 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.250
 track the remote computer 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.050
 whose Internet access you 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.879
 You can click on sending report

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.489
 which can only read 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.310
 program or as a webpage 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.500
 or text file here we enter 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.199
 mailbox which will be 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.330

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.540
 control air 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:48.850
 they will start tracking the shift control with 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.440
 stop tracking and so without 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.889
 delay go into stealth mode 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:57.010
 shift control is already the default shift 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:05:00.100
 control m will come out and the hidden mode is 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.350
 main hotkeys but others can 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.710
 look by clicking the help button 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.080
 the program 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.260
 let's see how the program works 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:13.140
 although there is nothing interesting in her work 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.320
 it is not visible only the result 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.880

 program ignore this tracking 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.940
 went but the program remains visible 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.860
 it can alert users and 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.080
 they won't do anything like that 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.080
 this computer click on the button 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.790

 keys shift control m press ok 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.730
 the whole program is hidden and its user 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.220
 not visible we can easily move away from 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.380
 computer giving the opportunity to the person behind 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.660

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.880

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.860
 you will come to the e-mail address you provided 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.100
 in the settings for example we go by 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.320
 All sites will bring to the program, you can log 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.960

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:16.260
 click stop tracking all 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.940
 tracking stopped and onwards the program 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.940
 offers us several options 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:23.520
 view reports first report by 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:27.030
 categories, that is, a report is issued in the form 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:29.310
 the report table is divided into window categories 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.110
 who discovered what they typed on 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.510
 keyboard screenshots 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.610
 every time we changed to a new one 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.280
 the program window did the screenshot here 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.670
 one of the screenshots also what was contained 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.290

 viewing slideshows are mainly based 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:06.450
 on the screenshots you took 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:08.910
