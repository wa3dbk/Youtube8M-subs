00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello welcome to this show 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.730
 questions and answers where you 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.820
 they ask and I answer 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.889
 and I speak bad I always speak badly in order 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.350
 you put questions on facebook or 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.869
 twitter and I answer them in the form of 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.880
 video mentioning his name is easy to 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.800
 understand that we were going mom let's start 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.830
 an ex but nando martínez asks 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.080
 what are your best games and in 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.390
 which ones would you like to be so my best 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.900
 games are hide and seek because I 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.910
 I'm small then it 's easy for me 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.980
 find places to hide because 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.610
 that with many parts but do not tease 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:45.320
 that I'm small because I'm big 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.850
 at heart and although maybe now 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.950
 stop my heart because that blow 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.960
 it was ghastly 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.910
 it's true fernando you said games like that 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.640
 that to make it plural av so 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.970
 least say two games that are better and 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.540
 well I'm also better at the game of 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.460
 love do not play with love that with 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.840
 that is not played and also that if it were a 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.359
 game 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.100
 I would be a loser and in what game 

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:12.289
 I would like to be because I would like to be in 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.569
 mario kart because you can handle like 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:16.340
 crazy is going to be like that marc or are they going to do 

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:17.929
 many things to throw will give a 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.000
 explosion in anything but you never 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:22.579
 you die and you can travel to different 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.289
 different parts of different headquarters 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.289
 different learn to speak 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.890
 efe / mario cartería very funny because 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.680
 for many reasons you can manage 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.050
 carlos lovely pretty carrot has 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.720
 many parts where to visit is like 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.890
 traveling to several worlds is one thing 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.720
 special in order mario karts saúl mora 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.700
 question that you recommend to start a 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.820
 youtube channel like yours 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.659
 so I want unseat no 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.820
 you want to be better 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.429
 Well today you say that I am the best but 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.229
 slight you want to do the competition no 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.670
 to do with that to start a channel 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.950
 of youtube what you have to do is 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.149
 open an account on youtube and start 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.149
 put virgins 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.780
 that's how simple it is but I think what 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.510
 that Saul is referring to is like having a 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.580
 popular youtube channel and I do not consider 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.620
 that my channel is super popular but if 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.900
 I have reached many people 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.690
 nice as you who like to see 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.210
 my face to laugh but finally the way 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.490
 to get to this point and even more 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.560
 because there is no there is not a key there is not a 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.540
 formula what I can advise you is 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.880
 that you simply do the videos that 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.040
 you would like to see if they are videos that do not 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.780
 they exist even better because they do not 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.310
 there are then you are arriving a site 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.870
 that other people like you too 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.250
 they want to see those videos if they do not exist and 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.080
 they are looking for it and can not find it and 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.730
 says these are the ones that I've been 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.830
 waiting for all my life I'm going to 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.810
 dedicate myself to support this person and 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.730
 follow them to the end that is the key 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.800
 because this the truth that many do not 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.350
 believe but do this how to dedicate 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.050
 so much time is hard not here not what 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.800
 they create it is difficult to keep videos because 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:09.170
 I have many channels too many then 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.060
 I put almost six videos every week and 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.760
 well, the point is that 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.830
 to the videos you want to see 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.990
 and if you're doing well, you're fine if it's not going 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.030
 all right 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:24.170
 well 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:27.830
 we cry together Jorge go I go you I'll 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.850
 rather beautiful not jorge not our 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.790
 relationship is not like that 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:35.930
 correct please because I respect 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:39.110
 please but if I had three wishes that 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.120
 asking for this is something that I really 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.280
 thought enough and the best three 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.840
 desires that you can go is I would choose 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:50.180
 the omnipotence the omniscience and the 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.060
 omnipresence what it means is that 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.100
 you have the power to do everything create everything 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.900
 do whatever is practically what 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.820
 you think the reality becomes 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.670
 omnipresence means that you know 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.230
 everything is all your secrets all bad 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.239
 that you have done all the good things that I do 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.390
 all the information that may exist in 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.220
 the universe would know it and the omnipresence 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.410
 it means that it could be in all 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.510
 the places at the same time 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.180
 lúcio wow only covers almost everything 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.340
 fly calzones can see through 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.169
 the dresses not that I would do that I'm not going to 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.850
 do that again because I will not use my 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.530
 powers for evil I will use them to 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.880
 good but I want to say what could 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.920
 do it all 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.910
 and if I become bad then what bad for 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.670
 what 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.010
 It would be very bad if it were bad but not 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:38.310
 I am bad and those are the three wishes that 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.560
 I choose what is you came down 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.870
 comments in stain asks that 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.700
 you should say or do when you do not feel 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.400
 comfortable in a group for example in the 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:51.410
 school or work etcetera and three pec 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.410
 of nothing 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.580
 and they ask you why are you so quiet 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.310
 perhaps we do you wrong I always answer 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.760
 the same but I would like to know what 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.470
 would you say thank you 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.160
 or the truth the truth if you want a 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:14.250
 true solution the only thing would be that you 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.080
 it will force yourself to speak and 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.200
 communicate 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.530
 and if you see I do not know how to communicate well 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.750
 that the goal the purpose is to communicate 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.040
 good with people and talk to them more and 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.480
 Well they will not say why you are so 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.830
 shut up because you're talking a lot 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.840
 then they will not say you're 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.490
 silent because you're not quiet it would be 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.470
 something illogical that grant that you are silent 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.670
 when you're not quiet so that 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:40.050
 it would be like I think a solution the 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.150
 truth is that from the saying to the fact there is a 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.070
 long stretch and it's not that easy to do that 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.260
 as it is to say and one does not go simply 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.530
 to communicate with everyone to talk to them 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.750
 to do as if one were extroverted the 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:55.770
 that most speaks the most communicated not 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.840
 that is very difficult in my real life I 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.390
 I am quite quiet and many people 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.240
 they believe that I do not want them that I am 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.520
 very chopped that something like that I do not know is many 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.129
 no no, I really do not know what they think 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.219
 what 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:12.709
 I almost do not talk to them then I've 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:14.959
 known of some opinions because I 

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:16.909
 have other people said what they think or 

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:19.399
 what many people think sometimes 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:22.220
 They think that I make a bad face of them without a doubt 

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:24.740
 just my face 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.650
 and that's how my face looks when I do not have 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.060
 expressions and think that I am 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.800
 making a face and I'm just 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.050
 I'm just walking around 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.200
 there the solution is what I told you but 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.780
 to get to communicate more takes 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:42.440
 pretty confident in yourself and 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:44.300
 pretty practical and get pretty 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.090
 uncomfortable in those situations you have to 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.440
 make you uncomfortable to later feel 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:52.310
 comfortable 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:54.860
 I think I hope that helps you 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:58.730
 truth is something that I also need 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:00.110
 help I think but it's all for today I hope 

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:02.210
 that you liked this video that does not 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:05.540
 have enjoyed that they have laughed at 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:08.060
 laughter or at least a giggle like that 

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.490
 so then I hope that really what 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.410
 have enjoyed and I ran out of 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.390
 questions so stay tuned in 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:16.880
 twitter and facebook for the next time 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:19.460
 I connect more questions to 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.350
 answer them and next time no longer 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.690
 let's repeat more questions no longer 

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.520
 because there are many already repeated but I already 

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.680
 I'm going to have to choose the best ones 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:31.730
 so next time you ask me 

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:34.250
 exquisite and precious questions and 

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:36.940
 tasty I love you very much blessings 

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.940
 bye
