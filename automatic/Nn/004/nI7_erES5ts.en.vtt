realistically<00:00:13.679> but<00:00:14.639> essentially<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.980> rabbit

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
realistically but essentially a rabbit

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.220 
realistically but essentially a rabbit
boils<00:00:17.279> down<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.460> just<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.539> couple<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.930> shapes

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
boils down to just a couple of shapes

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.849 
boils down to just a couple of shapes
you<00:00:19.439> have<00:00:20.510> sort<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.570> an<00:00:21.689> egg<00:00:21.900> shape<00:00:22.199> much<00:00:22.680> like

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
you have sort of an egg shape much like

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.560 
you have sort of an egg shape much like
a<00:00:22.890> human<00:00:23.100> head<00:00:25.789> going<00:00:26.789> from<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.090> nose<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.539> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
a human head going from the nose to the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.390 
a human head going from the nose to the
back<00:00:27.810> we're<00:00:28.349> gonna<00:00:28.470> do<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> profile<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.160> a

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
back we're gonna do a profile of a

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.540 
back we're gonna do a profile of a
rabbit<00:00:29.699> here<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.740> then<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.830> have<00:00:32.009> basically

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
rabbit here and then you have basically

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:43.110 
rabbit here and then you have basically
a<00:00:32.669> large<00:00:34.610> angled<00:00:35.610> oval<00:00:36.059> for<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.660> body

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.930 

larger<00:00:44.080> than<00:00:44.230> that<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:45.930> there's<00:00:46.930> very<00:00:47.200> little

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
larger than that and there's very little

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.400 
larger than that and there's very little
neck<00:00:48.940> involved<00:00:49.720> in<00:00:50.440> a<00:00:50.560> rabbit

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
neck involved in a rabbit

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.060 
neck involved in a rabbit
you've<00:00:53.410> also<00:00:53.680> only<00:00:53.830> get<00:00:54.010> a<00:00:54.040> curve<00:00:54.370> there<00:00:56.070> now

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
you've also only get a curve there now

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.500 
you've also only get a curve there now
you<00:00:57.130> get<00:00:57.340> a<00:00:57.370> little<00:00:57.430> sharper<00:00:57.910> of<00:00:58.000> an<00:00:58.060> angle<00:00:58.390> on

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
you get a little sharper of an angle on

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.670 
you get a little sharper of an angle on
the<00:00:58.600> brow<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.960> can<00:01:01.990> go<00:01:02.170> ahead<00:01:02.260> and<00:01:02.440> get<00:01:02.560> your

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
the brow you can go ahead and get your

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.430 
the brow you can go ahead and get your
ears<00:01:02.950> in<00:01:06.540> everything's<00:01:07.540> curved<00:01:07.900> on<00:01:08.170> a<00:01:08.200> rabbit

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.359 

and<00:01:19.630> you<00:01:20.439> can<00:01:20.560> get<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:20.829> impression<00:01:21.189> of<00:01:21.250> the

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:30.819 
they have a line that comes down from

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
mess to each side around that line on

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.620 
mess to each side around that line on
each<00:01:44.170> side<00:01:44.380> of<00:01:44.469> that<00:01:44.500> line<00:01:45.000> from<00:01:46.000> this<00:01:46.179> angle

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
each side of that line from this angle

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.789 
each side of that line from this angle
from<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.649> profile<00:01:48.069> you<00:01:48.759> won't<00:01:48.939> really<00:01:49.060> even

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
from the profile you won't really even

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.380 
from the profile you won't really even
see<00:01:50.799> the<00:01:50.979> mouth<00:01:51.220> itself<00:01:51.700> that<00:01:51.880> much<00:01:52.030> mostly

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390

just that chubby muzzle now as you see
here's<00:01:59.229> where<00:01:59.349> we<00:01:59.500> really<00:01:59.739> can<00:01:59.890> see<00:02:00.099> that

00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:00.849 
here's where we really can see that

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:05.609 
here's where we really can see that
there's<00:02:01.060> no<00:02:01.270> neck<00:02:01.770> involved<00:02:04.079> or<00:02:05.079> that<00:02:05.289> it's<00:02:05.439> so

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
there's no neck involved or that it's so

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.050 
there's no neck involved or that it's so
thick<00:02:05.950> that<00:02:05.979> it's<00:02:06.280> hard<00:02:06.459> to<00:02:06.520> tell<00:02:06.759> it's<00:02:06.909> a

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
thick that it's hard to tell it's a

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.100 
thick that it's hard to tell it's a
knack<00:02:07.209> it<00:02:07.329> looks<00:02:07.479> like<00:02:07.599> it's<00:02:07.719> just<00:02:07.840> part<00:02:08.079> of

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
knack it looks like it's just part of

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.160 
knack it looks like it's just part of
the<00:02:08.200> body<00:02:09.269> now<00:02:10.269> you<00:02:10.299> can<00:02:10.509> use<00:02:10.690> some<00:02:10.840> scratchy

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
the body now you can use some scratchy

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.949 
the body now you can use some scratchy
edges<00:02:11.709> here<00:02:12.120> depending<00:02:13.120> on<00:02:13.209> how<00:02:13.329> fluffy<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.900> a

to a cat's when you're looking at a cat
straight<00:02:28.030> on<00:02:28.209> you<00:02:28.450> have<00:02:28.630> this<00:02:29.639> definite<00:02:32.459> angle

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
straight on you have this definite angle

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.599 
straight on you have this definite angle
that's<00:02:34.060> 45-degree<00:02:34.989> but<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.230> Rabbids<00:02:37.079> it's

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
that's 45-degree but a Rabbids it's

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.789 
that's 45-degree but a Rabbids it's
almost<00:02:39.609> a<00:02:39.819> 90-degree<00:02:40.540> angle<00:02:40.569> if<00:02:41.470> you<00:02:41.709> were

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
almost a 90-degree angle if you were

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.420 
almost a 90-degree angle if you were
looking<00:02:41.920> straight<00:02:42.340> on<00:02:42.370> them<00:02:44.099> so<00:02:45.099> even<00:02:45.250> from

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
looking straight on them so even from

looking straight on them so even from
the<00:02:45.579> profile<00:02:46.000> we<00:02:46.209> can<00:02:46.239> see<00:02:46.540> this<00:02:46.750> almost

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
the profile we can see this almost
