much else he's not able to get that much

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.679 
much else he's not able to get that much
out<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:53.700> he<00:01:53.790> wasn't<00:01:53.939> able<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.180> take<00:01:54.329> out<00:01:54.479> one

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
out so he wasn't able to take out one

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.030 
out so he wasn't able to take out one
storage<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.200> was<00:01:55.320> like<00:01:55.409> he's<00:01:55.530> actually<00:01:55.710> getting

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
storage I was like he's actually getting

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.289 
storage I was like he's actually getting
pretty<00:01:56.130> close<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.460> taking<00:01:56.729> out<00:01:56.939> another<00:01:57.180> one

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
pretty close to taking out another one

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.120 
pretty close to taking out another one
which<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.540> surprising<00:01:58.049> cuz<00:01:58.200> watch<00:01:58.710> my<00:01:58.890> wizard

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
which is surprising cuz watch my wizard

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.340 
which is surprising cuz watch my wizard
tower<00:01:59.369> over<00:01:59.670> here<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.210> keeps<00:02:00.570> on<00:02:00.750> wanting<00:02:01.049> to

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
tower over here it keeps on wanting to

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.870 
tower over here it keeps on wanting to
shoot<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.860> then<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.130> doesn't<00:02:02.369> especially

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
shoot and then it doesn't especially

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.340 
shoot and then it doesn't especially
with<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.090> goblins<00:02:03.420> watch<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.750> here<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:03.990> goes

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
with the goblins watch it here it goes

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.830 
with the goblins watch it here it goes
it<00:02:04.590> wants<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.950> shoot<00:02:05.130> nope<00:02:05.520> nope<00:02:05.880> nope<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:06.689> it

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
it wants to shoot nope nope nope but it

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.169 
it wants to shoot nope nope nope but it
doesn't<00:02:07.229> shoot<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.160> goblins<00:02:08.759> are<00:02:08.879> able<00:02:09.149> to

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
doesn't shoot so the goblins are able to

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.809 
doesn't shoot so the goblins are able to
take<00:02:09.509> out<00:02:09.750> some<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.590> my<00:02:10.709> elixir<00:02:11.129> but<00:02:11.730> my

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
take out some of my elixir but my

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.020 
take out some of my elixir but my
withered<00:02:12.150> hour<00:02:12.300> doesn't<00:02:12.599> do<00:02:12.750> anything

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
withered hour doesn't do anything

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.559 
withered hour doesn't do anything
about<00:02:13.300> it<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:14.370> conclusion<00:02:15.370> wizard<00:02:16.000> tower<00:02:16.209> is<00:02:16.540> a

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
about it so conclusion wizard tower is a

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.930 
about it so conclusion wizard tower is a
