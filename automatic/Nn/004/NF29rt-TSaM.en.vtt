00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.480
 starts with the automatic mode jova 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.519
 my device then I had on the mode 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.890
 I feel it's fashion 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.250
 here the famous manual so we hold 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.590
 surely the multi game I was falling to them 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.019
 you are not she who the automatic mode of 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.230
 dead proved with my peace now 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:41.670
 I'm doing the focus my hands said 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.100
 that I am and so was they if they change 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.030
 values ​​same depth as joseph 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.040
 in f3 game now air 13th tell me 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.690
 so the automatic upholstery mode 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.170
 from the moment in France the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.559
 button halfway makes him a bet at 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.449
 point 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.570
 then gives exactly the light he 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.219
 I need to clear air subject 13 which 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.339
 will we so according to the texts in two 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.009
 hundredths of speed so I repeat no 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.590
 automatic the mode side t she I 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.280
 amuses me to the point like this one I am 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.530
 an air 13 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.820
 I am half buried in the setting 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.009
 at the point is done now I 'm doing my 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.020
 picture like this I gave myself 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.850
 exactly the right light that me 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.619
 needed to clear in automatic mode 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.299
 you will see what to do with your 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.890
 photo and virtual goods nude during 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.630
 three seconds is that it tells me 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.960
 picked up the light for a photo this 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.939
 time their no I had the state towards 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.650
 the future it is necessary what the pilot in 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.759
 red it suddenly what I have this 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.600
 phase could make another photo 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.640
 all alone now I'm going to you 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.680
 show the exposure correction 12 h 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.409
 so it's very simple is that we 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.000
 can we even manage are in mode 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.380
 manual 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.020
 exposure correction as a 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.320
 example on the button c is here I the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.229
 keep in French until 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:01.590
 this icon with the flash more - in this 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.799
 it is at + 0 displays with the wheel and 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.680
 sigean once shot to add or 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.970
 remove the power to my flash from 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.079
 fingers what she wants to calculate in order to 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.030
 focus 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:14.850
 so if I would like that they would not 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.750
 his presentation a bit more than his calculation 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.340
 I'm holding on to that so it's a manna to 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.040
 the college for exposure correction 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.620
 flash so I can send more or less 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:30.030
 in this book is so I love you more in 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.890
 more to the media on the picture of which there is 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.110
 cleared a little bit stronger than she 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.430
 wants 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.500
 need now I 'm going to show you 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.390
 exposure bracketing what is 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.550
 it's actually exposure bracketing 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.740
 does it make three photos and then that 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.840
 I can program my flash to give myself 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.110
 a normal picture according to the focus 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:51.040
 I redo a picture under exposed and a 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.900
 other photo / exposes then to access 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.740
 to this theme beyond we would weigh on 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.870
 this right here as sometimes towards no 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.490
 a second time until you 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.950
 have three pictures one part from 6 others 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.780
 perez case whose value zero in switzerland 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.690
 can turn the wheel 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.730
 I'm at 1/3 2/3 it was the stats of 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.870
 differences that will have in each photo 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.860
 for my exhibitions 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.450
 so we will put up to 3 so I 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.940
 repeat my first picture is going to be normal 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.040
 normal lighting according to the setting 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.290
 remote point that I will have the second 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.720
 photo is the west way underexposed 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.810
 so the flash see pope is less strong 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.250
 then my third picture she admits to be 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.989
 overexposed that's what they call it 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.989
 flash exposure bracketing
