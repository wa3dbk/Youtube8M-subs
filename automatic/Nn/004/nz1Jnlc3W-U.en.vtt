00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:15.279
 with a girl in good state I hope everything is fine 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.560
 Benitez is the first 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.859
 video tutorial of the team and he is not obliged and rice 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.189
 what not 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.689
 some people know they do not have others I do not ask for armed peace 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.689
 by the world of sewing 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.240
 he commented 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.340
 new made bo that did not carry the smaller x of eike 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.300
 and as here on the blog on it as I put it to drop on here on the blog of 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.650
 All the best, a little 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.729
 I'll go then 

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:45.290
 but I would risk 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.870
 showing things always choices hot can lose in the day to day 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.649
 teams from the east to people even if it is not practical and everyone knows 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.930
 so the first tip 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.860
 barbie house 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.780
 How to Nail a Button 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.860
 so let's go, it's all right in correcting ferentz here it's squire 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.210
 according to the leader 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.110
 I put a button in place 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.010
 what i want is good usually when i dropped the button he already did 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.030
 score five goals 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.210
 of the previous line then in force does not have much problem 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.230
 this period 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.210
 so let's go there with a dead line 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.210
 the son here in the hole 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.970
 and the other around here 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.480
 very simple 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.300
 The agenda, we are not able to make ends meet. 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.960
 the right kind of glue some problem 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.090
 We come here and remember where we put it. 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.930
 also because not to be wrong does not stay 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.930
 I do not doubt that it is 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.290
 we repeat this procedure 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.690
 three or four children 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.079
 interesting we did not push too much too 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:16.699
 so that there is a certain distance between the button and the fabric even more if 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:19.939
 the fabric of the standing committee meeting 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.519
 Finally, let the blouse go quiet. 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:23.929
 if you have a tissue 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:26.849
 but earned above this percentage 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.869
 a feat that I never got to enter here striker 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:32.399
 in theory it was theatrical we're going to stop 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:36.799
 if the button for the main end of two little pigs then here for the rudder 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.809
 that presents to give a but not it is not then we go to the side 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.199
 I'd rather do five parallel lines to fitur than do with my whores 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.359
 dated 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.359
 suddenly 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:15.969
 arrived here 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:18.969
 I think it's interesting to give us a security that we can do. 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:24.429
 We feel like we're coming back but will not go through any little houses. 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.799
 I found some walks here. 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.099
 back 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.099
 back again 

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:52.729
 Paul has 

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:55.609
 Here I am going to do 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.609
 it's a speck that it contained a boat that we know 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:02.329
 I think we're living in a state in the world. 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.329
 little it 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.239
 kutcher 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.239
 that year 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.049
 invent close all that is that you will make joke or evil 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.969
 I always go more than one 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:24.409
 what is for you 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:26.309
 mainz 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:28.729
 what is to be more 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:31.580
 tourism - peaks on Monday 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.580
 or the code 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:38.749
 it costs a little more 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:45.879
 the crowd 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.330
 button already placed 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.089
 the second party 

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:07.089
 right 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.439
 with a space 15min35 and the button 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:15.490
 for you to be able 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.479
 I had to have made a home here. 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.990
 exemplifies this is 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.870
 put on 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.240
 anyway this 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.939
 I hope you enjoyed 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:30.459
 hope it was the motto is a pretty basic tip but there are things that are 

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:32.729
 machines and not everyone knows how to do 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.839
 so I do not find it interesting, we share 

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:38.089
 and any doubt you can 

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:41.189
 for being blog comments 

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:43.800
 Is it good to be with God? 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.819
 on teahupoo tah that I'm dying of shame 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:47.940
 no longer 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.789
 I'm going to take a second good time. 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:52.479
