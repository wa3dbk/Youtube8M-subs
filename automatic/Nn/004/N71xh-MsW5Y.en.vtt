00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
half which is afoot sometime in the

half which is afoot sometime in the
first<00:00:28.390> off<00:00:28.660> if<00:00:28.930> we<00:00:29.860> kept<00:00:30.160> cool<00:00:30.430> around<00:00:30.760> the<00:00:30.939> box

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
first off if we kept cool around the box

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.040 
first off if we kept cool around the box
and<00:00:31.360> more<00:00:31.600> awareness<00:00:32.070> on<00:00:33.070> the<00:00:33.309> ball<00:00:33.870> we<00:00:34.870> could

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
and more awareness on the ball we could

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.600 
and more awareness on the ball we could
have<00:00:35.140> had<00:00:35.260> maybe<00:00:35.470> another<00:00:35.950> opportunity<00:00:36.220> to

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
have had maybe another opportunity to

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.820 
have had maybe another opportunity to
score<00:00:36.760> second<00:00:37.180> go<00:00:37.300> we<00:00:37.720> didn't<00:00:38.020> they<00:00:38.650> played

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
score second go we didn't they played

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.260 
score second go we didn't they played
better<00:00:39.040> than<00:00:39.129> us<00:00:39.370> in<00:00:39.489> the<00:00:39.580> second<00:00:39.850> half<00:00:40.000> and

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
better than us in the second half and

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.040 
better than us in the second half and
they<00:00:40.629> scored<00:00:40.930> two<00:00:41.110> they<00:00:41.340> should<00:00:42.340> have<00:00:42.460> scored

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
they scored two they should have scored

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.770 
they scored two they should have scored
pre-weighed<00:00:44.050> the<00:00:44.290> pole<00:00:44.470> so<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:46.360> idea<00:00:46.449> of<00:00:46.720> the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
pre-weighed the pole so the idea of the

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.820 
pre-weighed the pole so the idea of the
day<00:00:46.930> maybe<00:00:47.680> the<00:00:48.000> drawers<00:00:49.000> was<00:00:49.900> a<00:00:49.930> fair<00:00:50.320> one<00:00:50.530> but

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
day maybe the drawers was a fair one but

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.770 
day maybe the drawers was a fair one but
as<00:00:51.730> I<00:00:51.790> said<00:00:52.000> you<00:00:52.150> know<00:00:52.239> we<00:00:52.330> need<00:00:52.449> to<00:00:52.540> be<00:00:52.629> more

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
as I said you know we need to be more

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.570 
as I said you know we need to be more
consistent<00:00:53.080> only<00:00:53.589> not<00:00:53.830> only<00:00:53.860> playing<00:00:54.339> well

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580
