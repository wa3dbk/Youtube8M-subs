have six teams and it seems that this
works<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:35.160> mercs<00:00:35.760> as<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.570> can<00:00:36.690> see<00:00:36.870> I'm<00:00:36.989> going

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
works is mercs as you can see I'm going

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.950 
works is mercs as you can see I'm going
to<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.440> right<00:00:37.620> now<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.100> ISA<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.390> basically

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
to that right now and ISA so basically

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.490 
to that right now and ISA so basically
what<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.350> have<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.559> do<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.950> start<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.700> game

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
what you have to do is start the game

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.470 
what you have to do is start the game
and<00:00:43.500> just<00:00:44.250> get<00:00:44.430> one<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.700> flags<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.270> sting

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
and just get one of the flags and sting

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.000 
and just get one of the flags and sting
in<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.660> next<00:00:45.840> one<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.170> reason<00:00:46.440> this

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
in the next one and the reason this

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.910 
in the next one and the reason this
works<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.700> because<00:00:47.789> there's<00:00:48.629> six<00:00:48.960> teams<00:00:49.289> so

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
works is because there's six teams so

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.529 
works is because there's six teams so
you're<00:00:50.219> just<00:00:50.280> gonna<00:00:50.399> be<00:00:50.579> taking<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:51.239> different

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
you're just gonna be taking a different

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.189 
you're just gonna be taking a different
teams<00:00:52.110> flag<00:00:52.410> or<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> whole<00:00:52.980> entire<00:00:53.190> time<00:00:53.250> so

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
teams flag or the whole entire time so

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.020 
teams flag or the whole entire time so
it's<00:00:55.199> going<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.410> keep<00:00:55.559> getting<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.980> lot<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.489> XP

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030
