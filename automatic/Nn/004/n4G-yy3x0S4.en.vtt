00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
love my heart controlling system I

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.830 
love my heart controlling system I
installed<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.669> myself<00:00:32.850> actually<00:00:33.480> with<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
installed it myself actually with the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.790 
installed it myself actually with the
help<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.290> couple<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.590> friends<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.120> it's

help of a couple of friends and it's

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.010 
help of a couple of friends and it's
replacing<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.980> 20<00:00:38.460> year<00:00:38.640> old<00:00:38.790> heart<00:00:39.510> controller

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
replacing a 20 year old heart controller

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.290 
replacing a 20 year old heart controller
that<00:00:40.590> was<00:00:40.770> still<00:00:40.980> going<00:00:41.010> strong<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.879> just<00:00:42.090> felt

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
that was still going strong I just felt

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.889 
that was still going strong I just felt
it<00:00:42.450> was<00:00:42.680> time<00:00:43.680> for<00:00:43.739> an<00:00:44.010> upgrade<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.690> new

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
it was time for an upgrade so the new

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.630 
it was time for an upgrade so the new
heart<00:00:46.140> controllers<00:00:46.620> are<00:00:46.829> really<00:00:47.190> great<00:00:47.430> they

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
heart controllers are really great they

heart controllers are really great they
offer<00:00:47.789> some<00:00:48.149> real<00:00:48.840> improvements<00:00:49.530> over

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
offer some real improvements over

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.290 
offer some real improvements over
furling<00:00:50.219> systems<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.910> have<00:00:51.030> been<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
furling systems that have been on the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.720 
furling systems that have been on the
market<00:00:51.690> for<00:00:51.960> years<00:00:52.280> first<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.489> all<00:00:53.579> they're

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
market for years first of all they're

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.160 
market for years first of all they're
made<00:00:53.910> from<00:00:54.090> totally<00:00:54.600> non<00:00:54.750> corrosive

aluminum<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:02.039> have<00:01:02.160> stainless<00:01:02.520> steel<00:01:02.730> things

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
aluminum you have stainless steel things

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.719 
aluminum you have stainless steel things
that<00:01:03.780> are<00:01:03.899> going<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.049> hold<00:01:04.350> up<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.460> salt

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
that are going to hold up to the salt

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.840 
that are going to hold up to the salt
and<00:01:06.030> sea<00:01:06.689> conditions<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.830> we<00:01:07.950> all<00:01:08.100> find

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
and sea conditions that we all find

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.710 
and sea conditions that we all find

the great thing about a furler instead
of<00:02:15.480> hanged<00:02:15.750> on<00:02:15.960> sale<00:02:16.290> is<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.740> can<00:02:16.920> be<00:02:17.070> much

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
of hanged on sale is it can be much

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.000 
of hanged on sale is it can be much
safer<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.420> takes<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:19.050> lot<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.500> stress<00:02:19.770> out

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
safer and takes a lot of the stress out
