year<00:00:55.629> I<00:00:56.629> thought<00:00:57.289> both<00:00:57.559> games<00:00:57.920> would<00:00:58.129> be<00:00:58.249> three

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
year I thought both games would be three

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.000 
year I thought both games would be three
point<00:00:58.760> games<00:00:59.030> I<00:00:59.420> got<00:01:00.229> them<00:01:00.350> both<00:01:00.499> right<00:01:00.769> but

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
point games I got them both right but

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.829 
point games I got them both right but
that's<00:01:01.129> not<00:01:01.249> the<00:01:01.459> point<00:01:01.639> I<00:01:01.909> mean<00:01:02.120> but<00:01:02.359> they

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
that's not the point I mean but they

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:04.450 
that's not the point I mean but they
were<00:01:02.899> both<00:01:03.139> close<00:01:03.409> I<00:01:03.679> thought<00:01:03.859> they'd<00:01:04.040> both<00:01:04.220> be

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
were both close I thought they'd both be

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.430 
were both close I thought they'd both be
three<00:01:04.670> point<00:01:04.879> games<00:01:05.150> I<00:01:05.449> thought<00:01:06.049> they'd<00:01:06.260> both

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
three point games I thought they'd both

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.740 
three point games I thought they'd both
be<00:01:06.650> very<00:01:06.860> close<00:01:07.100> games<00:01:07.369> and<00:01:07.670> let's<00:01:08.270> be<00:01:08.420> honest

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
game played where the defenses were the

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.809 
game played where the defenses were the

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
they won but I'm gonna be honest with

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.110 
they won but I'm gonna be honest with
you

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
you

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.620 
you
watching<00:05:19.630> the<00:05:19.750> game<00:05:20.130> when<00:05:21.130> the<00:05:21.250> Giants<00:05:21.880> punted

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
watching the game when the Giants punted

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.860 
watching the game when the Giants punted
at<00:05:23.410> that<00:05:24.010> point<00:05:24.370> I<00:05:24.610> thought<00:05:25.450> they<00:05:25.630> were<00:05:25.720> gonna

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
at that point I thought they were gonna

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.410 
at that point I thought they were gonna
get<00:05:26.020> beat<00:05:26.230> I<00:05:26.500> don't<00:05:27.310> think<00:05:27.580> if<00:05:27.790> they<00:05:27.970> did<00:05:28.030> not

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:28.420 
get beat I don't think if they did not

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.110 
get beat I don't think if they did not
turn<00:05:28.720> the<00:05:28.840> ball<00:05:28.870> over<00:05:29.050> I<00:05:29.470> do<00:05:29.530> not<00:05:29.890> think<00:05:30.250> the

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
turn the ball over I do not think the

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.910 
turn the ball over I do not think the
Giants<00:05:31.660> were<00:05:31.780> going<00:05:32.080> to<00:05:32.200> drive<00:05:32.500> for<00:05:32.890> a

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
Giants were going to drive for a

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.460 
Giants were going to drive for a
touchdown<00:05:33.190> on<00:05:33.640> that<00:05:33.790> team<00:05:34.050> that's<00:05:35.050> how<00:05:35.260> well

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
touchdown on that team that's how well

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.410 
touchdown on that team that's how well
the<00:05:35.590> defenses<00:05:36.100> were<00:05:36.250> playing<00:05:36.520> I<00:05:36.730> thought<00:05:37.210> that

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.420 
the defenses were playing I thought that

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.880 
the defenses were playing I thought that
the<00:05:37.570> I<00:05:37.600> thought<00:05:37.990> the<00:05:38.110> momentum<00:05:38.500> had<00:05:38.650> clearly

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
the I thought the momentum had clearly

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.800 
the I thought the momentum had clearly
swung<00:05:39.280> completely<00:05:39.880> to<00:05:39.970> San<00:05:40.150> Francisco

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
swung completely to San Francisco

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.810 
swung completely to San Francisco
I<00:05:40.840> think<00:05:41.320> the<00:05:41.440> inference<00:05:41.920> Isco<00:05:42.190> pass-rush<00:05:42.430> was

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
I think the inference Isco pass-rush was

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.940 
I think the inference Isco pass-rush was
at<00:05:42.940> that<00:05:43.060> point<00:05:43.300> dominating<00:05:43.960> the<00:05:44.050> game<00:05:44.200> and<00:05:44.470> I

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
at that point dominating the game and I

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.320 
at that point dominating the game and I
really<00:05:45.340> believe<00:05:45.670> the<00:05:45.850> Giants<00:05:46.150> would<00:05:46.210> have

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
really believe the Giants would have

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.060 
really believe the Giants would have
lost<00:05:46.480> if<00:05:46.660> that<00:05:46.810> ball<00:05:47.020> was<00:05:47.080> not<00:05:47.530> if<00:05:47.740> they<00:05:47.890> had

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
lost if that ball was not if they had

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.920 
lost if that ball was not if they had
run<00:05:48.490> three<00:05:48.700> plays<00:05:48.910> and<00:05:48.940> punted<00:05:49.390> it<00:05:49.450> back<00:05:49.690> I

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
run three plays and punted it back I

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.250 
run three plays and punted it back I
think<00:05:50.170> that<00:05:50.380> game<00:05:50.680> would<00:05:50.830> end<00:05:51.070> at<00:05:51.220> 1410<00:05:51.790> I

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
think that game would end at 1410 I

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.360 
think that game would end at 1410 I
really<00:05:53.260> believe<00:05:53.500> that's<00:05:53.950> what<00:05:54.070> I<00:05:54.100> believe<00:05:54.340> in

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
really believe that's what I believe in

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.460 
really believe that's what I believe in
my<00:05:54.520> heart<00:05:54.930> but<00:05:55.930> it<00:05:56.050> didn't

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
my heart but it didn't

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.860 
my heart but it didn't
and<00:05:56.670> give<00:05:57.670> the<00:05:57.850> Giants<00:05:57.880> any<00:05:58.450> like<00:05:58.630> credit

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
and give the Giants any like credit

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.230 
and give the Giants any like credit
because<00:05:59.110> on<00:05:59.410> third<00:05:59.710> and<00:05:59.890> 15<00:06:00.070> the<00:06:00.850> Giants
