00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello guys with you moto today 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.819
 I'll show you one very cool set with 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.069
 diamond village with emeralds with 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.559
 iron and a lot of any yummy 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.750
 here is something that is called the seed 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.610
 brother let's generate peace with you 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.039
 finally look at all this and so 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.199
 here and at the beginning of the village and in this 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.769
 the village we have an anvil that is 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.199
 in some villages there is none but here in 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.150
 this village is present here 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.830
 a chest that we can safely entangle 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.710
 but preliminary and stew 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.579
 this fire what does the chest do we have 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.989
 a pair of emerald iron saddle from 4 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:43.320
 pieces of iron in general I already said yes 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.500
 and ink bags well after which 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.850
 we go out of the anvil and apparently 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.520
 he is the head 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.890
 we fly to her that is, we first fly to her 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.140
 so as landmarks for you here 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.079
 fly to her then we take a little bit more to the right or 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.079
 sim here here here here there is a big 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.969
 such a canyon down a cliff here we fly to 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.650
 we already see coal on his way 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.549
 iron along the way is generally a lot of us 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.960
 iron meet right there and do not climb 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.020
 down we climb 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:18.000
 here here here here here 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.970
 not to the bottom but a little bit more precisely a little 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.070
 higher and slightly higher 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.409
 go down below here a lot 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.460
 iron is a lot of all sorts of different 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.850
 ores here is iron here lava it means 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.610
 it means if you are right 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.400
 if you see the words here yes here we go 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.100
 then left and go down here below 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.710
 we have a red stone and here they are ours 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.890

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.500
 no no no my nothing here 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.390
 after which we go up here 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.049
 here we rise by the way 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.060
 lapis lazuli about him I did not know before 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.490
 lapis lazuli and it will see very well sometimes 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:08.009

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.370
 I may not be able to tidy but 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.860
