00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.660
 The little boy on the ice 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.590
 It has not frozen frozen ice this year. 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.400
 The little boy stands by the pond and speaks to himself very softly: 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:44.070
 "I'll risk it, the ice, it has to carry. 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.000
 Who knows! "The little boy stomps and hacks 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 with his boot. The ice crackles at once 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:04.469
 and crash! already it breaks in. The little boy splashes and crawls, 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.759
 like a crab and wriggling with arm and leg. 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.470
 "O help, I must sink into all ice and snow! 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.470
 O help, I must drown in the deep, deep sea! " 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.209
 Would not a man have come - taken a heart, 

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:30.520
 Oh dear! 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.520
 The grabs it at the Schopfe and then pulls out, 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.390
 from the foot to the head like a water mouse. 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.270
 The little boy has dripped, the father has knocked it 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.270
 it out at home.
