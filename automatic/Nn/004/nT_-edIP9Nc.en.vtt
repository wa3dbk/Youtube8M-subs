 every contact 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.200
 same drug 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.200
 the negotiator is going on like this 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.420
 with this person 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.660

 that's all the shops where the pills 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.860
 but do not even think what led to this 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.420
 concluding anything but not getting up from the couch 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.280
 provided by an organization that 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.000

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.700
 enterprise director 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.950
 but the sentence can 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.110
 so if I really want to drag and when 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.510
 do not let go clear nemiroff lex 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.830
 but it may happen that 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.530
 man still made a decision 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.170
 join 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.830
 but it is clear that it is beautiful by request 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.890
 sorry for which they lose and 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.570
 President Salekh Galina Soldatov 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.910
 Most likely no 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.910
 if the situation is not so categorical 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.530
 the secretary if such an amendment 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.040
 allowing calls will still decide what 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.040
 131 masked men 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.939

 for the development of the game Spartak 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:10.809
 asking for the situation and even Sergey Katorgina 

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:13.519
 not as they were 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.309
 the film is why 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:17.579
 conflict column around the telephone 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.619

 negotiations and istanbul 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:27.779
 so here is a mere 93 percent 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:29.859
 it turns out that 55 percent 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.389
 communications are advised 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:34.389

 rather, the level of general culture is very much 

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:46.239
 attention 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.120
 you can use something new 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.269
 musicians so 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.389
 the question is how does he evaluate the work 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.389
 55 percent determine gb 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.639
 and 38 percent 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.629

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.609
 one region 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.719
 by 14 3 percent than then 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:11.609
 your speaking style 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.969
 and but not in words but the only talk 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:15.989
 split second value 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.989
 clearly defines send if and 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.909
