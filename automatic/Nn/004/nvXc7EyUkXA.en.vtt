00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.880
 here I come with a new video tutorial 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:20.539
 new is a way of if you are a do 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.710
 a new version let's say 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.340
 since it was the first tutorial I did and 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.010
 I did it like this very very from home 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.080
 and it was more or less like that despite that 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.570
 it was the most watched and good tutorial like 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.190
 you have many reproductions there is a lot 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.160
 people who have made me the claim that 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.710
 I do it very fast and good first thing 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.400
 what I did, I did it just like I'm going to 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:48.940
 do better or so I hope slower well 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.489
 explained if it's a good easy topic 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.900
 many are complicated to touch it 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.240
 but good 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.230
 do not worry it's easy I'm going to 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.850
 start the chords and 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.520
 and then each one you give a touch 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.480
 personal 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:10.260
 let's start with the intro 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.260
 never about over the has sustained greater 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.230
 ah 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.230
 and it's like that 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.359
 i 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.890
 i 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.890
 Y 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.290
 let's go with the right hand first 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.290
 it's like that 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.890
 Y 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.240
 i 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.970
 all together 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.439
 Y 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.760
 we have alpha 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.100
 well that is the intro very easy and good 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.990
 the sung part also starts from the 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.650
 first stanzas always on the 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.650
 sharp and fa 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.380
 all right 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.540
 i 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.680
 well that after the sustained does 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.680
 so so 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.270
 to sunbathe low in my network 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.739
 what does he do tomorrow 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.519
 this is rule 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.239
 are 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.209
 the sharp 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.990
 and so 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.870
 what we did today 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.370
 and that rock is the refrain 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.380
 Oh 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.060
 once 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.560
 good 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.070
 plus 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.070
 city 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.770
 one 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.800
 Y 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.390
 Y 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.780
 no longer has the subject of this excess in 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.490
 the second round repeats itself what 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.560
 same 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.080
 and good always on those chords like that 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.600
 that did not complicate more Christmas that 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.400
 only 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.400
 the end that does well 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.870
 same as the first 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.470
 two 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:19.400
 and that's it 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:22.699
 it's very easy they do not have like 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.930
 how not to understand it so good as 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:25.850
 I always tell them that they are very 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.880
 beginners these are always going to 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:32.030
 complicate not the tutorials I do not do them 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.820
 thinking of very present because the 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.389
 true that this type of songs no no 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.389
 they can touch them 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.960
 and well that's all friends I hope you 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.460
