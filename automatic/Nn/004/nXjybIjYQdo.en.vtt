this week I'm going to demonstrate how

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.430 
this week I'm going to demonstrate how
to<00:00:06.960> make<00:00:07.200> side<00:00:07.590> welt<00:00:08.389> sidewall<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.629> the<00:00:10.049> strip

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
to make side welt sidewall is the strip

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.410 
to make side welt sidewall is the strip
of<00:00:10.559> leather<00:00:10.770> that<00:00:11.040> runs<00:00:11.309> down<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.670> side<00:00:12.090> seam

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
of leather that runs down the side seam

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.900 
of leather that runs down the side seam
of<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.780> cowboy<00:00:12.990> boot<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.619> this<00:00:14.309> helps<00:00:14.670> protect

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
of a cowboy boot and this helps protect

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.380 
of a cowboy boot and this helps protect
and<00:00:15.420> hide<00:00:15.629> the<00:00:15.840> stitches<00:00:16.430> to<00:00:17.430> mix<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.940> will<00:00:18.000> you

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
and hide the stitches to mix I will you

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.120 
and hide the stitches to mix I will you
need<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.930> strip<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.800> leather<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.370> is<00:00:20.600> exactly

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
need a strip of leather that is exactly

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:31.470 
need a strip of leather that is exactly
precisely<00:00:24.470> 5/8<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.590> an<00:00:25.740> inch<00:00:25.770> wide

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.300 

or<00:00:32.080> at<00:00:32.170> least<00:00:32.320> that's<00:00:32.440> what<00:00:32.710> it<00:00:32.740> needs<00:00:33.070> to<00:00:33.190> be

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.310 
or at least that's what it needs to be

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.970 
or at least that's what it needs to be
if<00:00:33.790> your<00:00:34.180> seam<00:00:34.390> allowance<00:00:34.750> is<00:00:34.900> 1/8<00:00:35.260> like<00:00:35.560> mine

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
if your seam allowance is 1/8 like mine

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.680 
if your seam allowance is 1/8 like mine
is<00:00:36.220> for<00:00:36.880> side<00:00:37.060> seams<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:40.090> I<00:00:40.120> make<00:00:40.330> a<00:00:40.360> mark

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
is for side seams so I make a mark

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.480 
is for side seams so I make a mark
that's<00:00:40.870> 5/8<00:00:41.440> of<00:00:41.530> an<00:00:41.680> inch<00:00:41.770> from<00:00:42.010> this<00:00:42.190> straight

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:42.490 
that's 5/8 of an inch from this straight

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.130 
that's 5/8 of an inch from this straight
edge<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:44.530> then<00:00:44.770> I<00:00:44.920> try<00:00:45.190> to<00:00:45.250> cut<00:00:45.580> right<00:00:46.090> in<00:00:46.600> the

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
edge and then I try to cut right in the

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.549 
edge and then I try to cut right in the
center<00:00:47.680> of<00:00:49.920> my<00:00:50.920> silver<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.840> is<00:00:52.900> my<00:00:53.170> student

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
center of my silver this is my student

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.549 
center of my silver this is my student
Teresa<00:00:54.330> and<00:00:55.330> she's<00:00:55.600> volunteered<00:00:56.170> to<00:00:56.380> help

little bit at a time now aside well you
have<00:01:22.780> to<00:01:23.020> match<00:01:23.440> the<00:01:23.800> edges<00:01:24.190> exactly<00:01:25.080> when

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
have to match the edges exactly when

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.690 
have to match the edges exactly when
you're<00:01:26.229> making<00:01:26.410> skyped<00:01:26.890> beating<00:01:27.310> you<00:01:27.430> don't

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
you're making skyped beating you don't

you're making skyped beating you don't
line<00:01:27.880> up<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.180> edges<00:01:29.160> but<00:01:30.160> with<00:01:30.340> side<00:01:30.580> while

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
line up the edges but with side while

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.240 
line up the edges but with side while
the<00:01:30.970> edges<00:01:31.300> are<00:01:31.450> put<00:01:31.630> together<00:01:32.040> which<00:01:33.040> where

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
the edges are put together which where

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.140 
the edges are put together which where
they<00:01:33.369> match<00:01:33.640> exactly

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.630

and read it right alongside the court to
work<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.100> cord<00:01:44.990> back<00:01:45.990> into<00:01:46.050> the<00:01:46.410> fold<00:01:46.770> if<00:01:47.010> it

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
work that cord back into the fold if it

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:56.630 
work that cord back into the fold if it
wasn't<00:01:47.460> there<00:01:47.610> already<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:55.890> cord<00:01:56.190> I<00:01:56.250> use<00:01:56.460> this

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
wasn't there already the cord I use this

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.640 
wasn't there already the cord I use this
number<00:01:56.930> 346<00:01:57.930> nylon<00:01:58.770> bonded<00:01:59.580> thread<00:02:00.530> so<00:02:01.530> we

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
number 346 nylon bonded thread so we

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.340 
number 346 nylon bonded thread so we
need<00:02:01.800> so<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.250> side<00:02:03.030> weld<00:02:03.300> on<00:02:03.870> to<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.170> boot

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
need so the side weld on to the boot

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.870 
need so the side weld on to the boot
there's<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.650> really<00:02:04.920> specific<00:02:05.160> way<00:02:05.580> to<00:02:05.610> hold

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
there's a really specific way to hold

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.740 
there's a really specific way to hold
your<00:02:05.970> hands<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.600> like<00:02:07.410> to<00:02:07.530> have<00:02:07.650> my<00:02:07.770> ring<00:02:07.800> finger

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
your hands I like to have my ring finger

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.140 
your hands I like to have my ring finger
right<00:02:09.750> up<00:02:09.899> against<00:02:10.290> the<00:02:10.860> side<00:02:11.490> of<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.700> boot<00:02:11.880> in

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
right up against the side of the boot in

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.960 
right up against the side of the boot in
that<00:02:12.300> way<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.450> can<00:02:12.780> feel<00:02:13.140> if<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.280> side<00:02:14.520> welt<00:02:14.760> is

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
that way I can feel if the side welt is

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.600 
that way I can feel if the side welt is
exactly<00:02:15.720> flush<00:02:16.110> with<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:17.040> side<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.430> boot

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
exactly flush with the side of the boot

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.820 
exactly flush with the side of the boot
which<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:18.030> needs<00:02:18.210> to<00:02:18.420> be<00:02:18.570> so<00:02:19.500> I've<00:02:19.590> got<00:02:19.710> my

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
which it needs to be so I've got my

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.680 
which it needs to be so I've got my
thumb<00:02:20.010> under<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:20.460> these<00:02:20.760> two<00:02:20.940> fingers<00:02:21.270> on<00:02:21.420> top

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
thumb under it these two fingers on top

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.060 
thumb under it these two fingers on top
and<00:02:22.250> then<00:02:23.250> this<00:02:23.430> finger<00:02:23.850> right<00:02:24.530> on<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.710> side

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
and then this finger right on the side

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.650 
and then this finger right on the side
so<00:02:26.370> I<00:02:26.430> can<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:26.760> feel<00:02:28.040> those<00:02:29.040> two<00:02:29.370> edges

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
so I can you feel those two edges

00:02:29.660 --> 00:03:03.960 
so I can you feel those two edges
together

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970
