00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:25.119
 slept who forgot and 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:27.330
 battles or www you wish 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.620
 in a just future 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.840
 has a project that fits in with the 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.730
 secondary schools are directed by the 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.070
 fifth grade up to the 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.380
 upper-level both the general education 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.380
 schools and vocational schools 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.430
 the special thing is that you are at one 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.320
 Event about 200 students 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.140
 That means the students experience it 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.030
 as a small company as one 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.830
 group in which one can look 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.930
 who actually has what opinion like 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.720
 we behave through mood pictures 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.790
 you realize how is our behavior 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.570
 in proportion to what we are 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.570
 actually make 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.220
 we have two different versions 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.320
 of the film the different lengths 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.510
 are and can be different 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.370
 especially in the lifestyle of 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.650
 event to the respective event 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.210
 interests and the knowledge of the 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.210
 go into school 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.710
 so 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.270
 my sister my friends also with 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.329
 for example, to the bicycle 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.329
 drive 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.040
 maybe meet once 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:29.890
 and that's also why I found the 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.159
 Switzerland has the resources with the resources 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.210
 fast you consume yourself 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:37.010
 do not notice it yourself 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.750
 I did not know what I have 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.850
 these movies or this kind of movie 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.430
 already seen a lot and i will 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.570
 Every time so extremely sour but I think 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.320
 it's important and good that this is here 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.720
 place 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.720
 so i can be very informative and after that 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.020
 if you are everything again 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.360
 generally in the film sees what can I do 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.570
 what can i do garbage recycle 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.990
 eat less meat less car 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.940
 drive 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.860
 those little things each of us 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.300
 can do that to the students close to 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.810
 I found this event 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.810
 really good
