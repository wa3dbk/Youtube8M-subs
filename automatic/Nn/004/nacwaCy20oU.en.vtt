00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
after that victory by three goals that

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.449 
after that victory by three goals that
means<00:03:47.169> we<00:03:47.260> can<00:03:47.379> buy<00:03:47.500> a<00:03:47.530> team<00:03:48.010> and<00:03:48.190> season

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
means we can buy a team and season

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.390 
means we can buy a team and season
player<00:03:48.669> up<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.239> a<00:03:49.269> budget<00:03:49.480> of<00:03:49.780> 150<00:03:50.560> K<00:03:50.739> so<00:03:51.190> it<00:03:51.310> was

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
player up to a budget of 150 K so it was

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.069 
player up to a budget of 150 K so it was
kind<00:03:51.549> of<00:03:51.579> a<00:03:51.669> choice<00:03:51.819> between<00:03:52.090> two<00:03:52.359> players<00:03:52.810> and

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
kind of a choice between two players and

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:54.869 
kind of a choice between two players and
because<00:03:53.680> we<00:03:53.859> can<00:03:54.099> get<00:03:54.310> Danny<00:03:54.489> off<00:03:54.609> as<00:03:54.849> a

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
because we can get Danny off as a

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:55.349 
because we can get Danny off as a
right-back

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
right-back

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:57.449 
right-back

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
Filipe luís and go for his team the

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:00.599 
Filipe luís and go for his team the
season<00:03:59.680> version<00:03:59.980> which<00:04:00.069> Ashley<00:04:00.340> has<00:04:00.430> some

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
season version which Ashley has some

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.720 
season version which Ashley has some
really<00:04:01.150> good<00:04:01.359> stats<00:04:01.660> in<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:01.949> 127<00:04:02.949> KO<00:04:03.160> them<00:04:03.519> for

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730

very<00:04:04.060> solid<00:04:04.480> card<00:04:04.720> but<00:04:05.139> hopefully<00:04:05.560> we<00:04:05.680> can<00:04:05.709> we

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
very solid card but hopefully we can we

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.349
