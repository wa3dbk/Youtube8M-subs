see we've got the Atomos ninja top of

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.120 
see we've got the Atomos ninja top of
d800<00:00:39.730> and<00:00:39.940> what<00:00:40.810> this<00:00:40.960> is<00:00:41.080> showing<00:00:41.110> is<00:00:41.590> a<00:00:41.770> clean

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
d800 and what this is showing is a clean

maybe<00:00:42.400> hdmi<00:00:43.090> out<00:00:43.210> from<00:00:43.660> the<00:00:43.780> camera<00:00:44.110> this<00:00:44.350> also

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
maybe hdmi out from the camera this also

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.670 
maybe hdmi out from the camera this also
happens<00:00:45.010> we<00:00:45.160> g600<00:00:45.970> so<00:00:46.060> you<00:00:46.150> get<00:00:46.330> back<00:00:46.480> to<00:00:46.690> the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
happens we g600 so you get back to the

appearing in fields and a 600 2020 so

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.980 
appearing in fields and a 600 2020 so
you<00:00:57.730> can<00:00:57.940> control<00:00:58.180> a<00:00:58.450> purchase<00:00:58.720> separately

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
you can control a purchase separately

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.140 
you can control a purchase separately
