00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.780
 so come on 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.630
 how am I going to use the dark enamel? 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.990
 first I'll pass this protective base 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.810
 it's all nails with a nail polish 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.109
 black I chose from colorama because 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.080
 it looks great with a layer of enamel 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.000
 glitter does not need to be golden 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.710
 we have several options out there that 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.689
 you can find I chose 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.530
 golden because I think it looks beautiful 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.540
 with black enamel and inspiration 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.040
 that used these two colors 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:44.489
 We're going to need tape too. 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.530
 is to help us do the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.450
 drawing on the right nail so let's go 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.030
 The first step is to apply the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.690
 protective base on all nails 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:58.559
 hopes and caoc after I applied in 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.719
 all my nails one layer one 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.680
 normal people that enamel layer 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.149
 color 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.489
 you will see that you still have the 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.790
 borradinhos because I have not cleaned 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.500
 the right ones and now I want one 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.850
 little piece of durex 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.950
 I just do not want him to stay with 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.280
 So much glue so I 'll put it in here. 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.700
 My hand is going to take a little of the glue. 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.170
 right 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.810
 and here I am going to do in that middle line 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.580
 image by scribbling from here to this 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.640
 here 's a scratch 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:34.710
 so the team will then put my 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:38.490
 adhesive tape I 'll try to get to 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.430
 right here because the 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.670
 It will form one O zinho triangle 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.009
 here below with another piece of tape 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.790
 also after removing a little bit from the 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:55.409
 Cola I'll do the same thing I'll put 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:59.930
 You can see here and 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.930
 take to the tip of the nail here 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.780
 sure you can see 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.690
 I think now has to see well right tÃ¡ 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.190
 Seeing with zen triangle here ok because 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.470
 it is important that the base enamel 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.070
 be because if you want to take your clothes off 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:21.780
 To clean the drawing, you will not 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.970
 to damage the nail polish you can 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.210
 do already on all the nails with the tape 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.550
 adhesive or you can make one like me 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.100
 nail one at a time is now I'm going to get 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.090
 the golden glaze with glitter and I go 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.090
 put here 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.200
 the club cover well this is going to wait here 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.069
 a little bit just to remove the 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:57.019
 durex 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:03:00.349
 so now picchu and hockey stayed and 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.510
 So I'm going to enjoy that 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:06.130
 I'm still going 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.130
 give a little tooth to take the excess 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.670
 and then just do that step by step 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.319
 on all the nails does not give much work 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.319
 Did not you see people live there then? 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.940
 ready 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.160
 I'm going to do all my nails and I'll be right back. 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.650
 to take the next step with you 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.550
 sure people had not done it at all 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.920
 nails the ac and to leave the shine more 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.720
 nice to take away any blemishes I 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.090
 I will pass an extra brightness over 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.350
 all nails start with these here 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.330
 that I did first 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.950
 It looks like already gives one had the most is 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.180
 much more beautiful is everything 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.140
 uniform then it makes a lot of difference 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.030
 extra brightness 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.950
 now yes i will clean the smudges and 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.380
 I'm going to show you around and I'll be back to show you. 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.750
 for you the final result is ready 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.730
 No one, no one, still has one. 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.549
 bit of glitter around because it's only 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.770
 I'm going to leave, I think I'm in the shower, but I 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.110
 I think it was a very special detail 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.050
 I recommend that you put enough 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.060
 glitter like I did on this line that 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.850
 because then the brightness stands out more 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.830
 drawing appears more on this line than the 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.530
 glitter is fainter but even 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.130
 so you can see that it gives a good touch 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.700
 Special 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:45.210
 then a very special touch and let 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.860
 A very different nail is how I was not 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.270
 In the manicure this week I 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.130

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.900

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.710
