00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
very very quickly and I also love the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.690 
very very quickly and I also love the
packaging<00:01:37.890> because<00:01:38.310> they're<00:01:38.490> really

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
packaging because they're really

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.270 
packaging because they're really
satisfying<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.659> clicky<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.079> magnetic<00:01:41.040> and

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
satisfying and clicky and magnetic and

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.670 
satisfying and clicky and magnetic and
they<00:01:41.939> stay<00:01:42.240> put<00:01:42.450> for<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.689> really<00:01:42.899> long<00:01:43.079> time<00:01:43.140> but

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
they stay put for a really long time but

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.350 
they stay put for a really long time but
also<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.579> think<00:01:44.610> what's<00:01:44.939> really<00:01:45.210> impressive

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
also I think what's really impressive

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.600 
also I think what's really impressive
about<00:01:45.600> them<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.229> color<00:01:46.439> range<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.280> cool

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
about them is the color range is so cool

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.990 
about them is the color range is so cool
they're<00:01:48.210> really<00:01:48.600> really<00:01:48.780> bold<00:01:49.729> but<00:01:50.729> still

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
they're really really bold but still

naturally be drawn to without my

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.840

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.850 
and think well actually if they like a
nude<00:03:02.790> maybe<00:03:03.150> they<00:03:03.390> like<00:03:03.630> a<00:03:03.840> nude<00:03:04.140> base<00:03:04.470> but

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
nude maybe they like a nude base but

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.440 
nude maybe they like a nude base but
could<00:03:05.010> maybe<00:03:05.220> push<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.730> color<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:06.000> little<00:03:06.150> bit

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
could maybe push the color a little bit

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.690 
could maybe push the color a little bit
more<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:06.870> go<00:03:07.019> for<00:03:07.230> this<00:03:07.319> red<00:03:07.620> because<00:03:08.459> even

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
more and go for this red because even

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.160 
more and go for this red because even
though<00:03:08.819> it's<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.060> true<00:03:09.299> red<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:09.720> still<00:03:09.959> has<00:03:10.140> a

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
though it's a true red it still has a

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.690 
though it's a true red it still has a
nice<00:03:10.349> earthy<00:03:10.890> base<00:03:11.099> to<00:03:11.370> it

go a little bit Pinker but still have

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.699 
go a little bit Pinker but still have
quite<00:03:20.640> a<00:03:20.670> pretty<00:03:21.000> wearable<00:03:21.570> base<00:03:21.750> so<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.470> would
