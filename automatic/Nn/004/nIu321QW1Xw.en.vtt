because he was gonna switch out I mean
you<00:01:46.770> know<00:01:46.860> why<00:01:47.040> wouldn't<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.670> had<00:01:47.790> before

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
you know why wouldn't you you had before

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.420 
you know why wouldn't you you had before
Rhett<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.450> know<00:01:48.570> four<00:01:48.930> times<00:01:49.290> was<00:01:49.530> weakness

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
Rhett you know four times was weakness

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.639 
Rhett you know four times was weakness
to<00:01:50.790> rock<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.390> know<00:01:51.509> anyway<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.500> know<00:01:52.619> I

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
to rock so you know anyway you know I

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.530 
to rock so you know anyway you know I
did<00:01:53.040> predict<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.490> awesomely<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.210> then<00:01:54.450> I

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
did predict that awesomely and then I

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.209 
did predict that awesomely and then I
switched<00:01:54.840> out<00:01:55.020> into<00:01:55.259> gyarados<00:01:55.619> not<00:01:55.829> because<00:01:56.130> I

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
switched out into gyarados not because I

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.560 
switched out into gyarados not because I
was<00:01:56.340> fearing<00:01:56.579> meteor<00:01:56.880> match<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:57.240> because<00:01:57.479> I

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
was fearing meteor match but because I

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.850 
was fearing meteor match but because I
knew<00:01:57.659> he<00:01:57.810> was<00:01:57.869> gonna<00:01:57.990> switch<00:01:58.290> out<00:01:58.439> fearing

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
knew he was gonna switch out fearing

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.139 
knew he was gonna switch out fearing
that<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.159> toggle<00:01:59.549> for<00:01:59.700> another<00:01:59.939> earthquake

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
that you toggle for another earthquake

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.300 
that you toggle for another earthquake
so<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.570> go<00:02:00.780> into<00:02:01.020> gyarados<00:02:01.469> unfortunately<00:02:02.189> he's

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
so I go into gyarados unfortunately he's

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.090 
so I go into gyarados unfortunately he's
which<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.579> out<00:02:02.700> into<00:02:02.969> his<00:02:03.380> charizard<00:02:04.380> x<00:02:04.799> karam

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
which is out into his charizard x karam

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.069 
which is out into his charizard x karam
out<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.759> i<00:02:05.820> go<00:02:05.939> for<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.149> double<00:02:06.390> edge<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.810> double

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
out so i go for a double edge and double

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.809 
out so i go for a double edge and double
edge<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.350> choice<00:02:07.560> betted<00:02:07.979> everything<00:02:08.399> Adam<00:02:08.729> is

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
edge of choice betted everything Adam is

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.790 
edge of choice betted everything Adam is
maxed<00:02:09.270> attack<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.899> it's<00:02:10.020> like<00:02:10.140> wow<00:02:10.379> it's<00:02:10.649> not

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
maxed attack and it's like wow it's not

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.840 
maxed attack and it's like wow it's not
believing<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.310> much

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
believing that much

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.370 
believing that much
suicune<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.540> I'm<00:02:12.630> seeing<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.020> he<00:02:13.140> goes<00:02:13.290> from

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
suicune and I'm seeing that he goes from

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.440 
suicune and I'm seeing that he goes from
some<00:02:13.590> hidden<00:02:13.800> power<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.310> I'm<00:02:14.790> thinking<00:02:15.270> about

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
some hidden power and I'm thinking about

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.420 
some hidden power and I'm thinking about
him<00:02:15.720> like<00:02:15.900> okay<00:02:16.020> so<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.860> might<00:02:17.250> have<00:02:17.370> been

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
him like okay so it might have been

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.040 
him like okay so it might have been
hidden<00:02:17.610> power<00:02:17.880> electric<00:02:18.330> but<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.630> didn't<00:02:18.840> kill

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
hidden power electric but it didn't kill

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.020 
hidden power electric but it didn't kill
so<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.410> must<00:02:19.800> admit<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.130> this<00:02:20.460> thing<00:02:20.730> didn't

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
so I must admit that this thing didn't

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.420 
so I must admit that this thing didn't
have<00:02:21.120> really<00:02:21.300> any<00:02:21.420> investment<00:02:22.200> into<00:02:22.560> was<00:02:23.250> the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
have really any investment into was the

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.890 
have really any investment into was the
personal<00:02:24.120> attack<00:02:24.360> at<00:02:24.480> all<00:02:24.570> because<00:02:24.720> I

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
personal attack at all because I

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.880 
personal attack at all because I
certainly<00:02:25.230> should<00:02:25.350> have<00:02:25.530> killed<00:02:25.680> but

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
certainly should have killed but

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.680 
certainly should have killed but
anything<00:02:26.220> so<00:02:26.520> anyway<00:02:26.790> it's<00:02:27.210> like<00:02:27.330> oh<00:02:27.420> my<00:02:27.540> god

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
anything so anyway it's like oh my god

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.300 
anything so anyway it's like oh my god
he<00:02:27.840> goes<00:02:27.990> into<00:02:28.200> Tyrannosaur<00:02:28.770> which<00:02:28.890> pisses<00:02:29.070> me

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
he goes into Tyrannosaur which pisses me

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.190 
he goes into Tyrannosaur which pisses me
off<00:02:29.340> because<00:02:29.640> I<00:02:29.820> absolutely<00:02:30.450> hate<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:30.930> thing

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
off because I absolutely hate this thing

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.890 
off because I absolutely hate this thing
it's<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:31.860> unnecessary<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.970> have<00:02:33.180> unless

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
it's so unnecessary to have unless

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.750 
it's so unnecessary to have unless
you're<00:02:34.080> having<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.380> sandstorm<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.520> I'm<00:02:35.610> not

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
gonna have a sandstorm team then don't

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.240 
gonna have a sandstorm team then don't
bring<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.170> plus<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.590> fastest<00:02:40.950> hamachi

bring it and plus the fastest hamachi
isn't<00:02:42.060> always<00:02:42.330> fast<00:02:42.870> in<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.290> fact<00:02:43.500> that

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
isn't always fast in the fact that

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.080 
isn't always fast in the fact that
people<00:02:43.860> bring<00:02:44.010> this<00:02:44.160> thing<00:02:44.220> mixers<00:02:44.700> all<00:02:44.880> like

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
people bring this thing mixers all like

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.060 
people bring this thing mixers all like
take<00:02:45.330> an<00:02:45.480> hour<00:02:45.630> more<00:02:46.410> than<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.710> should<00:02:46.740> be<00:02:47.040> and

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
take an hour more than it should be and

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.860 
take an hour more than it should be and
it's<00:02:47.310> like<00:02:47.400> okay<00:02:47.670> you're<00:02:47.850> cool<00:02:47.970> anyway<00:02:48.420> so<00:02:48.480> I

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
it's like okay you're cool anyway so I

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.990 
it's like okay you're cool anyway so I
fought<00:02:49.380> her<00:02:49.470> out<00:02:49.620> my<00:02:49.830> gyarados<00:02:50.550> because<00:02:50.790> I

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
fought her out my gyarados because I

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.790 
fought her out my gyarados because I
gyarados<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.650> being<00:02:53.060> your<00:02:54.060> your<00:02:54.840> your

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
gyarados you you being your your your

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.670 
gyarados you you being your your your
anyway<00:02:56.760> so<00:02:56.820> you<00:02:57.060> know<00:02:57.150> he<00:02:57.330> died<00:02:57.900> because<00:02:58.320> of<00:02:58.500> an

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
anyway so you know he died because of an

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.350 
anyway so you know he died because of an
earthquake<00:02:59.010> he<00:02:59.520> didn't<00:02:59.730> switch<00:02:59.910> out<00:03:00.090> because

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
earthquake he didn't switch out because

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.240 
earthquake he didn't switch out because
you<00:03:00.630> know<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.750> figured<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.560> would<00:03:01.680> be<00:03:01.830> faster

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
you know I figured that would be faster

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.070 
you know I figured that would be faster
because<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.670> know<00:03:02.760> gyarados<00:03:03.210> was<00:03:03.510> not<00:03:03.870> that

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
because you know gyarados was not that

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.560 
because you know gyarados was not that
fast<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:04.860> I<00:03:05.340> was<00:03:05.490> still<00:03:05.700> faster<00:03:06.150> than<00:03:06.390> I

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
fast and I was still faster than I

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.060 
fast and I was still faster than I
retina<00:03:06.840> start<00:03:07.020> after<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:07.560> through<00:03:07.710> dragon

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
retina start after and through dragon

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.950

dance<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:09.060> I'm<00:03:09.150> like<00:03:09.270> okay<00:03:09.420> I<00:03:09.600> don't

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
dance so I'm like okay I don't
