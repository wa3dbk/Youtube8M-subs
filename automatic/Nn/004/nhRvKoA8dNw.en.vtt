00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:08.933
From the golden age of Indian
cinema great actress Begum Para.

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:14.311
She was born in 1926 at Farahak.

00:00:14.391 --> 00:00:18.122
Her family was well
known and was from Aligarh.

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.636
It was the time when
English ruled over India.

00:00:22.716 --> 00:00:25.717
Her father occupied
a high government post.

00:00:25.797 --> 00:00:27.960
And her childhood
was spent in Bikaner.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.771
Later she studied
from Aligarh University.

00:00:32.757 --> 00:00:36.460
Begum Para's family had
made great contributions..

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.824
..to the beginning of Indian cricket.

00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:41.987
So on one hand it was cricket
and on the other it was films.

00:00:42.067 --> 00:00:45.906
Actually Begum Para's brother
married Protima Dasgupta..

00:00:45.986 --> 00:00:48.649
..who was great actress of that time.

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:51.176
Whenever she used to go
to Mumbai to visit her brother..

00:00:51.378 --> 00:00:55.594
..then the glamour and glitter
of film industry would attract her.

00:00:55.674 --> 00:00:57.918
Lata movies.
'Chidi ka Ghulam'. Scene number 21.

00:00:57.998 --> 00:00:59.215
Shot 1. Take 2.

00:00:59.295 --> 00:01:01.945
Because of her nice
attitude and beauty..

00:01:02.025 --> 00:01:04.944
..people often used
to offer her films.

00:01:05.377 --> 00:01:07.188
Shashidhar Mukherjee and Devika Rani..

00:01:07.268 --> 00:01:10.418
..were the ones who gave
Begum Para her first break.

00:01:10.498 --> 00:01:12.608
Though her father
was not at all ready..

00:01:12.688 --> 00:01:15.391
..but he surrendered in front
of his daughter's stubbornness.

00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:16.703
He just kept one condition.

00:01:16.783 --> 00:01:20.379
That she will never work
in any movies in Lahore.

00:01:20.608 --> 00:01:24.013
Her first film was Pune's
Prabhat Studio's 'Chand'.

00:01:24.202 --> 00:01:27.405
It was the year 1944.
Prem Adib was her hero.

00:01:27.485 --> 00:01:30.648
And Sitara Devi was
playing the role of a vamp.

00:01:30.864 --> 00:01:31.797
The film was well received and..

00:01:31.877 --> 00:01:34.324
..she started earning
1500 rupees a month.

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:37.850
At that time 1500 rupees
used to be a huge amount.

00:01:39.444 --> 00:01:41.890
And after that she
made film 'Chamiya'..

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.661
..along with her
sister-in-law Protima.

00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:46.363
It was based on the novel 'Pygmalion'.

00:01:46.443 --> 00:01:47.647
Even this was successful.

00:01:47.727 --> 00:01:52.674
Though she had opportunities
she was not working a lot.

00:01:52.754 --> 00:01:56.580
That was because she had
the image of a modern girl.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.850
She wanted to steer
away from any conservative..

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.323
..or crying and weeping
character portrayals.

00:02:03.647 --> 00:02:06.728
Begum Para befriended
other actress of that time.

00:02:06.917 --> 00:02:08.296
She was carefree heroine.

00:02:08.376 --> 00:02:10.836
She used to do everything in public.

00:02:10.916 --> 00:02:13.985
She never concealed her carefreeness.

00:02:14.647 --> 00:02:17.404
She worked with many
actresses of that era.

00:02:17.674 --> 00:02:20.202
Like in film 'Mehndi' with Nargis.

00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:23.810
She did 'Zanjeer' and 'Soni
Mahiwal' with Ishwarlal and Dixit.

00:02:24.094 --> 00:02:25.864
'Meherbani' with Ajit.

00:02:25.944 --> 00:02:29.162
And 'Suhaag Raat' with
Bharat Bhushan and Geeta Bali.

00:02:29.242 --> 00:02:31.851
Raj Kapoor was with
her in 'Neelkamal'.

00:02:33.405 --> 00:02:35.054
This is also famous that Begum Para..

00:02:35.134 --> 00:02:38.014
..left that role in 'Mughal-e-Azam'..

00:02:38.094 --> 00:02:40.446
..which was later
played by Nigar Sultana.

00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:42.392
The reason was that she wanted..

00:02:42.472 --> 00:02:44.473
..to stay away from weepy characters.

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:47.999
And that's why she even
left a film like 'Mughal-E-Azam'.

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:51.012
She was the first Indian
actress to be selected..

00:02:51.092 --> 00:02:54.743
..by 'Life' magazine as pin up girl.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.323
And then at one point off
her life she met her life partner.

00:03:00.403 --> 00:03:03.459
Dilip Kumar's younger
brother Naseer Khan.

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:05.648
Famous actress Shammi helped a lot..

00:03:05.728 --> 00:03:10.540
..in the success of Begum
Para and Naseer Khan's love story.

00:03:11.581 --> 00:03:14.108
Though Naseer was already
married at that time..

00:03:14.188 --> 00:03:17.041
..and Begum Para tried
a lot to stay away from him.

00:03:17.244 --> 00:03:20.338
But since Naseer's marriage
was already breaking up..

00:03:20.418 --> 00:03:22.568
..so these two allowed
this relation to go further.

00:03:22.648 --> 00:03:26.230
Thought both are Muslims,
Begum para clarified that..

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.743
..she won't stay with
him as his second wife.

00:03:28.823 --> 00:03:32.959
So Naseer should first
divorce her and then marry her.

00:03:33.162 --> 00:03:34.351
And that is what happened.

00:03:34.431 --> 00:03:36.770
Naseer had a daughter
from his first marriage.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.338
And begum Para had clarified
that as soon as you marry me..

00:03:40.418 --> 00:03:42.203
..I will take your
daughter's responsibility.

00:03:42.283 --> 00:03:45.095
And she fulfilled her
responsibility her entire life.

00:03:46.135 --> 00:03:49.716
Though her famous
brother-in-law Dilip Kumar..

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:51.459
..didn't attend the wedding.

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:53.689
But after that circumstances changed..

00:03:53.918 --> 00:03:57.377
..and Dilip Kumar and Begum
Para wouldn't even face each other.

00:03:57.457 --> 00:04:00.431
Saira Banu was held responsible
for this to some extent.

00:04:02.093 --> 00:04:04.376
Dilip's family felt
that since Saira Banu..

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:09.714
..has come into his life he
has become estranged from his family.

00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:15.714
Begum Para's husband
Naseer Khan was also an actor.

00:04:15.794 --> 00:04:18.431
He had acted wonderfully
in film 'Ganga Jumna'.

00:04:18.647 --> 00:04:20.512
But since his hair was
falling off prematurely..

00:04:20.592 --> 00:04:22.998
..and he had to work wearing a wig..

00:04:23.078 --> 00:04:26.593
..he thought of
focusing on film making.

00:04:27.727 --> 00:04:31.119
In the year 1974 Begum
Para and Naseer Khan..

00:04:31.322 --> 00:04:34.470
..invested all their life
earning in the film 'Zid'.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.051
The lead characters of
this film were played by..

00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:37.605
..Sanjay Khan and Saira Banu.

00:04:37.685 --> 00:04:39.389
The film was almost over.

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:40.970
Just a little work
was left to be done.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.091
And Naseer left for outdoor shooting.

00:04:43.308 --> 00:04:46.794
And the next day Nargis
called Begum Para and said that..

00:04:46.874 --> 00:04:51.930
..due to a heart attack her
husband Naseer has passed away.

00:04:55.497 --> 00:04:57.214
This was a huge shock for her.

00:04:57.294 --> 00:04:59.835
She was completely
dependent on her husband.

00:05:00.079 --> 00:05:03.160
And they had already invested
all their money in film 'Zid'.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.998
She had three children
from this marriage.

00:05:05.078 --> 00:05:07.998
And it was very hard for
her to look after her entire family.

00:05:08.078 --> 00:05:09.674
She started to drink.

00:05:09.754 --> 00:05:13.337
And before she would
drown herself in alcohol..

00:05:13.566 --> 00:05:18.066
..her sister took her to
Pakistan where her father lived.

00:05:19.566 --> 00:05:20.917
She stayed there for nearly 2 years.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.755
She gained a little courage.
Decided to return.

00:05:23.835 --> 00:05:26.066
And she rented out part of her house..

00:05:26.146 --> 00:05:28.241
..which covered her family expenses.

00:05:28.321 --> 00:05:31.566
Her son Ayub Khan
is a well-known actor.

00:05:31.646 --> 00:05:34.931
Ayub Khan has earned a good
name in films and television.

00:05:36.026 --> 00:05:39.634
But Begum Para returned
to films again after leaving it.

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:42.824
And this time she
returned in the year 2007.

00:05:43.148 --> 00:05:47.459
She played the role of Sonam
Kapoor's elder in film 'Saawariya'.

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:51.621
Begum Para was seen again in
Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Saawariya'.

00:05:51.811 --> 00:05:55.635
Sanjay Leela Bhansali wanted
to sign her up for another film.

00:05:55.892 --> 00:05:58.635
But before that begum
Para breathed her last.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.771
On 9th December, 2008 at the
age of 81 begum Para passed away.
