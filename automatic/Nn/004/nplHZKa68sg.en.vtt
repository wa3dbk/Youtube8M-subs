because<00:02:19.820> then<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.150> moss<00:02:20.300> is<00:02:20.450> going<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.690> move

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
because then the moss is going to move

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.440 
because then the moss is going to move
you<00:02:21.380> point<00:02:21.680> out<00:02:21.830> this<00:02:22.220> if<00:02:22.820> your<00:02:22.970> pointer<00:02:23.330> from

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
you point out this if your pointer from

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.420 
you point out this if your pointer from
straightaway<00:02:23.590> your<00:02:24.590> hand<00:02:24.800> is<00:02:24.950> going<00:02:25.100> to<00:02:25.160> block

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
straightaway your hand is going to block

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.430 
straightaway your hand is going to block
the<00:02:25.790> infrared<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:26.690> it's<00:02:26.990> not<00:02:27.140> going<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:27.320> work

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
the infrared and it's not going to work

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.900 
the infrared and it's not going to work
so<00:02:27.470> you<00:02:27.650> always<00:02:27.800> have<00:02:28.100> to<00:02:28.220> point<00:02:28.370> it<00:02:28.550> out<00:02:28.640> and

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
so you always have to point it out and

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.820 
so you always have to point it out and
then<00:02:29.330> for<00:02:29.660> example<00:02:29.720> it's<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.200> 45<00:02:30.590> degrees

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
then for example it's a 45 degrees

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.980 
then for example it's a 45 degrees
because<00:02:31.370> away<00:02:31.580> remote<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:32.120> says<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.570> infrared

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
because away remote it says the infrared

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.460 
because away remote it says the infrared
a<00:02:33.170> 45<00:02:33.950> degree<00:02:34.100> angle<00:02:34.360> up<00:02:35.360> down<00:02:35.900> from<00:02:36.350> from

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
a 45 degree angle up down from from

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.150 
a 45 degree angle up down from from
sideways

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
sideways

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.200 
sideways
so<00:02:38.030> now<00:02:38.240> just<00:02:38.870> cancel<00:02:39.020> all<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.500> stuff<00:02:39.740> and

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
so now just cancel all the stuff and

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.990 
so now just cancel all the stuff and
click<00:02:41.590> calibrate<00:02:42.590> as<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.520> also<00:02:43.760> click<00:02:43.970> on
