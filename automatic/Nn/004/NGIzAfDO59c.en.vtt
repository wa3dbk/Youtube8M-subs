hi<00:00:00.359> I'm<00:00:00.510> Chris<00:00:00.780> Palmer<00:00:01.050> today<00:00:01.709> we're<00:00:01.860> gonna

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
hi I'm Chris Palmer today we're gonna

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.249 
hi I'm Chris Palmer today we're gonna
talk<00:00:02.190> about<00:00:02.250> pre<00:00:02.820> drilling<00:00:03.179> wood<00:00:03.480> so<00:00:04.080> your

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
talk about pre drilling wood so your

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.890 
talk about pre drilling wood so your
fasteners<00:00:04.830> don't<00:00:05.100> crack<00:00:05.370> it<00:00:08.360> more<00:00:09.360> often<00:00:09.570> than

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
fasteners don't crack it more often than

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.680 
fasteners don't crack it more often than
not<00:00:09.929> it's<00:00:10.469> better<00:00:10.860> if<00:00:11.160> you<00:00:11.340> pre-drill<00:00:12.090> when

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
not it's better if you pre-drill when

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.230 
not it's better if you pre-drill when
you're<00:00:12.840> driving<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.679> screw<00:00:14.250> or<00:00:14.549> even<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.000> nail

without<00:00:48.780> pre-drilling<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:50.070> crack<00:00:50.460> went

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
without pre-drilling this crack went

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.639 
without pre-drilling this crack went
half<00:00:51.420> way<00:00:51.449> down<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:51.989> board

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
half way down the board

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.510 
half way down the board
the<00:00:53.610> proper<00:00:54.000> way<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.149> do<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.980> would<00:00:55.980> be<00:00:56.010> to

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
the proper way to do that would be to

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.990 
the proper way to do that would be to
make<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.300> nice<00:00:58.260> hole<00:00:58.649> first<00:01:01.250> here's<00:01:02.250> here's<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
make a nice hole first here's here's the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.679 
make a nice hole first here's here's the
fastener<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.719> want<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.110> use<00:01:05.360> and<00:01:06.360> here's<00:01:06.540> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
fastener I want to use and here's the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.800 
fastener I want to use and here's the
appropriate<00:01:07.260> bit<00:01:07.670> now<00:01:08.670> if<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.450> look<00:01:09.600> at<00:01:09.689> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
appropriate bit now if you look at the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.800 
appropriate bit now if you look at the
screw<00:01:10.110> not<00:01:10.380> counting<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.890> thread<00:01:11.810> that

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
screw not counting the thread that

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.410 
screw not counting the thread that
should<00:01:13.170> be<00:01:13.290> about<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.710> diameter<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:15.030> your

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
should be about the diameter of your

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.330 
should be about the diameter of your
drill<00:01:16.140> bit<00:01:16.170> or<00:01:16.530> even<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.799> little<00:01:16.950> bit<00:01:17.189> smaller

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
drill bit or even a little bit smaller

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.179 
drill bit or even a little bit smaller
that<00:01:18.030> way<00:01:18.150> there's<00:01:18.360> plenty<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.810> thread

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
that way there's plenty of thread

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.560 
that way there's plenty of thread
cutting<00:01:20.189> into<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> wood<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.119> keep<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.420> nice

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
cutting into the wood to keep a nice

cutting into the wood to keep a nice
strong<00:01:22.250> connection<00:01:28.549> go<00:01:29.549> ahead<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:34.220> drill

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
strong connection go ahead and drill

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.760 
strong connection go ahead and drill
your<00:01:35.250> hole

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.730 

pull<00:01:39.770> out<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:39.950> drill<00:01:40.370> bit<00:01:40.580> you<00:01:41.409> drive<00:01:42.409> in<00:01:42.620> your

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
pull out the drill bit you drive in your

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.880 
pull out the drill bit you drive in your
fastener<00:01:43.340> and<00:01:43.780> sink<00:01:44.780> it<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:44.960> it<00:01:45.290> should<00:01:45.500> be<00:01:45.680> a

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
fastener and sink it and it should be a

00:01:45.890 --> 00:02:00.609 
fastener and sink it and it should be a
