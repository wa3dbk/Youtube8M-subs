00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.870
 with no foo 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.570
 the fictional house stands for the fake 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:23.010
 house where we want a response 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.010
 on the current mode system 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.500
 we really feel that there is 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.150
 there is no more room for development 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.940
 from young talent so it 's time for that 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.770
 we are going to create space ourselves 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.100
 the i just said so we do it now and it 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.420
 happens in fifteen minutes 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.879
 Joost Schrickx then put things down 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.410
 as we stand and then it is ready 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.500
 here they are literally from this morning 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.210
 9 hours is starting to build up 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.900
 soon be altruistic with the models 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.760
 and you get it then you tell them something 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.729
 they are going to do how to do that 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.800
 and they also have some sort of acting 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:01:00.479
 lens because there is a very bad one 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.479
 interaction with the models themselves 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.360
 Hi Tim I are in from those bouquets 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.360
 this package is made for us 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.900
 it is going according to plan 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.310
 I believe to walk slightly behind the whole 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.540
 decor 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.670
 it just takes a little more time 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.220
 because we secretly confuse all 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.260
 In the meantime I am just doping 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.840
 adrenaline is going smoothly now through my 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:34.119
 veins so we just go and 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.799
 and yes where we are working towards now is the 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.170
 launch of my without woman top 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.969
 fashion week then came up immediately 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.929
 that we could participate in vodafone 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:43.000
 fashional app 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:44.409
 his think selects because my whole 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.630
 have a different approach 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.670
 approach with this collection 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.289
 very much at the contrast that 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.560
 is actually central to everything we do 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.500
 to do 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.840
 that woman who is in the chanel couture dress 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.060
 to the all who are going to buy the beer 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.649
 for example we don't want any 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.270
 make a distinction between young and younger 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.350
 old man and woman 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.219
 we actually see everything as 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.219
 equivalent 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.160
 but this is not going well at all with the 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.830
 gotta get started 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.440
 and to pass on 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:29.650
 are you 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.520
 it was n't what we had with me 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.450
 agreed 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.280
 it is dark videos go to so 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.700
 start playing flush with it 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.700
 collapse 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.310
 with our presentation during the 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.960
 Amsterdam fashion week will be our first 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.850
 own empty 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.070
 what we are going to do would be a distortion 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.930
 it would not literally run the modern 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.900
 ready from front to back when 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.830
 looks ice cold and the work light goes on 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.510
 to 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.650
 you get out of your role so kind of 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.570
 of logical yes yes of yourself it is the 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.030
 launch of our house and it becomes one 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.620
 explosion of neighbor aesthetics and and 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.390
 bad taste in one 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.630
 we are looking for that again very much 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.540
 contrasts on the black lines and 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.330
 to the whole of Amsterdam 18 years 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.069
 to ted some space in between 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.800
 now the series is coming to use 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.180
 tomorrow as it turned out 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.500
 So 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.840
 there are still many people that we 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.090
 had expected that with it 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.040
 now very tense I would almost 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.040
 can puke but that's good I think 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.470
 Oh 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.940
 Oh 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.490
 Oh no 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.540
 I make sense in the sphere us first 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.160
 they have to show up, we have to go 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.410
 two we already made is not possible 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.260
 So pay that be true 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.110
 I really liked this show 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:17.350
 it's different this kind of thing is true 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.920
 you need it at hamster that is unfortunately 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.720
 I really like skilled people 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.970
 if you have drawn I want whole 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.640
 like to look at the clothes separately and again 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.130
 then actually get stuck when you get 11 on it 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.680
 t great and that is exactly what we wanted 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.560
 do that they should talk about it 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.050
 think about what I exactly afterwards 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.950
 I think it's good that we have dust on people 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.950
 gripped load
