00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.690
 welcome to neighborhood magic 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.500
 welcome to a new video and today we are going 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.789
 to do a trick 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.380
 with kings and queens 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:25.400
 that according to those who know 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.810
 they have so much power that they always try to 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.519
 join 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.920
 although the months that they put us 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:36.810
 separated they always look for the way 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.800
 magically of course 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.800
 to join 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.540
 four kings and four queens 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.329
 there are not few 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:56.329
 to see if what they say is true 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:01:01.390
 and we are going to separate four from each side 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:04.470
 so if we take this side 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.380
 the clover queen 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.880
 I imagine that on this side we will have to 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.880
 turn the king of 3 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:19.159
 good apparently 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.159
 they do not have as much power as he says 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.660
 or maybe 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.510
 let's try again 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.649
 Queen of Hearts 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.619
 this side we turn 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.460
 I could almost have been the king of 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:51.360
 hearts but still is not 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:55.340
 bad is a king and a queen the reds 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.340
 but it is not of hearts 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.080
 or perhaps yes 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.390
 this is left by four letters 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.720
 the queen of diamonds 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.120
 turn the king diamonds 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.740
 we did not have luck until now 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.810
 we go back the queen of spades 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.080
 so it's true that they have so much 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.080
 power 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.860
 maybe not 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.909
 or maybe yes 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.780
 let's go to the revelation 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.840
 well the revelation first thing what 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.120
 what to do 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.160
 is to accommodate the letters of the next 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.830
 shape 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.250
 king of spades with diamond queen 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.150
 Queen of Hearts 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.760
 king of the clover 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.980
 on the other hand we go back queen of spades 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:17.730
 diamond king 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:21.379
 king of hearts and queen of clover 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.379
 they have to have this order 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.780
 we take this 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.990
 and together 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:33.580
 What I did was distribute the 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.580
 in different places in the deck 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.760
 for that way 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.300
 when the ones that were accommodated in 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.550
 that order 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.600
 well once we take it out of the deck 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.600
 this is going to be 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.390
 that you see in the order this is the order 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.490
 that they have to have 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:00.370
 and we're going to mix how we're going to create 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:04.830
 one in one one two three 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:12.240
 4 and we throw the rest of the letters over 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:14.880
 again 1 2 3 4 and we throw the cards 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.600
 that we have left that would be the other 4 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.600
 above 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.799
 we distribute the four cards 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.230
 four on each side 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.960
 let's take the first side 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.139
 right that is going to be the queen 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.389
 of clover 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.939
 and with this part what we are going to do is 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.390
 a tripe lift have to close three 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:40.880
 letters 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.780
 to show the diamond queen here 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.780
 you will have only one 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.910
 what they are going to show is the queen of 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.490
 diamonds 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.000
 they will place again and what they are going to 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.150
 take 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.500
 in the letter above 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.500
 who is the king of clover 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.900
 now what we are going to take out 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:06.249
 normal is this the queens of hearts 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.429
 we left state letters coins 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:12.110
 here if we do a double row lift that 

00:05:09.429 --> 00:05:14.980
 they are going to show is the king 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.980
 of diamonds 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:23.460
 they are going to hitler and what they are going to extract 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:24.629
 is the king of hearts once made 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.569
 this will leave us two letters of 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:30.289
 openwork the left age we passed it 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:30.289
 for the right 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:36.539
 we take the letter from above that is going to be 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.539
 the queen of diamonds 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:43.220
 and since what we do 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:46.840
 is removed with the thumb 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.840
 the letter that is above 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.580
 and showing is 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.050
 that would be the queen of spades which 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:57.310
 have 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.620
 the king of diamonds 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:02.550
 under 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.550
 we put there 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:09.280
 and what we 're going to get out is the king of 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:12.490
 diamonds and we will be of course 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.800
 the king and queen of spades 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.460
 heart is a simple trick but 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.460
