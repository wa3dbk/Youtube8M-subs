stages but ice man stage is so short

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.069 
stages but ice man stage is so short
that<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:36.000> really<00:01:36.150> doesn't<00:01:36.360> compare<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.750> elec

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
that it really doesn't compare to elec

that it really doesn't compare to elec
man<00:01:37.320> stage<00:01:37.650> which<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:39.030> know<00:01:39.060> more<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.540> a

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
marathon like this this level may

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.950 
marathon like this this level may
actually<00:01:41.310> take<00:01:41.640> us<00:01:41.820> five<00:01:42.390> minutes

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
actually take us five minutes

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.990 
actually take us five minutes
I<00:01:43.020> don't<00:01:43.200> know<00:01:43.320> 4<00:01:44.040> minutes<00:01:44.430> that'd<00:01:44.670> be<00:01:44.759> crazy

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
I don't know 4 minutes that'd be crazy

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.260 
I don't know 4 minutes that'd be crazy
considering<00:01:45.479> we've<00:01:45.659> done<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.899> last<00:01:46.079> few<00:01:46.229> into

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
considering we've done the last few into

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.580 
considering we've done the last few into
part<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.630> because<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:49.290> know<00:01:49.380> I'm

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
part of that is because you know I'm

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.260 
part of that is because you know I'm
just<00:01:49.649> not<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.250> great<00:01:50.460> at<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.820> game<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.119> mean

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
just not that great at the game I mean

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.450 
just not that great at the game I mean
I'm<00:01:51.360> I'm<00:01:51.509> pretty<00:01:51.960> good<00:01:52.200> I've<00:01:52.890> been<00:01:52.950> training

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460

I'm I'm pretty good I've been training
for<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.610> past<00:01:53.820> three<00:01:54.030> weeks<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.420> relatively

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
for the past three weeks and relatively

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.679 
for the past three weeks and relatively

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
solitary confinement trying to get just

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.889 
solitary confinement trying to get just
as<00:01:57.899> good<00:01:58.259> as<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.500> am<00:01:58.619> right<00:01:58.860> now<00:01:59.090> but<00:02:00.090> yeah<00:02:00.600> part

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
as good as I am right now but yeah part

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.389 
as good as I am right now but yeah part
of<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.079> is<00:02:01.140> just<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:01.680> long<00:02:01.890> it's<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.250> long

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
of it is just that it's long it's a long

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.120 
of it is just that it's long it's a long
level<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:03.570> boss<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:04.170> know<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:04.860> mentioned

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
level the boss I know I mentioned

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.880 
level the boss I know I mentioned
earlier<00:02:05.670> that

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
earlier that

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.470 
earlier that
three<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.100> the<00:02:08.220> four<00:02:08.400> robot<00:02:08.850> masters<00:02:09.300> could

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:09.480 
three of the four robot masters could

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.700 
three of the four robot masters could
probably<00:02:09.720> be<00:02:09.930> beaten<00:02:10.200> relatively

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
probably be beaten relatively

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.550 
probably be beaten relatively
comfortably<00:02:11.220> with<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.940> Mega<00:02:12.120> Buster<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.720> think

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
comfortably with the Mega Buster I think

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.320 
comfortably with the Mega Buster I think
um<00:02:13.740> I'm<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.310> little<00:02:14.520> bit<00:02:14.610> remiss<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:15.060> should<00:02:15.210> take

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
um I'm a little bit remiss I should take

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.840 
um I'm a little bit remiss I should take
that<00:02:15.480> back<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:16.290> can<00:02:16.650> beat<00:02:16.890> elect<00:02:17.280> man<00:02:17.460> with

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
that back you can beat elect man with

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.540 
that back you can beat elect man with
the<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.330> Mega<00:02:18.510> Buster<00:02:18.720> but<00:02:19.620> it's<00:02:20.280> gonna<00:02:20.400> be

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
the the Mega Buster but it's gonna be

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.800 
the the Mega Buster but it's gonna be
tricky<00:02:20.730> let's<00:02:21.060> put<00:02:21.210> it<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.390> way<00:02:21.450> you're

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
tricky let's put it that way you're

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.480 
tricky let's put it that way you're
gonna<00:02:21.990> be<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.200> lot<00:02:22.410> better<00:02:22.650> off<00:02:22.830> using<00:02:23.010> rolling

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
gonna be a lot better off using rolling

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.880 
gonna be a lot better off using rolling
cutter<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:24.390> course<00:02:24.720> using<00:02:25.200> rolling<00:02:25.680> cutter

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
cutter of course using rolling cutter

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.400 
cutter of course using rolling cutter
it's<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.760> cakewalk<00:02:27.330> so<00:02:27.810> like<00:02:28.200> there's

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
it's a cakewalk so like there's

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.020 
it's a cakewalk so like there's
not<00:02:28.560> even<00:02:28.590> any<00:02:28.950> challenge<00:02:29.370> whatsoever<00:02:29.670> then

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
not even any challenge whatsoever then

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.570 
not even any challenge whatsoever then
it's<00:02:30.660> almost<00:02:30.780> like<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.440> know<00:02:31.530> if<00:02:31.800> Mega<00:02:32.370> Man

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
it's almost like you know if Mega Man

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.550 
it's almost like you know if Mega Man
was<00:02:32.610> an<00:02:32.880> orange<00:02:33.240> we've<00:02:33.900> gotten<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.290> peels

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
was an orange we've gotten the peels

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.750 
was an orange we've gotten the peels
started<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.130> know<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.340> whole<00:02:35.490> thing's

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
started to know the whole thing's

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.450 
started to know the whole thing's
starting<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.090> coming<00:02:36.390> unraveled<00:02:36.920> or<00:02:37.920> unpeeled

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
starting to coming unraveled or unpeeled

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.430 
starting to coming unraveled or unpeeled
I<00:02:38.580> guess<00:02:38.760> is<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:38.940> better<00:02:39.240> word<00:02:39.840> for<00:02:39.870> it

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
I guess is a better word for it

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.010 
I guess is a better word for it
let<00:02:41.160> me<00:02:41.250> get<00:02:41.370> as<00:02:41.460> a<00:02:41.490> delicious<00:02:42.120> Mega<00:02:42.420> Man<00:02:42.690> fruit

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
let me get as a delicious Mega Man fruit

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.290 
let me get as a delicious Mega Man fruit
in<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.290> middle<00:02:43.410> which<00:02:43.740> I<00:02:44.070> guess<00:02:44.610> is<00:02:44.790> not<00:02:44.970> dying

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
in the middle which I guess is not dying

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.560 
in the middle which I guess is not dying
20<00:02:45.930> times<00:02:46.400> every<00:02:47.400> time<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.670> play<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.880> level<00:02:48.210> any

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
20 times every time you play a level any

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.830 
20 times every time you play a level any
game<00:02:48.780> anyway<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.760> really<00:02:50.760> like<00:02:50.970> these<00:02:51.150> these

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.720 
game anyway I really like these these

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
mining hat enemies I think the first

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.000 
mining hat enemies I think the first
time<00:02:53.820> I<00:02:53.940> was<00:02:54.060> introduced<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.630> them<00:02:54.810> was<00:02:55.080> in

one of my favorite mega net enemies

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.290 
one of my favorite mega net enemies
particularly<00:03:05.070> because<00:03:05.280> unlike<00:03:05.820> these<00:03:06.030> guys

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
minutes to kill them they die in one hit

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.140 
minutes to kill them they die in one hit
which<00:03:10.410> is<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:11.330> breath<00:03:12.330> of<00:03:12.480> fresh<00:03:12.540> air<00:03:12.930> let's<00:03:13.200> say

here we go yeah I actually made that

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.030 
here we go yeah I actually made that
jump<00:03:16.980> successfully<00:03:17.610> who<00:03:17.730> would<00:03:17.880> have<00:03:18.000> thought
