out and my wife asked me to replace it
so<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:14.969> figured<00:00:15.089> I'd<00:00:15.420> take<00:00:15.990> this<00:00:16.109> opportunity

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
so I figured I'd take this opportunity

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.910 
so I figured I'd take this opportunity
to<00:00:16.980> show<00:00:17.190> you<00:00:17.359> how<00:00:18.359> you<00:00:18.420> can<00:00:18.600> replace<00:00:18.960> some<00:00:19.890> of

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
to show you how you can replace some of

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.920 
to show you how you can replace some of
these<00:00:20.039> keys

these keys

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.990 
these keys
sometimes<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.260> laptop<00:00:23.160> keyboard

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
sometimes the laptop keyboard

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.820 
sometimes the laptop keyboard
configurations<00:00:24.900> can<00:00:25.050> be<00:00:25.109> somewhat<00:00:25.619> different

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
configurations can be somewhat different

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.339 
configurations can be somewhat different
but<00:00:26.519> quite<00:00:27.119> commonly<00:00:27.630> they're<00:00:27.840> structured

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
but quite commonly they're structured

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.589 
but quite commonly they're structured
very<00:00:28.890> similar<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.519> here<00:00:29.760> let<00:00:29.910> me<00:00:29.939> zoom<00:00:30.090> in

these were actually underneath the key

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.649 
these were actually underneath the key
here<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.409> we're<00:01:26.310> connected<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.479> these

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
here and we're connected to to these

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.940 
here and we're connected to to these
little<00:01:27.960> hook<00:01:28.799> arms<00:01:29.460> right<00:01:29.909> here<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.950> looking

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
little hook arms right here and looking

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.590 
little hook arms right here and looking
at<00:01:32.070> them<00:01:32.189> really<00:01:32.430> closely<00:01:32.670> they<00:01:33.090> do<00:01:33.150> kind<00:01:33.509> of

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
at them really closely they do kind of

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.770 
at them really closely they do kind of
come<00:01:33.840> together<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.979> first<00:01:35.220> step<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:36.479> to

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
come together and the first step is to

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.469 
come together and the first step is to
know<00:01:36.930> which<00:01:37.170> direction<00:01:37.560> they<00:01:38.310> go<00:01:38.490> back<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:39.090> and

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
know which direction they go back in and

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.050 
know which direction they go back in and
if<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.200> look<00:01:40.409> closely<00:01:40.710> on<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.159> largest<00:01:41.579> one

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
if you look closely on the largest one

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.020 
if you look closely on the largest one
you'll<00:01:42.689> kind<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.049> see<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:44.009> flat<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.820> kind

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
you'll kind of see it's flat it's kind

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.880 
you'll kind of see it's flat it's kind
of<00:01:45.060> dirty<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.570> side<00:01:45.780> but<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.290> flat<00:01:46.649> on

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
of dirty on that side but it's flat on

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.539 
of dirty on that side but it's flat on
one<00:01:46.979> side<00:01:47.549> on<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:49.049> top<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.560> there's<00:01:50.369> this

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
one side on the top and there's this

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.670 
one side on the top and there's this
little<00:01:50.820> bump<00:01:51.180> if<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.630> could<00:01:51.899> kind<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.170> zoom<00:01:52.649> in

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
little bump if I could kind of zoom in

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.630 
little bump if I could kind of zoom in
here<00:01:53.750> if<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.899> can<00:01:55.110> show<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.979> there's<00:01:56.549> a

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
here if I can show you this there's a

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.510 
here if I can show you this there's a
little<00:01:56.850> bump<00:01:57.210> on<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.810> bottom<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.500> both<00:01:58.560> sides

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
little bump on the bottom on both sides

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.539 
little bump on the bottom on both sides
Dion<00:01:59.909> well<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.689> little<00:02:01.040> depressor<00:02:02.040> above

Dion well this little depressor above

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.179 
Dion well this little depressor above
here<00:02:02.939> goes<00:02:03.600> on<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> bottom<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.710> actually

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
here goes on the bottom so it actually

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.650 
here goes on the bottom so it actually
the<00:02:05.430> flat<00:02:05.700> part<00:02:06.060> goes<00:02:06.329> on<00:02:06.570> top<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.520> the

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
the flat part goes on top and the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.240 
the flat part goes on top and the
irregular<00:02:09.660> area<00:02:10.229> where<00:02:10.410> there's<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.649> bump

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
irregular area where there's a bump

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.470 
irregular area where there's a bump
goes<00:02:11.550> on<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.819> bottom

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
goes on the bottom

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.380 
goes on the bottom
so<00:02:13.080> that's<00:02:13.290> four<00:02:13.739> for<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.220> larger<00:02:14.580> one<00:02:14.730> now

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
so that's four for the larger one now

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.449 
so that's four for the larger one now
for<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.660> smaller<00:02:15.989> one<00:02:16.260> it's<00:02:16.739> kind<00:02:17.099> of<00:02:17.190> similar

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
for the smaller one it's kind of similar

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.390 
for the smaller one it's kind of similar
you<00:02:18.180> kind<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.480> look<00:02:18.720> at<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:19.920> larger

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
you kind of look at this this larger

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.190 
you kind of look at this this larger
piece<00:02:20.610> here<00:02:21.120> let<00:02:21.300> me<00:02:21.330> just<00:02:21.629> point<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.080> here

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
piece here let me just point to it here

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.170 
piece here let me just point to it here
so<00:02:25.200> there's<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:25.650> little<00:02:25.950> smaller<00:02:26.670> hook<00:02:26.940> arm

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
so there's this little smaller hook arm

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.140 
so there's this little smaller hook arm
there<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.690> then<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.230> larger<00:02:28.830> one<00:02:28.860> there<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.730> if

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
there and then a larger one there and if

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.520 
there and then a larger one there and if
you<00:02:30.269> look<00:02:30.510> at<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.930> larger<00:02:31.410> one<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:33.410> is<00:02:34.410> very

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
you look at the larger one it is very

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.740 
you look at the larger one it is very
hard<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:34.920> do<00:02:35.069> this<00:02:35.190> with<00:02:35.400> tangles<00:02:35.880> it's<00:02:36.420> very

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
hard to do this with tangles it's very

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:45.380 
hard to do this with tangles it's very
tiny<00:02:37.040> it<00:02:38.040> looks<00:02:38.310> like<00:02:43.549> it's<00:02:44.549> kind<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:44.940> flatter

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
tiny it looks like it's kind of flatter

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.690 
tiny it looks like it's kind of flatter
on<00:02:45.660> one<00:02:45.930> side<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.620> there's<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.069> little<00:02:47.220> kind<00:02:47.580> of

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
on one side and there's a little kind of

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.030 
on one side and there's a little kind of
lip<00:02:47.970> on<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.330> other<00:02:48.480> side<00:02:48.840> well<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.530> lip<00:02:49.799> is

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
lip on the other side well the lip is

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.759 
lip on the other side well the lip is
the<00:02:50.280> bottom<00:02:50.640> part<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.890> so<00:02:53.720> so<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:55.650> it

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
the bottom part and so so that so it

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.550 
the bottom part and so so that so it
goes<00:02:55.920> like<00:02:56.340> that

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
goes like that

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.470 
goes like that
okay<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.920> way<00:02:59.130> these<00:02:59.340> go<00:02:59.640> in<00:02:59.880> is<00:03:00.150> I

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
okay and the way these go in is I

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.080 
okay and the way these go in is I
usually<00:03:00.750> put<00:03:01.230> in<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:02.010> smaller<00:03:02.340> piece<00:03:02.700> first

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
usually put in the smaller piece first

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.350 
usually put in the smaller piece first
and<00:03:03.560> moving<00:03:04.560> up<00:03:04.799> to<00:03:05.010> here<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:05.430> get<00:03:05.880> this<00:03:06.030> big

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
and moving up to here you get this big

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.330 
and moving up to here you get this big
hook<00:03:06.630> right<00:03:07.079> there<00:03:07.380> let<00:03:07.920> me<00:03:08.040> get<00:03:08.190> my

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
hook right there let me get my

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.740 
hook right there let me get my
screwdriver<00:03:08.610> back<00:03:09.680> here's<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.980> big<00:03:11.190> hook<00:03:11.400> and

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
screwdriver back here's the big hook and

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.140 
screwdriver back here's the big hook and
here's<00:03:12.750> two<00:03:13.049> small<00:03:13.500> smaller<00:03:14.310> hooks<00:03:14.579> one<00:03:14.880> and

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
here's two small smaller hooks one and

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.910 
here's two small smaller hooks one and
two<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.370> what<00:03:17.370> you<00:03:17.549> do<00:03:17.700> with<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.870> with<00:03:19.799> the

two and what you do with the with the
smaller<00:03:20.280> plastic<00:03:20.700> piece<00:03:21.180> is<00:03:21.829> making<00:03:22.829> sure

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
smaller plastic piece is making sure

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.729 
smaller plastic piece is making sure
that<00:03:23.250> it's<00:03:23.430> correctly<00:03:24.150> positioned<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:25.470> put

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
that it's correctly positioned you put

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:36.890 
that it's correctly positioned you put
this<00:03:25.859> in<00:03:27.739> right<00:03:28.739> over<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:30.480> larger<00:03:30.900> hook

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.690 

just<00:03:37.900> like<00:03:38.050> that<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:38.590> you<00:03:38.769> can<00:03:38.920> hold<00:03:39.190> lay<00:03:39.550> it

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
just like that and you can hold lay it

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.610 
just like that and you can hold lay it
right<00:03:39.730> over<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.209> button<00:03:40.569> now<00:03:41.110> some<00:03:41.410> people

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
right over the button now some people

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.180 
right over the button now some people
actually<00:03:42.010> here<00:03:42.519> let<00:03:42.940> me<00:03:43.030> back<00:03:43.269> up<00:03:43.300> always

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
actually here let me back up always

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.270 
actually here let me back up always
these<00:03:45.190> two<00:03:45.730> pieces<00:03:45.970> actually<00:03:46.890> go<00:03:47.890> together

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
these two pieces actually go together

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.820 
these two pieces actually go together
they<00:03:48.910> actually<00:03:49.420> kind<00:03:49.660> of<00:03:49.780> clip<00:03:50.200> on<00:03:50.379> together

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
they actually kind of clip on together

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.410 
they actually kind of clip on together
and<00:03:51.370> you<00:03:51.519> could<00:03:51.700> see<00:03:51.970> there<00:03:52.299> is<00:03:52.480> a<00:03:52.799> little

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
and you could see there is a little

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.350 
and you could see there is a little
little<00:03:55.680> divot<00:03:56.680> here<00:03:56.709> and<00:03:57.160> a<00:03:57.280> dip<00:03:57.489> it<00:03:57.610> here<00:03:57.640> well

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
little divot here and a dip it here well

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.240 
little divot here and a dip it here well
those<00:03:58.480> go<00:03:58.720> into<00:03:58.989> little<00:03:59.650> holes<00:03:59.830> on<00:04:00.069> either

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
those go into little holes on either

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.430 
those go into little holes on either
side<00:04:00.640> and<00:04:00.970> they<00:04:01.510> actually<00:04:01.900> if<00:04:01.989> you<00:04:02.080> push<00:04:02.319> them

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
side and they actually if you push them

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.140 
side and they actually if you push them
together<00:04:02.590> they<00:04:02.950> actually<00:04:03.280> snap<00:04:03.549> together<00:04:03.849> and

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
together they actually snap together and

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.440 
together they actually snap together and
some<00:04:04.720> people<00:04:05.049> actually<00:04:05.910> put<00:04:06.910> these<00:04:07.090> together

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
some people actually put these together

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.280 
some people actually put these together
first<00:04:08.049> and<00:04:08.530> then<00:04:09.160> attach<00:04:09.549> it<00:04:09.579> in<00:04:10.000> here<00:04:10.569> but<00:04:10.780> in

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
first and then attach it in here but in

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.229 
first and then attach it in here but in
order<00:04:11.829> to<00:04:11.980> do<00:04:12.130> that<00:04:12.310> you<00:04:12.519> actually<00:04:12.640> have<00:04:12.940> to

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
order to do that you actually have to

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.240 
order to do that you actually have to
stretch<00:04:13.780> some<00:04:14.170> of<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.319> plastic<00:04:14.860> and<00:04:15.040> I<00:04:15.099> don't

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
stretch some of the plastic and I don't

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.170 
stretch some of the plastic and I don't
like<00:04:15.400> doing<00:04:15.730> that<00:04:15.849> it's<00:04:16.570> a<00:04:16.720> little<00:04:16.840> bit<00:04:18.180> you

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
like doing that it's a little bit you

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.490 
like doing that it's a little bit you
have<00:04:19.239> to<00:04:19.329> have<00:04:19.479> a<00:04:19.540> little<00:04:19.660> more<00:04:19.810> coordination

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
have to have a little more coordination

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.680 
have to have a little more coordination
to<00:04:20.709> put<00:04:20.950> on<00:04:21.070> them<00:04:21.370> on<00:04:21.519> separately<00:04:22.030> but<00:04:22.330> I<00:04:22.389> kind

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
to put on them on separately but I kind

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.550 
to put on them on separately but I kind
of<00:04:22.750> like<00:04:22.900> that<00:04:23.139> just<00:04:23.440> so<00:04:23.650> I<00:04:23.680> don't<00:04:25.320> so<00:04:26.320> I<00:04:26.380> don't

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
of like that just so I don't so I don't

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.800 
of like that just so I don't so I don't
break<00:04:26.860> these<00:04:27.130> things<00:04:27.490> so<00:04:27.760> I<00:04:27.789> I<00:04:28.090> first<00:04:28.510> just

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
break these things so I I first just

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.279 
break these things so I I first just
kind<00:04:28.990> of<00:04:29.050> put<00:04:29.260> these<00:04:29.410> in<00:04:29.590> place<00:04:30.450> like<00:04:31.450> that<00:04:31.780> and

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
kind of put these in place like that and

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.460 
kind of put these in place like that and
let<00:04:33.039> it<00:04:33.070> not<00:04:33.340> pop<00:04:33.610> out<00:04:33.870> kind<00:04:34.870> of<00:04:34.960> want<00:04:35.110> to<00:04:35.229> stick

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
let it not pop out kind of want to stick

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.879 
let it not pop out kind of want to stick
up<00:04:35.650> there<00:04:35.800> so<00:04:36.370> that's<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.699> first<00:04:37.000> one<00:04:37.180> and<00:04:37.889> the

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
up there so that's the first one and the

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.760 
up there so that's the first one and the
second<00:04:39.310> one<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:40.120> larger<00:04:40.510> one<00:04:40.690> if<00:04:41.320> I<00:04:41.530> could

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
second one the larger one if I could

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.330 
second one the larger one if I could
show<00:04:41.979> you<00:04:42.010> this<00:04:43.050> again<00:04:44.050> you<00:04:44.530> want<00:04:44.770> the<00:04:44.950> smooth

show you this again you want the smooth

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.719 
show you this again you want the smooth
part<00:04:46.120> on<00:04:46.419> top<00:04:47.020> so<00:04:47.620> that<00:04:47.650> that'd<00:04:48.190> be<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:48.490> top

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
part on top so that that'd be the top

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.960 
part on top so that that'd be the top
and<00:04:49.060> you<00:04:49.510> see<00:04:49.720> these<00:04:49.840> two<00:04:50.229> little<00:04:50.910> kind<00:04:51.910> of

and you see these two little kind of
like<00:04:52.120> hinge<00:04:52.419> points

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
like hinge points

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.409 
like hinge points
well<00:04:53.470> those<00:04:53.530> hinge<00:04:54.070> points<00:04:54.520> go<00:04:54.729> right<00:04:54.970> here

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
well those hinge points go right here

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:01.379 
well those hinge points go right here
and<00:04:55.599> so<00:04:56.289> you<00:04:56.349> kind<00:04:56.710> of<00:04:56.770> just<00:05:00.210> oops

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.250 
the larger one on top just like that and
then<00:05:24.789> very<00:05:25.000> carefully<00:05:27.000> you<00:05:28.000> try<00:05:28.300> to<00:05:28.360> press

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
then very carefully you try to press

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.140 
then very carefully you try to press
them<00:05:29.470> in<00:05:29.590> I'm<00:05:29.740> doing<00:05:30.070> this<00:05:30.160> with<00:05:30.340> one<00:05:30.370> hand<00:05:30.580> so

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
them in I'm doing this with one hand so

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.629 
them in I'm doing this with one hand so
it's<00:05:31.300> a<00:05:31.360> little<00:05:31.510> bit<00:05:31.690> and<00:05:32.560> if<00:05:32.770> you<00:05:32.889> press<00:05:33.430> them

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 
it's a little bit and if you press them

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.379 
it's a little bit and if you press them
in<00:05:33.820> together<00:05:34.030> they<00:05:34.840> should<00:05:35.110> snap<00:05:36.180> okay<00:05:37.180> so<00:05:37.240> I

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:37.389 
in together they should snap okay so I

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:39.779 
in together they should snap okay so I
did<00:05:37.599> get<00:05:37.750> a<00:05:37.810> helper<00:05:38.590> to<00:05:38.770> hold<00:05:38.950> the<00:05:39.099> camera<00:05:39.310> so<00:05:39.760> I

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:39.789 
did get a helper to hold the camera so I

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:41.310 
did get a helper to hold the camera so I
can<00:05:40.030> do<00:05:40.150> this<00:05:40.270> with<00:05:40.450> two<00:05:40.570> hands<00:05:40.840> so<00:05:40.960> I<00:05:41.050> kind<00:05:41.260> of

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
can do this with two hands so I kind of

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.649 
can do this with two hands so I kind of
hold<00:05:41.530> this<00:05:41.710> together<00:05:42.190> and<00:05:42.610> I<00:05:43.210> want<00:05:43.450> to<00:05:43.539> make

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:43.659 
hold this together and I want to make

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:47.790 
hold this together and I want to make
sure<00:05:43.690> that<00:05:44.080> those<00:05:44.289> little<00:05:45.419> those<00:05:46.419> little<00:05:46.590> nibs

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
sure that those little those little nibs

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.629 
sure that those little those little nibs
are<00:05:49.229> connected<00:05:50.229> together<00:05:50.379> on<00:05:50.800> both<00:05:50.979> sides<00:05:51.310> so

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 
are connected together on both sides so

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:53.730 
are connected together on both sides so
I<00:05:51.669> push<00:05:51.970> down<00:05:52.000> and<00:05:52.599> then<00:05:53.229> it<00:05:53.379> should<00:05:53.590> be

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
I push down and then it should be

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.189 
I push down and then it should be
connected<00:05:54.280> and<00:05:54.430> you<00:05:55.000> could<00:05:55.180> see<00:05:55.479> it<00:05:55.960> is

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 
connected and you could see it is

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:58.020 
connected and you could see it is
connected<00:05:56.800> there's<00:05:57.129> a<00:05:57.190> little<00:05:57.460> hinge<00:05:57.699> point

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
connected there's a little hinge point

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.050 
connected there's a little hinge point
on<00:05:58.210> both<00:05:58.389> sides<00:05:58.690> and<00:05:59.080> so<00:05:59.310> they<00:06:00.310> kind<00:06:00.460> of<00:06:00.580> bob<00:06:00.789> up

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
on both sides and so they kind of bob up

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.119 
on both sides and so they kind of bob up
and<00:06:01.180> down

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:02.129 
and down

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:04.619 
and down
so<00:06:03.129> with<00:06:03.340> these<00:06:03.490> connected<00:06:04.090> you<00:06:04.210> could<00:06:04.360> kind

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:04.629 
so with these connected you could kind

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:06.420 
so with these connected you could kind
of<00:06:04.690> see<00:06:04.870> this<00:06:05.050> little<00:06:05.229> spring<00:06:05.620> motion<00:06:06.159> going

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
of see this little spring motion going

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.640 
of see this little spring motion going
on<00:06:06.610> here<00:06:06.909> and<00:06:07.120> then<00:06:07.330> a<00:06:07.360> little<00:06:07.659> but<00:06:08.259> in<00:06:08.470> the

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
on here and then a little but in the

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.580 
on here and then a little but in the
middle<00:06:09.060> kind<00:06:10.060> of<00:06:10.180> moves<00:06:10.389> in<00:06:10.659> the<00:06:10.750> center<00:06:11.080> and

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
middle kind of moves in the center and

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.740 
middle kind of moves in the center and
so<00:06:12.190> the<00:06:12.310> next<00:06:12.490> thing<00:06:12.639> you<00:06:12.819> want<00:06:13.000> to<00:06:13.060> do<00:06:13.240> is<00:06:13.449> just

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
so the next thing you want to do is just

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.839 
so the next thing you want to do is just
take<00:06:13.990> your<00:06:14.229> little<00:06:14.379> your<00:06:15.250> button<00:06:15.669> plate

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:15.849 
take your little your button plate

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:17.969 
take your little your button plate
itself<00:06:16.270> and<00:06:16.509> you<00:06:16.569> could<00:06:16.720> see<00:06:16.900> this<00:06:17.050> little<00:06:17.229> two

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:17.979 
itself and you could see this little two

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:20.969 
itself and you could see this little two
little<00:06:18.960> connecting<00:06:19.960> points<00:06:20.349> there<00:06:20.530> and<00:06:20.770> one

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979 
little connecting points there and one

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:22.409 
little connecting points there and one
on<00:06:21.129> this<00:06:21.340> side<00:06:21.400> and<00:06:21.940> those<00:06:22.090> kind<00:06:22.389> of

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419 
on this side and those kind of

lower<00:06:27.219> hinge<00:06:27.460> point<00:06:27.819> there<00:06:28.090> in<00:06:28.270> this<00:06:28.690> little

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
lower hinge point there in this little

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.689 
lower hinge point there in this little
hinge<00:06:29.050> point<00:06:29.349> there<00:06:29.620> well<00:06:30.310> those<00:06:30.430> will

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:30.699 
hinge point there well those will

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:32.520 
hinge point there well those will
connect<00:06:31.060> into<00:06:31.270> this<00:06:31.419> one<00:06:31.659> in<00:06:31.870> that<00:06:32.080> one<00:06:32.319> and

connect into this one in that one and
then<00:06:33.129> this<00:06:33.310> little<00:06:33.460> hinge<00:06:33.879> point<00:06:34.240> right<00:06:34.629> there

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
then this little hinge point right there

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.189 
then this little hinge point right there
and<00:06:35.199> that<00:06:36.159> will<00:06:36.400> connect<00:06:36.729> into<00:06:36.969> that<00:06:37.120> one<00:06:37.389> and
