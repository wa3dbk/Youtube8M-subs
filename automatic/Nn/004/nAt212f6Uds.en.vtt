all<00:00:00.570> right<00:00:00.719> we're<00:00:00.960> going<00:00:01.170> to<00:00:01.260> do<00:00:01.589> a<00:00:01.620> reflection

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
all right we're going to do a reflection

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.309 
all right we're going to do a reflection
we're<00:00:02.820> going<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.060> use<00:00:03.179> reflection<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:03.959> create

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
we're going to use reflection to create

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.249 
we're going to use reflection to create
two<00:00:04.650> congruent<00:00:05.520> triangles<00:00:05.970> fold<00:00:06.810> your<00:00:07.020> Patty

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
two congruent triangles fold your Patty

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.250 
two congruent triangles fold your Patty
paper<00:00:07.529> at<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:07.980> diagonal<00:00:08.970> anyplace<00:00:09.780> but<00:00:10.080> just

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
paper at a diagonal anyplace but just

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.440 
paper at a diagonal anyplace but just
make<00:00:10.440> sure<00:00:10.559> you<00:00:10.679> save<00:00:10.920> yourself<00:00:11.130> more<00:00:12.090> room<00:00:12.330> so

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
make sure you save yourself more room so

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.759 
make sure you save yourself more room so
don't<00:00:12.630> make<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.929> too<00:00:13.080> small

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
don't make it too small

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.460 
don't make it too small
don't<00:00:14.070> make<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.340> too<00:00:14.370> small<00:00:14.639> like<00:00:14.940> this<00:00:15.470> you

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
don't make it too small like this you

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.050 
don't make it too small like this you
know<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.619> little<00:00:16.920> like<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.220> so<00:00:17.850> we're<00:00:17.970> going

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
know a little like this so we're going

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.480 
know a little like this so we're going
to<00:00:18.119> fold<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.740> I'm<00:00:19.740> going<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.070> fold<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.400> until

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
to fold it I'm going to fold it until

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.710 
to fold it I'm going to fold it until
right<00:00:20.820> about<00:00:21.090> here<00:00:23.119> it<00:00:24.119> doesn't<00:00:24.420> have<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.600> be

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
right about here it doesn't have to be

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.000 
right about here it doesn't have to be
perfect<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.590> creep<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:27.529> when<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.619> open<00:00:28.949> it

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
perfect and creep it when you open it

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.780 
perfect and creep it when you open it
back<00:00:29.160> up<00:00:29.539> now<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.599> have<00:00:30.929> your<00:00:31.140> mind<00:00:31.439> of

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
back up now you have your mind of

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.310 
back up now you have your mind of
reflection<00:00:32.790> okay<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:33.540> let's<00:00:33.989> go<00:00:34.110> ahead<00:00:34.140> and

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
reflection okay so let's go ahead and

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:44.560 
reflection okay so let's go ahead and
label<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.680> as<00:00:35.040> our<00:00:35.640> line<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.270> reflection

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.560 

okay<00:00:45.290> on<00:00:45.830> your<00:00:45.890> smaller<00:00:46.490> side<00:00:46.850> you're<00:00:47.330> going

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
okay on your smaller side you're going

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.840 
okay on your smaller side you're going
to<00:00:47.720> drive<00:00:47.990> yourself<00:00:48.110> the<00:00:48.470> triangle<00:00:48.950> any<00:00:49.550> old

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
to drive yourself the triangle any old

00:00:49.850 --> 00:01:08.359 
to drive yourself the triangle any old
triangle<00:00:50.450> will<00:00:51.170> do

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.310 

okay<00:01:09.119> see<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.380> backup

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.230 

you're<00:01:15.860> going<00:01:16.010> to<00:01:16.070> flip<00:01:16.370> it<00:01:16.520> over<00:01:16.640> so<00:01:17.120> that

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
you're going to flip it over so that

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.020 
you're going to flip it over so that
this<00:01:17.540> term<00:01:17.810> that<00:01:17.870> you<00:01:18.260> just<00:01:18.560> drew<00:01:18.980> is<00:01:19.250> on<00:01:19.880> the

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
this term that you just drew is on the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.540 
this term that you just drew is on the
bottom<00:01:20.450> okay

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
bottom okay

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.060 
bottom okay
so<00:01:23.510> now<00:01:23.690> if<00:01:23.780> you<00:01:23.900> look<00:01:23.930> your<00:01:24.320> larger<00:01:24.740> side<00:01:24.920> is

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
so now if you look your larger side is

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.710 
so now if you look your larger side is
on<00:01:25.190> the<00:01:25.220> top<00:01:25.520> and<00:01:25.550> are<00:01:25.820> some<00:01:26.000> other<00:01:26.210> side<00:01:26.420> is<00:01:26.570> on

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
on the top and are some other side is on

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.290 
on the top and are some other side is on
the<00:01:26.750> bottom<00:01:27.080> and<00:01:27.320> you're<00:01:28.040> going<00:01:28.070> to<00:01:28.460> trace<00:01:29.090> it

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
the bottom and you're going to trace it

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.750 
the bottom and you're going to trace it
so<00:01:29.810> that<00:01:29.930> we<00:01:30.050> can<00:01:30.200> create<00:01:30.440> other<00:01:30.920> than<00:01:31.490> ruin

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
so that we can create other than ruin

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.350 
so that we can create other than ruin
triangle<00:01:33.370> now<00:01:34.370> this<00:01:34.550> one<00:01:34.700> is<00:01:34.820> a<00:01:34.850> little<00:01:35.000> small

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
triangle now this one is a little small

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.940 
triangle now this one is a little small
maybe<00:01:35.660> yours<00:01:35.960> is<00:01:36.140> a<00:01:36.170> little<00:01:36.470> bit<00:01:36.590> bigger<00:01:36.830> I

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
maybe yours is a little bit bigger I

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.480 
maybe yours is a little bit bigger I
hope<00:01:41.050> use<00:01:42.050> your<00:01:42.260> straight<00:01:42.620> edge<00:01:42.650> so<00:01:43.190> that<00:01:43.220> you

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
hope use your straight edge so that you

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.090 
hope use your straight edge so that you
can<00:01:43.670> make<00:01:43.850> sure<00:01:44.120> that<00:01:44.450> all<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.320> sides<00:01:45.590> are

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
can make sure that all the sides are

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.540 
can make sure that all the sides are
congruent<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:47.620> nice<00:01:48.620> and<00:01:48.830> straight<00:01:50.500> okay

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
congruent and nice and straight okay

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.219 
congruent and nice and straight okay
once<00:01:52.550> you've<00:01:52.700> created<00:01:52.940> that<00:01:53.270> open<00:01:53.930> it<00:01:54.050> back<00:01:54.170> up

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
once you've created that open it back up

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.280 
once you've created that open it back up
and<00:01:56.110> you<00:01:57.110> have<00:01:57.350> your<00:01:57.970> reflection<00:01:58.970> so<00:01:59.750> you<00:01:59.840> have

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
and you have your reflection so you have

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.860 
and you have your reflection so you have
two<00:02:00.740> sides<00:02:01.010> if<00:02:01.340> you<00:02:01.610> want<00:02:01.880> you<00:02:02.150> can<00:02:02.330> darken<00:02:02.690> it

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
two sides if you want you can darken it

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.469 
two sides if you want you can darken it
in<00:02:03.020> this<00:02:03.680> was<00:02:03.920> your<00:02:04.070> original<00:02:04.310> this<00:02:05.120> is<00:02:05.330> your

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
in this was your original this is your

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.510 
in this was your original this is your
reflected<00:02:06.020> side<00:02:06.260> so<00:02:06.860> you<00:02:06.920> might<00:02:07.190> want<00:02:07.460> to

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
reflected side so you might want to

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.250 
reflected side so you might want to
write<00:02:07.760> it<00:02:07.850> back<00:02:07.970> this<00:02:08.179> was<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.540> original<00:02:11.260> and

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
write it back this was the original and

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:19.060 
write it back this was the original and
this<00:02:12.380> was<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.680> reflection<00:02:17.410> so<00:02:18.410> if<00:02:18.650> we<00:02:18.830> label

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
this was the reflection so if we label

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.600 
this was the reflection so if we label
this<00:02:19.459> to<00:02:19.670> be<00:02:19.820> triangle<00:02:20.450> ABC<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.470> we<00:02:22.190> started

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
this to be triangle ABC and we started

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.300 
this to be triangle ABC and we started
here<00:02:23.380> triangle<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.820> be

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
here triangle a be

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.940 
here triangle a be
and<00:02:27.610> we<00:02:28.390> want<00:02:28.660> to<00:02:28.870> make<00:02:29.080> sure<00:02:29.350> that<00:02:29.590> we<00:02:29.740> have

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
and we want to make sure that we have

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.530 
and we want to make sure that we have
triangle<00:02:31.290> XYZ<00:02:32.290> on<00:02:33.010> this<00:02:33.220> side<00:02:33.490> then<00:02:34.180> we<00:02:34.330> have

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
triangle XYZ on this side then we have

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.910 
triangle XYZ on this side then we have
to<00:02:34.690> make<00:02:34.900> sure<00:02:34.930> that<00:02:35.080> we<00:02:35.380> labeled<00:02:35.830> it

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
to make sure that we labeled it

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.370 
to make sure that we labeled it
appropriately<00:02:36.610> so<00:02:37.360> this<00:02:37.540> would<00:02:37.720> have<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.959> be<00:02:38.110> X

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
appropriately so this would have to be X

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.550 
appropriately so this would have to be X
this<00:02:39.280> would<00:02:39.550> have<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.819> be<00:02:39.880> Y<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:40.660> this<00:02:41.350> one

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
this would have to be Y and this one

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.520 
this would have to be Y and this one
would<00:02:41.770> be<00:02:41.800> Z<00:02:42.280> remember<00:02:43.180> is<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.510> reflection<00:02:44.230> so

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
would be Z remember is the reflection so

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.650 
would be Z remember is the reflection so
it's<00:02:45.160> going<00:02:45.459> to<00:02:45.550> be<00:02:45.700> kind<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.060> mirror<00:02:46.390> each

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
it's going to be kind of mirror each

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.470 
it's going to be kind of mirror each
other<00:02:46.900> so<00:02:47.620> Y<00:02:47.890> and<00:02:48.250> B<00:02:48.430> are<00:02:48.610> going<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.180> be<00:02:49.300> right

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
other so Y and B are going to be right

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.720 
other so Y and B are going to be right
across<00:02:49.690> from<00:02:49.900> each<00:02:50.020> other<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.650> X<00:02:51.310> have<00:02:51.550> to<00:02:51.580> be

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
across from each other and X have to be

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.000 
across from each other and X have to be
across<00:02:52.060> from<00:02:52.360> each<00:02:52.420> other<00:02:52.660> and<00:02:52.870> C<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.470> Z<00:02:53.770> have

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
across from each other and C and Z have

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.790 
across from each other and C and Z have
to<00:02:54.160> be<00:02:54.310> across<00:02:55.090> from<00:02:55.330> each<00:02:55.420> other<00:02:55.660> now<00:02:56.470> because

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
to be across from each other now because

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.440 
to be across from each other now because
we<00:02:56.980> know<00:02:57.130> that<00:02:57.160> they<00:02:57.430> are<00:02:57.550> congruent<00:02:57.790> we<00:02:58.270> can

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
we know that they are congruent we can

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.810 
we know that they are congruent we can
mark<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:59.200> angles<00:02:59.650> and<00:02:59.860> statements<00:03:00.519> like<00:03:00.640> we

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
mark the angles and statements like we

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.990 
mark the angles and statements like we
did<00:03:01.000> previously<00:03:01.320> so<00:03:02.320> I'm<00:03:02.410> going<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.739> mark

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
did previously so I'm going to mark

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.020 
did previously so I'm going to mark
angle<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:05.350> then<00:03:05.590> it<00:03:05.709> matches<00:03:06.040> angle<00:03:06.400> X<00:03:06.640> and

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
angle a and then it matches angle X and

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.960 
angle a and then it matches angle X and
you'll<00:03:07.959> be<00:03:09.690> congruent<00:03:10.690> to<00:03:10.900> angle<00:03:11.019> Y<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:11.970> then

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
you'll be congruent to angle Y and then

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.559 
you'll be congruent to angle Y and then
an<00:03:13.180> you'll<00:03:13.360> see<00:03:14.760> it's<00:03:15.760> congruent<00:03:16.180> with<00:03:16.360> angle

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
an you'll see it's congruent with angle

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.850 
an you'll see it's congruent with angle
Z<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:19.120> then<00:03:19.900> we<00:03:20.019> do<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.260> same<00:03:20.410> things<00:03:20.709> with

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
Z and then we do the same things with

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.729 
Z and then we do the same things with
the<00:03:20.980> segments<00:03:21.459> segment<00:03:22.090> a-b<00:03:22.440> this<00:03:23.440> couldn't

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
the segments segment a-b this couldn't

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.890 
the segments segment a-b this couldn't
run<00:03:23.860> to<00:03:23.950> segment<00:03:24.190> XY<00:03:24.959> segment<00:03:25.959> BC<00:03:26.680> is

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
run to segment XY segment BC is

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.430 
run to segment XY segment BC is
congruent<00:03:28.900> to<00:03:29.230> segment<00:03:29.530> Y<00:03:30.430> Z<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:31.410> then<00:03:32.410> a

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
congruent to segment Y Z and then a

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.680 
congruent to segment Y Z and then a
statement<00:03:32.739> a<00:03:33.010> AC<00:03:33.519> is<00:03:34.390> congruent<00:03:34.600> to<00:03:35.489> segment

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
statement a AC is congruent to segment

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.720 
statement a AC is congruent to segment
XZ<00:03:38.730> ok<00:03:39.730> so<00:03:40.060> now<00:03:40.209> you<00:03:40.269> have<00:03:40.570> your<00:03:40.720> triangles

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
XZ ok so now you have your triangles

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.340 
XZ ok so now you have your triangles
labeled<00:03:42.730> and<00:03:42.910> you<00:03:43.239> can<00:03:43.450> write<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.810> statements

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
labeled and you can write the statements

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.979 
labeled and you can write the statements
there<00:03:44.560> one<00:03:45.400> thing<00:03:45.640> to<00:03:45.820> note<00:03:46.120> is<00:03:46.390> that<00:03:46.450> the

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
there one thing to note is that the

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.490 
there one thing to note is that the
distance<00:03:47.530> between<00:03:47.739> a<00:03:48.450> point<00:03:49.450> and<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:50.200> line<00:03:50.380> of

the line of reflux reflection that is

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.479 
the line of reflux reflection that is
going<00:03:59.350> to<00:03:59.410> be<00:03:59.500> helpful<00:03:59.920> when<00:04:00.010> you're<00:04:00.160> looking

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
going to be helpful when you're looking

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:01.979 
going to be helpful when you're looking
for<00:04:00.700> problems<00:04:00.970> that<00:04:01.180> are<00:04:01.359> asking<00:04:01.810> you<00:04:01.959> to

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
for problems that are asking you to

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.410 
for problems that are asking you to
violate<00:04:02.470> what<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.609> coordinate<00:04:04.150> of<00:04:04.269> a<00:04:04.390> point

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
violate what the coordinate of a point

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.250 
violate what the coordinate of a point
would<00:04:04.780> be<00:04:04.810> once<00:04:05.350> it<00:04:05.500> was<00:04:05.620> reflected<00:04:05.859> around<00:04:07.260> a

would be once it was reflected around a

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.580 
would be once it was reflected around a
line<00:04:08.799> of<00:04:08.950> symmetry<00:04:09.160> okay<00:04:09.880> so<00:04:10.570> we<00:04:11.260> have<00:04:11.440> our

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
line of symmetry okay so we have our

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.920 
line of symmetry okay so we have our
original<00:04:11.739> in<00:04:12.280> our<00:04:12.400> reflection<00:04:12.940> we<00:04:13.540> have<00:04:13.720> our

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
original in our reflection we have our

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.020 
original in our reflection we have our
line<00:04:14.170> of<00:04:14.320> reflection<00:04:14.500> we<00:04:15.430> can<00:04:15.609> write<00:04:15.790> our

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
line of reflection we can write our

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.270 
line of reflection we can write our
statements<00:04:16.690> then<00:04:16.900> so<00:04:17.560> we<00:04:17.709> can<00:04:17.859> say<00:04:18.070> that

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
statements then so we can say that

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.630 
statements then so we can say that
triangle<00:04:18.760> a<00:04:19.090> B<00:04:20.609> C<00:04:21.609> is<00:04:22.380> congruent<00:04:23.380> to<00:04:23.770> triangle

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
triangle a B C is congruent to triangle

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.240

X<00:04:25.560> Y<00:04:26.669> Z<00:04:27.669> and<00:04:27.970> then<00:04:28.900> we<00:04:28.990> can<00:04:29.169> write<00:04:29.350> each<00:04:29.950> of<00:04:30.160> the

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250

line<00:05:24.059> in<00:05:24.299> here<00:05:25.249> just<00:05:26.249> so<00:05:26.369> you<00:05:26.399> can<00:05:26.639> see<00:05:26.849> it<00:05:26.909> a

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:26.969 
line in here just so you can see it a

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:33.029 
line in here just so you can see it a
little<00:05:27.149> bit<00:05:27.329> better

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:36.049 

and<00:05:33.669> you<00:05:33.759> can<00:05:33.939> check<00:05:34.119> the<00:05:34.330> distance<00:05:34.539> between<00:05:34.869> a

00:05:36.049 --> 00:05:36.059 
and you can check the distance between a

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:39.719 
and you can check the distance between a
to<00:05:37.059> your<00:05:37.240> body<00:05:37.779> reflection<00:05:38.409> and<00:05:38.589> XTU<00:05:39.460> amount

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
to your body reflection and XTU amount

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.389 
to your body reflection and XTU amount
of<00:05:39.849> reflection<00:05:40.210> it's<00:05:40.839> probably<00:05:41.349> very<00:05:41.649> helpful

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:42.399 
of reflection it's probably very helpful

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:44.070 
of reflection it's probably very helpful
for<00:05:42.789> you<00:05:42.969> to<00:05:42.999> go<00:05:43.210> ahead<00:05:43.300> and<00:05:43.719> check<00:05:44.050> that

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
for you to go ahead and check that

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.589 
for you to go ahead and check that
measurement<00:05:44.680> you<00:05:45.430> put<00:05:45.639> your<00:05:45.849> measurement<00:05:46.330> end

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 
measurement you put your measurement end

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:49.320 
measurement you put your measurement end
and<00:05:46.899> they<00:05:47.379> should<00:05:47.649> match<00:05:47.830> put<00:05:48.639> your<00:05:48.819> dash<00:05:48.999> line

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
and they should match put your dash line

00:05:49.330 --> 00:06:04.040 
and they should match put your dash line
in<00:05:49.539> here<00:05:55.949> I'll<00:05:56.949> do<00:05:57.069> the<00:05:57.189> one<00:05:57.339> between<00:05:57.639> b<00:05:57.999> and<00:05:58.029> y

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
and I'm just going to put points here so

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.000 
and I'm just going to put points here so
you<00:06:16.490> can<00:06:16.700> actually<00:06:16.970> have<00:06:17.390> your<00:06:18.010> measurements

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
you can actually have your measurements

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.870 
you can actually have your measurements
here<00:06:19.700> and<00:06:19.880> I'm<00:06:19.970> going<00:06:20.090> to<00:06:20.180> call<00:06:20.360> this<00:06:20.570> M<00:06:20.900> this

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 
distances are going to be the same it'll

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.050 
distances are going to be the same it'll
make<00:07:00.200> short<00:07:00.560> work<00:07:00.650> of<00:07:00.860> those<00:07:01.310> problems<00:07:01.880> that

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:02.060 
make short work of those problems that

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.500 
make short work of those problems that
are<00:07:02.180> requiring<00:07:02.540> you<00:07:02.870> to<00:07:03.520> to<00:07:04.520> try<00:07:04.700> to<00:07:04.760> find<00:07:05.120> that

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:05.510 
are requiring you to to try to find that

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.510 
are requiring you to to try to find that
other<00:07:05.690> point<00:07:06.080> if<00:07:06.290> this<00:07:06.470> was<00:07:06.710> an<00:07:06.980> a<00:07:07.160> coordinate

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 
other point if this was an a coordinate

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.280 
other point if this was an a coordinate
grid<00:07:08.770> okay<00:07:09.850> so<00:07:10.850> there<00:07:11.030> you<00:07:11.060> have<00:07:11.210> it<00:07:11.330> using

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:12.290 
grid okay so there you have it using

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.410 
grid okay so there you have it using
reflection<00:07:13.250> to<00:07:13.550> create<00:07:13.910> two<00:07:14.060> congruent

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:14.420 
reflection to create two congruent

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.390 
reflection to create two congruent
triangles<00:07:15.410> so<00:07:15.590> we<00:07:15.710> were<00:07:15.800> able<00:07:15.920> to<00:07:16.100> identify

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.400 
triangles so we were able to identify

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.850 
triangles so we were able to identify
the<00:07:16.970> corresponding<00:07:17.480> and<00:07:18.050> congruent<00:07:18.380> parts

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860 
the corresponding and congruent parts

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.210 
the corresponding and congruent parts
and<00:07:19.070> of<00:07:19.790> their<00:07:19.940> savings<00:07:20.270> and<00:07:20.570> on<00:07:21.050> their<00:07:21.380> angles

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:22.220 
and of their savings and on their angles

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.370 
and of their savings and on their angles
and<00:07:22.490> we<00:07:22.850> also<00:07:23.030> saw<00:07:23.420> that<00:07:23.450> the<00:07:23.840> distance

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:24.380 
and we also saw that the distance

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.340 
and we also saw that the distance
between<00:07:24.850> point<00:07:25.850> and<00:07:26.090> the<00:07:26.540> lines<00:07:26.780> reflection

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:27.350 
between point and the lines reflection

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.500 
between point and the lines reflection
is<00:07:27.440> going<00:07:27.470> to<00:07:27.710> be<00:07:27.800> the<00:07:27.860> same<00:07:28.220> as<00:07:28.550> the<00:07:29.330> distance

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:29.510 
is going to be the same as the distance

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.870 
is going to be the same as the distance
from<00:07:29.720> the<00:07:29.960> reflected<00:07:30.530> point<00:07:30.800> to<00:07:31.400> the<00:07:31.550> line<00:07:31.730> of
