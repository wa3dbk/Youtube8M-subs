its<00:02:16.020> green<00:02:16.380> scale<00:02:16.950> body<00:02:17.340> now<00:02:17.640> I'm<00:02:17.940> pretty

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
its green scale body now I'm pretty

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.550 
its green scale body now I'm pretty
similar<00:02:18.959> to

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
similar to

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.140 
similar to
first<00:02:19.739> one<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.040> just<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.370> there's<00:02:20.550> stripes

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
first one is just that there's stripes

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.900 
first one is just that there's stripes
now<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.630> green<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:21.900> think<00:02:22.230> it's<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.620> bit<00:02:23.340> darker

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
now that green I think it's a bit darker

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.770 
now that green I think it's a bit darker
in<00:02:24.120> my<00:02:24.599> opinion<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.140> bit<00:02:25.349> darker<00:02:25.800> now<00:02:25.980> but

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
in my opinion is a bit darker now but

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.500 
in my opinion is a bit darker now but
this<00:02:27.780> is<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.590> fish<00:02:28.920> or<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.030> sea<00:02:30.209> creature

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
this is the fish or the sea creature

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.839 
this is the fish or the sea creature
anyways<00:02:33.800> okay<00:02:34.800> so<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:35.280> looks<00:02:35.459> pretty<00:02:35.580> scary

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
anyways okay so that looks pretty scary

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.210 
anyways okay so that looks pretty scary
in<00:02:36.269> its<00:02:36.420> adult<00:02:36.780> form<00:02:36.870> now<00:02:37.290> before<00:02:37.860> it<00:02:38.010> wasn't

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
in its adult form now before it wasn't

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.670 
in its adult form now before it wasn't
like<00:02:38.489> that<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:39.120> check<00:02:39.390> out<00:02:39.569> its<00:02:39.989> teeth<00:02:40.380> it

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
like that the check out its teeth it

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.559 
like that the check out its teeth it
looks<00:02:40.950> really<00:02:41.550> sharp<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:42.150> looks<00:02:42.330> pretty

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
looks really sharp it looks pretty

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.830 
looks really sharp it looks pretty
dangerous<00:02:44.180> something<00:02:45.180> definitely<00:02:45.599> I<00:02:45.630> don't

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
dangerous something definitely I don't

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.300 
dangerous something definitely I don't
want<00:02:45.989> to<00:02:46.140> be<00:02:46.260> near<00:02:48.739> now<00:02:49.739> we're<00:02:49.890> gonna<00:02:50.010> try<00:02:50.280> to

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
want to be near now we're gonna try to

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.640 
want to be near now we're gonna try to
look<00:02:50.580> at<00:02:50.760> its<00:02:51.030> next<00:02:51.569> form<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.019> see<00:02:52.140> how<00:02:52.319> it

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
look at its next form and see how it

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.000 
look at its next form and see how it
grows<00:02:53.150> we<00:02:54.150> are<00:02:54.450> back<00:02:54.989> with<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.350> evolution

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
grows we are back with the evolution

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.039 
grows we are back with the evolution
screen<00:02:56.310> as<00:02:56.489> you<00:02:56.670> can<00:02:56.700> see<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:57.390> it<00:02:57.569> says<00:02:57.840> this

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
screen as you can see that it says this

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.020 
screen as you can see that it says this
sea<00:02:58.319> creature<00:02:58.769> could<00:02:58.950> open<00:02:59.250> its<00:02:59.430> jaw<00:02:59.640> wide

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
sea creature could open its jaw wide

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.620 
sea creature could open its jaw wide
enough<00:03:00.299> to<00:03:00.360> swallow<00:03:00.620> its<00:03:01.620> prey<00:03:02.130> whole<00:03:02.519> so<00:03:03.450> it's

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
enough to swallow its prey whole so it's

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.550 
enough to swallow its prey whole so it's
probably<00:03:03.930> pretty<00:03:04.230> big<00:03:04.970> now<00:03:05.970> we<00:03:06.030> are<00:03:06.450> back<00:03:06.959> with

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
probably pretty big now we are back with

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.210 
probably pretty big now we are back with
the<00:03:08.069> third<00:03:09.110> evolution<00:03:10.110> or<00:03:10.620> I<00:03:10.650> mean<00:03:10.860> this<00:03:11.040> is

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
the third evolution or I mean this is

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.089 
the third evolution or I mean this is
the<00:03:11.340> third<00:03:11.610> form<00:03:12.000> so<00:03:12.810> as<00:03:13.380> you<00:03:13.560> can<00:03:13.650> see<00:03:13.709> it's<00:03:13.950> no

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
the third form so as you can see it's no

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.170 
the third form so as you can see it's no
longer<00:03:14.130> green<00:03:14.670> it's<00:03:15.030> not<00:03:15.120> green<00:03:15.480> anymore<00:03:15.510> um<00:03:16.200> I

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
longer green it's not green anymore um I

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.220 
longer green it's not green anymore um I
mean<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:18.299> don't<00:03:18.420> see<00:03:18.569> the<00:03:18.690> black<00:03:18.900> anymore

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
mean you don't see the black anymore

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.460 
mean you don't see the black anymore
either<00:03:19.730> what<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:20.760> do<00:03:21.030> see<00:03:21.269> is<00:03:21.299> it's<00:03:21.780> red<00:03:22.110> and

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
either what you do see is it's red and

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.660 
either what you do see is it's red and
lost

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
lost

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.199 
lost
orange<00:03:24.120> orange<00:03:24.840> red<00:03:25.459> near<00:03:26.459> its<00:03:26.640> eyes<00:03:26.910> it's

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
orange orange red near its eyes it's

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.710

more red but there's blue stripes really

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.349 
more red but there's blue stripes really
different<00:03:31.109> from<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.410> other<00:03:31.769> design<00:03:32.370> but<00:03:32.820> you

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
different from the other design but you

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.640 
different from the other design but you
know<00:03:33.450> that's<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:34.019> color<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:34.470> is<00:03:36.500> now<00:03:37.500> we're

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
know that's the color it is now we're

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.550 
know that's the color it is now we're
gonna<00:03:37.739> look<00:03:37.920> at<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.220> adult<00:03:38.609> form<00:03:39.079> which<00:03:40.079> wow

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
gonna look at the adult form which wow

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.000 
gonna look at the adult form which wow
it<00:03:41.069> just<00:03:41.730> grew<00:03:41.970> really<00:03:42.209> big<00:03:42.630> like<00:03:43.140> before<00:03:43.590> but

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
it just grew really big like before but

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.430 
it just grew really big like before but
the<00:03:44.160> color<00:03:44.430> is<00:03:44.549> definitely<00:03:45.150> different

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
the color is definitely different

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.140 
the color is definitely different
reminds<00:03:46.440> me<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.620> salmon<00:03:47.130> color<00:03:47.430> or<00:03:47.790> something

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
reminds me a salmon color or something

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.900 
reminds me a salmon color or something
like<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:48.480> but<00:03:49.410> just<00:03:49.799> look<00:03:50.040> at<00:03:50.160> its<00:03:50.370> teeth<00:03:50.670> it

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
like that but just look at its teeth it

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.770 
like that but just look at its teeth it
looks<00:03:51.120> pretty<00:03:51.329> dangerous<00:03:52.730> so<00:03:53.730> that<00:03:54.060> is<00:03:54.389> the

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
looks pretty dangerous so that is the

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.569 
looks pretty dangerous so that is the
third<00:03:55.350> form<00:03:55.829> we're<00:03:56.040> going<00:03:56.069> to<00:03:56.220> be<00:03:56.280> looking<00:03:56.430> at

third form we're going to be looking at
the<00:03:56.730> last<00:03:56.880> and<00:03:57.150> final<00:03:57.299> form<00:03:57.720> in<00:03:58.079> the<00:03:58.920> moment<00:03:59.389> we

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
the last and final form in the moment we

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.509 
the last and final form in the moment we
are<00:04:00.660> back<00:04:01.049> here<00:04:01.319> with<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.650> last<00:04:01.859> evolution

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
are back here with the last evolution

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.379 
are back here with the last evolution
screen<00:04:02.850> basically<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:04.620> name<00:04:04.889> that<00:04:05.310> is<00:04:05.579> deceit

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
screen basically the name that is deceit

see<00:04:15.329> it<00:04:15.569> looks<00:04:15.720> really<00:04:16.139> similar<00:04:16.380> to<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.889> third

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
see it looks really similar to the third

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.409 
see it looks really similar to the third
form<00:04:17.549> but<00:04:18.389> it's<00:04:18.959> more<00:04:19.200> red<00:04:19.500> it<00:04:19.950> is<00:04:20.609> definitely

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
form but it's more red it is definitely

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.740 
form but it's more red it is definitely
more<00:04:21.630> red<00:04:21.930> right<00:04:22.260> near<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.650> eyes<00:04:22.889> and<00:04:23.750> it's

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
more red right near the eyes and it's

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.110 
more red right near the eyes and it's
orange<00:04:25.139> around<00:04:25.650> his<00:04:26.100> body<00:04:26.460> and<00:04:26.760> then<00:04:26.910> there's

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
orange around his body and then there's

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.899 
orange around his body and then there's
that<00:04:27.300> teal<00:04:28.070> kind<00:04:29.070> of<00:04:29.190> color<00:04:29.430> it's<00:04:29.700> kind<00:04:29.880> of

blue teal green ish color
so<00:04:34.669> it<00:04:34.759> looks<00:04:34.939> really<00:04:35.000> different<00:04:35.419> um<00:04:36.199> this<00:04:36.530> is

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
so it looks really different um this is

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.170 
so it looks really different um this is
the<00:04:36.919> baby<00:04:37.189> form<00:04:37.550> it<00:04:37.669> doesn't<00:04:37.789> look<00:04:38.000> that<00:04:38.030> scary

the baby form it doesn't look that scary

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.830 
the baby form it doesn't look that scary
but<00:04:38.810> now<00:04:39.340> as<00:04:40.340> we<00:04:40.400> level<00:04:41.150> it<00:04:41.270> I'm<00:04:41.419> pretty<00:04:41.629> sure

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
but now as we level it I'm pretty sure

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.779 
but now as we level it I'm pretty sure
it<00:04:42.020> will<00:04:42.229> be<00:04:42.530> very<00:04:42.759> scary<00:04:45.400> okay<00:04:46.400> there<00:04:46.610> we<00:04:46.759> go
