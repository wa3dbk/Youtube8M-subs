actually<00:02:49.780> planning<00:02:50.109> to<00:02:50.319> own<00:02:50.970> however<00:02:51.970> I<00:02:52.000> did

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
actually planning to own however I did

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.030 
actually planning to own however I did
love<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.510> fact<00:02:52.810> that<00:02:52.930> I<00:02:53.019> could<00:02:53.260> palm<00:02:53.680> the

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
love the fact that I could palm the

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.830 
love the fact that I could palm the
tablet<00:02:54.430> in<00:02:54.549> one<00:02:54.730> hand<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.180> perform<00:02:55.540> all<00:02:55.720> my

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
tablet in one hand and perform all my

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.720 
tablet in one hand and perform all my
functions<00:02:56.079> instead<00:02:57.010> of<00:02:57.129> merely<00:02:57.340> trying<00:02:57.669> to

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
functions instead of merely trying to

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.610 
functions instead of merely trying to
clumsily<00:02:58.329> hold<00:02:58.659> it<00:02:58.750> with<00:02:58.870> two<00:02:59.019> hands<00:02:59.290> or

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
clumsily hold it with two hands or

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.740 
clumsily hold it with two hands or
manage<00:03:00.489> to<00:03:00.639> hold<00:03:00.819> it<00:03:00.909> with<00:03:01.030> one<00:03:01.060> hand<00:03:01.239> somehow

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
manage to hold it with one hand somehow

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.170 
manage to hold it with one hand somehow
just<00:03:02.159> resting<00:03:03.159> it<00:03:03.250> on<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.459> back<00:03:03.609> of<00:03:03.790> my<00:03:03.879> hand

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
just resting it on the back of my hand

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.050 
just resting it on the back of my hand
so<00:03:04.659> that<00:03:04.689> was<00:03:04.959> definitely<00:03:05.319> a<00:03:05.379> plus<00:03:06.060> more

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
so that was definitely a plus more

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.699 
so that was definitely a plus more
