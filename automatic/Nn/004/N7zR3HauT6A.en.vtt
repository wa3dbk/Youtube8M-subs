00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.549
 to eat Japanese and one 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.170
 muffin yes but no special muffin 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.609
 but a chocolate after that I have 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.590
 Also not heard chocolate bananas 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.539
 muffin you are definitely in germany 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.340
 any premium bakeries too 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.720
 Chocolate banana on it stops 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.340
 every case very interesting 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.349
 the japanese are really crazy anyway 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.020
 so baked goods and muffins we are 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.489
 partly have the incredible 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.129
 So I'm creating folk on twitter 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.890

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.079
 post pictures of asics where are you then 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.789
 because it turned off so the yes 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.120
 situation if you unpack now 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.260
 and of course last but not least 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.469
 try is from the Japanese 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.570
 bakery with me out of town is like that 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.690
 So many cool things so consistency 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.350
 first that the muffin sees it that way 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.930
 he out and yes consistency even right 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.939
 way up a bit hard as well 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.729
 I'll love him now 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.920
 muffins are so good muffins and 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:16.020
 dear muffin so we'll see him now 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.380
 open up and that looks pretty good 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.299
 out 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.790
 and now we will watch the whole movie 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.070
 with the knife of the knife again 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.750
 look out the middle and see if 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.100
 we maybe the banana structure 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.759
 can recognize and looks very good 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.350
 like that not after Judge it so far 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.189
 My god is right because I believed 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.720
 it's really good 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.840
 I can not really talk about names 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.490
 recognize clearly chocolate things can be recognized 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.930
 yes and the thing we will open now 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.970
 try every case again 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.299
 I'm curious if I play now 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.460
 determined so violently delicious the song 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.320
 agree it is my mouth would 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.869
 kill a decay too tasty 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.909
 okay I'm very excited yes we see 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.829
 then we are back while trying again 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:04.290
 me right now with face 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:06.810
 and of course the good things here became 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.610
 shared with the knife of the fair yes 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.030
 but already seen 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.160
 we have this martin, then 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.970
 I can see you can see yes you can 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.380
 see or split in the middle and me 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.000
 I'm very curious how it tastes 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.170
 It would be a banana chocolate 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:32.650
 muffins and crutches we enjoy 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:35.140
 Okay, so okay 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:44.019
 chocolate pieces you can taste it 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:45.190
 but the banana so the banana I have 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.280
 not really tasted me now 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:52.890
 honestly say yes so it's a 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:57.100
 muffin it's a muffin sounds so good 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.290
 extremely good in consistency 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:05.620
 one does not say consistency is 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:08.170
 totally so fleeting little ear 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.000
 he flatters already now which 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.580
 simple just so consistency is very 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.680
 cool yes the taste but it is 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.440
 not so that I even like it now 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.150
 how on the skin I have to completely 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.400
 honestly say chocolate chips 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.320
 If you taste banana I will taste it 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.269
 rather less out maybe for the whole 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.110
 small touch to banal that is in there 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.430
 otherwise like normal muffin from the 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.010
 So it really is a very nice taste 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.510
 very good but not now 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.280
 bad man find but really ein 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.190
 Good muffin in quality very 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.290
 good but nothing special in the sense 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.540
 but now I expected more from 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:48.280
 that kind promise of the 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.380
 banana yes but very cool so very 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.410
 solid muffin I say you can get up 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.060
 Eat every case I knew you 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.780
 Definitely recommend but that 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.150
 in any case 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.890

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.250

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.230
 just because you grab some food 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.680

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.930
