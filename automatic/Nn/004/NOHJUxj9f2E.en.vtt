00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.820
 In a word, triple flash 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.529
 At the speed of communication speed 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.570
 Compatible with WiMAX 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.800
 The second one is dual core CPU 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.480
 It is said that the speed of the main unit is high 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.829
 I'm making a concept 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:36.590
 Finally put all the features of your mobile phone 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.410
 It works crisply 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.700
 It is called a crisp touch panel 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.410
 Taking a trademark 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.160
 Don't lose your name 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.580
 This action is against the fast finger 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.970
 To follow 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.080
 We are equipped with technology 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.960

 Compatible 13.1M backside illuminated CMOS sensor 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.330

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.640
 Also waterproof performance and one-segment Osaifu-keitai 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.170
 Japanese specifications such as infrared communication 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.670
 It corresponds to the function 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.440
 In software, it is handwriting input 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.400
 Fujitsu's unique home app 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.010
 It is equipped with it and it is comfortable there 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.470
 I am making it usable 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.210
 For example, activating a camera 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.390
 Do not search on the home screen 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.250
 At the same time as unlocking here 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.000
 There is a thing that can be done 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.619
 The rest is about handwriting input 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.100
 Character input is with touch panel 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.229
 I think there are many customers who are bothered 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:57.529
 Here in common in Japanese that "Mirai" 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.450
 Characters can be inserted easily by character input 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.970
 After all it is high-speed communication 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.010
 High speed operation 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.970
 First of all, the Geek layer 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.159
 I want to do with a variety of mobile phones after 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.050
 Various smartphones 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.010
 Is watching TV or 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.780
 I want to do something like that 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.220
 Function layer 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.760
