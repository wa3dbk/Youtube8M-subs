00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.910
 the ticket to Brazil-2014 continues in 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.950
 game for the mexican team vÃ­ctor 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.350
 Manuel Vucetich is the new helmsman and his 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.670
 commitment to take the tri afloat 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.830
 new strategist of the national team 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.260
 it does not assure that in Mexico it will arrive 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.390
 well but if you commit to do everything 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.400
 possible for this to happen for 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.020
 it focuses on calling players 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.630
 that you think are in a better moment 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.490
 such as rafael marquez or lucas lobos 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.619
 while he has others in mind 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.199
 as many as carlos vela guillermo ochoa 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.189
 to those who certainly does not promise them the 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.780
 ownership 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.850
 when we know we are in a 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.629
 uncomfortable situation a difficult situation 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.710
 but precisely that is the slogan of 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.920
 confidence to be able to 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.829
 reverse this situation and of course 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.270
 look for the pass the world cup can do in 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.449
 Direct way can be in shape 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.449
 hint 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.190
 then you can not be sure what 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.560
 we can assure that we are being what 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.720
 best 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.250
 all efforts at times we are 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.540
 depending on a single game in these 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.760
 instants 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.590
 we have a certain disadvantage because of the goals 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.570
 against more however there are full 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.680
 trust in everything the body is 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.410
 technical in the people that we are going to 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.570
 to involve who are the players for 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.110
 that we assume the same commitment with the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.110
 same seriousness 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.400
 It's totally a challenge for everyone and it 's a 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.400
 commitment to Mexican football 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.220
 It's not for me to talk about what has 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.500
 I know I have not been able to capitalize 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.230
 the opportunities had been true 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.400
 lack of control and at the end of the day that 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.000
 absence of goal is what has 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.420
 Mexican soccer 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.130
 in an uncertainty with what we are 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:59.190
 looking precisely for the elements that 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.190
 give us greater certainty of production 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:07.149
 important make up 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.750
 in the scheme I think that I do not think that 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:13.420
 today the world scheme are very few 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.010
 what you have and what you do 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.019
 you can have some variants in the 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.319
 players that in a moment are going to 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.319
 nominate 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.520
 let's make a good choice now 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:28.160
 determine the number of players that 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.640
 it is considered enough elements 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.430
 because it is necessary to observe see the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.320
 moments see the circumstances but the 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.580
 rhythm everything that in a moment we 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.300
 I can 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.340
 detect in this first observation 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.070
 so get the best conclusion too 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.320
 because we have to also contribute what 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:56.300
 better is such an important player 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:58.640
 Elimination experience is important 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.440
 no doubt more than what today 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.590
 the most important thing is to have that 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.380
 combination that they have the desire to 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.720
 participate that they have that experience and 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.910
 of course they go through a good 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.460
 moment to be able to endure what is the 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.480
 pressure the pace that today is 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.480
 implement in world football 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.510
 I think that will depend on 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.990
 exactly how is each one or what is the 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.450
 selection is for the best and yes 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:39.670
 here there is better is that there are already better 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.670
 here all are welcome 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.850
 neither is it a possibility that 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.430
 can enter for branch is an option if 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.950
 the doors are open the externado 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.720
 I can not guarantee anything to anyone in 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.060
 that sense because I have to see them how 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.780
 they are and I have to base myself on the basis 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.780
 its performance 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.510
 the plan of the 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.360
 dialogue on the part of the federation that 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:10.060
 it is at times they are the people who are 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.060
 having that work situation 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.620
 there is a base that is already good 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:23.709
 established and on that basis we are going to 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:23.709
 work for the people 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.900
 good what we ask in these 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:33.530
 moments I think that today we can not 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.650
 have stop being a have the unit 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.229
 in relation to what we need to qualify 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.840
 and I think that together we are going to do 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:45.229
 stronger if there is a break between 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.360
 hobby and the team it is clear that the 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.069
 moment can be seen diminished although 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.569
 we have to work and prepare 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:52.490
 the players for any 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:56.180
 contingency and look for the moment of 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:59.199
 Either way successfully overcome 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.199
 very bad and gras
