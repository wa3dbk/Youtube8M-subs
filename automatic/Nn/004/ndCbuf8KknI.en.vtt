going<00:02:38.300> to<00:02:38.360> get<00:02:38.450> this<00:02:45.940> there<00:02:46.940> we<00:02:47.150> go<00:02:47.269> got<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:47.720> be

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
going to get this there we go got to be

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.630 
going to get this there we go got to be
smarter<00:02:48.260> than<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.470> blender<00:02:48.799> all<00:02:49.310> right<00:02:49.489> so

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
smarter than the blender all right so

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.600 
smarter than the blender all right so
we're<00:02:49.760> gonna<00:02:49.819> get<00:02:50.090> this<00:02:50.330> turned<00:02:51.319> on<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:52.040> blend

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
we're gonna get this turned on and blend

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.300 
we're gonna get this turned on and blend
it<00:02:52.849> up<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.440> like<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:54.560> said<00:02:54.620> you<00:02:54.830> might<00:02:54.950> have<00:02:55.129> to

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
it up and like I said you might have to

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.949 
it up and like I said you might have to
stop<00:02:55.549> it<00:02:55.730> a<00:02:55.819> couple<00:02:56.030> times<00:02:56.299> use<00:02:56.599> your<00:02:56.750> spatula

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
stop it a couple times use your spatula

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.750 
stop it a couple times use your spatula
to<00:02:57.379> kind<00:02:57.410> of<00:02:57.650> mix<00:02:57.860> it<00:02:57.980> down<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:58.400> make<00:02:58.489> sure<00:02:58.519> it

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
to kind of mix it down and make sure it

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.150 
to kind of mix it down and make sure it
gets<00:02:58.879> all<00:02:59.150> mixed<00:02:59.360> up<00:02:59.690> so<00:03:00.500> after<00:03:01.010> you're<00:03:01.129> done
