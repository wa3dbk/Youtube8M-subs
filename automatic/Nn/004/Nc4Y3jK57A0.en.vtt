people don't blame him quite so well

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.799 
people don't blame him quite so well
because<00:00:32.369> he's<00:00:32.700> not<00:00:32.820> really<00:00:32.940> not<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.390> easy<00:00:33.630> to

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
because he's not really not that easy to

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.819 
because he's not really not that easy to
start<00:00:33.989> off<00:00:34.200> with<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.890> few<00:00:35.790> tips<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.829> would

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
start off with a few tips I would

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.680 
start off with a few tips I would
recommend<00:00:38.070> starting<00:00:38.610> off<00:00:38.940> with<00:00:39.210> Dorrans

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
recommend starting off with Dorrans

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.290 
recommend starting off with Dorrans
blade<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.610> getting<00:00:41.610> yourself<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.030> lot<00:00:42.210> of

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
blade and getting yourself a lot of

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.380 
blade and getting yourself a lot of
attack<00:00:42.600> damage<00:00:42.840> runes<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.760> makes<00:00:45.300> it

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
attack damage runes so it makes it

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.660 
attack damage runes so it makes it
easier<00:00:45.690> for<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.020> fight<00:00:46.320> people<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.980> well

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
easier for you to fight people and well

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.340 
easier for you to fight people and well
really<00:00:48.360> it's<00:00:48.480> mainly<00:00:48.660> for<00:00:48.899> last<00:00:49.110> hitting

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
really it's mainly for last hitting

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.380 
really it's mainly for last hitting
minions<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.920> would<00:00:50.489> recommend<00:00:50.760> starting<00:00:51.120> off

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
minions I would recommend starting off

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.900 
minions I would recommend starting off
with<00:00:51.629> about<00:00:51.840> 15<00:00:52.440> attack<00:00:52.739> damage<00:00:52.920> some<00:00:53.640> attack

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
with about 15 attack damage some attack

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
with about 15 attack damage some attack
speed<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:56.120> maybe<00:00:57.120> some<00:00:57.510> movement<00:00:57.780> speed

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
speed and maybe some movement speed

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.450 
speed and maybe some movement speed
honestly<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.649> think<00:00:58.739> right<00:00:59.129> here<00:00:59.190> i'm<00:00:59.430> using

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
honestly I think right here i'm using

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.970 
honestly I think right here i'm using
about<00:00:59.940> eight<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.510> half<00:01:00.570> attack<00:01:00.960> damage<00:01:01.170> six

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
about eight and a half attack damage six

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.160 
about eight and a half attack damage six
percent<00:01:02.280> crit<00:01:02.520> chance<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.120> some<00:01:03.899> movement

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
percent crit chance and some movement

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.850 
percent crit chance and some movement
speed<00:01:04.320> an<00:01:04.470> attack<00:01:04.739> speed<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:06.630> yeah<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.710> right

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
speed an attack speed so yeah and right

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.750 
speed an attack speed so yeah and right

damage<00:03:44.830> and<00:03:46.020> usually<00:03:47.020> like<00:03:47.050> to<00:03:47.290> use<00:03:47.590> it<00:03:47.770> when

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
damage and usually like to use it when

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.430 
damage and usually like to use it when
they're<00:03:48.010> all<00:03:48.190> clustered<00:03:48.670> up<00:03:48.820> right<00:03:49.660> here<00:03:49.930> this

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
they're all clustered up right here this

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.290 
they're all clustered up right here this
game<00:03:50.680> I<00:03:50.710> decided<00:03:51.340> to<00:03:51.460> rush<00:03:51.610> a<00:03:51.640> black<00:03:51.970> cleaver

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300

game I decided to rush a black cleaver
for<00:03:52.450> early<00:03:52.900> game<00:03:53.080> damage<00:03:53.560> and<00:03:53.890> it<00:03:54.100> works<00:03:54.250> out

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.460 
for early game damage and it works out

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.790 
for early game damage and it works out
perfectly<00:03:54.850> fine<00:03:55.260> usually<00:03:56.260> I'd<00:03:56.410> Russian

perfectly fine usually I'd Russian

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.940 
perfectly fine usually I'd Russian
infinity<00:03:57.220> edge<00:03:58.200> but<00:03:59.200> I<00:03:59.230> like<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.710> Black

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
infinity edge but I like the Black

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.380 
infinity edge but I like the Black
Cleaver<00:04:00.220> because<00:04:00.400> you<00:04:00.700> get<00:04:00.790> some<00:04:01.000> early<00:04:01.150> game

usually I i would say recommend getting

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.190 
usually I i would say recommend getting
infinity<00:04:12.160> edge<00:04:12.280> first<00:04:12.640> but<00:04:13.030> a<00:04:13.060> lot<00:04:13.510> of<00:04:13.540> a<00:04:13.870> lot

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
infinity edge first but a lot of a lot

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.990 
infinity edge first but a lot of a lot
of<00:04:14.290> people<00:04:14.500> saw<00:04:14.650> the<00:04:14.709> pros<00:04:15.040> bill<00:04:15.310> trini<00:04:15.670> forest

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000

first and then the built the

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.530 
first and then the built the
bloodthirster<00:04:17.799> and<00:04:17.980> that<00:04:18.580> only<00:04:18.880> works<00:04:19.299> if<00:04:19.510> you

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540

mean I don't get it this game because
there<00:04:39.370> was<00:04:39.490> no<00:04:39.580> need<00:04:39.610> to<00:04:40.000> because<00:04:40.300> I<00:04:40.450> was

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
there was no need to because I was

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.930 
there was no need to because I was
already<00:04:40.720> faced<00:04:41.080> rolling<00:04:41.440> them<00:04:41.590> but<00:04:42.250> usually

know what I'm doing with Israel so I
that's<00:05:25.530> why<00:05:25.740> I'm<00:05:25.889> doing<00:05:25.919> this<00:05:26.160> was<00:05:26.550> more<00:05:26.699> of<00:05:26.759> an

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
that's why I'm doing this was more of an

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.240 
that's why I'm doing this was more of an
experiment<00:05:27.389> just<00:05:27.539> to<00:05:27.660> try<00:05:27.930> it<00:05:27.960> out<00:05:28.229> and<00:05:28.590> it

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
experiment just to try it out and it

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.890 
experiment just to try it out and it
works<00:05:29.430> out<00:05:29.580> phenomenal<00:05:30.120> I<00:05:30.389> wouldn't

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
works out phenomenal I wouldn't

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.240 
works out phenomenal I wouldn't
recommend<00:05:31.169> doing<00:05:31.350> this<00:05:31.590> unless<00:05:31.889> you<00:05:31.979> really

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
recommend doing this unless you really

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.439 
recommend doing this unless you really
know<00:05:32.340> what<00:05:32.460> you're<00:05:32.639> doing<00:05:32.940> if<00:05:33.060> you<00:05:33.150> play<00:05:33.300> ad
