in the warm-up and then worked up

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.180 
in the warm-up and then worked up
heavier<00:00:50.329> but<00:00:51.199> I<00:00:51.230> found<00:00:51.530> what<00:00:51.770> most<00:00:51.920> of<00:00:52.070> these

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
heavier but I found what most of these

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.270 
heavier but I found what most of these
guys<00:00:52.460> is<00:00:53.020> they<00:00:54.020> need<00:00:54.199> quite<00:00:54.530> a<00:00:54.559> bit<00:00:54.649> of<00:00:54.829> warm<00:00:55.100> up

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
guys is they need quite a bit of warm up

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.060 
guys is they need quite a bit of warm up
in<00:00:56.239> order<00:00:56.690> to<00:00:56.870> get<00:00:57.019> their<00:00:57.170> body<00:00:57.379> ready<00:00:57.739> for<00:00:58.010> the

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
in order to get their body ready for the

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.340 
in order to get their body ready for the
big<00:00:58.250> weight<00:00:58.460> so<00:00:58.850> doing<00:00:59.059> some<00:00:59.780> of<00:00:59.870> the<00:00:59.930> dynamic

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
big weight so doing some of the dynamic

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.810 
big weight so doing some of the dynamic
effort<00:01:00.680> work<00:01:00.829> first<00:01:02.469> has<00:01:03.469> has<00:01:04.100> been<00:01:04.550> pretty

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
effort work first has has been pretty

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.350 
effort work first has has been pretty
beneficial<00:01:05.080> on<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.289> other<00:01:06.410> hand<00:01:06.500> doing<00:01:07.490> some

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
beneficial on the other hand doing some

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.650 
beneficial on the other hand doing some
of<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:08.979> doing<00:01:09.979> max<00:01:10.250> effort<00:01:10.520> work<00:01:10.820> first<00:01:11.210> puts

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
of the doing max effort work first puts

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.900 
of the doing max effort work first puts
them<00:01:11.780> in<00:01:11.899> a<00:01:11.960> fatigue<00:01:12.320> state<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:13.039> then<00:01:13.670> I<00:01:13.759> can

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
them in a fatigue state and then I can

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.700 
them in a fatigue state and then I can
drill<00:01:14.240> them<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:15.200> have<00:01:15.350> them<00:01:15.380> go<00:01:15.679> through

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
drill them and have them go through

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.400 
drill them and have them go through
their<00:01:16.039> dynamic<00:01:16.490> effort<00:01:16.789> work<00:01:16.940> fast<00:01:17.300> one<00:01:18.200> guy

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
their dynamic effort work fast one guy

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.620 
their dynamic effort work fast one guy
after<00:01:18.619> another<00:01:18.890> trying<00:01:19.850> to<00:01:19.970> never<00:01:20.149> really

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
after another trying to never really

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.280 
after another trying to never really
leave<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:20.930> bar<00:01:21.460> empty<00:01:22.460> and<00:01:22.990> that<00:01:23.990> has<00:01:24.140> been

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
leave the bar empty and that has been

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.109 
leave the bar empty and that has been
effective<00:01:24.770> as<00:01:24.890> well<00:01:25.130> because<00:01:25.520> now<00:01:25.790> they're<00:01:26.000> in

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
effective as well because now they're in

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.120 
effective as well because now they're in
their<00:01:26.630> training<00:01:26.900> in<00:01:27.079> a<00:01:27.140> fatigue<00:01:27.470> state<00:01:27.829> and

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
their training in a fatigue state and

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.069 
their training in a fatigue state and
that's<00:01:28.729> exactly<00:01:28.939> what<00:01:29.420> crossfitters<00:01:29.960> are

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
that's exactly what crossfitters are

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.190 
that's exactly what crossfitters are
after<00:01:30.409> in<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:30.560> first<00:01:30.770> place<00:01:31.930> many<00:01:32.930> of<00:01:33.079> the

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
after in the first place many of the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.840 
after in the first place many of the
Watts<00:01:33.470> they<00:01:33.829> do<00:01:33.890> in<00:01:34.130> many<00:01:34.280> different<00:01:34.579> things

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
Watts they do in many different things

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.179 
Watts they do in many different things

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
pre fatigue state so whether you're

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.330 
pre fatigue state so whether you're
doing<00:01:39.979> crossfit<00:01:40.670> or<00:01:40.759> playing<00:01:41.030> football<00:01:41.509> or

basketball or whatever I would recommend

basketball or whatever I would recommend
both<00:01:46.610> styles<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.240> be<00:01:47.390> very<00:01:47.869> effective<00:01:48.340> but<00:01:49.340> the

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
both styles to be very effective but the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.639 
both styles to be very effective but the
latter<00:01:49.700> one<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.659> max<00:01:50.869> effort<00:01:51.079> work<00:01:51.350> first

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
latter one the max effort work first

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.899 
latter one the max effort work first
followed<00:01:52.070> by<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:52.219> dynamic<00:01:52.399> work<00:01:53.469> seems<00:01:54.469> to<00:01:54.649> be

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
followed by the dynamic work seems to be

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.690 
followed by the dynamic work seems to be
maybe<00:01:55.909> even<00:01:56.240> a<00:01:56.509> little<00:01:56.570> bit<00:01:56.840> more<00:01:57.710> well<00:01:58.159> suited

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
maybe even a little bit more well suited

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.609 
maybe even a little bit more well suited
for<00:01:58.869> those<00:01:59.869> that<00:02:00.170> need<00:02:00.520> more<00:02:01.520> conditioning<00:02:02.619> be

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
for those that need more conditioning be

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:04.899 
for those that need more conditioning be
hard<00:02:03.860> to<00:02:03.979> try<00:02:04.130> to<00:02:04.159> concentrate<00:02:04.640> on

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
hard to try to concentrate on

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.209 
hard to try to concentrate on
conditioning<00:02:05.600> before<00:02:05.930> you<00:02:06.049> go<00:02:06.170> heavy<00:02:06.409> will<00:02:07.130> be

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
conditioning before you go heavy will be

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:08.859 
conditioning before you go heavy will be
easier<00:02:07.640> to<00:02:07.729> concentrate<00:02:07.939> on<00:02:08.360> conditioning

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
easier to concentrate on conditioning

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.620 
easier to concentrate on conditioning
after<00:02:09.380> you<00:02:09.440> go<00:02:09.590> heavy<00:02:09.799> go<00:02:10.700> have<00:02:10.910> you<00:02:11.000> first<00:02:11.269> put

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
after you go heavy go have you first put

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.349 
after you go heavy go have you first put
as<00:02:11.720> much<00:02:11.840> as<00:02:11.989> you<00:02:12.110> can<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.500> that<00:02:12.709> get<00:02:13.489> a<00:02:13.519> 300<00:02:14.090> 400

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:14.359 
as much as you can to that get a 300 400

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:16.000 
as much as you can to that get a 300 400
pound<00:02:14.690> squat<00:02:14.959> whatever<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:15.470> may<00:02:15.590> be<00:02:15.620> for<00:02:15.950> the

the<00:04:25.520> Olympic<00:04:25.910> lifting<00:04:26.270> like<00:04:26.510> for<00:04:26.870> example

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
the Olympic lifting like for example

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.520 
the Olympic lifting like for example
rich<00:04:27.470> Froning<00:04:28.010> is<00:04:28.780> extremely<00:04:29.780> efficient<00:04:30.380> on

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
rich Froning is extremely efficient on

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.700 
rich Froning is extremely efficient on
many<00:04:31.130> of<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.340> movements<00:04:31.850> and<00:04:32.530> therefore<00:04:33.530> he's

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
many of the movements and therefore he's

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.300 
many of the movements and therefore he's
able<00:04:33.890> to<00:04:34.040> plow<00:04:34.430> through<00:04:34.460> them<00:04:36.100> much<00:04:37.100> more

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
able to plow through them much more

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.380 
able to plow through them much more
efficiently<00:04:37.850> than<00:04:38.090> than<00:04:38.450> most<00:04:40.090> now<00:04:41.090> we<00:04:41.150> got

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
efficiently than than most now we got

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.600 
efficiently than than most now we got
these<00:04:41.570> guys<00:04:41.750> moving<00:04:42.050> into<00:04:42.350> a<00:04:42.380> band<00:04:42.740> deadlift

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
these guys moving into a band deadlift

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.150 
these guys moving into a band deadlift
and<00:04:43.910> you<00:04:44.600> can<00:04:44.720> see<00:04:44.900> we<00:04:45.020> got<00:04:45.200> the<00:04:45.380> the<00:04:45.770> barbell

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
and you can see we got the the barbell

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.190 
and you can see we got the the barbell
raised<00:04:46.400> off<00:04:46.610> the<00:04:46.640> floor<00:04:46.820> a<00:04:47.090> little<00:04:47.240> bit<00:04:47.510> what

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
raised off the floor a little bit what

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.250 
raised off the floor a little bit what
I've<00:04:48.320> noticed<00:04:48.560> with<00:04:48.860> these<00:04:49.160> guys<00:04:50.260> they're

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
I've noticed with these guys they're

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.850 
I've noticed with these guys they're
thin<00:04:51.650> they're<00:04:52.250> athletic<00:04:52.730> and<00:04:53.410> if<00:04:54.410> we<00:04:54.710> do

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
thin they're athletic and if we do

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.680 
thin they're athletic and if we do
deficit<00:04:55.400> deadlifts<00:04:55.970> they<00:04:56.090> actually<00:04:56.450> lift

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
deficit deadlifts they actually lift

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.620 
deficit deadlifts they actually lift
more<00:04:57.110> or<00:04:57.410> the<00:04:57.440> same<00:04:57.560> as<00:04:58.100> they<00:04:59.090> would<00:04:59.300> off<00:04:59.480> the

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
more or the same as they would off the

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.900 
more or the same as they would off the
floor<00:04:59.930> and<00:05:00.170> that's<00:05:01.100> because<00:05:01.430> it's<00:05:01.610> teaching

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
floor and that's because it's teaching

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.380 
floor and that's because it's teaching
them<00:05:03.010> somewhat<00:05:04.010> of<00:05:04.130> an<00:05:04.220> artificial<00:05:04.730> tightness

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
them somewhat of an artificial tightness

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.470 
them somewhat of an artificial tightness
and<00:05:06.310> here<00:05:07.310> we<00:05:07.460> were<00:05:07.550> taking<00:05:07.880> all<00:05:08.060> tightness

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
and here we were taking all tightness

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.290 
and here we were taking all tightness
away<00:05:08.810> by<00:05:09.710> having<00:05:10.010> the<00:05:10.100> bar<00:05:10.280> raised<00:05:10.640> up<00:05:10.910> off<00:05:11.090> the

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
away by having the bar raised up off the

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.850 
away by having the bar raised up off the
floor<00:05:11.450> most<00:05:11.900> of<00:05:12.020> these<00:05:12.080> guys<00:05:12.290> hate<00:05:12.650> this

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
floor most of these guys hate this

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.159 
floor most of these guys hate this
movement<00:05:13.130> more<00:05:13.550> so<00:05:15.640> than<00:05:16.640> then<00:05:17.360> full<00:05:17.930> range

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
movement more so than then full range

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.010 
movement more so than then full range
and<00:05:18.470> more<00:05:18.650> so<00:05:18.830> than<00:05:19.010> deficit<00:05:19.490> pulls<00:05:19.810> so<00:05:20.810> we

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
and more so than deficit pulls so we

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.450 
and more so than deficit pulls so we
boost<00:05:21.290> the<00:05:21.440> weight<00:05:21.620> up<00:05:21.830> a<00:05:21.919> little<00:05:22.130> bit<00:05:22.280> and

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
boost the weight up a little bit and

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.780 
boost the weight up a little bit and
they<00:05:22.610> actually<00:05:22.790> tend<00:05:23.210> to<00:05:23.330> lift<00:05:23.540> less<00:05:24.640> but<00:05:25.640> what

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
they actually tend to lift less but what

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.640 
they actually tend to lift less but what
we're<00:05:25.940> after<00:05:26.120> here<00:05:26.510> is<00:05:26.660> to<00:05:27.169> find<00:05:27.380> the<00:05:27.500> weak

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
we're after here is to find the weak

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.360 
we're after here is to find the weak
points<00:05:28.070> and<00:05:28.130> attack<00:05:28.490> them<00:05:29.590> we<00:05:30.590> also<00:05:30.800> do<00:05:31.100> rak

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
points and attack them we also do rak

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.130 
points and attack them we also do rak
deadlift<00:05:31.910> sometimes<00:05:32.360> where<00:05:32.660> the<00:05:32.780> where<00:05:33.110> the

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
deadlift sometimes where the where the

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.140 
deadlift sometimes where the where the
weights<00:05:33.860> are<00:05:34.040> up<00:05:34.160> with<00:05:34.310> even<00:05:34.550> higher<00:05:34.580> closer

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
weights are up with even higher closer

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.590 
weights are up with even higher closer
to<00:05:35.419> the<00:05:35.540> knee<00:05:35.800> and<00:05:36.850> I<00:05:37.850> actually<00:05:38.060> have<00:05:38.419> an

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
to the knee and I actually have an

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.600 
to the knee and I actually have an
invention<00:05:38.960> that<00:05:39.380> you<00:05:39.800> guys<00:05:40.010> are<00:05:40.190> going<00:05:40.310> to<00:05:40.370> see

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
invention that you guys are going to see

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:47.020 
invention that you guys are going to see
in<00:05:41.800> about<00:05:43.720> three<00:05:44.720> weeks<00:05:45.490> let's<00:05:46.490> see<00:05:46.669> in<00:05:46.790> about

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
in about three weeks let's see in about

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.970 
in about three weeks let's see in about
three<00:05:47.360> weeks<00:05:47.390> it's<00:05:47.810> just<00:05:48.020> a<00:05:48.110> prototype<00:05:48.380> so<00:05:48.860> who

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980 
three weeks it's just a prototype so who

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.780 
three weeks it's just a prototype so who
the<00:05:49.070> hell<00:05:49.160> knows<00:05:49.340> will<00:05:49.669> look<00:05:49.850> like<00:05:50.500> but<00:05:51.790> it'll

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
the hell knows will look like but it'll

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.730 
the hell knows will look like but it'll
help<00:05:52.940> solve<00:05:53.360> some<00:05:53.540> of<00:05:53.750> the<00:05:53.870> mumbo<00:05:54.200> jumbo<00:05:54.620> of

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
help solve some of the mumbo jumbo of

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.330 
help solve some of the mumbo jumbo of
trying<00:05:55.070> to<00:05:55.570> have<00:05:56.570> weird<00:05:57.020> boxes<00:05:57.800> to<00:05:57.950> deadlift

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
trying to have weird boxes to deadlift

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.510 
trying to have weird boxes to deadlift
off<00:05:58.580> of<00:05:58.850> and<00:05:59.060> different<00:05:59.450> mats<00:05:59.690> and<00:06:00.220> so<00:06:01.220> on<00:06:01.370> and

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
off of and different mats and so on and

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.590 
off of and different mats and so on and
so<00:06:01.580> forth

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.420 

you<00:06:06.140> can<00:06:06.260> see<00:06:06.410> here<00:06:06.590> they're<00:06:06.710> doing<00:06:06.950> triples

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
you can see here they're doing triples

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.600 
you can see here they're doing triples
it<00:06:07.820> is<00:06:08.030> very<00:06:08.180> common<00:06:08.750> very<00:06:09.040> common<00:06:10.040> for<00:06:10.430> me<00:06:10.520> to

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
it is very common very common for me to

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.820 
it is very common very common for me to
have<00:06:10.760> these<00:06:10.910> guys<00:06:11.090> doing<00:06:11.630> the<00:06:11.840> sets<00:06:12.440> of<00:06:12.560> two's

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
have these guys doing the sets of two's

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.910 
have these guys doing the sets of two's
that's<00:06:13.310> a<00:06:13.400> three<00:06:13.760> sets<00:06:14.120> of<00:06:14.240> five<00:06:14.710> we<00:06:15.710> do

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:15.920 
that's a three sets of five we do

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.290 
that's a three sets of five we do
singles<00:06:16.460> quite<00:06:17.210> a<00:06:17.240> bit<00:06:17.450> as<00:06:17.540> well<00:06:18.520> but<00:06:19.520> in<00:06:20.210> my

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
singles quite a bit as well but in my

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.270 
singles quite a bit as well but in my
opinion<00:06:20.630> it's<00:06:21.350> important<00:06:21.980> to<00:06:22.070> have<00:06:22.100> these

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
opinion it's important to have these

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.740 
opinion it's important to have these
guys<00:06:22.520> really<00:06:22.880> get<00:06:23.600> that<00:06:23.750> work<00:06:24.080> capacity<00:06:24.350> down

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
guys really get that work capacity down

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.820 
guys really get that work capacity down
after<00:06:26.750> they<00:06:26.870> obtain<00:06:27.230> that<00:06:27.410> work<00:06:27.620> capacity

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
after they obtain that work capacity

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.270 
after they obtain that work capacity
after<00:06:28.580> they<00:06:28.700> built<00:06:28.970> a<00:06:29.120> certain<00:06:29.450> work<00:06:29.600> capacity

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 
after they built a certain work capacity

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.780 
after they built a certain work capacity
I<00:06:31.690> believe<00:06:32.690> it's<00:06:32.870> a<00:06:32.930> little<00:06:33.110> bit<00:06:33.310> safer<00:06:34.310> and

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:34.790 
I believe it's a little bit safer and

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.880 
I believe it's a little bit safer and
more<00:06:34.970> beneficial<00:06:35.660> for<00:06:36.230> them<00:06:36.320> to<00:06:36.470> start<00:06:36.680> moving

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:36.890 
more beneficial for them to start moving

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.130 
more beneficial for them to start moving
into<00:06:37.340> triples<00:06:37.820> and<00:06:38.000> singles<00:06:38.420> and<00:06:38.780> things<00:06:39.020> like
