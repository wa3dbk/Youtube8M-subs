00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
the stadium that sought a penalty but

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:42.010 
the stadium that sought a penalty but
the<00:00:34.440> referee<00:00:34.620> was<00:00:35.160> very<00:00:35.760> close<00:00:36.059> with<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.570> see

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.709 

you<00:00:43.020> know<00:00:43.140> these<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.879> after<00:00:44.879> before<00:00:45.090> we

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
you know these that after before we

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.190 
you know these that after before we
should<00:00:45.899> lose<00:00:46.110> one<00:00:46.410> game<00:00:47.300> but<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.809> desert

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
should lose one game but the desert

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.639 
should lose one game but the desert
after<00:00:49.379> fast<00:00:49.829> as<00:00:50.039> i<00:00:50.340> to-to<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:51.210> great<00:00:51.390> day<00:00:51.660> we

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
after fast as i to-to the great day we

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.260 
after fast as i to-to the great day we
can<00:00:52.800> win<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.070> game<00:00:53.430> because<00:00:53.640> we<00:00:53.879> play<00:00:54.030> very

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
can win this game because we play very

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.160 
can win this game because we play very
very<00:00:54.480> well<00:00:54.629> because<00:00:56.210> personal<00:00:57.210> savings

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
very well because personal savings

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.889 
very well because personal savings
account<00:00:58.789> acknowledgement<00:00:59.789> way<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.690> save<00:01:00.870> a

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
account acknowledgement way to save a

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.690 
account acknowledgement way to save a
profit<00:01:01.289> on<00:01:02.090> this<00:01:03.090> time

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:27.390 

because<00:01:07.360> a<00:01:07.390> rain<00:01:08.350> a<00:01:08.380> lot<00:01:16.979> one<00:01:17.979> second

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.910 

I<00:01:28.400> think<00:01:29.180> that<00:01:29.300> we<00:01:29.570> dominate<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.110> game<00:01:30.290> is<00:01:30.620> it

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
I think that we dominate the game is it

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.070 
I think that we dominate the game is it
usually<00:01:31.400> that<00:01:31.790> one<00:01:32.090> thing<00:01:32.360> come<00:01:32.690> here<00:01:32.870> and

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
usually that one thing come here and

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.050 
usually that one thing come here and
play<00:01:33.230> against<00:01:33.620> jets<00:01:33.920> jets<00:01:34.190> is<00:01:34.340> a<00:01:34.370> top<00:01:34.610> team<00:01:34.820> and

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
play against jets jets is a top team and

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.120 
play against jets jets is a top team and
play<00:01:35.750> like<00:01:35.990> this<00:01:36.230> and<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.560> first<00:01:36.800> half<00:01:36.980> we

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
play like this and the first half we

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.220 
play like this and the first half we
donate<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.550> game<00:01:37.730> if<00:01:38.390> there<00:01:38.540> is<00:01:38.660> one<00:01:38.900> referee

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
donate the game if there is one referee

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.770 
donate the game if there is one referee
when<00:01:39.710> one<00:01:40.100> team<00:01:40.310> play<00:01:40.490> very<00:01:40.700> well<00:01:40.790> as<00:01:41.270> a<00:01:41.330> chance

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
when one team play very well as a chance

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.330 
when one team play very well as a chance
to<00:01:41.900> score<00:01:42.050> another<00:01:42.140> goal<00:01:42.320> there<00:01:42.770> is<00:01:42.830> a<00:01:42.860> big

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
to score another goal there is a big

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.490 
to score another goal there is a big
penalty<00:01:43.610> you<00:01:44.570> should<00:01:44.780> consider<00:01:47.140> all<00:01:48.140> it<00:01:48.380> is

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
penalty you should consider all it is

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.130 
penalty you should consider all it is
after<00:01:49.070> we<00:01:49.190> can<00:01:49.370> lose<00:01:49.550> we<00:01:49.910> can<00:01:50.060> win<00:01:50.450> this<00:01:50.660> don't

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
after we can lose we can win this don't

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.540 
after we can lose we can win this don't
change<00:01:51.380> because<00:01:51.830> when<00:01:52.100> you<00:01:52.190> play<00:01:52.370> against

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
change because when you play against

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.040 
change because when you play against
gesture<00:01:52.790> you<00:01:52.880> can<00:01:53.060> lose<00:01:53.210> because<00:01:53.450> jetty<00:01:53.780> is<00:01:53.960> a

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
gesture you can lose because jetty is a

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:01.210 
gesture you can lose because jetty is a
true<00:01:54.170> team<00:01:54.820> not<00:01:55.820> like<00:01:55.940> this<00:01:59.680> we<00:02:00.680> surprised<00:02:01.040> by

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
true team not like this we surprised by

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.800 
true team not like this we surprised by
how<00:02:01.340> to<00:02:01.400> factor<00:02:02.200> october<00:02:03.400> i<00:02:04.570> think<00:02:05.570> that<00:02:05.690> in

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
how to factor october i think that in

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.370 
how to factor october i think that in
this<00:02:05.900> moment<00:02:06.140> maybe<00:02:06.440> chats<00:02:06.830> a<00:02:08.110> play<00:02:09.110> like<00:02:09.320> this

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
this moment maybe chats a play like this

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.160 
this moment maybe chats a play like this
because<00:02:09.830> we<00:02:10.070> want<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.690> play<00:02:11.690> contra<00:02:12.200> tack<00:02:12.410> a

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
because we want to play contra tack a

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.449 
because we want to play contra tack a
warmer<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.290> last<00:02:15.470> four<00:02:15.740> games<00:02:15.950> i<00:02:16.160> think<00:02:16.370> that

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
warmer the last four games i think that

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:23.940 
warmer the last four games i think that
is<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.640> good<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:18.530> decision

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.210 

to<00:02:24.950> allow<00:02:25.190> just<00:02:25.490> balance<00:02:25.970> today<00:02:27.040> no<00:02:28.040> I<00:02:28.069> think

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
to allow just balance today no I think

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.540 
to allow just balance today no I think
that<00:02:28.550> only<00:02:29.260> that<00:02:30.260> we<00:02:30.440> didn't<00:02:30.709> score<00:02:30.950> another

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
that only that we didn't score another

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.190 
that only that we didn't score another
goes<00:02:31.880> in<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.120> first<00:02:32.360> start<00:02:32.540> when<00:02:32.900> we<00:02:33.080> had<00:02:33.170> the

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
goes in the first start when we had the

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.920 
goes in the first start when we had the
chance<00:02:33.290> with<00:02:33.770> a<00:02:33.830> Garrow<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.920> penalty<00:02:37.610> I<00:02:38.570> think

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
chance with a Garrow the penalty I think

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.150 
chance with a Garrow the penalty I think
that<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.170> game<00:02:39.320> is<00:02:39.440> was<00:02:39.620> changed<00:02:40.040> after

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
that the game is was changed after

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.940 
that the game is was changed after
sending<00:02:40.820> off<00:02:41.150> this<00:02:41.420> after<00:02:42.380> was<00:02:42.560> really

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
sending off this after was really

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.990 
sending off this after was really
difficult<00:02:43.130> is<00:02:43.610> not<00:02:43.790> easy<00:02:44.500> but<00:02:45.500> also<00:02:46.190> these<00:02:46.520> you

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
difficult is not easy but also these you

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:58.660 
difficult is not easy but also these you
consider<00:02:47.480> maybe<00:02:47.660> 2-3<00:02:48.200> chance<00:02:57.459> don't<00:02:58.459> change

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
consider maybe 2-3 chance don't change

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.370 
consider maybe 2-3 chance don't change
nothing<00:02:59.150> for<00:02:59.330> us<00:02:59.360> because<00:02:59.810> we<00:03:00.200> know<00:03:00.350> that

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
nothing for us because we know that

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.430 
nothing for us because we know that
after<00:03:01.070> before<00:03:01.430> we<00:03:01.640> should<00:03:01.790> lose<00:03:02.000> one<00:03:02.239> game

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
after before we should lose one game

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.479 
after before we should lose one game
because<00:03:03.440> today<00:03:03.769> but<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:06.680> season<00:03:07.010> is<00:03:07.130> very

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
because today but the season is very

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.440
