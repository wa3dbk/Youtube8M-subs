00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.700
 us and I'm going to show you the content of 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.860
 this edition is my first one boxing 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.189
 I'm behind the camera so it's a 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.170
 little weird but good good we open the 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.850
 box 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.860
 this is the edition 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.780
 As you can see, it's not a normal box of 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.700
 Playstation3 is like a kit 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.120
 survival 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:36.150
 and we are going to proceed to show you the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.640
 Content will teach what it takes to 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.920
 lesson edition then also tell you 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.920
 that what there is the edition 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.629
 that's why what the edition said 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.350
 but good that already the same but with the 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.290
 image of him and for example on vinyl 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.559
 and in the poster that I will now show you what 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.330
 first of all the game this is the 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.070
 game and most importantly because it's something 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.530
 what are you going to play 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.470
 As you can see, it 's a cardboard box 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.120
 pretty 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.480
 that you open it, I will not teach you the 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.290
 code because you are leaving 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.290
 the game 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.740
 the instructions and behind there is then the 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.710
 obviously online pass 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.750
 as you see 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.800
 you have to work and put the instruction 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.700
 and cut face self 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.310
 well that and the downloadable content that 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.540

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.500

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.750

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.410
 very important a piece of band 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.410
