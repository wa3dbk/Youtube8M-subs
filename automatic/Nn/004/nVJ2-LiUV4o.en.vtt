lost four to two because that was the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.359 
lost four to two because that was the
that<00:01:28.470> was<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.680> question<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
that was the question of the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.010 
that was the question of the
controversial<00:01:30.090> point<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.540> don't<00:01:30.840> read

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
controversial point I don't read

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.190 
controversial point I don't read
someplace<00:01:31.640> about<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.630> think<00:01:33.780> both<00:01:34.170> of

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
someplace about that so I think both of

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.440 
someplace about that so I think both of
them<00:01:34.439> have<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> confidence<00:01:35.400> in<00:01:35.549> both<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:36.000> them<00:01:36.119> I

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
them have a confidence in both of them I

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.060 
them have a confidence in both of them I
have<00:01:36.890> respect<00:01:37.890> for<00:01:38.009> each<00:01:38.759> other<00:01:39.000> so

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
have respect for each other so

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.920 
have respect for each other so
I<00:01:40.100> look<00:01:40.370> forward<00:01:40.610> may<00:01:41.060> not<00:01:41.210> be<00:01:41.390> a<00:01:41.420> high-scoring

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
I look forward may not be a high-scoring

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.290 
I look forward may not be a high-scoring
match<00:01:42.170> I<00:01:42.350> think<00:01:42.530> we<00:01:42.590> might<00:01:42.740> see<00:01:42.770> a<00:01:42.920> lot<00:01:43.130> of

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
match I think we might see a lot of

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.340 
match I think we might see a lot of
countering<00:01:44.300> and<00:01:44.570> you<00:01:44.930> know<00:01:45.050> because<00:01:45.260> these

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
countering and you know because these

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.840 
countering and you know because these
are<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.590> quality<00:01:46.070> efforts<00:01:46.190> and<00:01:46.610> it's<00:01:46.730> not

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
are the quality efforts and it's not
