00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.809
 welcome to the information of 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.549
 weather forecast as every occasion 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.740
 It's a pleasure to greet you and give you 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.600
 all the meteorological details home 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.400
 week and we're going quickly to the 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.230
 satellite image after this end 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.029
 of the last week the conditions of 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.830
 instability were present for 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.050
 different sectors of the national northeast 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.939
 apparently stability returns me 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.859
 I mean that the high pressures are 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.990
 little by little getting stronger 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.999
 to dominate even already the northwest area 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.590
 the northern part of the country or is it a matter 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:35.540
 only time for them to achieve 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.820
 also be placed towards the area of 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.680
 Mexican northeast and in this way cause 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.199
 a major change in the landscape yet 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.120
 there is a system of low pressure towards 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.829
 the southeastern part of the state of texas 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.500
 associated with a trough the height also 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.570
 that keeps you extensive and achieves even 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.399
 encompass the part of tamaulipas towards 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.170
 south of the state reaches towards the 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.640
 western and in this way auspicious 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.170
 light rain with thunderstorms 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.660
 in the center and in the south of the 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.039
 country the conditions of precipitation 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.809
 continue but attention is already a matter 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.300
 of the next few days so maybe 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.790
 we can say goodbye or at least 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.260
 hope that a couple of 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.080
 days since the rains have not stopped 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.910
 in the important recent season 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.740
 branch of the next 48 hours in 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.210
 as to the image of the rain towards the 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.890
 behavior of them from 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.410
 will be directing at least all this 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.420
 zone instability present from texas 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.710
 and the northeast of the eastern part towards 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.900
 the southeastern United States- 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.460
 entering through the Gulf area of 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.950
 mexico today the maxim of the city of 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.150
 maximum Mexican precisely reaching a 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.250
 value similar to what has been 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.500
 recently reported near 22 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.480
 of the 23 partly cloudy skies dominating 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.340
 Precipitation conditions that tend 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.810
 to disappear attention today there is the 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.490
 possibility but it is already from 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.770
 tomorrow it can be decreasing along with the 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.750
 cloudiness that prevails in a certain way 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.610
 already during the previous weeks in the 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.710
 city ​​of monterrey also subtract the 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.570
 conditions of low cloudiness absence 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.670
 of rain and warm temperatures do not 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.800
 very high close to 32 cm the 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.510
 thermometer and also the next few days 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.280
 as maximum values of the pearl tapatía 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.350
 maximum 28 middle cloudy with showers 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.510
 thunderstorms conditions this 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.400
 form prevail for the next few days 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.929
 of this week in progress even now if 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.520
 we go to the south center and 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.550
 western Mexico where the conditions 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.130
 that prevail are precisely perhaps the 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.570
 cloudiness and rainfall given but you 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.740
 I reiterate that it will only be a matter of 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.090
 time for him to be 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.770
 panorama can change shape 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.780
 important average maximum values ​​the 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.850
 today to a close to the 26 and the 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.650
 almost 30 from querétaro another scale 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.480
 morelia cuernavaca area to oaxaca 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.190
 a rain in the western part I 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.870
 I refer in the coastal parts to the 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.630
 beach areas in acapulco in the area 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.190
 huatulco of course in léon the maximum 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.960
 today almost reaches 30 the 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.240
 conditions of precipitation do not 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.860
 discarded yet but they are isolating little 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.230
 by little so that tomorrow I can even 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.360
 be absent this condition as to 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.070
 people max 24 mid cloudy 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.390
 also and we observe one day of this 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.700
 week just where the rains 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.620
 maybe they can be absent in the same way 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.940
 the area of ​​toluca is not ruled out that it is 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.620
 the same condition for the area of 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.570
 pachuca in the area of ​​texas av la 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.340
 current instability in houston with 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.140
 variable cloudiness and maybe some 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.370
 precipitation with thunderstorm on 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.960

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.040
 more of victory that is something of rain 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.720

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.930
 and the northern part of the country changes 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.340
 enough the panorama are absent 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.660
 those rain trends that 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.550
 were in force especially in 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.690
 mountains values ​​of 34 in monclova and 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.180

 temperature for tomorrow's day that 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.290
 be a warm environment surpassing the 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.150

 some rain today very 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.120
 early and then barre growing up this 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.220
 panorama to change a sunny sky 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.690
