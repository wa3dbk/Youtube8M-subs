actual egg whites I also like to add

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.329 
actual egg whites I also like to add
honey<00:00:28.149> to<00:00:28.419> mine<00:00:28.630> because<00:00:29.289> it<00:00:29.439> moisturizes<00:00:29.710> the

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:30.339 
honey to mine because it moisturizes the

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:33.480 
honey to mine because it moisturizes the
skin<00:00:30.429> it<00:00:31.149> gives<00:00:31.899> it<00:00:32.050> all<00:00:32.230> these<00:00:32.410> vitamins<00:00:33.040> so

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:33.490 
skin it gives it all these vitamins so

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.610
