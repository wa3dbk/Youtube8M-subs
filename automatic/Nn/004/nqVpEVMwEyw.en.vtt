00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:11.429
 first step is what generates little 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.849
 or wanted to be 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:14.449
 unknown 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:17.449
 is it going to make a way to have with your parents 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:21.550
 base time thing I 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.550
 If you are going to do a tour this passes by 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.880
 sarkozy when you put after the treatment that rises 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.720
 the heel 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.940
 couto pt 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.100
 same thing 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.100
 but the format 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.590
 The important is you. 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.590
 in 15ยบ correctly and train slowly 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.000
 before being able to appreciate that of Anderson's peak of music 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.220
 it's a tricky step because you have to get a suspension 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.530
 When you take off, you train. 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.410
 this happened to take these movements if you think 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.670
 the apartments as 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.670
 so it stays with everyone and the kunduz runners 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.390
 with the arrival of two more levers 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.999
 so when you have trained 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.219
 This is what I know is important for some 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:32.069
 that I'm going to explain things 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.010
 that will be changed if it has passed 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.369
 in the past it was clean 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:38.369
 But this is for after you have to train a lot on it. 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:41.039
 slowly 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:43.999
 so far it has occurred 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:45.119
 on the waterfront 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.119
 is to accelerate and since he wins in the field of music 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.649
 so now the world has seen 

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:58.649
 man who will make the exchange 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.299
 Are you going to take a medication? 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.299
 the teams are doing 

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:10.709
 and said jets 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.709
 behind the other 

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:16.499
 ahead 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:19.259
 Then you do it again with the model 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:22.259
 to play a game with the other leg 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:28.789
 there to make the exchange 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:30.689
 philipsz ago 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:33.689
 you step on the front 

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:36.829
 to come back 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.379
 in this way banal 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.379
 in the end will appear but the minsk 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.669
 mb garage that method he's talking about here in the way of t 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.719
 But for you, you really train. 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:04.719
 if you catch the right time 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.359
 but in fact this power 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.359
 tab with the calendar if you want 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.779
 we are here also said merkel 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.330
 do not have to limit yourself to five pickup trucks a year ago 

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:31.159
 can be simplified 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:34.159
 even if you want 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.849
 so the training tip 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:47.979
 what game is for you 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.150
 have in the foot exchange 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.169
 it's all people 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.309
 all electronic music has a count 

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:56.900
 of four-stroke time 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.800
 so will you make the palace 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.389
 tasso has nothing to do with mistakes 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.699
 however of anything change then come back to show in practice malosa 

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:09.589
 it has always been like that 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.680
 I realized that in the 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.169
 buenos aires behind new and already think in front designed 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.979
 the intention of tokyo 

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:38.659
 if you had a taste of baghdad 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:41.419
 increasing the speed gradually 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.830
 if that moment of the pet exchange is taken 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.830
 easily 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.229
 It is also to take care 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:54.460
 what I see a lot of change people in brazil mainly for 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:57.789
 What happened to the same thing? 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:00.789
 There are a lot of people who came from this 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.860
 ends up cutting the bad 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.059
 as a matter of fact 

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:06.879
 Understand the snow campbell 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:10.240
 and end up doing it here 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.240
 But bernardinho 

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:17.460
 if you train very slowly 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.020
 well any day 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.020
 misimovic 

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:24.699
 you will see 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:27.110
 and do it right 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.550
 hugo that gives effect that you are moving by the mec / capes is 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:31.550
 sliding 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.949
 was not 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:35.499
 on leaving the place 

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:36.830
 what will work 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.830
 these aircraft 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:46.070
 why people who have to accept the proposal but attention to lose 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.360
 here you will be moving 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.360
 and type this tool that goes unnoticed then 

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:56.919
 the event that will give them 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:59.919
 is to propose also always leave the leg you are doing 

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:04.189
 as early as possible would be the knee bent because 

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:08.590
 I made you leave the group folded it will look like you just want to do it here today 

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:17.740
 which ends up taking the effect because this here is going to be a blessing 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.729
 but what I want you to be listening to 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:22.289
 I feel like I've never seen
