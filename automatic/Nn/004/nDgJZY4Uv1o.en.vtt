00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.840
 Sergey from the city of Ekaterinburg 3 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.809
 tell about your experience of participating in 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.639
 marathon I know that you passed the marathon and 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.650
 didn't get the result here because 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.050
 many people think the novel only lays out 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.939
 guys who get results yes there 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.580
 always beat themselves in the chest and i say there 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.199
 He becomes rich you a slightly different 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.930
 tell a story 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.970
 Well, it all started with the fact that I kind of 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.160
 did websites just for customers 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.540
 site business card here is such a prehistory 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.559
 and 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.410
 well stumbled upon a smartphone belly something novel 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.960
 That is, it was completed successfully 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.170
 here but no matter how I got the result 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.300
 I am the sum that is, well, I did not reach 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.000
 30,000 Ie there are the first few 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.730
 months you get 56 thousand rubles 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.379
 there are after somewhere 6 months well 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.780
 it turned out twenty five twenty six 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.170
 thousand rubles now wait important 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.180
 The moment why someone will say a dick to yourself 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.270
 a small amount of 20 pieces gives i mean i 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.299
 how much they get and when I was promoted 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.000
 after five years of service there actually 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.110
 Why is this 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.060
 run off a small amount because we 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.180
 we declare that 6 months after 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.009
 marathon you have to get out on the thirty 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.500
 if you don't go out there and accordingly 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.470
 you either return the money and more yourself 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.829
 do not deal accordingly you all 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.689
 equal to plus a big either we are you 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.600
 dokruchivay and you start earning 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.280
 thirty satisfied with the result in general 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.710
 it turned out like what I have not to 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.110
 spinning and like u thought on freak time 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.380
 promised a guarantee then I must apply 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.720
 under warranty and as if addressed here 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.290
 I wonder how the guarantee happened 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.700
 have what it is toss 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.400
 how did this even happen who wrote 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.200
 the letter or everything happened easier that is 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.020
 the novel of his blog announced that how would 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.690
 time guarantees, respectively, well, and I 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.120
 Once I pass through the guarantee, I turned with 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.090
 the letter went on so we 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.790
 phoned and like a novel completely 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.560
 scanned my site look here you 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.890
 some shortcomings 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.360
 oversight and shortcomings so I made up 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.230
 list as if 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.970
 from this list most implemented 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.310
 all sorts of chips here, respectively 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.280
 then after about a month 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.190
 one and a half growth graph began to grow straight 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.900
 much faster, that is, well, somewhere 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.500
 After 2 months, the amount has already turned out 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.620
 about 40 terrorist thousand rubles a month then 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.630
 there was it was one project to 1 project 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.910
 so far it was 20 25 25 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.040
 in a month 45 out of 45 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.790
 ok well i'm seemingly turned out yes 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.530
 it seems to be yes but actually the guarantee is 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.920
 all works in different ways why 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.590
 which I unfortunately cannot for you 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.060
 introduce everything I say but if you 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.569
 embed that result should be 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.400
 because action is experience there is 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.019
 a large number of participants who 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.099
 it is already used and accordingly 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.900
 get the result that I would like more 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:16.269
 you know that is now now later 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.239
 how much has passed since then 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.829
 after the warranty eight months eight 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.320
 months before that is eight months 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.180
 you must have introduced some other things 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.920
 further untied urgently developed further 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.140
 for that is what you came to now 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.640
 let's say such traffic figures are interesting 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.540
 still wondering if you are talking about 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:41.260
 numbers vector at least subject numbers 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.959
 Now in income and let's say how are you 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.880
 arranged that is there can be in the details not 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.470
 dive that is how much yours 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.049
 involvement in all this activity 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.750
 how much do you spend on this time, I realized well 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:56.590
 turns out in numbers attendance now 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:59.049
 already about 10 12 thousand visitors this 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.860
 niche and health medicine here it is me 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:04.670
 I say all about one project is obtained 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.410
 profit somewhere around 70 80 thousand rubles 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.420
 but if we talk about automation like 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.970
 I have a small team she of course 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.370
 show tied up with me i mean i don't 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.829
 I sit all day with a computer without putting on 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.810
 not resting here it turns out all the same 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.120
 tighten it up 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.370
 automate more like that 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.470
 editor and author and content manager all 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.730
 it already has it all successfully sort of 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.590
 working on expanding clear a 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.720
 how much time do you spend that is 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.160
 but for example a week there how much 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.830
 devote time to 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.330
 support and tours 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.430
 but do not know the week well every day hour 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.500
 two exactly as it should be all the same 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.390
 control has not yet reached that point 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.840
 when can that is no more like 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:52.730
 not a bad job two hours a day 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:56.040
 80 70 80 thousand rubles yes ok 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:58.140
 many are now interested in something like 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.270
 you happened so fast 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.950
 quick start yes that is get out and maybe 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.000
 one of the marathoners looks who passed 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:08.790
 marathon and guarantees he approached the numbers there 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.400
 15-20 thousand rubles that is the secret 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:14.370
 what's the chip then what's the moment are you 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.830
 can highlight give as a recommendation well 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.360
 the very first is that is after 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.180
 consultations immediately began to introduce everything 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.860
 without delay the same evening sat down and how 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.450
 would do everything to make Glinda as possible 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.990
 faster it all was not for this 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.430
 experiences that inside him especially 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.590
 if you finish off with some experience 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.870
 I think it does not work very well with this. 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:37.110
 I would argue or you just implemented everything 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:39.030
 Well, as if I still still a little bit myself 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.100
 tested before but also saw that 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.250
 Role errors such as commonplace 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.020
 an oversight on Igor and as if injected from our 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.740
 it will definitely help like me 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.320
 was that 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.540
 but one of the chips is that in the sidebar 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.950
 I was covered by rubrics here 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.320
 there are the same words in the headings 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.419
 Well, how could it be used? 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:01.129
 gave a strong result in terms of 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:05.340
 weight distribution and how did she sleep 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:07.169
 ok principle seriously thanks i think 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.020
 Now we will see it became more clear that 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:12.060
 such a guarantee, they learned that in fact 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.150
 you can apply and receive 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.340
 results and I think your advice especially 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.870
 About perespam and I think many 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.629
 It will be useful because in fact 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.669
 very many sites on the big sidebar with 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:25.680
 a huge number of headings heading 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:27.780
 where the same words are found before 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:32.270
 pay attention to this with you 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.270
 Novel body and Sergey all bye
