00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:08.910
 hello friends with you now he and 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.940
 today we have a little unusual my they 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.880
 Usually it is the fact that visiting us pt 8 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.090
 level and perhaps one of the best PTF 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.369
 its level Soviet 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.189
 isu-152 and so what is in this n from 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.619
 what her classmates don't have and of course 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.230
 I'm talking about her wonderful 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.750
 gun legendary bl-10 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.489
 at the sight of his enemies begin to fear and 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.649
 roll for the nearest shelter 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.809
 probably only bl-10 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.270
 600 meters ability to get on 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.450
 flying at full speed t 52 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.520
 beat mu both caterpillars without damage well 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.370
 okay on this raw not finish how 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.980
 see in the patch 086 bl 9 can fall 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.250
 on tracks and with damage and so what's the same 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.370
 the uniqueness of the weapon in the first his alpha 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.210
 750 units is an absolute record for 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.449
 level eight among the pitfalls stuff and 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.660
 286 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.670
 conventional armor-piercing projectile at 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.060
 subcaliber as I recall in the area 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.409
 330 breakthroughs and there are also wonderful 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.630
 landmines punch them 90 and the average damage 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.720
 950 why did I talk about land mines 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.820
 as you can see ammunition 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.490
 isu-152 is pretty small 20 shells and 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.860
 I carry with me 15 bb step and 5 mines 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.650
 why so i distributed my 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.259
 shells giving up roughly fights 20 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.240
 I guess I understand that if you don’t 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.549
 punch some so armor piercing 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.979
 projectile then sabling you him too 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.290
 hardly break through so i unloaded everything 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.380
 lifted take and loaded 5 mines 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.700
 why it was a landmine somehow I had 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.640
 case of Karelia 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.070
 e100 because of the stone enemy tank oval 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.049
 overboard and ours naturally nobody could 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.610
 punch him I even shot him there 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.860
 I tried it once a grandmother 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.229
 Naturally, I hit the screen and did not rush 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.390
 then I tried to charge the bomb 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.780
 time i had two land mines as far as i 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.990
 I remember the first shot on the screen I shot him 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.789
 about 350 damage and a second shot on 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.230
 300 I finished him off 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:16.250
 so here in two shots in 30 seconds 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:19.549
 removed a sheet of 650 efficiency while no one else 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.379
 could not check it naturally and after 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.930
 of this I unloaded all the subscale 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:26.060
 shells and loaded 5 mines and think 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.340
 that did everything right because 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.769
 land mines here such situations they are very 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.890
 help a lot and even when it’s necessary 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:36.890
 finish some of the seventh about it 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.340
 150 200 then you can easily 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.890
 to make 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.170
 by a land mine you are more likely a water mine and water 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.299
 than pierce let's say subcaliber 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.310
 projectile but this is of course all mine 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.620
 personal opinion about land mines and you 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.829
 You can not agree with me saying that 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.660
 land mines is not a constant thing although 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.629
 principle like all other shells 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.200
 the same land mines can carry 300 and 400 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:03.200
 HP and in one case and do not carry down 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.239
 50 rude but at the same time cumulative 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.690
 projectile either subcaliber on you with the same 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.280
 success can not punch or 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.489
 He ricocheted from whom some 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.170
 kvass and either of and this is all of course 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.970
 everyone's personal matter what shells 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.060
 but I used you still on the old 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.510
 habit more confidence in landmine and here at 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.910
 ISU-152 or on other tanks with large 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.459
 caliber guns charging mine 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.010
 you can say are turning such 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.669
 art of any sixth level is not 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.010
 I remember what damage there is now 950 and you can 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:38.720
 there guaranteed 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.319
 remove some amount of hp using 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.599
 high explosive 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.280
 okay, stop talking about types 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.880
 shells what else can you say about 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.370
 tool 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.980
 reduced but rather long 34 seconds 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.030
 so I put the drive drives with 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.760
 they live easier 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.340
 down the gun goes down by 6 degrees and 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.560
 horizontal corners it has a minus 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.440
 eight plus eight are rather small 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.299
 indicators therefore often have to 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.370
 turn body away because of this 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.430
 circle of information on this both kind and all 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.139
 I hope I all said nothing is forgotten so 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.959
 already pretty much chatting about it 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:15.440
 about and let's talk about the dynamics 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:17.660
 dynamics she basically has a straight line 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.659
 she keeps somewhere 30 kilometers in this 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.600
 the maximum speed of her 43 but with Gora 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:24.570
 somewhere in the area 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:28.190
 probably 50 will roll if much 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:31.050
 push her but here if we talk about 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.780
 the ease of this birdie here unfortunately 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.810
 everything is bad very weak she spins 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.900
 in place and speaking of the weak 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.970
 Whether soils, is there drying better at all? 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.700
 do nothing then there is no drive in 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.620
 marshland because 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:51.000
 marshland she but she just 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.550
 not moving forward is not going let alone the 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.560
 I generally keep silent 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.540
 then you can talk about booking well 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.820
 what to say booking and drying is not 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.520
 although there is one place in which 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.890
 there is some dropping this mask 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.500
 guns but I will immediately say that the reservation 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.910
 it is rather specific because 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.030
 there were such cases that me 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.670
 I punched Moscow dough guns 10-5 then 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.890
 there are 10 heavy ones and there have been such cases 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.840
 when I eat there easily penetrated 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.750
 her royal tiger ie strands 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.060
 eighth level therefore by no means 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.430
 relying on some kind of armor is not worth it and 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.340
 it is most likely a random occurrence if 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.560
 someone does not pierce you and what else can 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.600
 note out of trouble this is what 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.780
 drying in the forehead is tanks 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:40.140
 that is, they are on my left of 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.960
 guns if you look here from my camera and 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.570
 if you get in that place you can 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.150
 naturally set fire so i drive with 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.130
 a goldovye if they do not cook 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.250
 affect the probability of occurrence 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.350
 fires getting into the tank but due to the fact 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.230
 that they automatically put out fires they 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.480
 can save you no they are there 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:04.260
 hundred hop if your reaction is not 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:06.360
 fast enough and due to this these 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.330
 scans on fpl may help you 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.460
 somehow decide the outcome of the battle so golden 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.100
 consumables advertised well 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.880
 task performed now you can talk 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.380
 about disguise 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:21.660
 here is 085 more precisely 2086 pocheu jesus 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.330
 disguised everything was generally fine she 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:27.240
 feel good among 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.920
 bushes and trees did not glow at all 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.650
 if you don't approach her meters on 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.020
 fifty but here's 086 in my situation 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.120
 changed a little and 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.840
 quite frequent drying glows after 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:41.780
 a shot if there isn’t anybody 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.400
 more often, but in principle, disguise 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.650
 he has good ones so i carry with me 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:49.069
 camouflage net seems to have increased 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.300
 and her influence is in 086 and so I am her with 

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:52.699
 I drive with pleasure 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.699
 Well, in conclusion you can probably say 

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:57.650
 a few words about the crew skills of the commander 

00:06:55.699 --> 00:07:00.650
 the first light bulb 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.840
 second repair for all other members 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:06.830
 crew first skill goes repair and 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:10.370
 second in all but the driver in 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:12.740
 inject it less virtuoso and all 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.419
 the rest is disguised here 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.310
 I have about this skill set 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:18.199
 Now at this point in the second perk 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.780
 I was not completely pumped out there somewhere 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:23.330
 90 percent but me basically so 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.969
 I'll arrange a set on this 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.409
 finish your kind 

00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:29.509
 familiarity with isu-152 

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:32.060
 I hope you have something useful for yourself 

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:33.560
 this video was found in the background by the way there was a fight 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.750
 on the alder onion card 

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.300
 commented because to comment 

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:41.479
 there is nothing special and let's now 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:46.099
 as always, by tradition, let's go to the hangar 

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:48.139
 and see the results of this fight and so 

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:50.509
 the results of the battle you can see on your 

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:52.819
 screens and I thank you for your attention with 

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:55.370
 you were now subscribe to my 

00:07:52.819 --> 00:07:58.449
 channel strong armor and precision weapons you 

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.449
 and see you soon
