over time it got progressively worse and

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.119 
over time it got progressively worse and

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
can see how great the screen protector

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.870 
can see how great the screen protector
the<00:02:26.290> glass<00:02:26.500> sits<00:02:26.890> on<00:02:27.040> here<00:02:27.190> you<00:02:27.310> can<00:02:27.430> see<00:02:27.640> look

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
the glass sits on here you can see look

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.820 
the glass sits on here you can see look
at<00:02:27.940> that<00:02:28.000> it's<00:02:28.930> barely<00:02:29.350> even<00:02:29.530> noticeable<00:02:31.830> now

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
at that it's barely even noticeable now

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.750 
at that it's barely even noticeable now
mind<00:02:33.550> you<00:02:33.700> that's<00:02:34.209> just<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:35.220> zoom<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:36.400> have<00:02:36.580> on

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
mind you that's just the zoom I have on

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.310 
mind you that's just the zoom I have on
the<00:02:36.880> macro<00:02:37.090> lens<00:02:37.420> i<00:02:37.540> have<00:02:37.720> in<00:02:37.840> this<00:02:37.959> is<00:02:38.140> off<00:02:38.290> the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
the macro lens i have in this is off the

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.990 
the macro lens i have in this is off the
charts<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:41.820> just<00:02:42.820> so<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.060> can<00:02:43.180> see<00:02:43.240> the<00:02:43.540> fit

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
charts so just so you can see the fit

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.670 
charts so just so you can see the fit
there<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.090> go<00:02:46.209> you<00:02:46.810> can<00:02:46.959> see<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.230> fit<00:02:47.380> is<00:02:47.470> just

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
there you go you can see the fit is just

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.070 
there you go you can see the fit is just
perfect<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:50.560> just<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.550> prove<00:02:51.700> this<00:02:52.570> is<00:02:52.630> just

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
perfect and just to prove this is just

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.390 
perfect and just to prove this is just
dust<00:02:54.070> and<00:02:54.720> like<00:02:55.720> i<00:02:55.870> said<00:02:55.959> this<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.650> magnitude

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
dust and like i said this the magnitude

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.890 
dust and like i said this the magnitude
that<00:02:57.520> i<00:02:57.610> got<00:02:57.790> going<00:02:58.120> right<00:02:58.150> now<00:02:58.300> is<00:02:58.600> off<00:02:58.750> the

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
that i got going right now is off the

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.050 
that i got going right now is off the
charts<00:02:59.370> it's<00:03:00.370> probably<00:03:00.640> one<00:03:00.760> of<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.910> best

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
charts it's probably one of the best

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.590 
charts it's probably one of the best
macro<00:03:01.510> lenses<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:01.959> can<00:03:01.989> use<00:03:02.320> so<00:03:03.310> you<00:03:04.470> can<00:03:05.470> see

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
macro lenses you can use so you can see

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.390 
macro lenses you can use so you can see
definitely<00:03:07.600> a<00:03:07.660> perfect<00:03:08.080> fit<00:03:08.260> now<00:03:08.800> the<00:03:08.860> install
