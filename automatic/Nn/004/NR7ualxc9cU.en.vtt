00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.370
 hello very good to all the kids I am 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.769
 from state back and today we are here to 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.110
 talk about a new strategy 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.900
 advanced competitive already you know 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.150
 always looking for the pull of uber views and 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.189
 in this case we are going to talk about mega 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.710
 place I 'm worth as you can see here 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.300
 I put an image to eat the user and 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.110
 First of all, we are going to analyze a 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.300
 little his stats his type and skill 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.550
 that is here I have not put it but 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.040
 well I will explain what is and what 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.470
 utility to give us good as you can 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.839
 see the combination of listening types 0 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.530
 it's a combination that gives us a lot 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:49.600
 resistance rocks campaign is worth and that is 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.360
 pretty good especially for the new 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.040
 skill that is adaptive worth 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.589
 adaptable what it is going to do is that 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.839
 our attacks that we make that are 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:02.019
 of our same kind instead of receiving 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:04.930
 a taste of 1.5 receive on a bus for 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:08.380
 two is to say point-blank deserves to have if 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.680
 has 120 power as mdc receive 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.820
 1.5 for this would be 180 that receives 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.590
 by 2 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.710
 a point of this mega place I 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.250
 would have 240 of power as such 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.390
 well said is very good as you can 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:28.060
 see the faces the stats mega ario look 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.910
 70 70 70 in life defense and defense 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.090
 special is to say in the boom part 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.160
 It is not very bull that you will see that it does not 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.710
 nothing has improved in this aspect is 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.710
 quite weak in this sense is very 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.590
 fragile 135 attack they have uploaded the 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.410
 attack base very good 135 attack 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.410
 physical is very good 115 attack 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.140
 special similar the same is very high 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.479
 it's also worth pretty well and 90 of 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.580
 speed 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.310
 come here is already where our fellow goes 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.000
 to pick up a little bit as I explain another 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:08.140
 time with sugar and 90 speed it seems 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.780
 short it is slow from 90 is 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.890
 slow then let's have what 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.209
 try to remove let's say try 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.520
 compensate for this lack of speed with 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.050
 then good priority movements 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.030
 now let's spend a little bit the 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.560
 strategy and how can you see the 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.080
 strategy that I have thought is of a 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.140
 physical attacker but good given the 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.630
 variety of the world of the muc pool that 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.150
 You have therefore also can use 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.580
 mixed or even special is worth this already 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.800
 depends on each one stands out for its great 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.569
 attack and a very good special attack and 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.820
 its speed seems like something short like 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.530
 I have told you before and good object has 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.060
 that take the mega lose if not for 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.790
 this could not evolve to mega 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.120
 location well the musel is quite clear 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.459
 dance sword fist bullet point-blank and the 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.560
 fourth movement shred an ice 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.830
 extreme speed or some that you 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.080
 happen good as here I give thanks to 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.780
 Your adaptive bullet fist skill will have 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.580
 80 power and close-up 240 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.010
 then these two because these two 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.860
 movements are going to go fixed fist bullet 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.829
 because it hits very hard and with priority and 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.730
 point-blank because I have 240 which is 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.519
 a truly 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.709
 burrada and it's very very powerful so 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.780
 sword is to carry we are worth carrying 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.280
 our attack on bestial levels is 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.280
 say after such a sword in 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.319
 our place I will be almost unstoppable 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.780
 and the fourth movement as well 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.330
 depends on each one to a movement of 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.250
 type coverage either grind for 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.290
 psychic ghost type and so on 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.049
 ice fist for flyers type earth or 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.480
 dragons or extreme speed that 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.430
 responds to the same need of fist 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.549
 bullet of priority need then 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.980
 if you see that it is very important that you do not need more 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.870
 speed and they take out some pokemon 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.700
 resistant to zero type so you can 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.790
 hit with extreme speed that too 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.060
 it has an 80 power then good 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.790
 this has been all in regards to this 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.950
 advanced analysis of mega lúcar yo 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.629

 lots and good then now I'm going to leave you 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.859
 an open question that is more than anything 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.400
 If you think it's going to be better 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:21.799
 mega lúcar I was going to spread more

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.350
 the comments you already know if you see any 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.340
 mistake in the strategy or you think that 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.949
 you have another variant that you can 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.889
 improve it also comment without fear 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:40.720
