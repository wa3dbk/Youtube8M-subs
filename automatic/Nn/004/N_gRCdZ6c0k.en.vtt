 school days are good if your baby every 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.620
 day goes to school with pleasure but here 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.339
 what to do if it is not 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.400
 for starters do not panic whether 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.679
 the situation is nothing abnormal 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:17.369
 try to question croc about 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.449
 reasons for his dissatisfaction 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.090
 maybe he didn't have a relationship with 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.119
 teachers then you should go to 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.119
 schools and understand the cause of the conflict 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.390

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.850
 artificially create conditions for 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.400
 close communication and shoes with 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.000
 classmates 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.830
 and another reason for this country 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.890
 what reason is lost motivation 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.810
 ruled out when the child does not know 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.490

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.280
