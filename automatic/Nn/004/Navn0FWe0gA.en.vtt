00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.170
 victims of abandonment 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.570
 thanks to the daily work of protectors 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.619
 as animal aid these animals can 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.619
 have a second chance 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.890
 of animal aid is currently a 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.750
 protective society and it is also a 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.540
 Association of university students 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.150
 de murcia right now I'm in charge of 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.860
 issue of not having the veterinary of the 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.380
 protective and to review all the 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.270
 animals before they arrive and before 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.490
 that are given for adoption 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.130
 in the protective currently there are more than 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:54.680
 100 animals for adoption 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:58.890
 the majority is a dog 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.030
 but we also find rodent cats 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.030
 and exotic animals 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.310
 the animals come in many forms 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:11.220
 different by notices of 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.130
 I've seen a dog in the street because you 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.689
 find it yourself when you decide 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.850
 catch a new animal for the 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.479
 protective you have to take care of 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.920
 that animal you have to take care of 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.920
 have a foster home for him 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:32.090
 from the moment you enter until that dog comes out 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.090
 or that animal 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.229
 between all the volunteers are made 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.360
 charge of hosting educate and teach 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.360
 animals in their homes until their adoption 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.860
 the expenses of the protective are covered 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.240
 with the annual membership fee and with 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.630
 donations from people who want 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.630
 to collaborate 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.690
 all donations are destined 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.490
 entirely to the care of the animals 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:03.380
 to your maintenance to feed vaccine vaccine 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:07.240
 gasoline to go with an animal of no 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.240
 site for another everything for them 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.010
 the end of this process is that the 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.350
 animals find a home when 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:20.030
 I have a day of slump and when I 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:22.930
 I see always encourage me and it's fidelity 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.930
 but that is always there 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:32.390
 and I think I could not live animal if 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.019
 they give us a lot and you have to have one to 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.019
 know what it is
