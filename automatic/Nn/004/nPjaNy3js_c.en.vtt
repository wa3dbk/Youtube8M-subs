going to slow pedal faster you're gonna

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.870 
going to slow pedal faster you're gonna
do<00:01:11.850> fast<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.479> tap<00:01:12.689> your<00:01:12.720> back<00:01:13.020> brake<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> bit

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.690 

through<00:01:24.380> this<00:01:24.530> system<00:01:24.770> you<00:01:25.130> can<00:01:25.280> get<00:01:25.430> pretty

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
through this system you can get pretty

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:34.370 
through this system you can get pretty
good

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.540 

I<00:01:35.180> just<00:01:36.180> need<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.479> get<00:01:36.570> good<00:01:37.159> you<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.190> need<00:01:38.520> a
