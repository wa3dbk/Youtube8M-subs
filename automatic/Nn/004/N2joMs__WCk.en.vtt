00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 Hello dear friends with you service 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:09.510
 it's such a small tutorial and just 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.200
 general stream of thoughts about the army on the server 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.719
 raknet 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.199
 army zone 51 here and accordingly 1 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.210
 theme 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.279
 in 1 episode that I want to talk this 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.010
 how to actually get into this 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.220
 army and there are three ways two 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.689
 absolutely legal and the easiest but 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.940
 perhaps it will soon not be covered by a fact and 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:36.120
 So the first is the most simple-watching 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.989
 at the expense and needing when in urban 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.030
 news 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:44.460
 ever say that's open on 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:48.480
 board service on 69 or a51 I will say right away 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.800
 that 51 is desert zones at 69 this 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.910
 respectively, which aircraft carrier 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.910
 is near san fierro 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.480
 of the ways you have to wait 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.320
 actually this call interview 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.260
 as they call him 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.989
 press in the specified place are built in 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.450
 queue and actually wait until that 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.600
 will come military all arrange pass 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.610
 you have to have a little brp test 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.340
 a passport that is always with you 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.159
 it is impossible to select it even as an object 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.770
 from as such there is no and medknizhka which 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.320
 must recoup through the slash my then 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.120
 there is 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.550
 a book that you have on idea 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.640
 which is not you and even present as 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.140
 a passport can't you ideally have yet 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.860
 call at the hospital 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.930
 but during such an interview you 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.630
 screenshot simply will not require you 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.130
 there you come from play and 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.460
 either you would not be from yourself 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.840
 throw out a community of horseradish and here it turns out 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.240
 that you come to the specified place and 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.420
 you pass a little test you play 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.220
 passports you believe and medical book to you 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.690
 knows a few questions every time they 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.539
 may be different but of the very such 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.280
 Tricky recommend immediately think 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:09.830
 your characterâ€™s age at 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.840
 moment on january the 27th it seems there on 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.810
 94 year server , respectively, need 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:20.180
 push me away from him a character by 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:24.470
 my 34 years old or 24 no 34 means that 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.340
 it in my born in 1960 I do 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.530
 I don't remember already 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.030
 and this is even a grandfather recorded not to be confused 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.510
 but not a fact 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.890
 no matter 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.750
 This is the easiest way and pass 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.420
 small testik and if you perceives 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.880
 just wait until they give you another 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.290
 This faction will be given the form and in principle 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.540
 then you can go to go 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.990
 some after some time on 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:51.610
 server barracks there no matter spawn 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:54.780
 will move automatic to zone this 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.920
 first way second way is to go to 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.880
 official portal 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.100
 as it is called in the game site can not be 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.880
 say why it is not clear and the portal 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.840
 You can go to the site and there is no cancer. su go 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.100
 in section 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:15.010
 Nation Guard go to applications section 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.300
 which can be closed open and there 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.760
 respectively write about too 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.070
 most for some particular formula 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.900
 here and there should be a screenshot 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.960
 passports but again this is not very 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.390
 the big problem with roofs is this done 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.730
 default sambir engine on f8 if 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.570
 someone is too lazy to bathe there somehow 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.430
 it doesn't matter and accordingly it's just there 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.580
 leave application and go as well 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.830
 must approve or disapprove there 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.720
 challenging it harder article let's say 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.450
 will not accept to for some reason but it 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.520
 no matter this is the second way 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.810
 pretty light but rather more and more 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.060
 long lasting because 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.040
 leaders but no they are quite often 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.530
 attend forms but there is not the first time 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.459
 Naturally seconds 40 how can this 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.380
 make for prizes 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.380
 although personally we stood on 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.500
 the call of forty minutes pipe three hours in 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.030
 In general, we got so far all of us 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.019
 processed there was still a lot of people so far 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.480
 brought bye 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:16.910
 base until the notes themselves fell on it 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.459
 the second is regulated way that's 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.680
 accordingly, the third way 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.800
 the freest but possible 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.880
 will shut up after you are on the server 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.669
 handing over 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.250
 right after jamie won 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.070
 there all designs once will give you 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.630
 offer several directions 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.180
 ask you want to serve silita 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:43.760
 gangster there so here respectively 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:45.729
 Jimmy gives himself a couple somewhere on 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.169
 map and when you come and speak 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.290
 guys sent me to you my old friend 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.240
 he recommended the canal being built ghetto 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.789
 this by the way can not give me a ride i'm not 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.940
 sure poetry there leaders though playing back 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:01.160
 on it should still it somehow 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:04.400
 Well, that is, in theory, you can even 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.860
 don't get this quest don't take on 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.710
 right just come and tell the guys 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.680
 mikom sent my old friend i want 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.390
 serve you and most importantly in father's chat 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.210
 write what is quest 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:20.660
 otherwise it will sound rather strange 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.180
 and if it is cool in principle they are not 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.710
 can in any way 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.830
 getting rid of it is no longer important in 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.750
 principle here and 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.550
 it is possible to sham so pretty all 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.190
 equal will ask the passport cheesy will 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.920
 a small basin to agree that it is worth 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.530
 at the interview 4 hours 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.810
 wait while you are framed on the forum and 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.210
 just come and say no one 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:47.360
 happens from a concert mates somehow 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:51.080
 much easier respectively in the following 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.540
 series I will tell inside him build 3 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.700
 thought the final syria will be just mine 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.010
 personal reflections because I already 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.630
 it was an attempt I spoke very strongly 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.340
 then 15 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.590
 there was too much in the top a 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.840
 respectively the right to join the army 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.510
 you are the main focus or enjoy 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.400
 guys come on stand on kid luck 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.630
 I will tell the following series already 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.540
 internal order 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.920
 Army Well guys you had service 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:19.220
