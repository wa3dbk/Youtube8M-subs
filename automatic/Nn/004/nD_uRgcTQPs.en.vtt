00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:18.960
 for a break that he ever did 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.119
 Today we want you there is no pressure I'm speechless Jan students should be like that 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.099
 is 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.890
 Food 4 is created in principle 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.210
 the device 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.340
 So thought for the lead safely that and their suggestions because even 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.900
 so I blocked one 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.610
 what she has to do, "said Zuma 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.800
 Half-mast roots 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.060
 because many songs of the breaks also cancel, for example 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.280
 This also does not work very well 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.069
 to this from the manufacturer but basically percent 

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:54.309
 just so that would be some of his approved ones would be laid by the guys 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:55.620
 Application out 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.000
 how does a different story work? 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.310
 yes, if they really value man so it says the manufacturer says 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.310
 do not work with strong numbers 18 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.410
 Resolutions, the device is listed by Nokia 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.570
 11 millimeters 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.570
 So that means saving criminal law 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.360
 Passersby have said 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.550
 Year of wear at next year's percent which is like 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.290
 always free 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.630
 it is ticked off very quickly 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.820
 like more in preliminary talks or better the marks relative 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.360
 discreetly she is not supposed to be alone due to the wear 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.760
 his 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.670
 SID as well mark the hype of its kickers 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.660
 as before our gate 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.660
 which is very very small 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.940
 informed 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.170
 it has been moved 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.250
 no problem 9 Kapfenberg has weight as she says 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.900
 very small year of 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.010
 but small species-rich 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.020
 80 75 millimeters yes so very very compact 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.100
 what do you really want to say is that you have access to none at any time 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.960
 Case over long distances or too fast 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.770
 furthermore 10 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.550
 Giant hits development has not been built with his moped becomes the Felipe 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.399
 Gonzales 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.089
 and the whole thing gets pretty hot and what will be the device to the adventure 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:17.089
 wears out but that too should be broken 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:20.639
 after approx 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.639
 Richard Feinstein it's just wonderful 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.909
 Tunisia has Sal 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.020
 they pull in half-heartedly so grab right here 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.020
 I do not care what it is rare 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:41.439
 one way or another 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:44.109
 she is due to the water going up 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.389
 In any case, this is so stocked 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:49.859
 that's all upstairs 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.329
 from accidents 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.209
 what's the name of 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.839
 when it was the first title stopped 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:58.299
 this popularity 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.799
 either way, we can succeed here again, among other things 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.509
 in the course of his election 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:07.110
 so easy to install Berlin 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.760
 we hope that we do not anymore 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.760
 Percent Zumba thought I do not care 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:17.050
 currently they are phasing out the red cross he was on back up 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.779
 especially hold on to the partner 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:23.249
 otherwise could actually research and so is also a manual 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:24.649
 from RWE 

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:27.979
 in our opinion he knows quite well 

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:32.549
 here, too, gave up this on this event kind of this 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.609
 I just did 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.719
 with 3 4 to the top, Florian took profit 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.579
 so the device should be guided 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.999
 so the head coach 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:44.839
 how to see how they did 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:46.549
 that as Father Charlie 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.769
 with one hand succeeds her released 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:50.739
 otherwise 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.449
 That should be pretty fine ounce 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:56.219
 that would protect 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:59.579
 To be a footnote and deport this 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.349
 make a note of it 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.349
 Similar to other appliances stop car market 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:06.790
 the laser is coming 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.790
 Chute be ne patient in any case that is wanted so 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.530
 that was dynamically sure that means I would additionally slow down completely 

00:04:14.529 --> 00:04:17.759
 important is that we have it all valves down safely 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:21.769
 Century why so should unexpected sooner 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.230
 In this seriousness only you in the sponsoring offers and worked 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.099
 and thanks to a faultless performance in protection 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:33.379
 for sure 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:37.590
 that's the way it looks because it's basically a weird and weird condition 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.590
 that looks like it is 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.099
 I do not search anymore 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:44.639
 is cold 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.229
 this includes moisture 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.300
 that is so dangerous that it is dangerous 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.110
 It is owned by Robert Bartko for 90 days 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.740
 March so that's all real 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.789
 almost nothing regulated 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:03.950
 There is a risk that even a bit to accidents 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.590
 to abuse the old town hall 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.590
 that would be lost a lot so hold on 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.789
 Fraser best fulfills Sions person dead 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:17.439
 which is almost misplaced somewhere executed skeptical 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:25.270
 What Urs Bucher is also about as Richard is so leisurely lavish 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.559
 Gallen old 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:27.809
 came under pressure 

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:33.349
 Catching the customer Kath also later works to himself 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:36.349
 also office 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:39.729
 Â«And we do not see shared 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.659
 the skilful passes August 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:46.169
 to move in the cockpit also to get employed to 8 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:48.189
 did not believe 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:50.990
 suggest the fis-council which say 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.860
 RA we demand
