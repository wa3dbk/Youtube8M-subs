00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
which are really not especially but

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.320

with<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.630> iphone<00:02:07.380> doll<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:08.060> this<00:02:09.380> card<00:02:10.380> lets

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
with the iphone doll so this card lets

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.949 
with the iphone doll so this card lets
there's<00:02:11.340> one<00:02:11.610> form<00:02:11.850> i<00:02:11.940> think<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.270> basic<00:02:12.720> theme

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
there's one form i think a basic theme

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.560 
there's one form i think a basic theme
deck<00:02:13.370> i'm<00:02:14.370> not<00:02:14.550> sure<00:02:14.610> i<00:02:15.000> think<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.360> came<00:02:15.510> from

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
deck i'm not sure i think it came from

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.630 
deck i'm not sure i think it came from
recipe<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.410> it's<00:02:16.590> not<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.459> best

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
recipe that it's not in the best

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.420 
recipe that it's not in the best
condition<00:02:17.790> but<00:02:18.800> anyway<00:02:21.560> 12<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:22.709> ok<00:02:22.920> i<00:02:23.820> guess

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
condition but anyway 12 is ok i guess

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:32.830 
condition but anyway 12 is ok i guess
the<00:02:26.430> sub<00:02:28.940> base<00:02:29.940> two<00:02:30.360> parties<00:02:30.930> which<00:02:31.830> came<00:02:32.130> with

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
the sub base two parties which came with

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:43.490 
the sub base two parties which came with
another<00:02:33.840> team<00:02:34.170> deb<00:02:34.410> card<00:02:41.540> this<00:02:42.540> from<00:02:42.870> pi<00:02:43.470> think

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
another team deb card this from pi think

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.310 
another team deb card this from pi think
it's<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:44.010> new<00:02:44.160> discovery<00:02:44.700> theme<00:02:45.239> deck<00:02:48.320> probably

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
it's a new discovery theme deck probably

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.220 
it's a new discovery theme deck probably
the<00:02:49.709> scheme<00:02:50.040> decried<00:02:50.430> here<00:02:50.700> i'm<00:02:51.690> not<00:02:51.989> sure<00:02:52.200> but

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
the scheme decried here i'm not sure but

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.350 
the scheme decried here i'm not sure but
i<00:02:52.530> think<00:02:52.560> we<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.310> came<00:02:53.610> with<00:02:53.640> this<00:02:53.910> thing<00:02:54.180> that

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
i think we it came with this thing that

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.890 
i think we it came with this thing that
idea

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.229 

and<00:03:02.900> finally<00:03:03.290> another<00:03:03.410> farthest<00:03:04.250> from<00:03:04.730> I

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
and finally another farthest from I

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.460 
and finally another farthest from I
think<00:03:05.599> it's<00:03:05.750> near<00:03:05.959> Genesis<00:03:07.390> okay<00:03:08.390> those<00:03:09.290> are

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
think it's near Genesis okay those are

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.309 
think it's near Genesis okay those are
