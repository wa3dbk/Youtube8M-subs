00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.100
 the city of Latin America face a 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.189
 huge challenge truly we 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.880
 we find cities with a region 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.070
 that has 80% of its urbanized 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.450
 population lives in urban areas and has 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.850
 serious problems of poverty one of each 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.750
 four people is poor and 32% of the 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.010
 population lives in informal housing 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.420
 these cities of Latin America have 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.949
 grown uncontrolled 100 ago 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.540
 years that urbanism is not done in 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.390
 Latin America 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.970
 we see growths with very low density 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.400
 and a lot of fragmentation from where 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.190
 closed neighborhoods coexist with areas 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.059
 of extreme poverty and these cities 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.430
 secondary of each of the countries 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.080
 they are growing demographically more than 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.089
 the big cities the big cities 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.790
 of their countries are also engines of 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.680
 economic growth we have identified 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.990
 140 cities that represent 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.080
 approximately 30 percent of the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.740
 regional economy have fewer resources 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.860
 economic and have less capacity 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.420
 technique is much more difficult to implement 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.120
 by themselves projects therefore 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.150
 depend much more on transfers 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.980
 of the government of the national government or of 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.770
 funds that they can borrow today 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.830
 for today in the vast majority of 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.500
 cities in the region 50 percent 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.910
 of the water that is exploited does not reach the 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.910
 quills people that water is lost 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.790
 on the way are lost are few 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.170
 city ​​that today have micro meters and 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.480
 that measure exactly with cm the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.130
 Household consumption usually the 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.690
 consumption is related to some other 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.430
 parameter that has nothing to do with 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.440
 the actual consumption in these situations 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.270
 what is the incentive for a person 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.940
 to save the resource to keep it 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.850
 between 2 and 12 percent in the 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.110
 region and is only recycled less 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.460
 of 15 percent of the waters 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.080
 residuals of the region are treated 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.240
 many of these waters received are 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.920
 dumped into rivers urban streams that 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.840
 pollute the city and they go through the 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.819
 heart of the city no city is 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.590
 truly prepared for 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.060
 adaptation to climate change and for 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.700
 the problems that these bring 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.470
 created a society that around the car 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.670
 that has the car as a focus and this 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.040
 what we should in some way 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.560
 change transportation and land use 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.450
 they have a symbiotic relationship that is 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.840
 impossible to think of a system of 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.380
 viable transport that does not have one that 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.760
 is not nestled in a high environment 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.760
 density and vice versa 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.720
 to
