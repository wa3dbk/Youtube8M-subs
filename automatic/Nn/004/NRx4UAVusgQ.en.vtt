00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
this foundation is not that great if you

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.990 
this foundation is not that great if you
have<00:02:49.239> spots<00:02:49.870> like<00:02:50.200> me<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:51.130> gives<00:02:51.400> a<00:02:51.580> light<00:02:51.790> to

is light to medium so if you do have
really<00:04:26.729> bad<00:04:26.880> spots<00:04:27.270> then<00:04:27.780> I<00:04:28.020> would<00:04:28.260> recommend

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
really bad spots then I would recommend

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.300

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
then it's a perfect skin tone match for

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.790 
then it's a perfect skin tone match for
me<00:04:34.889> maybe<00:04:35.400> it's<00:04:35.729> just<00:04:35.820> for<00:04:36.180> me<00:04:36.210> but<00:04:36.510> they<00:04:37.320> do<00:04:37.380> do

me maybe it's just for me but they do do

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.219

more<00:05:08.420> than<00:05:08.660> two<00:05:08.930> layers<00:05:09.320> because<00:05:09.860> it<00:05:10.370> could

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
more than two layers because it could

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.850 
more than two layers because it could
start<00:05:10.940> look<00:05:11.420> a<00:05:11.450> bit<00:05:11.690> cakey<00:05:12.200> and<00:05:12.320> you<00:05:12.620> really

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
start look a bit cakey and you really

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.940 
start look a bit cakey and you really
