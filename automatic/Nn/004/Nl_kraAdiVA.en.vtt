00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.040
 Hi 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.620
 this time i have little profit espai 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.590
 brent video and this time the action oh 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.980
 section of course not and brand but who 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.660
 a store but yes mix makeup or maps 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.510
 and more whatever you want to call it I go 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.220
 everything I pack in terms of action mega 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.140
 show you today I think 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.019
 action makeup very nice 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.050
 what is dirt cheap and the quality that 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.219
 I think getting it in return is really good 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.210
 well it of course differs per 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.489
 product 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.140
 but yes i do like the action and also 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.520
 of the makeup they have 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.960
 and I think you find it too 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.430
 very nice so it seemed to me 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.379
 nice to record this video 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.450
 I will first start with the products that 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.120
 now I don't think about the action anymore 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.829
 to be found and first to be one 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:59.969
 lip gloss yes it is very old and macs 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.739
 lips lipgloss and is now well and light 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.000
 in so that you can easily do it too 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.510
 just because I have nothing on my 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.250
 lips yes look beautiful and sit here 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.390
 in a mirror 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.920
 I think I bought it even when I 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.770
 I was still in school and that is now 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.770
 already 20 years ago or so 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.290
 then I found this very cool with such 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.290
 light is a mirror 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.950
 must now equally well on the Dutch 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.720
 share video building it is a beautiful 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.720
 a great lip gloss a lot of glitter 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.240
 but it won't bother you so much 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.650
 saves I now had one for the video 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.420
 frown my curse on my shirt 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.090
 good shackles 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.950
 but is very nice yes now I think 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.780
 might as well go away then because I wear 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.880
 him now and I am then I have two 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.000
 palettes and these both have 18 color 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.040
 this is condomi crazy number four and this one 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.909
 has a lot of colors like you 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.799
 can see 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.560
 unfortunately the pigmentation is real 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.880
 terrible and chicken that really 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.060
 I think like this by the way 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.290
 yes this 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.600
 length of my own first one 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.700
 review I wrote on my blog and I 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.829
 will indeed I have him by now 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.000
 written at the bottom just link and this is 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.039
 I think this is one of the first things 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.630
 where I actually have a wall a lot about 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.190
 wrote this is very nice for that 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.680
 back late i'm also going to read you seriously 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.269
 I am curious how I was in then 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.610
 my writing style and in my photos and so on 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.040
 but well she really didn't wrap any pigment 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.860
 I got it from the orange for that 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.599
 used 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.190
 Queensday or football live in the afternoon 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.500
 or so but now on a different palette 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.819
 which also is in a beautiful orange than 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.160
 maybe I'll add it again 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.230
 and the other palette is this one 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.989
 devastated I have this drop 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.790
 really super dull but this is really nice 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.980
 palette all shimmer colors 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.780
 all very creamy very beautiful 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.670
 pigmentation is really great you can too 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.989
 see it in reviews but yes this is not 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.010
 more for sale 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.780
 otherwise I really just had new van 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.280
 buy this one because it costs no shit and me 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.690
 I think the quality of this is very good 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.980
 I thought I was going to some 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.560
 what I love from my eye shadow palette 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.209
 and that they have this action app 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.739
 I had a wife for the burgundy color 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.579
 I now also have my eye look 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.739
 experienced and I want to go your bordeaux 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.320
 try red eye shadow but not 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.609
 I would buy an expensive brand right away 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.709
 I thought this is natural 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.970
 ideal because it costs no turd and them 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.500
 know very well try out whether I 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.359
 Anyway it was up to see if you like it 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.500
 whether you or yes yes beautiful looks with that color 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.510
 can make 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.640
 democracy is a very possible whole 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.840
 well with your brush about the color sense and 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.660
 then apply 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.910
 but if you apply it wet speculation 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.260
 or grandma better and yes the quality I think 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.709
 not very great of these 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.100
 but yes it is nice to do something like that 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.500
 to attempt 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.660
 I want a mascara from the action de mix 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:42.010
 mascara double lash effect 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.269
 And yes I have a little duty once 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.650
 with my done so you can too 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.700
 view if you like it he is 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.920
 good 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.450
 certainly for the price but I still use it 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.829
 would rather have other crimes than just 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.230
 what better find where I already have more 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:55.269
 for paid so yes this is nice if you like 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.160
 starts with makeup to try it out 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.200
 this really a must and what it costs 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.860
 not even a euro in my opinion then 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.470
 I have a lot of lipsticks and 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.570
 I think of two types of lines 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.580
 first is from mexx makeup i have this one 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.060
 of which you are these have a silver 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.010
 sleeve 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.770
 and I also have a review about this 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.600
 Written pigmentation is very good 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:19.310
 differed meters because there is one in between 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.500
 it is really shiny oh you can 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.090
 thrown away this billion shine and 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.450
 these are all with your creamy creamy 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.740
 and colors are a few nice ones 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.560
 but on a few i don't use them 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.120
 like this I almost never made it but me 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.440
 I always find it very nice and shows 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.020
 don't sit very long two or three hours 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.630
 without eating you say and yes it is 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.830
 just great certainly nice to do nice jobs 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.470
 from the try not so long ago 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.780
 I bought these four colors real 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.030
 fall colors with your dark barry 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.470
 color is brownish red and yellow 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.340
 I especially like these two above stem 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.440
 beautiful 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:56.480
 that is looveren's and function yes and and 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.340
 This hearing also pretty nifty indeed so 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.280
 really a bit of a dark color 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.830
 cranberry and this fire not very beautiful 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.330
 fan british more bit brown pink and me 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.090
 do not yet know what I think of it 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.610
 and anyway i hope they page the 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.430
 and then they are lipsticks 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.040
 80 cents I think yes you can 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.479
 don't leave and I really like the color 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.030
 these are colors really something alive in the 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:21.380
 fall and that you really see a lot now 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.380
 also as the more expensive brands we mac 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.150
 for example or just in the drugstore 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.090
 so yes i like it very much i have 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.770
 also three pluses actually four 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.660
 but and just when I put all my stuff on 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.550
 was collecting the action 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.440
 think i got my stash when it fell 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.870
 package and of course a blush broke 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.970
 unfortunately the picture cut my stash 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.410
 I guess but I could 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.280
 I crashed that I don't think so 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.950
 will do 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.630
 but good as the first, this is also 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.060
 quite god use is also pretty 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.470
 like and often 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.180
 but yes that has also broken you 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.130
 the packaging is not very thunderous 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.680
 with the action but well there you pay 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:00.800
 also simply not for that is this me 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.810
 will give this is called the little finger altogether 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.590
 dissolve color that I now also and the 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:08.210
 pigmentation yes look but this is just 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.380
 it's just yes sorry but I think so 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.900
 that's very nice for the price you pay 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.150
 pays for now with all those eyes in it 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.490
 for I think yes really I find this very 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.590
 very nice that I have such a round and this one 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.800
 also break very often this is a pink 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.330
 hat and this smear a bit one 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.570
 find something here orange color jane 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.729
 where myself always look good 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.910
 pigmentation is again really good 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:32.860
 and yes very nice recommended 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.910
 and then also a square and this is 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.210
 little finger 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:39.070
 rose and yes this is a very nice one 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.110
 little purplish with a purple undertone 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:43.660
 I like to ask this if I am a little 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:46.750
 a cool one or a few i will pin on 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:48.910
 and this is also the pigmentation 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.380
 again very good yes I know news 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.910
 can do with the action but the 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.669
 I think the quality of a product is real 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.110
 well for that price really great this is 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:58.180
 everything I like about the action and pair 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:00.430
 makeup I can do action makeup very whole 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.560
 very much recommend it if you like it 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.270
 starts with make-up for a quick test 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.330
 to build then you can look forward 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:09.460
 test what my condition is then my needs 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.009
 lipstick color well what do I like 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.360
 think that means these are really common 

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:16.419
 this is the price to spend it for 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.880
 try saying so cheap so yes 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:20.320
 recommend ex makeup and it is not like that 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.090
 that you are a cunning as your ex you 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.949
 wear or use makeup 

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.630
 it's just fun to participate
