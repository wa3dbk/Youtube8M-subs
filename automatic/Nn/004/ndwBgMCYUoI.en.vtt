00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 This short video is about now 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.759
 not about the primary functions of 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.740
 smart shelf but we want you 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.019
 just show some 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.010
 Possibilities of combining them with 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.259
 load smart reader 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.160
 I have a garage system here 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.810
 prepared 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.699
 also two-dimensional so I am in the 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.830
 level below have gone body 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.330
 input and the whole thing I will now 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.449
 populate it so they look like that 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.000
 something looks like when appliances are hung up 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.500
 or are inserted 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.420
 that would be a slow order , for example 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.399
 solution and with a little bit of fantasy 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.739
 Now imagine these others 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.230
 Teacher body or hook still stocked 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.910
 in front 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.570
 I refer especially for example 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.760
 on the corp load i have here 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:53.610
 two full buckets with one 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:56.430
 lawn fertilizers or swimming pools ph - 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.109
 built in and they weigh together about 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.260
 20 kilo 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:06.450
 the hook load is included per hook 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:09.060
 about 22 5 kilo per corp up to 27 kilo 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.530
 I build all again now to order 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.479
 show them like this 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.830
 railing system as it is mounted here 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.090
 it could also look different here 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.280
 First , the naked one again 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.460
 railing system as it is on the wall 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.759
 mounted and now a new one 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.840
 Configuration of the hook and fork here 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:36.299
 the modified configuration is equipped 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:38.610
 and in the next video mode determines the 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.150
 was then the solution for a particular 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.600
 version according to your wishes 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.009
 interesting is also the situation that 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.130
 she hooked over a double s 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.649
 long-handled objects over one underneath 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.799
 lying rail with for example 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.530
 parallel hooks can lead to the 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.280
 for example, rake or shovel 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.130
 hang 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:08.929
 So just space-saving original 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:11.420
 and absolutely varied 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.040
 Please do not forget that the smart 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.349
 shelf system not only in the horizontal 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.829
 but also in the vertical direction 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.239
 can expand is a module system that 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:26.629
 I can permanently expand 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.670
 remodeling can be dismantled saves space 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.859
 is and not just for garage cellar 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.420
 or hobby room is suitable but 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:36.109
 because of the very high quality 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:42.459
 processing also for rooms in the house like 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:46.310
 kitchen nursery hallway laundry or 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:49.340
 Smart cellar only exists
