00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.410 

like<00:00:50.920> me<00:00:51.070> it's<00:00:51.220> got<00:00:51.430> blemishes<00:00:51.940> I<00:00:52.090> mean<00:00:52.240> it's

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
like me it's got blemishes I mean it's

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.910

just right but I think that's that's
what<00:01:02.830> makes<00:01:03.010> it<00:01:03.130> interesting<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:04.570> I<00:01:05.260> found

what makes it interesting and I found

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.350 
what makes it interesting and I found

that particularly in the printmaking

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.660 
that particularly in the printmaking

image<00:02:08.979> of<00:02:09.310> which<00:02:09.610> part<00:02:09.880> of<00:02:09.940> that<00:02:10.000> area<00:02:10.500> cover

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
image of which part of that area cover

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.940 
image of which part of that area cover
up<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.890> lens<00:02:12.720> come<00:02:13.720> back<00:02:13.840> over<00:02:14.140> here<00:02:14.380> have

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
up the lens come back over here have

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.640 
up the lens come back over here have
separate<00:02:15.459> exposures<00:02:15.790> I<00:02:16.239> open<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.019> tube<00:02:17.230> I

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
separate exposures I open the tube I

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.280 
separate exposures I open the tube I
will<00:02:17.970> duct<00:02:18.970> tape<00:02:19.180> or<00:02:19.360> clamp<00:02:19.600> this<00:02:19.750> paper<00:02:20.049> to

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
will duct tape or clamp this paper to

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.170 
will duct tape or clamp this paper to
the<00:02:20.410> wall<00:02:20.590> then<00:02:21.220> expose<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.730> paper<00:02:21.910> for

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
the wall then expose the paper for

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.000 
the wall then expose the paper for
however<00:02:22.390> long<00:02:22.570> I<00:02:22.840> need<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.380> mean<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.890> best

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
however long I need to I mean the best

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.190 
however long I need to I mean the best
thing<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.280> can<00:02:24.340> do<00:02:24.580> is<00:02:24.760> kind<00:02:24.910> of<00:02:25.030> take<00:02:25.239> what's

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
thing I can do is kind of take what's

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.350 
thing I can do is kind of take what's
given<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.530> me<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:26.890> kind<00:02:27.730> of<00:02:27.760> make<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.030> best<00:02:28.209> of

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
given to me and kind of make the best of

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.150 
given to me and kind of make the best of
it<00:02:28.480> it's<00:02:29.019> not<00:02:29.260> me<00:02:29.410> I<00:02:29.440> don't<00:02:29.590> have<00:02:29.769> control<00:02:29.950> over

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
it it's not me I don't have control over

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.250 
it it's not me I don't have control over
this<00:02:30.430> I<00:02:30.670> have<00:02:31.150> an<00:02:31.239> idea<00:02:31.510> of<00:02:31.600> what<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:31.870> want<00:02:32.200> the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
this I have an idea of what I want the

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.190 
this I have an idea of what I want the
work<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:32.680> look<00:02:32.830> like<00:02:33.100> and<00:02:33.570> I<00:02:34.570> want<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.840> exert

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
work to look like and I want to exert

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.320 
work to look like and I want to exert
some<00:02:35.500> control<00:02:35.530> over<00:02:35.890> it<00:02:36.190> but<00:02:36.489> if<00:02:37.030> I<00:02:37.090> try<00:02:37.299> to

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
some control over it but if I try to

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.960 
some control over it but if I try to
control<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:37.840> too<00:02:37.989> much<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.440> looks<00:02:38.970> artificial

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
control it too much it looks artificial

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.240 
control it too much it looks artificial
and<00:02:40.090> manufactured<00:02:40.750> you<00:02:41.709> end<00:02:41.860> up<00:02:41.920> with<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.070> lot

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
and manufactured you end up with a lot

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.650 
and manufactured you end up with a lot
of<00:02:42.280> interesting<00:02:42.790> artifacts<00:02:43.180> in<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.420> final

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
of interesting artifacts in the final

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.890 
of interesting artifacts in the final
print<00:02:43.930> this<00:02:44.860> was<00:02:45.070> actually<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:46.600> place<00:02:46.780> I

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
print this was actually the the place I

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.380 
print this was actually the the place I
was<00:02:47.019> making<00:02:47.290> these<00:02:47.440> prints<00:02:48.000> was<00:02:49.000> using<00:02:49.299> these

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
was making these prints was using these

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.050 
was making these prints was using these
old<00:02:49.600> library<00:02:49.989> tables<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:51.400> make<00:02:51.519> my<00:02:51.640> prints<00:02:51.910> on

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
old library tables to make my prints on

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.470 
old library tables to make my prints on
that's<00:02:52.480> actually<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.049> edge<00:02:53.140> of<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.350> table

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
that's actually the edge of the table

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.020 
that's actually the edge of the table
you<00:02:55.480> have<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.690> edge<00:02:55.810> of<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.080> Plexiglas<00:02:57.030> that

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
you have the edge of the Plexiglas that

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.610 
you have the edge of the Plexiglas that
holds<00:02:58.299> down<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.540> work<00:02:58.870> you<00:02:59.350> have<00:02:59.380> some

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
holds down the work you have some

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.080 
holds down the work you have some
developer<00:03:00.130> residue

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
developer residue

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.640 
developer residue
I<00:03:01.180> think<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.810> best<00:03:01.989> prints<00:03:02.290> are<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.470> ones

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
I think the best prints are the ones

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.259 
I think the best prints are the ones
where<00:03:02.950> you<00:03:03.310> can't<00:03:03.550> tell<00:03:03.819> where<00:03:04.060> the

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
where you can't tell where the

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.440 
where you can't tell where the
photograph<00:03:05.230> ends<00:03:05.709> and<00:03:06.069> the<00:03:06.280> squirrel<00:03:07.180> enos

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
photograph ends and the squirrel enos

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.270 
photograph ends and the squirrel enos
begins<00:03:07.870> it's<00:03:08.379> the<00:03:08.560> signature<00:03:08.920> for<00:03:09.129> these

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
begins it's the signature for these

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.130 
begins it's the signature for these
pieces<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:09.970> it's<00:03:10.330> a<00:03:10.450> signature<00:03:10.750> of<00:03:10.900> Who<00:03:11.019> I<00:03:11.110> am

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
pieces and it's a signature of Who I am

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.110 
pieces and it's a signature of Who I am
as<00:03:11.379> an<00:03:11.500> artist<00:03:11.560> there's<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.280> lot<00:03:12.400> of<00:03:12.580> you<00:03:12.970> could

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
as an artist there's a lot of you could

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.360 
as an artist there's a lot of you could
see<00:03:13.330> all<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.900> various<00:03:14.290> gears<00:03:14.769> and<00:03:15.099> you<00:03:15.220> could

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
see all the various gears and you could

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.059 
see all the various gears and you could
read<00:03:15.610> labels<00:03:15.849> on<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.239> machinery<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:16.810> things

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
read labels on the machinery and things

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.130 
read labels on the machinery and things
when<00:03:18.069> you<00:03:18.160> make<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.459> prints<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:19.660> lose<00:03:19.930> some

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
when you make the prints you lose some

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.970 
when you make the prints you lose some
of<00:03:20.170> that<00:03:20.260> detail<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:22.410> you<00:03:23.410> know<00:03:23.530> originally<00:03:23.950> I

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
of that detail and you know originally I

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.130 
of that detail and you know originally I
thought<00:03:24.220> well<00:03:24.430> this<00:03:24.670> is<00:03:24.819> just<00:03:24.849> a<00:03:25.209> lesser<00:03:25.870> image

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
thought well this is just a lesser image

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.500 
thought well this is just a lesser image
now<00:03:26.349> but<00:03:26.760> instead<00:03:27.760> I<00:03:27.819> wanted<00:03:28.239> to<00:03:28.360> try<00:03:28.480> to

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
now but instead I wanted to try to

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.270 
now but instead I wanted to try to
compensate<00:03:28.810> with<00:03:29.140> that<00:03:29.290> with<00:03:29.739> my<00:03:29.890> printmaking

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
compensate with that with my printmaking

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.960 
compensate with that with my printmaking
technique<00:03:30.700> so<00:03:31.540> I<00:03:32.280> really<00:03:33.280> played<00:03:33.549> around<00:03:33.610> a

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
technique so I really played around a

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.470 
technique so I really played around a
lot<00:03:34.150> with<00:03:35.310> solarizing<00:03:36.310> with<00:03:37.090> using<00:03:37.390> the

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
lot with solarizing with using the

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.990 
lot with solarizing with using the
developer<00:03:37.989> if<00:03:38.829> it<00:03:39.250> tells<00:03:39.400> a<00:03:39.579> story<00:03:39.610> that

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
developer if it tells a story that

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.309 
developer if it tells a story that
wasn't<00:03:40.150> there<00:03:40.420> before<00:03:40.540> you<00:03:40.780> had<00:03:40.959> this<00:03:41.170> whole

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
wasn't there before you had this whole

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.130 
wasn't there before you had this whole
series<00:03:41.680> of<00:03:41.739> flames<00:03:42.099> that<00:03:42.400> are<00:03:42.519> kind<00:03:42.700> of

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
series of flames that are kind of

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.120 
series of flames that are kind of
kicking<00:03:44.140> at<00:03:44.230> Richard's<00:03:44.530> feet<00:03:44.739> as<00:03:44.890> he's

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
kicking at Richard's feet as he's

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.890 
kicking at Richard's feet as he's
climbing<00:03:45.489> up<00:03:45.579> the<00:03:45.670> ladder<00:03:45.700> I<00:03:46.120> use<00:03:46.390> giant<00:03:46.660> rolls

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
climbing up the ladder I use giant rolls

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.569 
climbing up the ladder I use giant rolls
of<00:03:47.079> the<00:03:47.110> photographic<00:03:47.530> paper<00:03:47.769> for<00:03:48.459> my

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
of the photographic paper for my

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.490 
of the photographic paper for my
negative<00:03:48.940> I<00:03:49.150> also<00:03:49.390> use<00:03:49.629> that<00:03:49.810> for<00:03:49.870> my<00:03:50.049> positive

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
negative I also use that for my positive

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.580 
negative I also use that for my positive
whether<00:03:51.040> you're<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.599> high-end<00:03:52.599> collector<00:03:53.079> or

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
whether you're a high-end collector or
