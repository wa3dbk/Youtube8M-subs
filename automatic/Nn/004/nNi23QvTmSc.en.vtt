00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.310 
to discard while it's here because i was

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.550

but<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.310> on<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.640> bright<00:01:11.880> side<00:01:11.910> i'm<00:01:12.600> not<00:01:12.720> a

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
but on the on the bright side i'm not a

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.150 
but on the on the bright side i'm not a
little<00:01:12.960> loss<00:01:13.110> at<00:01:13.290> what<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.440> discard<00:01:13.650> for<00:01:14.130> a

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
little loss at what to discard for a

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.830 
little loss at what to discard for a
liliana<00:01:14.550> so<00:01:14.990> that's<00:01:15.990> good<00:01:16.230> or<00:01:17.570> I<00:01:18.570> could<00:01:18.810> just

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
liliana so that's good or I could just

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.380 
liliana so that's good or I could just
make<00:01:19.080> them<00:01:19.220> sack<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.370> bird<00:01:20.580> which<00:01:20.880> also<00:01:21.060> seems

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
make them sack of bird which also seems

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.910 
make them sack of bird which also seems
good<00:01:21.690> so<00:01:23.120> let's<00:01:24.120> do<00:01:24.360> that

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.300 

but<00:01:28.920> yeah<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.700> assume<00:01:30.630> he<00:01:30.720> has<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> Geist<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.350> hand

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.580 

and<00:01:35.600> that's<00:01:36.600> why<00:01:36.869> he<00:01:37.020> couldn't<00:01:37.140> play<00:01:37.380> it

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
and that's why he couldn't play it

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.710 
and that's why he couldn't play it
because<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.180> mana<00:01:39.180> base<00:01:40.369> well<00:01:41.659> now<00:01:42.659> he

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
because of the mana base well now he

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.469 
because of the mana base well now he
gets<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.049> play<00:01:43.229> his<00:01:43.470> bird<00:01:43.680> or<00:01:44.340> his<00:01:44.490> Geist<00:01:44.759> and
