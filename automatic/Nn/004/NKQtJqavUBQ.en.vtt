00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:14.280
 Hi guys, everybody here is today until 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.650
 that I gave you this map that I 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.720
 I've been doing it a long time that I am 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.689
 trying to get an idea about it from the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.769
 beginning of the year and I decided to start it 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.949
 these days 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.439
 only reinforces the inscription, but the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.170
 scenery for you here until from 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.620
 workshop that this one is actually a 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.710
 map of the break fast for those who played cs 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.149
 1.6 know is this is what I think 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.010
 Who knows, this one is a police station. 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.899
 and thief for those who have never seen this 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.780
 thief is a political thief that he is the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.379
 who is a cop you have to take care of 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.640
 prisoners you can do is 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.239
 joking things up then you can 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.690
 kill the guys if we want to and this 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.939
 map is proof that I 'm waiting for him 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.090
 have the map of cs same right 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.700
 so it's going to be much bigger than that 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.500
 show you here because when 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.000
 Do you have any suggestions for here? 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.990
 on map flour presents us 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.830
 comments 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.290
 and it's basically that's the map okay 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.560
 simple so far it 's just that part of the 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.630
 make are the benches that I know the cell is 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.280
 so it gets general use so it has to 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.979
 evaluated and here are these matches here 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.960
 are the prisoners when it's time to start 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.060
 the game I've been watching the system yet 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.150
 that when a person dies it does not 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.680
 paulo is the store is in perfect mode but 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.479
 This is going to be a bit tense because I have 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.360
 to make several modifications on the map 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.210
 But soon I 'm doing here to 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.040
 Do you like it there and do you want me? 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.460
 continue to favor favoritism in the 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.040
 animation and I have here is that q sic 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.820
 today I had to do the bob series 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.549
 sponge 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.290
 But it did not work very well . 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.329
 some problems there then tomorrow 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.250
 will probably have this series then 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.009
 connected to the channel and also 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.390
 probably in the coming days there this 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.120
 next 10 earth 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.850
 the week will have the comb there because 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.580
 came back almost ending it then it would be 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.020
 election also sent since then 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.180
 did you like and want continuity or the 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.420
 favor and after grace in this video 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.850
 this becomes if you sign up then this is 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.850
 now you can come out said
