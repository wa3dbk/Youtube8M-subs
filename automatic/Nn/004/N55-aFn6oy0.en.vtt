00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:14.790
 Today he does see how it was done or 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:19.210
 of paper or a paper helicopter this 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:23.439
 however, it is kind of finished for pretty well with del 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:39.639
 gene then certainly not my sheet of 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:45.459
 paper then we cut out a strip there 

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:48.850
 should be fine then we cut one 

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:52.440
 bit 30 with boards to make 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:01:08.500
 then the helicopter would be better 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:11.320
 citizens then now it is enough to explain 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.869
 a sheet such as here 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:24.070
 that I must say in height like that yes 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:27.850
 then you have to cut here up to about 5 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:31.630
 mm danieli and form this house of 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:37.270
 so the fans now cut you 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:42.249
 these two up here and we do n't have a 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:44.109
 piece of a piece of remains now 

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:46.409
 this was caloric 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:49.390
 now to complete our thing 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.509
 you have to take some strips of 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:58.359
 paper cut people from it 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:59.380
 sheet like these is quite the 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:02.469
 truth 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:25.030
 world so let's go feed 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:31.420
 strips 17 now the scissors ad 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:33.489
 example taking our prototype 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.349
 let's take it and there it was 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:43.450
 they curl up all around 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:47.849
 so that a weight is formed on the 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:50.799
 bottom now you always continue from there 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:54.640
 without bothering immediately otherwise 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:56.819
 It would be a waste of you do annoys 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.819
 so 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.969
 and then many adults pay a product 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.969
 with this big 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:27.519
 now I take the scotch has them 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:32.049
 torn piece and glued it like this 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.049
 one that hangs 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:49.000
 then here it would be better to put others 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:58.930
 goals 1335 another and another 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:04:07.760
 then select another another 2 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:10.329
 1 and 2 background but now we piss off the 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.329
 all 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.569
 so 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.380
 you have to bother at the bottom is a lot 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:27.669
 important or it'll not move and will not be 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:35.610
 stable is once your annoyed 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:35.610
 eric holder I face this helicopter 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:49.000
 now I don't know why if I saw needle 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:54.150
 here if here maybe with a little better but 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.150
 it turns and lands completely stable 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:04.380
 now access certain light i 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:08.550
 I'll bet up here 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:14.970
 there is a little more height 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:20.180
 you saw this video is everything 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.180
 commentate is in crisis hello
