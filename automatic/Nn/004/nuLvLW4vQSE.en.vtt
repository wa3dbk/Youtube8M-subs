00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:31.119
 follow his example 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.119
 Why 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.150
 this day is to say 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.150
 during his stay 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.740
 we are in the hard 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.010
 strong of his score is still 0-0 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.880
 if things happen in another 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.410
 waiting for the shock of the explosion 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.420
 his arguments 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.900
 last week 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.580
 coach who is higher 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.580
 the sound is excellent in France 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.280
 for its processors 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.890
 we are happy to be here too 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.810
 Because 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.810
 it touches the sprint 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.880
 it's for me too 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.590
 the society 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.730
 too few resources 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.730
 for everyone 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:15.169
 these are always under the guise of blood 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:23.429
 10:16 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:26.429
 It's certain 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.739
 v 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.889
 v 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.999
 v 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:54.529
