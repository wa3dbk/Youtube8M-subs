00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.390
 the filmmaker is that they do not study here what we are going to realize is a 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.090
 Clothing edition is 100% 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:10.490
 dente sar de 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.610
 from scratch we're not going to take pictures the whole illustration we're going to do 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.829
 here with photos or 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:20.149
 haiti as you can see and I already have the image in italy so first thing the 

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:23.579
 stellar a new layer for each garment that we will work 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:26.109
 I'm going to start with the blouse 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.369
 I already created my new house 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.439
 so that others do not know how to modify 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.690
 there they lock all the other things that he paints 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.360
 i good 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.530
 Start 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.290
 for this doctor who thinks pen release we will use 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.300
 brushes maybe the filling lady as it goes 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.700
 second in the edition the type but then basically everything esplÃ¡ 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.020
 I started plume mint then it occurred to me 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.940
 who will I start with a marine inspired blouse 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160
 begins to redraw above the arch 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.530
 this will be the examination of their quota so they have the pitfalls 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.530
 the cct 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.730
 dear Mons 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.450
 stuffed 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.880
 i 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.980
 Well obviously you have to take into account the outline 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.790
 yes yes that meaning so then the salary problems a little bit all the 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.910
 outline do so this act 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:48.969
 because I borrow it 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:52.499
 the parades toads are the way that suddenly a blouse is given a piece 

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:53.770
 leather on the outside 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.170
 the ideal is that I stayed a little 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.470
 so by 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.010
 outside 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.580
 a little more forgiveness of the marked line if of the white 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.680
 so that pieces of skin are coming out of our clothes 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.499
 i 

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:12.699
 well they also use the zoom in case it is necessary 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:16.809
 client I do not have very good view 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:18.859
 so 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:20.789
 I put sun 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:23.789
 together with the key 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:27.439
 track 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.369
 and good 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:32.369
 I'm going to finish my blouse 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:37.549
 I cadillac that I will not talk 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:38.680
 Windows of 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.159
 peace 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.599
 as well 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.609
 readers but that's called 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.269
 i cooked the selection i do not want i like to be white 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:53.089
 and said the white color 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:56.309
 i with a brush 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:59.249
 try to make it from the firm judicial 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:03.109
 that have such opacity continue unless they pay to do some 

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:06.339
 class 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:08.449
 degraded or something 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:12.689
 and well and I'm fine I have my lights but obviously states are very 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.539
 simple I will not be like this 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:17.629
 so 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.849
 min the sive there are those who did not have enough to select 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.369
 then they can use the free selection tool 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:27.129
 you gain the shift key 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.540
 and good selection in these brush this stress and sad 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.139
 They got out 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.209
 He said they were there 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.209
 so that it is perfectly as real as possible 

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:41.469
 i fonts election masters 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:45.659
 whenever they use a step they try to save the simple request the pen 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.989
 the guards 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.760
 so that they will not have places in this sample any correction on everything 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.699
 I know I'm going to get it I like it 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:57.049
 without these careers 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.049
 now I'm going to make a bridge or I can think of what 

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:02.680
 quintana 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.999
 and good, I'll always be a neck 

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:07.999
 they knew him but this country I like a lot 

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:29.879
 to be given in perspective not depending on how Lavazza wake 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:32.530
 i see also 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.729
 create a company without selected 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.729
 they grab a free selection tool by pressing the shift keys 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.319
 i close our 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.139
 intel I want this piece of 20n 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.080
 in it clothes then 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.400
 they select red or not 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.120
 from the nfl 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.120
 i went through a hundred hince 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.919
 to her that is not 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.499
 and good if I want to try it and some effect rumbita then 

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:07.580
 it's the empire is here in a van grabbing 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.629
 since the darkest begins for students with color 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:14.759
 Well yes, some think with 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.639
 something to drink has therefore given a soft brush 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:23.029
 so 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:26.519
 the panacea in the Yankee amount is not totally flat 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:31.689
 his mother his part 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:36.479
 kennedy certain details that are afp remove customers 70 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.120
 after some attempt 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.669
 i 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:52.699
 I do not like it then I'm going to defend it, it's always 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.059
 inside that this was going well 

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:59.059
 of the last round was the one that they zone 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:02.169
 so 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.849
 returned to the real 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:07.849
 tinsel 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:09.379
 After his 

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:12.830
 a portento 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.039
 i here too 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:17.770
 of dollars 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.449
 inter in normal size 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:22.249
 and well I think it has 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:24.759
 a better way 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:29.430
 then again I'll grab the one I want the edges to have another color 

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:33.089
 To wear 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:39.639

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:49.450
 again the truth is that he spent it with him 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.169
 control z 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:55.419
 really if I'm wrong I'm very pleased with everyone when it comes to closing 

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:58.669
 actors 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:02.190
 when choosing the colors and so on, 

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:12.610

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.869
