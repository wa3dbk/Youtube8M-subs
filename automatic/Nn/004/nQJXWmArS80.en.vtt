00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.510
 very often i will always go after mine 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.699
 black and white look like I asked the 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.560
 I must confess also this 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.090
 Base 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.270
 priest many many years ago 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.750
 I downloaded it, I believe 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.070
 press at heaven i think i know it 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.539
 not exactly, I'd like 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.340
 show in a nutshell what basically taken 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.289
 the base is or the 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.879
 secret behind this black white 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.600
 I like to look very user 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.530
 the point is that I am very very 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.089
 high contrast black and white pictures 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.610
 that means I have black here 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:43.800
 areas really drowned 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.190
 are and I have white areas the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.229
 tend to be eaten up so 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.479
 Burned out and I always say 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:54.299
 my color space is just like that 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:56.309
 eroded and drowned 

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:57.629
 like all other colors and if you are 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.080
 black and white you can see that I think 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.519
 OK, but let's get into it 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.739
 Development now I am taking 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.350
 again a virtual copy go into the 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.630
 development model set the picture 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.680
 back and say again here attitude 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.040
 previously copy settings to afterwards 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.460
 or 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.740
 afterwards to before now we start with 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.210
 the black white and you look around her 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.109
 if you are here by default as well 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.109
 black and white clicks in lightroom that is 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:29.850
 actually pretty mau so that's for 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:32.999
 my taste for my taste 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.069
 too low contrast I start now 

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:37.200
 so that I have the contrast high here 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:38.969
 So pull on me can it pop 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.439
 Contrast is therefore always so 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:46.740
 up to 70 80 then I go as 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:51.950
 next integration courses on rgb 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:54.749
 channel so and now I draw the deep ones 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:01.380
 pretty far down so really here 

00:01:54.749 --> 00:02:03.479
 so on - about the dark 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.450
 medium sounds also piece down the 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.720
 is here in the area 30 40 and the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.280
 bright midrange the lights a whole 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.459
 bit so that of course now 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.080
 a bit weird you see yes 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.270
 already of the image overall very dark 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.650
 become a tip against tax 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.240
 I now just the exposure 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.650
 turn up you see that's all 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.420
 a bit unorthodox, then 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.730
 usually you do not get on it 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.379
 to do something like that 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.640
 I have to confess I will 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.650
 most likely never yourself 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.180
 come on but this preset what 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.220
 I have downloaded some point the 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.480
 It was just made and I have 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.340
 then someday just for me 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.769
 adopted and appropriate mine 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.530
 needs adjusted so now i can 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:45.709
 here with my lights deep and such 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.750
 continue to control rules according to rework 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.709
 now i can for example still here 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.650
 the lights a bit high I can with 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.120
 the depth knob details again 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.730
 I can work out about the black 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.620
 governor again drown a little more 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.599
 leave or the black area something 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.790
 high turns the beautiful is that the reason 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.890
 contrast of the picture remains relatively good 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.590
 So it will not be woman anymore even if 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.599
 I pull the black up a bit like that 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.340
 I can do exactly this with these rules 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:17.379
 play a bit and I do that 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:22.160
 I just think so in total 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:24.099
 that's about as it should 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.180
 suffice 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.670
 now comes a little bit more clarity 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.030
 in there we have to take care again 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.130
 Of course, the skin pores get clarity 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.470
 out the model has here 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:41.109
 luckily very very good skin 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:43.510
 of a place nor do I here before rhade 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:46.510
 wrong tool i wanted this 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.889
 make some small ones here 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.889
 impurities away easily from the 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:53.599
 because I just noticed it 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:55.400
 and because it kicks me and these are 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.760
 I always have to do things like that somehow 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.049
 Immediately because I just do it 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.370
 disturbs and of course all the more 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:04.280
 stronger to the fore 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.919
 the more contrast the look is in 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.090
 but fortunately that is not 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:11.000
 especially much we do here 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.349
 so now we can have one here 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.160
 little bit of the black and white mixture 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:19.940
 turn and especially the yellow orange 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:24.310
 or red sounds something down when 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:28.300
 we want that so now we can do it here 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:31.310
 that still adapt a bit but that 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.050
 they are already pretty good 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.650
 here maybe I can yet again, 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.530
 rausholen deep something 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.350
 that was it and I like that 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.410
 actually very good what we are now 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:49.139
 still can do sometimes I grab in 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:51.430
 the apartment shares a very minimal 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.979
 23 4 percent 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.720
 so a bit yellow orange so 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.820
 really just a very small one 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.910
 house that's just for that 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.320
 picture is not that hard in the reason 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.120
 I do not like housing 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.009
 black and white pictures that's really just 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.820
 for a certain amount of ground heat 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:09.880
 produce 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.650
 Of course we have here now 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.870
 a few small things to do the skin 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.639
 actually pulls out very well I am 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.800
 also no friend of the skin too smooth 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.180
 to iron what I'm doing now I suppose 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.780
 here simply the clarity regulator 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.990
 so go approximately -80 and catch you 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:28.300
 so much about the skin here 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.699
 you must not exaggerate it then 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.400
 disappearing, the skin texture, the 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:35.560
 I do not like my stuff at all 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.289
 opinion it is very scary 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.940
 so these cover pages of some 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:41.620
 magazines where the skin is really total 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.820
 is ironed smooth if you do not 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.380
 then you just need new ones 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.580
 brush do it again because you feeling 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.199
 again over it and now you see 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.139
 already if I do this here and on 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.940
 Eye like the skin a bit 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:53.430
 Therefore, plastic becomes moderately easy 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.440
 let's stay with the 1 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.760
 you can also come here for a bit 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.190
 to play the controller 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.870
 that should be absolutely sufficient 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.150
 but I still need new brushes 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.599
 because what I definitely have to do is 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:11.949
 work out the eye something 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:14.919
 press the button and mark it 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:17.650
 this is not the case anymore 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:20.490
 sharp does not give him that good 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:23.889
 can recognize edges but that's enough 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:26.050
 Okay, to take that away and then 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:28.930
 the key h with these points 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.699
 disappear and the eye gets now 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.280
 a bit of exposure a half 

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:34.900
 Iris about the deep holes I get too 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.669
 easy out and a whole 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.710
 little clarity and that's just it 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:39.880
 really this sparkle in the eyes 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:44.970
 hey says 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:49.050
 wow to conclusion I look again in 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:52.300
 the sharpening purely but that for 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:56.440
 My taste as if nothing here 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:07:00.970
 maybe it needs to be sharpened again 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:04.160
 put the mask over it and maybe 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:06.890
 a little bit hurt 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.440
 and the picture is finished, let's see 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:11.780
 us before and after 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.550
 and that's really two completely 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.110
 different worlds so that 's one 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.210
 bit the base of my black white 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.250
 look straight with these regulators 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:21.170
 Here deep lights and so on because 

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.910
 I do the fine tuning of the reason 

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.430
 lure is actually in the tradition 

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:27.380
 curve appeared in conjunction with 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.240
 this hard contrast and this 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:32.150
 gross overexposure here because so 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:36.580
 a bit opposite works yes 

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:36.580
 so much for my black and white look
