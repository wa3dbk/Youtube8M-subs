forts it's smaller than expected

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.830 
forts it's smaller than expected
it's<00:01:47.540> absolutely<00:01:48.650> kind<00:01:49.650> of<00:01:49.800> very<00:01:49.980> pretty<00:01:50.840> and

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
can't take 3d photos if you look on the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.340 
can't take 3d photos if you look on the
back<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:35.280> still<00:02:35.610> has<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.540> two<00:02:36.690> cameras<00:02:37.140> this

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
back it still has the two cameras this

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.430 
back it still has the two cameras this
allows<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:37.740> take<00:02:38.430> 3d<00:02:38.880> photo<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.330> video

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
allows you to take 3d photo and video

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.110 
allows you to take 3d photo and video

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
and upload it to any 3d enabled devices

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.290 
and upload it to any 3d enabled devices
so<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.690> can<00:02:42.780> get<00:02:43.050> a<00:02:43.410> new<00:02:43.860> addition<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.670> 2d

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
so you can get a new addition to the 2d
