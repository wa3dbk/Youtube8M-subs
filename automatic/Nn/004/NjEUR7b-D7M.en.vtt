have the treads sit flat in the routes
of<00:01:32.900> the<00:01:33.050> stringer

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.920 

now<00:01:43.710> temporarily<00:01:44.460> install<00:01:45.060> wedges<00:01:45.570> as<00:01:45.750> you

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
now temporarily install wedges as you

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.050 
now temporarily install wedges as you
did<00:01:46.140> for<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.470> other<00:01:46.620> side

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.660 

next<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.180> can<00:01:54.299> lay<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.719> stair<00:01:55.020> over<00:01:55.469> flat<00:01:55.770> you

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
next you can lay the stair over flat you

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.420 
next you can lay the stair over flat you
may<00:01:56.820> want<00:01:57.060> some<00:01:57.270> help<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.689> doing<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:58.049> part

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.880 

now<00:02:02.430> here<00:02:02.939> comes<00:02:03.149> an<00:02:03.299> important<00:02:03.750> part<00:02:04.020> we<00:02:04.649> need

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
now here comes an important part we need

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.639 
now here comes an important part we need
to<00:02:05.039> make<00:02:05.189> sure<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.700> stair<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.270> square<00:02:06.720> we<00:02:07.439> do

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
to make sure the stair is square we do

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.710 
to make sure the stair is square we do
this<00:02:07.860> by<00:02:08.190> taking<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.819> diagonal<00:02:09.360> measurement

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
this by taking a diagonal measurement

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.830 
this by taking a diagonal measurement
from<00:02:10.289> any<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:11.069> same<00:02:11.430> points<00:02:11.940> on<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.269> stair<00:02:12.569> and

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
from any to same points on the stair and

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.900 
from any to same points on the stair and
repeating<00:02:13.709> it<00:02:13.800> for<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.130> other<00:02:14.280> side

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
repeating it for the other side

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.080 
repeating it for the other side
both<00:02:15.569> measurements<00:02:16.319> should<00:02:16.709> be<00:02:16.980> within<00:02:17.190> 1/8

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
both measurements should be within 1/8

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.660 
both measurements should be within 1/8
of<00:02:18.330> an<00:02:18.450> inch<00:02:18.720> from<00:02:19.230> each<00:02:19.380> other<00:02:19.650> this<00:02:20.430> would

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
of an inch from each other this would

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.990 
of an inch from each other this would
mean<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:21.180> your<00:02:21.360> stair<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:22.019> no<00:02:22.290> more<00:02:22.650> than

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
mean that your stair is no more than

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.160 
mean that your stair is no more than
1/16<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.209> an<00:02:24.330> inch<00:02:24.480> out<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:25.110> square<00:02:30.110> now<00:02:31.110> you

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
1/16 of an inch out of square now you

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.820 
1/16 of an inch out of square now you
have<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.650> nice<00:02:32.010> square<00:02:32.700> stair<00:02:33.510> frame<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.560> start

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
have a nice square stair frame to start

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.100 
have a nice square stair frame to start
working<00:02:35.220> with<00:02:35.250> drill<00:02:36.209> your<00:02:36.450> three<00:02:36.750> treads

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
working with drill your three treads

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.990 
working with drill your three treads
using<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.650> pilot<00:02:38.010> holes<00:02:38.220> that<00:02:38.370> are<00:02:38.430> provided

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
using the pilot holes that are provided

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.440 
using the pilot holes that are provided
in<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.150> stringer

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.140 

then<00:02:45.050> secure<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.680> treads<00:02:46.010> using<00:02:46.430> four<00:02:46.700> screws

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
then secure the treads using four screws

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:56.980 
then secure the treads using four screws
in<00:02:47.180> each
