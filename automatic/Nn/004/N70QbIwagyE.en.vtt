00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.960
 also the next question has with the 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.389
 finance of the sk to do so quickly 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.219
 why is one so great for the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.259
 private and advertising industry too 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.830
 attractive club like rapid constantly 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.869
 money michael madl also puts here completely 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.779
 Explicitly ask where is the money 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.480
 get transfers europe 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.240
 league what do you say to causa jelavic 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.840
 what is the status with the open rate 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.850
 and why you sell a top striker 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.180
 overheated at a time like that 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:40.020
 Financial Marches Association namely the Rangers 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:42.660
 many ask in one please this question 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.309
 is of course also formulated with the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.559
 The wisdom of the future is what you have to do 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.260
 meet if you approached 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.910
 That is always very easy in the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.820
 afterwards to qualify 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.320
 I realize that it 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.590
 outrageously optimistic 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:09.360
 is if you think that all 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.490
 Overcome businesses everywhere 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.970
 to save in sports but that is 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.240
 one is a wishful thinking of one 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.710
 wishful thinking and among the rapid fans 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.140
 it the wish thinking that of course 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:28.259
 picture over all that stands for me 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:31.439
 But every entrepreneur must be 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.100
 consider it for him too 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.960
 Profit situation for no sponsor it 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.479
 the caritas it will be a win win 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.220
 situation we want to win you 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.220
 Want to win is in the economic 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.320
 area and that is very difficult 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.720
 Such decisions in the economy 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.420
 to achieve and often a very 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:55.140
 lengthy often over a long time 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:02:00.390
 periods of time the process goes out 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.799
 until you get a sponsor and 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.020
 sometimes there are entrepreneurial 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.729
 decisions outside the sk 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.320
 rapid ab game where we have none at all 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.190
 But influence with sustainable 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:15.750
 impact the stage two examples 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:17.790
 than in 2003 the one major 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.420
 Austrian bank from a German 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.090
 Bank bought us went inside 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.610
 from a few weeks the main sponsor 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.010
 lost because the german owner 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.820
 said in austria football 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.150
 invest 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.450
 no interest than us some years 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.260
 later a big Austrian 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.450
 industrial companies have won at 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.520
 to sponsor us by name 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.560
 That was a long process until you got there 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.100
 have drawn this fun ashore 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.370
 and then there was a change there 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.880
 the group's top and the group's top 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.760
 meant we have another guests in the 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.600
 looking at our own marketing 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.580
 away from football to more culture 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.020
 for integration and the like more that 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.880
 Do not judge it 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.550
 then left such decisions 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.739
 outside the possibilities of this sk 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.799
 Rapid has one has to know 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.799
 often take very painful and it is 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:20.459
 then at that time also extremely difficult 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:22.320
 Replacement relatively quickly to find what the 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:27.090
 last question in connection with the 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:30.390
 transfer jelavic is one thing 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.549
 also do me personally very much 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.760
 has affected at the time 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:41.130
 I remember that jelavic still few 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.660
 days before he tells us he wants 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.209
 no longer play for rapid in the 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.890
 large daily newspapers double-sided 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.160
 interview explains for him comes rapid 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:54.209
 and nothing else in question 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:56.070
 we had two options, the 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.410
 One possibility would have been no 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.780
 say and we would have one here 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.940
 frustrated players still had one 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.870
 Year at 1 year later would be free 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.310
 been free 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.900
 or just to try a player of 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.750
 already packed the suitcase in 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.190
 direction scotland the maximum for the 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.760
 to bring out the club we have 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.549
 also done 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.949
 in the shortage of time it was the 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:25.830
 any assurance from the glasgow rangers the 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:30.220
 set up a special account 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:33.310
 actually enough security they have 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.289
 also paid two rates completely correct 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.539
 it is the third rate dependent except 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.550
 Priced out and I'm sure 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.979
 that we make a big part of this rate 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.210
 also get because even the 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:48.550
 Scottish bandaged the Glasgow Rangers 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:52.030
 The debts she has contributed 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.610
 Other European unions have to 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.500
 settle or unite with them 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.320
 balance if you are very 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.229
 We are optimistic that we will be there in the foreseeable future 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:05.130
 most of this open rate 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.130
 to be gotten yet
