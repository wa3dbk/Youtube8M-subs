exercise I'll give you an example if I'm
doing<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.570> bicep<00:00:36.809> I'm<00:00:37.379> gonna<00:00:37.829> squeeze<00:00:38.370> from<00:00:38.789> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
doing a bicep I'm gonna squeeze from the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000 
doing a bicep I'm gonna squeeze from the
bicep<00:00:39.570> all<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.050> way<00:00:40.200> up<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.680> get<00:00:40.770> that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
bicep all the way up and get that

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.760 
bicep all the way up and get that
contraction<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.940> all<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.570> way<00:00:42.719> down<00:00:43.020> most

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
contraction and all the way down most

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.160 
contraction and all the way down most
people<00:00:44.160> just<00:00:44.370> drop<00:00:44.699> it<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.149> then<00:00:46.020> when<00:00:46.140> you

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
people just drop it and then when you

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.000 
people just drop it and then when you
drop<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.129> cracks<00:00:47.670> into<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.180> joint<00:00:48.480> and

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
drop it it cracks into the joint and

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.099 
drop it it cracks into the joint and
then<00:00:50.010> you're<00:00:50.129> gonna<00:00:50.250> end<00:00:50.430> up<00:00:50.520> having<00:00:50.579> problems

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
then you're gonna end up having problems

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.500 
then you're gonna end up having problems
okay<00:00:52.109> you<00:00:52.890> understand<00:00:53.489> what<00:00:53.670> tendons<00:00:54.239> are

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
okay you understand what tendons are

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.229 
okay you understand what tendons are
tendons<00:00:55.500> are<00:00:55.649> basically<00:00:56.190> if<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.850> can<00:00:57.000> imagine

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
tendons are basically if you can imagine

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.540 
tendons are basically if you can imagine
it<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.690> your<00:00:57.840> head<00:00:58.079> they're<00:00:58.559> ropes<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.309> hold

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
it in your head they're ropes that hold

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.759 
it in your head they're ropes that hold
your<00:00:59.789> body<00:01:00.000> together<00:01:00.269> and<00:01:01.050> I'll<00:01:01.199> explain<00:01:01.590> what

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
your body together and I'll explain what

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.970 
your body together and I'll explain what
I<00:01:01.800> mean<00:01:01.890> by<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.250> when<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:03.300> contract<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.830> I

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 
I mean by that when I contract and I

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.560 
I mean by that when I contract and I
squeeze<00:01:05.400> my<00:01:05.640> bicep<00:01:06.470> my<00:01:07.470> tendon<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.100> loose<00:01:08.570> when

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
squeeze my bicep my tendon is loose when

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.190 
squeeze my bicep my tendon is loose when
I<00:01:09.600> loosen<00:01:10.290> my<00:01:10.470> arm<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.700> bring<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.090> down<00:01:12.200> my

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
I loosen my arm and I bring it down my

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.870 
I loosen my arm and I bring it down my
tendon<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.799> tight<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.369> I'll<00:01:14.520> give<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.790> an

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
tendon is tight and I'll give you an

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.179 
tendon is tight and I'll give you an
analogy<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:15.840> understand<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.979> find

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
analogy that you can understand and find

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.270 
analogy that you can understand and find
a<00:01:17.310> rope<00:01:17.610> tight<00:01:17.970> from<00:01:18.270> here<00:01:18.540> here<00:01:19.040> okay<00:01:20.070> and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
a rope tight from here here okay and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.249 
a rope tight from here here okay and
when<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.820> straighten<00:01:21.210> my<00:01:21.509> arm<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.049> went

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
when I straighten my arm and it went

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.980 
when I straighten my arm and it went
tight<00:01:22.610> that's<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.880> function<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.329> my<00:01:24.570> tendon

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
tight that's the function that my tendon

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.310 
tight that's the function that my tendon
would<00:01:25.110> have<00:01:25.369> okay<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.670> when<00:01:27.360> I'm<00:01:27.479> squeezing<00:01:27.930> up

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
would have okay so when I'm squeezing up

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.230 
would have okay so when I'm squeezing up
and<00:01:28.650> I'm<00:01:28.799> doing<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.250> bicep<00:01:29.820> curl

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
and I'm doing that bicep curl

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.810 
and I'm doing that bicep curl
if<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.110> Rope<00:01:31.350> went<00:01:31.770> from<00:01:32.009> here<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.430> here<00:01:32.729> and

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
if the Rope went from here to here and

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.389 
if the Rope went from here to here and
was<00:01:32.970> tight<00:01:33.240> when<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.899> squeezed<00:01:34.439> my<00:01:34.680> bicep<00:01:35.189> up

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
was tight when I squeezed my bicep up

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.940 
was tight when I squeezed my bicep up
and<00:01:35.610> bent<00:01:35.880> my<00:01:36.060> arm<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.990> rope<00:01:37.320> would<00:01:37.560> be<00:01:37.680> dang

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and bent my arm that rope would be dang

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.179 
and bent my arm that rope would be dang
don't<00:01:38.250> loose<00:01:38.750> okay<00:01:39.780> well<00:01:40.590> that's<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.950> same

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
don't loose okay well that's the same

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.730 
don't loose okay well that's the same
idea<00:01:41.399> with<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.909> tendon<00:01:42.299> work<00:01:42.479> okay<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.110> when

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
idea with the tendon work okay so when

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.859 
idea with the tendon work okay so when
I'm<00:01:43.829> squeezing<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.610> have<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.030> contraction

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
I'm squeezing I have that contraction

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.910 
I'm squeezing I have that contraction
and<00:01:46.079> as<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.920> go<00:01:47.159> down<00:01:47.490> I'm<00:01:47.880> gonna<00:01:48.420> stay<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.350> that

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
and as I go down I'm gonna stay in that

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.389 
and as I go down I'm gonna stay in that
bicep<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:51.450> entire<00:01:51.840> way<00:01:52.170> down<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.799> don't

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
bicep the entire way down I don't

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.270 
bicep the entire way down I don't
hyperextend<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.280> hyperextension

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
hyperextend this is a hyperextension

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.330 
hyperextend this is a hyperextension
okay<00:01:57.090> at<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.960> point<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.500> tendon<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.070> tight

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
okay at this point the tendon is tight

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.340 
okay at this point the tendon is tight
and<00:01:59.610> then<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.299> joints<00:02:00.780> gonna<00:02:00.960> get<00:02:01.170> that

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
and then the joints gonna get that

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.889 
and then the joints gonna get that
pressure<00:02:01.710> on<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.820> what<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.030> do<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.840> don't

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
pressure on it so what I do is I don't

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.170 
pressure on it so what I do is I don't
go<00:02:04.170> completely<00:02:04.710> all<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.890> way<00:02:05.009> down<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.610> go<00:02:06.119> to

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
go completely all the way down I go to

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.370 
go completely all the way down I go to
here<00:02:06.539> which<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.439> like<00:02:07.680> an<00:02:07.829> 85<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.640> 90<00:02:08.970> percent

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
here which is like an 85 to 90 percent

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.860 
here which is like an 85 to 90 percent
range<00:02:10.380> so<00:02:11.190> I'll<00:02:11.310> go<00:02:11.460> to<00:02:11.520> here<00:02:11.940> where<00:02:12.390> I'm<00:02:12.480> still

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
range so I'll go to here where I'm still

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.140 
range so I'll go to here where I'm still
in<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.200> bicep

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
in the bicep

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.600 
in the bicep
and<00:02:14.239> then<00:02:14.599> I'll<00:02:14.720> squeeze<00:02:15.200> so<00:02:15.829> I<00:02:15.890> mean<00:02:16.099> I'm<00:02:16.489> in

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
and then I'll squeeze so I mean I'm in

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.520 
and then I'll squeeze so I mean I'm in
position<00:02:17.090> here<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.510> I'm<00:02:17.840> squeezing<00:02:18.290> that

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
position here and I'm squeezing that

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.490 
position here and I'm squeezing that
bicep<00:02:18.860> up<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:19.939> have<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:20.329> contraction<00:02:21.079> now

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
bicep up and I have that contraction now

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.500 
bicep up and I have that contraction now
as<00:02:21.709> I<00:02:21.890> come<00:02:22.129> down<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.400> don't<00:02:22.819> drop<00:02:23.120> it

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
as I come down and don't drop it

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.830 
as I come down and don't drop it
okay<00:02:24.200> I<00:02:24.409> stay<00:02:24.950> in<00:02:25.159> the<00:02:25.280> contraction<00:02:25.760> all<00:02:26.510> the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
okay I stay in the contraction all the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.839 
okay I stay in the contraction all the
way<00:02:26.989> down<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.590> we'll<00:02:27.709> see<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.040> biceps<00:02:28.280> start

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
way down and we'll see the biceps start

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.030 
way down and we'll see the biceps start
to<00:02:28.970> move<00:02:29.120> downward<00:02:29.689> and<00:02:30.319> I'll<00:02:30.470> go<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.739> they're

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
to move downward and I'll go to they're

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.940 
to move downward and I'll go to they're
keeping<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.510> contraction<00:02:33.109> so<00:02:33.290> at<00:02:33.500> this<00:02:33.680> point

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
keeping the contraction so at this point

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.119 
keeping the contraction so at this point
my<00:02:34.280> bicep<00:02:35.180> is<00:02:35.329> still<00:02:35.599> tight<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.680> then<00:02:36.980> I

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
my bicep is still tight and then I

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.000 
my bicep is still tight and then I
continue<00:02:38.769> okay

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
continue okay

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.339 
continue okay
so<00:02:40.400> whether<00:02:40.700> you're<00:02:40.879> doing<00:02:41.030> biceps<00:02:41.780> or<00:02:42.049> legs

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
so whether you're doing biceps or legs

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.020 
so whether you're doing biceps or legs
or<00:02:42.680> chest<00:02:43.010> I<00:02:43.250> don't<00:02:43.370> know<00:02:43.459> if<00:02:43.549> any<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.790> you<00:02:43.939> have

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
or chest I don't know if any of you have

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.059 
or chest I don't know if any of you have
ever<00:02:44.120> seen<00:02:44.390> my<00:02:44.569> videos<00:02:44.989> but<00:02:45.709> when<00:02:46.040> I

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
ever seen my videos but when I

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.490 
ever seen my videos but when I
competitively<00:02:46.849> bench<00:02:47.090> press<00:02:47.420> I<00:02:47.690> bring<00:02:48.319> that

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
competitively bench press I bring that

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.039 
competitively bench press I bring that
weight<00:02:48.709> down<00:02:48.769> so<00:02:49.340> slow<00:02:49.730> sometimes<00:02:50.569> it'll<00:02:50.810> take

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
weight down so slow sometimes it'll take

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.039 
weight down so slow sometimes it'll take
810<00:02:51.319> seconds<00:02:52.069> to<00:02:52.190> get<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.579> bottom<00:02:53.049> okay

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
810 seconds to get to the bottom okay

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.440 
810 seconds to get to the bottom okay
but<00:02:54.650> what<00:02:54.799> I'm<00:02:54.889> doing<00:02:54.920> is<00:02:55.340> I'm<00:02:55.609> staying<00:02:55.970> in<00:02:56.329> the

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
but what I'm doing is I'm staying in the

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.319 
but what I'm doing is I'm staying in the
muscularity<00:02:57.290> and<00:02:57.560> I'm<00:02:58.069> curling<00:02:58.849> up<00:02:59.060> that

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
muscularity and I'm curling up that

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.740 
muscularity and I'm curling up that
power<00:02:59.689> just<00:03:00.109> like<00:03:01.099> if<00:03:01.280> I'm<00:03:01.430> in<00:03:01.459> a<00:03:01.639> bicep<00:03:02.180> and

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
power just like if I'm in a bicep and

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.629 
power just like if I'm in a bicep and
I'm<00:03:02.930> coming<00:03:03.200> down<00:03:03.470> I'm<00:03:03.530> coiling<00:03:04.250> up<00:03:04.430> that

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:04.639 
I'm coming down I'm coiling up that

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.020 
I'm coming down I'm coiling up that
power<00:03:05.260> but<00:03:06.260> I'm<00:03:06.409> staying<00:03:06.799> in<00:03:07.189> the<00:03:07.340> bicep<00:03:07.849> the

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
power but I'm staying in the bicep the

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.629 
power but I'm staying in the bicep the
entire<00:03:08.389> way<00:03:08.659> so<00:03:09.379> when<00:03:09.560> I<00:03:09.590> go<00:03:09.829> to<00:03:09.859> go<00:03:10.129> up<00:03:10.310> on<00:03:10.519> my

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
entire way so when I go to go up on my

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.809 
entire way so when I go to go up on my
next<00:03:11.000> contraction<00:03:11.389> I'm<00:03:12.170> already<00:03:12.500> in<00:03:12.859> here<00:03:13.189> so

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
next contraction I'm already in here so

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.729 
next contraction I'm already in here so
I<00:03:13.879> don't<00:03:13.970> Matt<00:03:14.269> what<00:03:14.599> I<00:03:14.629> have<00:03:14.870> is<00:03:15.079> a<00:03:15.109> mind<00:03:15.470> and

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
I don't Matt what I have is a mind and

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.369 
I don't Matt what I have is a mind and
muscle<00:03:15.829> linked<00:03:16.340> up<00:03:16.549> I<00:03:16.819> have<00:03:17.569> my<00:03:17.750> mind<00:03:18.049> and<00:03:18.349> I

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
muscle linked up I have my mind and I

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.110 
muscle linked up I have my mind and I
have<00:03:18.560> it<00:03:18.739> in<00:03:18.829> the<00:03:18.949> area<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.519> where<00:03:19.639> I'm<00:03:19.790> tied

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
have it in the area to where I'm tied

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.599 
have it in the area to where I'm tied
all<00:03:20.329> the<00:03:20.389> way<00:03:20.510> down<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:20.930> that<00:03:20.989> bicep<00:03:21.650> and<00:03:21.919> then

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
all the way down to that bicep and then

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.909 
all the way down to that bicep and then
I<00:03:22.730> never<00:03:22.970> have<00:03:23.209> to<00:03:23.389> rethink<00:03:23.840> it<00:03:24.109> because<00:03:24.769> I'm

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:24.919 
I never have to rethink it because I'm

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:27.909 
I never have to rethink it because I'm
already<00:03:25.340> in<00:03:25.669> that<00:03:25.970> mode<00:03:26.319> it's<00:03:27.319> like<00:03:27.560> a<00:03:27.590> bow<00:03:27.889> and

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:27.919 
already in that mode it's like a bow and

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:30.430 
already in that mode it's like a bow and
arrow<00:03:28.220> if<00:03:28.879> we<00:03:29.150> took<00:03:29.329> a<00:03:29.389> bow<00:03:29.659> and<00:03:29.840> arrow<00:03:29.989> and<00:03:30.379> we

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
arrow if we took a bow and arrow and we

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.439 
arrow if we took a bow and arrow and we
put<00:03:30.650> an<00:03:30.739> arrow<00:03:30.949> in<00:03:31.099> it<00:03:31.400> as<00:03:31.549> you<00:03:32.060> pulled<00:03:32.329> back

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:32.449 
put an arrow in it as you pulled back

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:35.559 
put an arrow in it as you pulled back
you<00:03:32.900> without<00:03:33.109> pressure<00:03:33.560> in<00:03:33.859> that<00:03:33.889> bow<00:03:34.340> so<00:03:35.209> when

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
you without pressure in that bow so when

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:36.939 
you without pressure in that bow so when
you<00:03:35.690> get<00:03:35.959> back<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.500> where<00:03:36.590> you're<00:03:36.739> going<00:03:36.889> to

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:36.949 
you get back to where you're going to

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:39.490 
you get back to where you're going to
shoot<00:03:37.190> that<00:03:37.400> arrow<00:03:37.750> when<00:03:38.750> you<00:03:38.900> let<00:03:39.139> it<00:03:39.260> go

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
shoot that arrow when you let it go

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.129 
shoot that arrow when you let it go
there's<00:03:39.859> no<00:03:40.069> loose<00:03:40.430> point<00:03:40.879> in<00:03:41.120> it<00:03:41.299> at<00:03:41.419> all<00:03:41.569> its

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
there's no loose point in it at all its

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.710 
there's no loose point in it at all its
torque<00:03:42.680> all<00:03:42.949> the<00:03:43.280> way<00:03:43.430> back<00:03:43.699> and<00:03:44.030> then<00:03:44.540> when

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
torque all the way back and then when

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.689 
torque all the way back and then when
you<00:03:44.810> let<00:03:45.019> it<00:03:45.049> go<00:03:45.169> that<00:03:45.560> tightness<00:03:45.889> is<00:03:46.280> already

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:46.699 
you let it go that tightness is already

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:49.180 
you let it go that tightness is already
going<00:03:46.909> forward<00:03:47.479> so<00:03:48.169> that<00:03:48.349> pressure<00:03:48.650> is<00:03:48.979> on

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
going forward so that pressure is on

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.000 
going forward so that pressure is on
that<00:03:49.549> arrow<00:03:49.879> the<00:03:50.180> entire<00:03:50.569> time<00:03:50.959> that's<00:03:51.799> the
