00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.020
 hello everyone welcome to my channel and you 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.000
 I bring the review of a mod that has 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.840
 called much much attention the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.260
 biosphere mod 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:26.789
 As you can see here , let us add a new 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.919
 World type biospheres 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.480
 I'm going to put it in creative and now I'm going 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.790
 to teach 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.650
 what this mod does 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.620
 at the end of the video you have how 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.170
 install it and in the description of ais 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.460
 the links of the modern and the mod that is 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.460
 We only need to install it 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.520
 when I created the map we will appear in a 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.520
 kind of crystal ball 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.580
 that will be communicated with many more 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.540
 good balls that are then the biospheres 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.540
 as you see 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.850
 each one has a language type 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.980
 and they are all united by these bridges 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.150
 of wood that are created by themselves 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.470
 example here we have 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.470
 the jungle biome 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.780
 we also appear small small 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.020
 biospheres where we have materials like 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.020
 this 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.179
 in all biospheres in materials in 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.619
 these there are many more for example here 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:34.880
 there is iron 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.060
 there will surely be diamond out there 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.060
 inside 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.470
 good there are emeralds ay ay diamond 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.500
 as you see one size still there 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:55.200
 different biomes any biome can 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.200
 enter the biosphere 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.079
 the world is infinite while we go 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.369
 exploring what you see here they go 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.369
 appearing more biospheres 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.120
 there are also animals there are all around 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.959
 what you can find in a world 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.959
 normal I say that put in balls of 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.959
 crystal 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.590
 as you can see while the world is going 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.590
 generating biospheres are appearing 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.030
 the mod is pretty nice what is going 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.540
 creating 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.220
 because creating this would be very difficult here 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.980
 and Well 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.220
 there it ends it seems that it is not infinite 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.220
 all 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.140
 Well, it's not infinite at all 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:55.319
 I thought that if it seems that here it is cut 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.349
 I do not know if it was a bug or is it just you 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.040
 create a number a piece if it is a book it 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.040
 is cutting now 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.709
 Well, now I leave you with the 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.709
 installation of the mod 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.890
 and I hope you liked it already you know 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.810
 who urged the links in the inscription 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.400
 To download it 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.400
 and good I leave you with the installation 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.260
 good will teach us to install it download 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.209
 the two files that are in the 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.519
 description of the video are download 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:31.400
 direct the biosphere of the world and the world 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:34.489
 we open them both 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:38.280
 something like that will not come out with the winrar very 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:42.950
 simple let's go to percentage 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.950
 a pepe data percentages 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.580
 we went to point minecraft bean 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.230
 we will acquire the minecraft 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.760
 we give you to open with 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.760
 winrar archiver 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.799
 as you see here we get the minecraft 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.459
 we delete the folder is to the goal and 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.459
 ene efe 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.579
 has already been deleted 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.770
 we take the mod loader we take all 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.490
 we copy these files in the 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.490
 minecraft folder 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:35.870
 despite the fact that add replace accept 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.870
 to the bierzo that is the mod 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.600
 and the same thing we take these files 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.969
 and to the minecraft folder add 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.780
 replace the same accept 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:50.730
 and with this we already have the mod installed 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.620
