00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.899
 I welcome the viewers of the channel fun games and with 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:12.240
 you pavel baltin of and today more precisely 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:17.490
 Yesterday a new version was released on 03 z to 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:20.340
 This was version 3x 0 and already it is not 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.410
 new well it is clear what happened 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.779
 03 z and therefore no steep when 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.539
 she appeared introduction 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.600
 let's see it is but 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.989
 interface principle has not changed anything 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.829
 so I found one server which is already 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:44.730
 that is, it works on the vertex d zr1 on it 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:50.250
 here are 23 people 30 lots 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:53.539
 Well, in general, let's see and then we 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.410
 continue here I went to the server itself 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:01:00.600
 the main innovation is that 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.590
 shooting is not pinging danger gear 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.070
 well, that is, before 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.530
 many players who play long 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.380
 dragged killed newbies pinging 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.560
 and newcomers could not skin their Odessa 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.430
 kill now is this problem solved and 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:24.140
 that is, when you introduce yourself 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:27.860
 here that is, well, that means I was killed then 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.119
 there is now here shoot and skins now 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.450
 more realistic 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.660
 this is the first innovation of the latter are not as 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:40.690
 significant well first 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:47.840
 more for developers something that 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:50.270
 Now you can quickly be anti-cheat can 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.050
 do well because the new version 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.710
 all the same 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.780
 and that means some time now 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.060
 there will be no accounts at all since new ones 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.410
 there is still no version for it 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:07.330
 so hurry to play because things 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:10.789
 teru will mean I have not shown here 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.340
 so does not move me anywhere and then here I am 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.760
 went here and got into this port and me right away 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.959
 moved to some match and gave 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:29.810
 choose a weapon right now I hit I 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:32.450
 unarmed means let 's generally sing 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.959
 someone moved me to friends 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.530
 some kind of match again and this kind of 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.880
 map 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.050
 which is usual in gta san andreas 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.330
 to change 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.490
 in which I played and went to some 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.550
 typewriter let's be here now 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:55.590
 shoot and see just the same 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:59.910
 we will work the main innovation 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:05.880
 it's shooting paski so i play for 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:09.060
 yellow there still blue here here it is 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.760
 common yagu kings noobs therefore for me 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.209
 there was a big mystery all the time 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:20.340
 ping and still do n't know 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:22.160
 so I get killed here and so it 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.190
 this one works 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:29.100
 on the introduction as it were so 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.850
 became for me because I do not know how 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.519
 shoot 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:38.340
 arches and everyone knows it probably already let's 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:41.040
 still need someone to aim for 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.320
 treasure all let's jump in 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.450
 inviz and try someone soak your feet 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:53.579
 immediately killed 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:58.470
 such what looks like a phallus 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:04:04.610
 anchor don't know so let's run here 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:07.200
 he is what the devil so he means 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.540
 it rains even when I call someone 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.390
 I get and killed me again because 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:18.630
 they are careful to change while the weapon is not 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:22.950
 give it like that let's see it will be possible 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:27.140
 do i usually kill someone i always 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.140
 when I went to some server and 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:36.389
 really i'm getting here even from afar 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:42.620
 and kill him I kill no I kill before I kill 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:47.250
 this is not generally you understand Vlad Frost 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:52.250
 killed me i play the pizzeria team 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:55.229
 and there are blue guys and this sound means 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:05:02.460
 for sure that we won this sound by 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:04.949
 my from this from where on horseback everyones 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.409
 Strange need to drive means and for some reason 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:10.409
 I have minus 2 bucks, that is, those to someone 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:13.710

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:16.009
 Mafia and drown me tying cometary 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:20.639
 leg and me again 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:24.120
 stuffed for some match this match 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:29.840
 apparently it will be right here to give another 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:32.219
 play do not play for pizzerias cheek would be her 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.520
 so while guns 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:39.539
 How much time is needed Shotgan was he in my 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:45.050
 no surprise more and 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:51.199
 here with a sniper punished for here 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:53.279
 here and the volume ogio okay well well 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.259
 we need to play on it 

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:56.840
 faster because so far that ball and 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:06:00.590
 Kirov 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:06.970
 tyrkov 4 fagot yes does not interfere how to play 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:12.740
 I know this in general if you cheat shit 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:20.870
 so here I killed one more now need 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:26.210
 learn to drag on another yes on like this 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:31.910
 and play means then here on our base 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:36.110
 freak would not be surprised where the weapons and well in general 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:39.830
 we all saw me have minus 2 so me 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:44.180
 killed and for some reason threw it means we already 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:47.840
 completed well the game is more precise there is no play 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:51.080
 version of the game turned out good but what about 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:55.820
 the mafia is driving me so I will probably be killed 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:59.210
