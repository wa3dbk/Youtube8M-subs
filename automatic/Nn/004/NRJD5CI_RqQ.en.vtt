00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.880
 ah 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.030
 What is a bank and how does it work? 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.730
 a bank is a type of institution 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.100
 financial his functions are 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.379
 mainly three save and 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.590
 manage our money lend 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.599
 money when we need to provide 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.300
 payments for the purchase and sale of 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.310
 goods and services because the bank we 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.160
 pay an interest for having deposited 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.080
 our money very simple what the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.129
 bank makes with the money that we deposit 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.530
 is to make loans to people and companies 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.940
 lending the bank receives profits 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.340
 share of those earnings we 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.620
 reward for having maintained 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.079
 deposited the money for what the 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.019
 banks 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.510
 saving the credit and the free flow of 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.489
 Payments are vital for the operation 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.460
 of the economy when we save 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.929
 We keep our money safe very much 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.120
 more than if we keep it under the 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:01.519
 mattress and how the bank pays us for 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.129
 save or invest our money going 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:07.130
 growing something that does not happen under the 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.600
 mattress on the other hand the credit allows 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.970
 that people can meet 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.759
 objectives that otherwise could not 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.039
 achieve for example to buy a house 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.289
 without the help of a bank we would need 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:21.799
 collect money a large part of our life 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:24.319
 before you can have it and inhabit one 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.080
 credit allows us to buy and pay at 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:29.149
 bank month to month banks lend 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.850
 money also to companies and they 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.569
 let's grow for example a company 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.729
 need to buy more modern machinery 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:40.490
 As it is very expensive, it asks a bank 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.440
 to lend you the necessary amount with your 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.539
 new machinery the company can 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.240
 perform the same job much more 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:50.000
 Quickly get new clients and 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.170
 get more profit shares from those 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.740
 earnings 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.540
 to the bank the money that he lent him in addition 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.850
 to boost the economic growth of 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.360
 the people the banks are engines of 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.280
 economic growth of the countries 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.170
 next to savings and credit other 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.780
 benefit of banks for society 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.140
 and the economy in general is that they allow 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.040
 that the money circulate constantly 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.700
 enabling the purchase and sale of 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.250
 goods and services the movement of 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.569
 money finally makes the 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.569
 economy of a whole country
