00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
past similar LEvolution really haven't

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.319 
past similar LEvolution really haven't
changed<00:01:51.799> the<00:01:52.220> way<00:01:52.369> the<00:01:52.520> map<00:01:52.700> is<00:01:52.850> point<00:01:53.150> that

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
changed the way the map is point that

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.630 
changed the way the map is point that
much<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:54.110> I'd<00:01:54.259> like<00:01:54.290> to<00:01:54.500> see<00:01:54.680> more<00:01:54.950> LEvolution

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
much so I'd like to see more LEvolution

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.399 
much so I'd like to see more LEvolution
that<00:01:55.850> really<00:01:56.150> do<00:01:56.329> evolve<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:57.020> map<00:01:57.229> they

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
that really do evolve the map they

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.260 
that really do evolve the map they
change<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.890> pace<00:01:58.100> of<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.340> game<00:01:58.520> and<00:01:58.700> change

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
change the pace of the game and change

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.359 
change the pace of the game and change
the<00:01:59.450> way<00:01:59.600> the<00:01:59.780> map<00:01:59.960> is<00:02:00.110> played<00:02:00.439> so<00:02:01.009> hopefully

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
the way the map is played so hopefully

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:02.950 
the way the map is played so hopefully
that<00:02:01.520> improvement<00:02:02.060> in<00:02:02.180> LEvolution<00:02:02.840> will

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
that improvement in LEvolution will

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.380 
that improvement in LEvolution will
continue<00:02:03.409> to<00:02:03.560> evolve<00:02:03.829> into<00:02:04.310> final<00:02:04.670> stand<00:02:04.970> now

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390

hardly anyone plays out there so I

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.900 
hardly anyone plays out there so I

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910

snow<00:03:09.470> camouflage<00:03:10.070> it<00:03:10.550> would<00:03:10.640> also<00:03:10.790> allow<00:03:11.090> us

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
snow camouflage it would also allow us

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.390 
snow camouflage it would also allow us
to<00:03:11.330> bring<00:03:11.570> out<00:03:11.780> pretty<00:03:12.050> cool<00:03:12.320> snow<00:03:12.620> camos<00:03:13.010> we

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
to bring out pretty cool snow camos we

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.010 
to bring out pretty cool snow camos we
do<00:03:13.550> have<00:03:13.700> some<00:03:13.970> already<00:03:14.240> available<00:03:14.660> for<00:03:14.959> the

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
guns but it would be cool to see fully

course to go alongside all of this we

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.830 
course to go alongside all of this we
need<00:03:30.680> some<00:03:30.980> brand<00:03:31.190> new<00:03:31.310> weapons<00:03:31.850> now<00:03:32.540> in<00:03:32.690> the

now<00:03:47.540> of<00:03:47.660> course<00:03:47.810> so<00:03:48.049> far<00:03:48.080> we<00:03:48.500> don't<00:03:48.680> know

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
now of course so far we don't know

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.530 
now of course so far we don't know
whether<00:03:48.980> or<00:03:49.100> not<00:03:49.190> this<00:03:49.430> is<00:03:49.489> a<00:03:49.670> weapon<00:03:50.120> maybe<00:03:50.450> a

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
whether or not this is a weapon maybe a

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.570 
whether or not this is a weapon maybe a

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
pickup only piece of kit as we see with

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.310 
pickup only piece of kit as we see with
the<00:03:52.700> raw<00:03:52.910> or<00:03:53.330> maybe<00:03:53.630> it's<00:03:53.840> just<00:03:53.900> a<00:03:54.110> perk

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
the raw or maybe it's just a perk

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.470 
the raw or maybe it's just a perk
available<00:03:54.920> for<00:03:55.100> the<00:03:55.160> commander<00:03:55.610> to<00:03:55.730> use<00:03:55.940> but

available for the commander to use but

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.210 
available for the commander to use but
either<00:03:56.630> way<00:03:56.840> I<00:03:56.870> thought<00:03:57.320> it'd<00:03:57.440> be<00:03:57.470> cool<00:03:57.590> on<00:03:57.920> the

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
either way I thought it'd be cool on the

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.400 
either way I thought it'd be cool on the

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
whole idea of prototype weapons to think

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.380 
whole idea of prototype weapons to think
of<00:04:00.500> some<00:04:00.709> cool<00:04:00.980> prototype<00:04:01.549> guns<00:04:01.790> to<00:04:02.000> see<00:04:02.180> in

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
of some cool prototype guns to see in

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.390 
of some cool prototype guns to see in
final<00:04:02.810> stand<00:04:03.080> that<00:04:03.500> we<00:04:03.590> may<00:04:03.769> or<00:04:03.920> may<00:04:04.040> not<00:04:04.070> have

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
final stand that we may or may not have

but it was a very popular weapon in bad
company<00:04:24.470> 2<00:04:24.860> and<00:04:25.039> it's<00:04:25.160> definitely<00:04:25.610> a<00:04:25.640> gun<00:04:25.880> i'd

now move
on<00:04:29.180> to<00:04:29.330> the<00:04:29.360> carbines<00:04:29.900> this<00:04:30.290> is<00:04:30.410> probably<00:04:30.620> a

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
on to the carbines this is probably a

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.379 
on to the carbines this is probably a
weapon<00:04:31.100> a<00:04:31.220> lot<00:04:31.400> of<00:04:31.490> you<00:04:31.550> guys<00:04:31.610> haven't<00:04:32.210> heard

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
of this is the f 90 now the f 90 is a

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.890 
of this is the f 90 now the f 90 is a
carbine<00:04:36.320> evolution<00:04:36.980> of<00:04:37.130> the<00:04:37.250> f<00:04:37.400> 88<00:04:38.000> which<00:04:38.750> is

carbine evolution of the f 88 which is

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.620
