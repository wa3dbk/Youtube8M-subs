00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 the tale of the month so this month I have 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.099
 hesitated between several and finally 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.320
 I have chosen 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.780
 it's a little con at least a big con 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.900
 of the month it is tariq ramadan but for 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.980
 have called for the rescue against me 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.260
 his lecture in Lille 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.449
 marc edouard nabe is that it was 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.550
 a disaster since done it was 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.250
 finally obliged as he knows so well 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.359
 do it in a very convoluted way of 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.019
 disavow on just about every point 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.520
 that they have addressed and especially he has 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.020
 weakened its position since in 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.329
 showing that he's even invited on the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.370
 same position as usual ie 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.170
 a position that validates the conflict of 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.840
 civilization in a certain way and 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.590
 especially a position too pro qatar 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.770
 Bernard Henri Levy In Libya Pro Too 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.180
 Globalist in Syria 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.330
 actually his position was becoming 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.370
 more and more identifiable and ambiguous 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.450
 as for someone who would resist the 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:04.290
 imperial domination american Zionist 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:06.240
 so I do not want I do not want to depressed 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.010
 how about i say ramadan because 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.720
 finally I think people 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.790
 include little by little 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.450
 what game he plays what he serves 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.680
 finally they confess employees to 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.820
 provide fairly complex analyzes and 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.680
 subtle enough close to mine 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.550
 these conclusions always happen 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.509
 finally he always chooses for the 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.800
 future the side of the empire in the end 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.200
 that is, there is a side to smoking 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.340
 what about nabeul I have I do not want 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.210
 to push it either because we're going 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.590
 show the excerpts of the video two 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.810
 of Lille I would say it's more than 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.250
 ridiculing he showed he was I 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.960
 do not know about the literary plan on 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.790
 can discuss it to his disgust this guy or 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.009
 seven colors booth name disputing 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.330
 of men as the elders said 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.770
 tastes and colors do not argue 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.899
 for those who would leave who 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.130
 do not master Latin that's a 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.149
 small little hint to a soly effect 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.259
 I did the Latin months unlike 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.410
 him and and yeah we see that the nabot 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.360
 actually is a is an old teen 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.490
 finally a little artist but who does not 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.569
 has no culture and no consciousness 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.150
 strictly no policy and that's it 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.290
 almost pitiful what because indeed they 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.880
 are not revolutions before 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.140
 talk but have not been 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.400
 only newly zulu me 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.830
 I would say that they are beheadings 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.020
 and I know there is something common in 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.150
 all his strengths his movements that we have 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.569
 our qualities and they beheaded 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.390
 buy all this and make me me I see 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.700
 nor ever since but old bones in 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.549
 the act of the people of here must be done 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.260
 watch out for this a7 of manipulation that 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.069
 is still both literary because 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.930
 they know it's for something 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.060
 of literary and so-called lyrical 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.219
 we are still 40 to 10 targets of 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:48.049
 fierce opponents of the theory in 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:51.859
 blocking her husband told me I think about 10 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.370
 years old fab using the theory of 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.129
 conspiracy 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.639
 just this juice highlighted and the 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:00.620
 shot but I think that tandem nam 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.510
 ramadan nabe ramadan is a disaster 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.730
 for both since Ramadan shows 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.900
 finally I'm going all the efforts that 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.299
 fact that hab is a fool in 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.469
 policy 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.689
 finally arguments from a child of 12 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:14.030
 years old gives my kids the 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:15.219
 bourgeoisie with a leftist ideology 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.419
 plus it's pretty weird 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:18.739
 and then on the other hand ramadan was 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:21.049
 very very much in my opinion rain thinking 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.639
 after very badly inspired from a plenum to the 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.680
 rescue against me since while 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.629
 I spoke month in geneva wants to talk to 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.159
 lille and we can see that ramadan that I 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.540
 destabilizes a little bit right now 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:31.370
 rather than answer me directly 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.949
 according to alex did not answer me he said 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.419
 soral deliry bcdc a little eye 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:36.079
 like that he says there is no answer 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:40.090
 to delusional stuff 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.090
 we would like to live there 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.800
 several months and the rat provocation and 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.959
 several years in provocation have 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.590
 useful vocation there we just presented 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.900
 ticket where it's a bit delusional so 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.519
 I now have a drink in the 1.6 to 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.510
 to answer a question is ramadan tu 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.180
 are paid by Qatar 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.340
 we work for them to pay us and 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.049
 finally what are the objectives of the 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.030
 qatar for who rolls the qatar and for 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.190
 tu rolling and finally it is 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.530
 checks on his position despite the 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.879
 convoluted analyzes and the remarks and 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.650
 the but it's a bit like dhl the 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.849
 war without finally loving ramadan 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.609
 we did the same thing on libya 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.049
 that bhl is anti-Gaddafism without 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.820
 love him but he still participated in 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.840
 the killing of Gaddafi and the 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.210
 destruction of libya 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.820
 here are Salafist nicknames 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.930
 Wahhabites in the service of the empire all 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.700
 that obviously sitting down as 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.050
 always on the social issue that the 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.120
 point that connects the two years now 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.700
 and nab besides being our 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.380
 globalists one who ignores himself and loti 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.430
 the cash quinquina beta globalists or 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.360
 senior citizens and ramadan is a 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.860
 globalist who hides it 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.479
 but both have great contempt 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.039
 I would say it comes from their idiots 5 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.510
 ghazi for the social question because 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:46.280
 they are ultimately cosmopolitan 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.300
 they are from everywhere and from nowhere they 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.580
 are proud to be tourists 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.690
 revolutionary they go are proud 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.130
 to have gone to Tunisia 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:58.849
 I went there I was there and finally he 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:01.190
 is at nab contempt a spirit of the people 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:02.840
 French and the people and the French who 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.190
 is very much displayed since always he is 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.300
 always elsewhere and above then 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.849
 it's like a French petit bourgeois 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.500
 in glasses and at ramadan of all 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.120
 way he in his logic to a myth that 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.240
 makes sense of finally islamo 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.360
 anti-nationalist globalists since 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.039
 valid always the same all the ideology 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.180
 trotsko masonic in reality that makes 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.520
 much of his vocabulary 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.280
 I am engaged as a human being 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.580
 on the run citizens but also as a 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.560
 to be and 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.800
 who's responsible what we 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.860
 want here in France is to imitate him 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.409
 it's freedom and respect for our 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.389
 era and anticolonialism I would say two 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:42.389
 globalists felt that dance profit 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:44.009
 heaven the justice that you demand in the 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:46.680
 treatment of your daily 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:48.659
 she must be accompanied by justice me 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.400
 ask for to be able to have by 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:53.310
 report to the south everything is linked 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.659
 do not want to turn us 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.599
 in honey to say we 're going it's 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:06:00.300
 our society is France to fight 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:03.270
 while all this the suburbs for 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.400
 that the expression of a policy of 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.680
 discrimination against the saints and 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.530
 who justified the same consciousness and 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.259
 the wool of j &amp; j will contract on the side of 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.840
 power ten years ago which allows it 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:17.699
 to legitimize all the degueulis doria 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.319
 bouteldja on the nation the people the 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:21.349
 patriots and that's what makes it a 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:24.360
 ally objective of the imperial process 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:27.509
 American Zionist with the allies we 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.919
 knows from the Muslim side who are the 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:30.300
 qatar saudi arabia does all this 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:32.460
 becomes clearer as and when 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.349
 as things get clearer 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.349
 and so here we have I called it 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:39.289
 a little circumstantial alliance and 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:41.250
 circumstantial of the smoking year of the moron 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:42.240
 Ramadan non smoking state ie 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.500
 that they speak very well that things 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.300
 very complicated but these positions 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.659
 concrete health finally are very 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.639
 simple he is behind the empire with 

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:52.560
 the qatar who pays him eventually 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:55.050
 as for nabil is lost and he 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.599
 would be better who devotes himself to the 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.190
 literature and poetry but 

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:00.210
 unfortunately on this ground there and on 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.330
 the bottom and on the form it is well 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:05.159
 less good than our friend felix the cat 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.509
 who nietzsche who is much stronger at 

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:08.279
 level of style is much deeper at 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:10.080
 level of subversion what I want 

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:12.240
 to say the current léon bloy is Félix 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.589
 it's not a banal I remember 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.779
 for myself who still follows me to the feast of 

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:17.190
 vermin is that it was in 84 so 

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:17.969
 you guarantee the litra you know this 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.370
 that it's the licra 

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:22.740
 the licra as soon as we pronounce the word jew 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.839
 there is a terrible day we can not anymore
