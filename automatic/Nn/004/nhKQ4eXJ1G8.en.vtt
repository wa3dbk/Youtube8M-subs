00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.420 
turn
and<00:01:10.590> once<00:01:11.590> that's<00:01:11.829> done<00:01:12.250> I<00:01:12.520> will<00:01:12.640> initialize

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
and once that's done I will initialize

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.330 
and once that's done I will initialize
just<00:01:15.430> so<00:01:15.610> that<00:01:15.790> it<00:01:15.880> knows<00:01:16.210> which<00:01:17.079> window<00:01:17.619> I<00:01:17.920> am

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
just so that it knows which window I am

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.950 
just so that it knows which window I am
working<00:01:18.670> on<00:01:18.909> because<00:01:19.210> you<00:01:19.299> can<00:01:19.479> run<00:01:19.720> more<00:01:19.899> than

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
working on because you can run more than

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.560 
working on because you can run more than

steps for different quests you'll see

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.930 
steps for different quests you'll see
that<00:01:53.679> it<00:01:53.799> pretty<00:01:54.039> much<00:01:54.190> will<00:01:54.340> solve<00:01:54.610> quest

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
that it pretty much will solve quest

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.020 
that it pretty much will solve quest

submit quests accept quests the last

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.999 
submit quests accept quests the last
step<00:01:58.330> was<00:01:58.539> fly<00:01:58.869> to<00:01:58.899> San<00:01:59.200> aryan<00:01:59.470> hold<00:01:59.649> which<00:01:59.860> is

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
step was fly to San aryan hold which is

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:06.840 
step was fly to San aryan hold which is
where<00:02:00.850> i<00:02:00.880> am<00:02:01.000> right<00:02:01.090> now<00:02:01.709> and<00:02:02.709> then<00:02:05.819> the<00:02:06.819> next

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
where i am right now and then the next

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.359 
where i am right now and then the next
step<00:02:07.209> is<00:02:07.479> level<00:02:07.959> up<00:02:08.110> 59<00:02:08.410> through<00:02:08.769> 60<00:02:09.130> a<00:02:09.160> little

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
step is level up 59 through 60 a little

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.339 
step is level up 59 through 60 a little
bit<00:02:09.489> of<00:02:09.549> a<00:02:09.610> grind<00:02:09.849> so<00:02:10.209> i<00:02:10.509> want<00:02:10.929> to<00:02:10.989> select<00:02:11.230> that

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
bit of a grind so i want to select that

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.620 
bit of a grind so i want to select that
and<00:02:11.680> take<00:02:12.340> that<00:02:12.489> as<00:02:12.640> first<00:02:12.940> step<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.360> select

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
and take that as first step and select

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.630 
and take that as first step and select
ok<00:02:14.070> and<00:02:15.070> go<00:02:15.579> ahead<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.790> start<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.120> bot<00:02:17.640> once

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
ok and go ahead and start the bot once

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.390 
ok and go ahead and start the bot once
that<00:02:18.910> started<00:02:19.709> you'll<00:02:20.709> see<00:02:20.950> that<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.250> bot

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
that started you'll see that the bot

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.479 
that started you'll see that the bot
pretty<00:02:21.640> much<00:02:21.790> just<00:02:22.000> takes<00:02:22.299> over<00:02:23.489> starts

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
pretty much just takes over starts

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.849 
pretty much just takes over starts
running<00:02:24.850> around<00:02:24.989> it<00:02:25.989> knows<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.320> i<00:02:26.590> was<00:02:26.769> at

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:26.859 
running around it knows that i was at

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:28.560 
running around it knows that i was at
the<00:02:26.950> flatpoint<00:02:27.190> so<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.790> know<00:02:27.910> exactly<00:02:28.420> where

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
the flatpoint so it know exactly where

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.069 
the flatpoint so it know exactly where
to<00:02:28.660> run<00:02:28.810> two<00:02:30.390> runs<00:02:31.390> out<00:02:31.540> into<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.810> middle<00:02:31.930> of

the orals here and since i'm on a grind

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.979 
the orals here and since i'm on a grind
path<00:02:35.890> it's<00:02:36.070> just<00:02:36.220> going<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.430> run<00:02:36.579> out<00:02:36.840> get<00:02:37.840> some
