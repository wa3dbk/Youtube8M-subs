like that which aren't necessarily on

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.309 
like that which aren't necessarily on
the<00:01:41.369> other<00:01:41.759> watches<00:01:42.299> now<00:01:42.719> for<00:01:42.990> some<00:01:43.139> reason

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:43.319 
the other watches now for some reason

tide<00:01:43.889> is<00:01:44.369> still<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:44.880> there<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.210> I'm<00:01:45.299> not

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:45.389 
tide is still on there and I'm not

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:47.899 
tide is still on there and I'm not
entirely<00:01:45.810> sure<00:01:46.020> why<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.859> feature<00:01:47.549> is

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
entirely sure why that feature is

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.149 
entirely sure why that feature is
necessary<00:01:48.719> on<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:48.990> racing<00:01:49.439> watch<00:01:49.679> but

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
necessary on a racing watch but

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.819 
necessary on a racing watch but
nevertheless<00:01:50.789> it<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.389> cool<00:01:52.009> and<00:01:53.689> and<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:55.679> also

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
nevertheless it is cool and and it also

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.590 
nevertheless it is cool and and it also
features<00:01:56.159> luminescence<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.359> what<00:01:57.479> we're

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
features luminescence so what we're

with these deep grooves that almost look

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.780 
with these deep grooves that almost look
like<00:02:36.360> tire<00:02:36.960> treads<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:38.250> that's<00:02:38.430> kind<00:02:38.640> of<00:02:38.700> a

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
like tire treads so that's kind of a

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.680 
like tire treads so that's kind of a
nice<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:40.080> know<00:02:40.280> style<00:02:41.280> on<00:02:41.670> this<00:02:42.360> watch<00:02:42.660> and

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
nice you know style on this watch and

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.870 
nice you know style on this watch and
then<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.920> can<00:02:44.070> see<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.370> there's<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.610> push

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
then you can see that there's a push

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.930 
then you can see that there's a push

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
freezy on Easy Off and then one other

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.060 
freezy on Easy Off and then one other
style<00:02:51.300> point<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.410> I<00:02:52.440> just<00:02:52.500> want<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:52.920> point

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
style point that I just want to point

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.240 
style point that I just want to point
out<00:02:53.250> is<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.730> push<00:02:53.940> buttons<00:02:54.300> on<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.570> side

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
out is that the push buttons on the side

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.160 
out is that the push buttons on the side
actually<00:02:56.250> kind<00:02:56.460> of<00:02:56.580> look<00:02:56.880> like<00:02:56.910> pedals<00:02:57.810> in<00:02:58.080> a

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
actually kind of look like pedals in a

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.890 
actually kind of look like pedals in a
car<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:59.430> that's<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.760> nice<00:02:59.970> that's<00:03:00.480> that's<00:03:00.810> a

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
car so that's a nice that's that's a

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.770 
car so that's a nice that's that's a
nice<00:03:01.080> design<00:03:01.470> but<00:03:02.040> overall<00:03:02.790> my<00:03:03.150> critique<00:03:03.600> of

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
nice design but overall my critique of

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.140 
nice design but overall my critique of
this<00:03:03.930> watch<00:03:04.200> is<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.590> I<00:03:05.010> feel<00:03:05.550> like<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:05.820> style

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
this watch is that I feel like the style

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.720 
this watch is that I feel like the style
Falls<00:03:06.570> a<00:03:06.720> little<00:03:06.870> bit<00:03:07.110> flat<00:03:07.500> certainly<00:03:08.460> it's<00:03:08.640> a

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
Falls a little bit flat certainly it's a

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.880 
Falls a little bit flat certainly it's a
feature-rich<00:03:09.180> watch<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.650> know<00:03:10.680> the

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
feature-rich watch and you know the

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.390 
feature-rich watch and you know the
t-touch<00:03:11.280> is<00:03:11.580> just<00:03:12.030> awesome<00:03:12.920> but<00:03:13.920> if<00:03:14.160> they're

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
t-touch is just awesome but if they're

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.000 
t-touch is just awesome but if they're
really<00:03:14.670> going<00:03:14.850> for<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.120> racing<00:03:15.570> theme<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:16.170> don't

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
really going for a racing theme I don't

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.160 
really going for a racing theme I don't
know<00:03:17.100> if<00:03:17.250> this<00:03:17.400> does<00:03:17.640> it<00:03:17.820> for<00:03:17.850> me<00:03:18.210> it<00:03:18.750> seems<00:03:19.020> a

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
know if this does it for me it seems a

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.890 
know if this does it for me it seems a
bit<00:03:19.350> simple<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.150> I<00:03:21.150> could<00:03:21.330> have<00:03:21.450> used<00:03:21.660> maybe

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
bit simple and I could have used maybe

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.979 
bit simple and I could have used maybe
some<00:03:22.230> more<00:03:22.350> accent<00:03:22.830> colors<00:03:23.250> since<00:03:24.210> colors<00:03:24.690> and

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
some more accent colors since colors and

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.590 
some more accent colors since colors and
logos<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:25.620> insignia<00:03:26.130> are<00:03:26.430> very<00:03:27.000> much<00:03:27.239> a<00:03:27.270> part

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
logos and insignia are very much a part
