all the way up they head right along the
edge<00:02:06.610> and<00:02:07.050> a<00:02:08.050> lot<00:02:08.260> of<00:02:08.290> times<00:02:08.590> when<00:02:08.800> I'm

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
edge and a lot of times when I'm

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.540 
edge and a lot of times when I'm
quilting<00:02:09.430> I<00:02:09.670> will<00:02:10.300> actually<00:02:10.860> do<00:02:11.860> this<00:02:12.070> so<00:02:12.400> that

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
quilting I will actually do this so that

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.760 
quilting I will actually do this so that
when<00:02:12.700> I<00:02:12.730> put<00:02:12.940> my<00:02:12.970> binding<00:02:13.570> on<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:14.020> don't<00:02:14.350> have

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
when I put my binding on I don't have

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.060 
when I put my binding on I don't have
gaps<00:02:15.610> in<00:02:15.880> between<00:02:16.110> my<00:02:17.110> quilting<00:02:17.680> designs

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
gaps in between my quilting designs

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.370 
gaps in between my quilting designs
where<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:18.910> might<00:02:19.060> pucker<00:02:19.450> as<00:02:19.870> I<00:02:20.080> put<00:02:20.260> the

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
where it might pucker as I put the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.080 
where it might pucker as I put the
binding<00:02:20.560> up<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.910> I<00:02:21.940> find<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.600> really<00:02:22.780> helps<00:02:23.470> and

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
binding up so I find it really helps and

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.730 
binding up so I find it really helps and
I<00:02:25.590> do<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.740> bunch<00:02:27.340> of<00:02:27.520> different<00:02:27.700> designs<00:02:28.740> right

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
I do a bunch of different designs right

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.150 
I do a bunch of different designs right
now<00:02:30.040> I'm<00:02:30.370> going

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
now I'm going

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:39.740 
now I'm going
really

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:03:00.130 

speeding<00:02:39.990> together

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.000 

my<00:03:00.860> voices

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
my voices

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.960 
my voices
well

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.490 

and<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:06.960> just<00:03:07.170> ran<00:03:07.410> out<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.650> bobbin<00:03:08.010> Friday
