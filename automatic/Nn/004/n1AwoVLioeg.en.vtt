becomes<00:01:41.030> much<00:01:41.240> more<00:01:41.450> pliable<00:01:41.750> you<00:01:42.680> can<00:01:42.860> just

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
becomes much more pliable you can just

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.590 
becomes much more pliable you can just
bend<00:01:43.370> it<00:01:44.710> rolling<00:01:45.710> it<00:01:45.890> until<00:01:46.670> fit<00:01:47.150> right

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
bend it rolling it until fit right

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.170 
bend it rolling it until fit right
inside<00:01:48.080> of<00:01:48.290> your<00:01:48.410> container<00:01:48.950> it's<00:01:49.820> kind<00:01:50.060> of

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
inside of your container it's kind of

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.110 
inside of your container it's kind of
twisting<00:01:51.020> it<00:01:52.150> sliding<00:01:53.150> it<00:01:53.510> in<00:01:54.729> you<00:01:55.729> want<00:01:55.940> it<00:01:56.000> to

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
twisting it sliding it in you want it to

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.560 
twisting it sliding it in you want it to
fit<00:01:56.420> tightly<00:01:57.070> snugly<00:01:58.070> right<00:01:58.340> up<00:01:58.580> to<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:58.820> edges

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.210 

then<00:02:02.570> using<00:02:03.020> some<00:02:03.290> of<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.500> aluminum<00:02:03.740> wire

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
then using some of the aluminum wire

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.190 
then using some of the aluminum wire
pull<00:02:05.090> it<00:02:05.240> out<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:06.020> then<00:02:06.860> twist<00:02:07.430> it<00:02:08.200> upon

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
pull it out and then twist it upon

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.010 
pull it out and then twist it upon
itself<00:02:09.830> you<00:02:10.670> don't<00:02:10.790> really<00:02:11.030> need<00:02:11.300> all<00:02:11.600> of<00:02:11.840> that

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
itself you don't really need all of that

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.720 
itself you don't really need all of that
I<00:02:12.050> think<00:02:12.140> I'll<00:02:12.440> cut<00:02:12.800> off<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.070> segment<00:02:15.670> I'm<00:02:16.670> just

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
I think I'll cut off a segment I'm just

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.220 
I think I'll cut off a segment I'm just
using<00:02:17.150> this<00:02:18.910> forcing<00:02:19.910> that<00:02:20.120> down<00:02:20.600> into<00:02:20.990> the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
using this forcing that down into the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.670 
using this forcing that down into the
center<00:02:21.800> this<00:02:22.340> will<00:02:22.520> create<00:02:22.760> an<00:02:22.970> armature<00:02:23.680> to

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
center this will create an armature to

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.520 
center this will create an armature to
support<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.310> flowers<00:02:25.850> in<00:02:26.090> place<00:02:26.350> then<00:02:27.350> all<00:02:27.500> I

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
support the flowers in place then all I

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:37.550 
support the flowers in place then all I
need<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.830> do<00:02:28.130> is<00:02:28.370> add<00:02:28.970> water

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.710 

mechanics<00:02:38.560> make<00:02:38.830> it<00:02:38.980> easy<00:02:39.220> then<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:40.180> just<00:02:40.330> take

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
mechanics make it easy then to just take

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.790 
mechanics make it easy then to just take
your<00:02:40.990> individual<00:02:41.560> blooms<00:02:41.860> give<00:02:42.760> them<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:43.030> cut

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
your individual blooms give them a cut

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.980 
your individual blooms give them a cut
remove<00:02:44.800> any<00:02:44.980> of<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.220> lower<00:02:45.430> foliage<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.450> then

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
remove any of the lower foliage and then

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.100 
remove any of the lower foliage and then
just<00:02:47.290> insert<00:02:47.740> it<00:02:47.770> through<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.250> armature<00:02:49.110> so

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
just insert it through the armature so

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.240 
just insert it through the armature so
that<00:02:50.200> Nestle's<00:02:50.740> right<00:02:50.830> onto<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.490> container

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.490 

again<00:02:57.250> removing<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:58.030> leaves<00:02:58.240> don't<00:02:59.200> want

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
again removing the leaves don't want

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.440 
again removing the leaves don't want
those<00:02:59.740> to<00:02:59.800> go<00:03:00.190> down<00:03:00.460> into<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:01.120> greens<00:03:01.480> at<00:03:02.080> all

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
those to go down into the greens at all

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.080 
those to go down into the greens at all
and<00:03:04.450> then<00:03:04.630> just<00:03:04.660> lifting<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.740> leaf<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.730> over

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
and then just lifting the leaf and over

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:16.590 
and then just lifting the leaf and over
and<00:03:10.090> again<00:03:14.430> making<00:03:15.430> sure<00:03:15.580> it<00:03:15.820> goes<00:03:15.940> down<00:03:16.270> all

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
and again making sure it goes down all

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.240 
and again making sure it goes down all
the<00:03:16.720> way<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.050> bottom<00:03:17.230> so<00:03:17.740> that<00:03:17.770> will<00:03:17.980> drink

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
the way to the bottom so that will drink

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.120 
the way to the bottom so that will drink
well<00:03:18.630> using<00:03:19.630> them<00:03:19.900> in<00:03:19.990> different<00:03:20.020> heights<00:03:20.560> you

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
well using them in different heights you

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.740 
well using them in different heights you
can<00:03:21.250> see<00:03:21.430> I<00:03:21.459> left<00:03:21.700> that<00:03:21.940> one<00:03:22.090> a<00:03:22.150> little<00:03:22.480> longer

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
can see I left that one a little longer

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.960 
can see I left that one a little longer
and<00:03:23.500> then<00:03:23.590> maybe<00:03:23.800> tucking<00:03:24.310> one<00:03:24.490> a<00:03:24.700> little

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
and then maybe tucking one a little

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.280 
and then maybe tucking one a little
shorter<00:03:25.570> underneath<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:27.750> then<00:03:28.750> going<00:03:29.020> back

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
shorter underneath it then going back

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.920 
shorter underneath it then going back
with<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.890> gerberas<00:03:32.730> tucking<00:03:33.730> them<00:03:33.940> in<00:03:34.209> and

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
with the gerberas tucking them in and

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.710 
with the gerberas tucking them in and
again<00:03:35.200> going<00:03:35.860> a<00:03:35.980> little<00:03:36.220> bit<00:03:36.340> taller<00:03:36.720> coming

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
again going a little bit taller coming

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.880 
again going a little bit taller coming
out<00:03:37.870> above<00:03:39.660> maybe<00:03:40.660> another<00:03:41.110> piece<00:03:41.500> of<00:03:41.530> the

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
out above maybe another piece of the

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:49.070 
out above maybe another piece of the
kale<00:03:46.530> crossing<00:03:47.530> from<00:03:47.709> one<00:03:47.950> side<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.550> other

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
kale crossing from one side to the other

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.750 
kale crossing from one side to the other
and<00:03:50.080> then<00:03:50.200> back<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.830> rose<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:54.160> as<00:03:54.340> I<00:03:54.459> work

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
and then back to the rose and as I work

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.330 
and then back to the rose and as I work
turn<00:03:55.450> it<00:03:55.720> you<00:03:56.230> want<00:03:56.440> it<00:03:56.560> to<00:03:56.680> look<00:03:56.830> great<00:03:57.130> from

turn it you want it to look great from

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.479 
turn it you want it to look great from
all<00:03:57.610> sides<00:03:58.060> you<00:03:58.450> don't<00:03:58.630> want<00:03:58.810> it<00:03:58.900> to<00:03:59.019> be<00:03:59.140> flat

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
all sides you don't want it to be flat

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.930 
all sides you don't want it to be flat
keep<00:04:00.489> it<00:04:00.670> round<00:04:02.160> lifting<00:04:03.160> and<00:04:03.340> tucking<00:04:03.820> and

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:12.830 
keep it round lifting and tucking and
adding<00:04:04.870> in<00:04:04.989> your<00:04:05.019> blooms

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.559 

now<00:04:13.650> I<00:04:13.680> just<00:04:13.860> go<00:04:14.250> through<00:04:14.640> and<00:04:14.880> add<00:04:15.120> fullness

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
now I just go through and add fullness

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.770 
now I just go through and add fullness
with<00:04:16.139> a<00:04:16.170> few<00:04:16.560> more<00:04:16.739> blossoms<00:04:17.340> again<00:04:18.269> cutting

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
with a few more blossoms again cutting
