either a plate or some plastic wrap and
the<00:02:00.530> next<00:02:00.830> morning<00:02:01.120> then<00:02:02.120> I<00:02:02.150> have<00:02:02.420> these<00:02:02.630> that

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
the next morning then I have these that

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.080 
the next morning then I have these that
I<00:02:03.230> already<00:02:03.710> I<00:02:03.980> already<00:02:04.100> pre<00:02:04.580> soaked<00:02:04.880> these

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
I already I already pre soaked these

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.190 
I already I already pre soaked these
last<00:02:05.900> night<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.530> again<00:02:07.160> this<00:02:07.550> is<00:02:07.900> three<00:02:08.900> dates

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
last night and again this is three dates

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.240 
last night and again this is three dates
the<00:02:10.130> pecans<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.240> almonds<00:02:11.900> and<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.250> the

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
the pecans the almonds and the the

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.150 
the pecans the almonds and the the
vanilla<00:02:13.700> bean<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:14.290> then<00:02:15.290> what<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.530> already<00:02:15.740> did

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
vanilla bean and then what I already did

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.640 
vanilla bean and then what I already did
was<00:02:16.460> I<00:02:16.730> poured<00:02:17.180> off<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.750> soaked<00:02:17.990> water<00:02:18.200> and

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
was I poured off the soaked water and

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.400 
was I poured off the soaked water and
the<00:02:19.490> reason<00:02:19.850> I<00:02:19.940> do<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.090> is<00:02:20.270> because<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.200> soap

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
the reason I do that is because the soap

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.740 
the reason I do that is because the soap
water<00:02:21.650> contains<00:02:22.340> an<00:02:22.550> enzyme<00:02:22.670> inhibitors<00:02:23.450> that

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
water contains an enzyme inhibitors that

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.870 
water contains an enzyme inhibitors that
will<00:02:24.410> give<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.710> stomachache<00:02:25.250> if<00:02:25.460> you<00:02:25.610> drink

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
will give you a stomachache if you drink

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.940 
will give you a stomachache if you drink
it<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:26.420> I<00:02:26.720> went<00:02:26.960> ahead<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.350> poured<00:02:27.530> that<00:02:27.740> off

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
it so I went ahead and poured that off

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.750 
it so I went ahead and poured that off
and<00:02:28.250> then<00:02:28.880> I<00:02:28.910> just<00:02:29.360> dump<00:02:29.570> that<00:02:29.630> into<00:02:30.020> this<00:02:30.140> bowl

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
and then I just dump that into this bowl

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.150 
and then I just dump that into this bowl
along<00:02:31.760> with<00:02:31.820> roughly<00:02:32.570> three<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.320> four<00:02:33.560> cups<00:02:33.890> of

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
along with roughly three to four cups of

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.640 
along with roughly three to four cups of
purified<00:02:34.790> water<00:02:34.870> depending<00:02:35.870> on<00:02:35.990> how<00:02:36.230> thick

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
purified water depending on how thick

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.490 
purified water depending on how thick
you<00:02:37.580> want<00:02:37.610> your<00:02:38.230> nut<00:02:39.230> milk<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:41.350> then<00:02:42.350> you're

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
you want your nut milk and then you're

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.130 
you want your nut milk and then you're
ready<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.770> go<00:02:45.280> well<00:02:46.280> actually<00:02:46.960> this<00:02:47.960> is

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
ready to go well actually this is

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.260 
ready to go well actually this is
another<00:02:48.380> one<00:02:48.590> of<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.800> new<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.100> improved

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
another one of the new and improved

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.850 
another one of the new and improved
things<00:02:50.270> that<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:50.540> did<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:51.170> make<00:02:51.410> this<00:02:51.620> taste

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
things that I did to make this taste

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.520 
things that I did to make this taste
even<00:02:52.010> better<00:02:52.190> I<00:02:52.370> used<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.910> add<00:02:53.090> cinnamon<00:02:53.570> maybe

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
even better I used to add cinnamon maybe

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.190 
even better I used to add cinnamon maybe
right<00:02:54.770> before<00:02:55.100> I<00:02:55.130> was<00:02:55.250> about<00:02:55.400> to<00:02:55.670> drink<00:02:55.910> it<00:02:56.200> but

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
right before I was about to drink it but

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.710 
right before I was about to drink it but
I<00:02:57.470> found<00:02:57.890> that<00:02:58.190> if<00:02:58.370> I<00:02:58.489> put<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.910> cinnamon<00:02:59.360> in

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
I found that if I put the cinnamon in

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.870 
I found that if I put the cinnamon in
with<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.560> nuts<00:03:00.770> in<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.070> water<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:01.459> actually

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
with the nuts in the water and actually

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.880 
with the nuts in the water and actually
run<00:03:02.060> it<00:03:02.270> through<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.570> juicer<00:03:02.840> that<00:03:03.770> it

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
run it through the juicer that it

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.830 
run it through the juicer that it
actually<00:03:04.070> is<00:03:04.459> distributed<00:03:05.209> more<00:03:05.330> evenly<00:03:05.510> and

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
actually is distributed more evenly and

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.720 
actually is distributed more evenly and
you<00:03:05.900> don't<00:03:06.080> get<00:03:06.200> those<00:03:06.380> little<00:03:06.680> lumps<00:03:06.980> that

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
you don't get those little lumps that

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.040 
you don't get those little lumps that
sometimes<00:03:08.120> if<00:03:08.270> you<00:03:08.360> try<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.600> stir<00:03:08.870> the

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
sometimes if you try to stir the

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.170 
sometimes if you try to stir the
cinnamon<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:09.650> later<00:03:09.800> and<00:03:10.130> then<00:03:11.050> also<00:03:12.050> I<00:03:12.290> add

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
cinnamon and later and then also I add

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.990 
cinnamon and later and then also I add
Himalayan<00:03:14.180> salt<00:03:14.480> which<00:03:15.459> enhances<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.520> flavor

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
Himalayan salt which enhances the flavor

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.470 
Himalayan salt which enhances the flavor
and<00:03:17.360> it<00:03:17.840> also<00:03:18.610> will<00:03:19.610> give<00:03:19.760> you<00:03:19.910> some<00:03:20.209> added

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
and it also will give you some added

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.920 
and it also will give you some added
minerals<00:03:21.940> all<00:03:22.940> right<00:03:23.090> so<00:03:23.330> here<00:03:23.540> we<00:03:23.570> are<00:03:23.690> we're

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
minerals all right so here we are we're

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.520 
minerals all right so here we are we're
ready<00:03:24.110> to<00:03:24.290> go

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.160 

now<00:03:28.160> I<00:03:28.190> put<00:03:28.670> a<00:03:28.700> measuring<00:03:29.240> cup<00:03:29.390> or<00:03:29.750> just<00:03:29.990> some

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
now I put a measuring cup or just some

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.980 
now I put a measuring cup or just some
kind<00:03:30.410> of<00:03:30.500> cup<00:03:30.680> underneath<00:03:31.480> where<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:32.510> pulp<00:03:32.840> is

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
kind of cup underneath where the pulp is

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.220 
kind of cup underneath where the pulp is
gonna<00:03:33.170> come<00:03:33.380> out<00:03:33.410> because<00:03:34.010> I<00:03:34.400> have<00:03:34.640> discovered

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
gonna come out because I have discovered

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.380 
gonna come out because I have discovered
you<00:03:36.230> get<00:03:36.380> a<00:03:36.410> much<00:03:36.710> higher<00:03:36.740> yield<00:03:37.610> if<00:03:37.880> you<00:03:38.180> run

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
you get a much higher yield if you run

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.300 
you get a much higher yield if you run
the<00:03:38.510> pulp<00:03:38.750> through<00:03:38.990> twice<00:03:41.860> because<00:03:42.860> it<00:03:43.100> takes

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
the pulp through twice because it takes

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.270 
the pulp through twice because it takes
a<00:03:43.520> it<00:03:44.330> takes<00:03:44.600> a<00:03:44.780> little<00:03:45.020> bit<00:03:45.260> if<00:03:45.560> you<00:03:45.890> notice

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
a it takes a little bit if you notice

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.340 
a it takes a little bit if you notice
when<00:03:47.150> this<00:03:47.270> starts<00:03:47.600> to<00:03:47.690> come<00:03:47.959> out<00:03:48.140> of<00:03:48.170> the

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
when this starts to come out of the

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
when this starts to come out of the
juicer<00:03:48.800> it's<00:03:49.300> actually<00:03:50.300> pretty<00:03:50.570> watery<00:03:51.220> so<00:03:52.220> it

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
juicer it's actually pretty watery so it

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.790 
juicer it's actually pretty watery so it
takes<00:03:52.610> that<00:03:52.760> second<00:03:53.420> time<00:03:53.660> through<00:03:56.590> to<00:03:57.590> really

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
takes that second time through to really

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.800 
takes that second time through to really
get<00:03:58.070> the<00:03:58.220> most<00:03:58.340> out<00:03:58.610> of<00:03:58.670> the<00:03:58.970> pulp<00:03:59.450> and<00:03:59.660> what<00:03:59.780> I

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
get the most out of the pulp and what I

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.080 
get the most out of the pulp and what I
find<00:04:00.080> is<00:04:00.350> the<00:04:00.620> second<00:04:01.459> time<00:04:01.610> around<00:04:01.640> you<00:04:01.910> end

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
find is the second time around you end

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.120 
find is the second time around you end
up<00:04:02.239> with<00:04:02.390> half<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:02.959> pulp<00:04:03.200> that<00:04:03.500> you<00:04:03.650> had<00:04:03.830> in

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
up with half the pulp that you had in

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:10.000 
up with half the pulp that you had in
sight<00:04:04.489> in<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:04.820> container<00:04:06.790> and<00:04:08.410> I<00:04:09.410> like<00:04:09.650> making

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
sight in the container and I like making

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.979 
sight in the container and I like making
that<00:04:10.160> milk<00:04:10.400> in<00:04:10.580> the<00:04:10.730> juicer<00:04:11.150> as<00:04:11.390> opposed<00:04:11.810> to

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
that milk in the juicer as opposed to

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.960 
that milk in the juicer as opposed to
the<00:04:12.200> Vitamix<00:04:12.620> people<00:04:13.010> do<00:04:13.160> ask<00:04:13.340> me<00:04:13.640> can<00:04:13.880> you

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
the Vitamix people do ask me can you

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.509 
the Vitamix people do ask me can you
make<00:04:14.180> nut<00:04:14.450> milk<00:04:14.660> in<00:04:14.810> the<00:04:14.900> Vitamix<00:04:15.290> I<00:04:15.560> have<00:04:16.190> I

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
make nut milk in the Vitamix I have I

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.440 
make nut milk in the Vitamix I have I
have<00:04:17.269> one<00:04:17.480> I<00:04:17.510> have<00:04:17.630> a<00:04:17.840> Vitamix<00:04:18.440> and<00:04:19.450> that's

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
have one I have a Vitamix and that's

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.270 
have one I have a Vitamix and that's
another<00:04:20.840> great<00:04:21.109> way<00:04:21.169> to<00:04:21.320> do<00:04:21.590> it<00:04:21.620> but<00:04:22.070> this<00:04:22.220> is

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
another great way to do it but this is

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.710 
another great way to do it but this is
just<00:04:22.550> a<00:04:22.730> little<00:04:22.820> bit<00:04:23.030> easier<00:04:23.360> because<00:04:23.540> you

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
just a little bit easier because you

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.090 
just a little bit easier because you
don't<00:04:23.870> have<00:04:23.960> to<00:04:24.169> strain<00:04:24.500> it<00:04:24.530> through<00:04:24.770> a

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
don't have to strain it through a

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.190 
don't have to strain it through a
cheesecloth<00:04:25.490> or<00:04:25.850> anything<00:04:26.270> like<00:04:26.510> that<00:04:26.570> or<00:04:26.990> not

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
cheesecloth or anything like that or not

Club at all but I have found that their
raw<00:05:52.730> pecans<00:05:53.730> are<00:05:54.120> much<00:05:54.480> much<00:05:54.900> cheaper<00:05:54.930> than

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
the difference it's probably less than

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.620
