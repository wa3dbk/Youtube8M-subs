00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.850 
they were in on the other controllers
because<00:01:42.460> they<00:01:42.550> were<00:01:42.610> all<00:01:42.760> blue<00:01:43.030> lights<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:44.320> we

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
because they were all blue lights so we

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.140 
because they were all blue lights so we
made<00:01:45.010> things<00:01:45.159> a<00:01:45.310> lot<00:01:45.430> easier<00:01:45.460> a<00:01:45.850> lot<00:01:45.970> more

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
made things a lot easier a lot more

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.790 
made things a lot easier a lot more
recognizable<00:01:46.810> so<00:01:46.900> you<00:01:46.990> can<00:01:47.110> keep<00:01:47.530> your<00:01:47.680> eyes
