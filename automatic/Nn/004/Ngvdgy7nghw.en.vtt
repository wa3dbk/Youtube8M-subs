00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
major problems the problem with ethanol

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.040 
major problems the problem with ethanol
the<00:02:36.700> biggest<00:02:37.030> problem<00:02:37.360> we<00:02:37.510> have<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.840> draws

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
the biggest problem we have it draws

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.460 
the biggest problem we have it draws
water<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.510> pulls<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:40.930> from<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.170> air<00:02:41.290> it's

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
water and it pulls it from the air it's

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.530 
water and it pulls it from the air it's
with<00:02:41.620> hydroscopic<00:02:42.190> is<00:02:42.519> the<00:02:42.670> cause<00:02:42.880> that's<00:02:43.450> the

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
with hydroscopic is the cause that's the

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.870 
with hydroscopic is the cause that's the
biggest<00:02:43.750> problem<00:02:44.130> so<00:02:45.130> it's<00:02:45.310> like<00:02:45.489> a<00:02:45.519> sponge

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
biggest problem so it's like a sponge

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.630 
biggest problem so it's like a sponge
and<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:46.690> alcohol<00:02:46.989> is<00:02:47.319> in<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.830> gasoline<00:02:48.250> as

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
and that alcohol is in the gasoline as

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.449 
and that alcohol is in the gasoline as
the<00:02:49.000> additive<00:02:49.420> is<00:02:49.540> drawn<00:02:49.900> into<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.530> water

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
the additive is drawn into the water

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.880 
the additive is drawn into the water
then<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:52.209> course<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.600> water<00:02:52.840> sinks<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.739> main

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
then of course the water sinks the main

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.770 
then of course the water sinks the main
course<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.940> person<00:02:55.269> pours<00:02:55.480> off<00:02:55.660> the

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
course and the person pours off the

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.839 
course and the person pours off the
Barbican<00:02:56.410> then<00:02:56.799> they<00:02:56.980> fill<00:02:57.370> up<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.640> gas<00:02:57.819> tank

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
Barbican then they fill up the gas tank

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.190 
Barbican then they fill up the gas tank
full<00:02:58.450> of<00:02:58.510> water<00:02:59.319> so<00:02:59.940> that's<00:03:00.940> one<00:03:01.420> situation

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
full of water so that's one situation

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.020 
full of water so that's one situation
the<00:03:02.319> other<00:03:02.349> situation<00:03:03.069> is<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.340> burn<00:03:03.519> rate<00:03:03.790> the

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
the other situation is the burn rate the

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.850 
the other situation is the burn rate the
burn<00:03:04.209> rates<00:03:04.480> worse<00:03:04.750> than<00:03:05.080> what<00:03:05.440> we<00:03:05.560> had<00:03:05.709> before

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
burn rates worse than what we had before

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.220 
burn rates worse than what we had before
so<00:03:06.430> as<00:03:06.760> it<00:03:07.360> burns<00:03:07.630> it<00:03:08.500> actually<00:03:09.040> has<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.730> poor

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
so as it burns it actually has a poor

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.020 
so as it burns it actually has a poor
quality<00:03:11.230> so<00:03:11.769> it<00:03:11.890> doesn't<00:03:12.130> burn<00:03:12.250> off<00:03:12.430> all<00:03:12.640> of<00:03:12.880> so

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
quality so it doesn't burn off all of so

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.210 
quality so it doesn't burn off all of so
you<00:03:13.120> have<00:03:13.239> a<00:03:13.269> lot<00:03:13.510> of<00:03:13.540> you<00:03:14.319> know<00:03:14.349> leftover

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
you have a lot of you know leftover

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.979 
you have a lot of you know leftover
material<00:03:15.700> inside<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.180> cylinder<00:03:16.570> head<00:03:16.750> what

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
material inside the cylinder head what

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.810 
material inside the cylinder head what
have<00:03:17.170> you<00:03:17.350> and<00:03:17.590> it<00:03:17.769> causes<00:03:18.190> you<00:03:18.310> know<00:03:18.430> plugging

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
have you and it causes you know plugging

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.449 
have you and it causes you know plugging
up<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.109> intake<00:03:20.109> ports<00:03:20.530> down<00:03:20.709> much<00:03:21.070> less<00:03:21.280> the

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
up the intake ports down much less the

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.240 
up the intake ports down much less the
exhaust<00:03:21.790> ports<00:03:22.180> but<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.510> actual<00:03:23.250> diameter

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
exhaust ports but the actual diameter

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.870 
exhaust ports but the actual diameter
decreases<00:03:25.030> on<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:25.890> intake<00:03:26.890> port<00:03:27.190> so<00:03:27.549> if<00:03:27.730> you

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
decreases on the intake port so if you

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.789 
decreases on the intake port so if you
crazy<00:03:28.090> since<00:03:28.299> I<00:03:28.450> see<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.720> complete<00:03:29.109> list<00:03:29.140> intake

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
crazy since I see a complete list intake

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.039 
crazy since I see a complete list intake
less<00:03:30.040> air<00:03:30.310> but<00:03:30.970> still<00:03:31.209> makes<00:03:31.480> it<00:03:31.660> less<00:03:31.780> power

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
less air but still makes it less power

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.960 
less air but still makes it less power
than<00:03:32.410> on<00:03:32.590> their<00:03:32.739> exhaust<00:03:33.400> port<00:03:33.730> when<00:03:33.880> it

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
than on their exhaust port when it

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.729 
than on their exhaust port when it
doesn't<00:03:34.299> burn<00:03:34.390> that<00:03:34.600> off<00:03:34.660> yes<00:03:35.109> particulars

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
doesn't burn that off yes particulars

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.009 
doesn't burn that off yes particulars
left<00:03:35.980> over<00:03:36.310> because<00:03:37.120> our<00:03:37.299> equipment<00:03:37.900> has

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
left over because our equipment has

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
cattle converters on there close those

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.599 
cattle converters on there close those
up<00:03:40.150> so<00:03:40.569> you<00:03:40.660> can't<00:03:40.930> get<00:03:41.139> as<00:03:41.440> much<00:03:42.010> any<00:03:42.280> but<00:03:42.579> you

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
up so you can't get as much any but you

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.699 
up so you can't get as much any but you
can't<00:03:42.910> get<00:03:43.090> it<00:03:43.180> out<00:03:43.359> plus<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:44.139> burn<00:03:44.319> of<00:03:44.470> course

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
can't get it out plus the burn of course

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:45.569 
can't get it out plus the burn of course
yeah

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579
