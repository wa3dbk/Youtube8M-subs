00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.530 
everything if you see this and then it
comes<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.480> me<00:02:20.570> like<00:02:20.810> that

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.130 

now<00:02:24.930> what<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:25.319> knots<00:02:25.620> gonna<00:02:25.890> do<00:02:27.019> it's<00:02:28.019> a

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
now what this knots gonna do it's a

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.869 
now what this knots gonna do it's a
friction<00:02:28.560> not<00:02:28.680> also<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.310> can<00:02:29.489> pull<00:02:29.730> it

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
friction not also that you can pull it

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.240 
friction not also that you can pull it
you<00:02:30.180> can<00:02:30.299> stay<00:02:30.629> solid<00:02:32.750> so<00:02:33.750> I've<00:02:33.870> got<00:02:34.019> it

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
you can stay solid so I've got it

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.309 
you can stay solid so I've got it
erected<00:02:35.250> if<00:02:35.400> you'll<00:02:36.030> notice<00:02:36.239> I<00:02:36.480> have<00:02:36.689> on<00:02:37.170> the

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
erected if you'll notice I have on the

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.229 
erected if you'll notice I have on the
corners<00:02:37.739> I<00:02:37.860> put<00:02:37.890> down<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.250> couple<00:02:38.549> of<00:02:38.640> rocks

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
corners I put down a couple of rocks

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.839 
corners I put down a couple of rocks
later<00:02:40.019> on<00:02:40.230> I'll<00:02:40.379> put<00:02:40.560> down<00:02:40.590> more<00:02:40.920> rocks<00:02:41.190> if<00:02:41.610> you

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
later on I'll put down more rocks if you

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.000 
later on I'll put down more rocks if you

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
had your aluminum stakes that's where

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.860 
had your aluminum stakes that's where
you<00:02:44.190> would<00:02:44.310> use<00:02:44.549> them<00:02:44.790> but<00:02:45.480> what<00:02:45.629> I'm<00:02:45.720> going<00:02:45.840> to

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
make this a better shelter would be at

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.420 
make this a better shelter would be at
some<00:03:30.579> point<00:03:30.879> like<00:03:31.269> really<00:03:31.659> quickly

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
some point like really quickly

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.030 
some point like really quickly
dig<00:03:33.430> out<00:03:33.579> some<00:03:34.200> ditches<00:03:35.200> along<00:03:35.319> the<00:03:35.560> side<00:03:35.799> for

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
dig out some ditches along the side for

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.809 
dig out some ditches along the side for
rainwater<00:03:36.519> to<00:03:37.060> drop<00:03:41.250> inside<00:03:42.250> I<00:03:42.280> would<00:03:42.549> lay<00:03:42.670> my

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
rainwater to drop inside I would lay my

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.369 
rainwater to drop inside I would lay my
poncho<00:03:43.120> down<00:03:43.540> or<00:03:44.230> some<00:03:44.530> other<00:03:44.709> waterproof

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
poncho down or some other waterproof

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.869 
poncho down or some other waterproof
sheet<00:03:47.379> or<00:03:47.560> something<00:03:47.590> like<00:03:48.010> that<00:03:48.280> and<00:03:48.459> then

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
sheet or something like that and then

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.759 
sheet or something like that and then
prop<00:03:49.150> up<00:03:49.329> the<00:03:49.480> edges<00:03:49.870> with<00:03:50.019> other<00:03:50.230> rocks<00:03:50.560> so

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
prop up the edges with other rocks so

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.330 
prop up the edges with other rocks so
you<00:03:50.829> have<00:03:51.010> kind<00:03:51.159> of<00:03:51.310> a<00:03:51.370> bowl<00:03:51.669> in<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.060> middle<00:03:53.340> on

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
you have kind of a bowl in the middle on

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.349 
you have kind of a bowl in the middle on
the<00:03:54.370> uphill<00:03:55.150> side<00:03:55.349> you<00:03:56.349> can<00:03:56.500> see<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.799> shadows

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
the uphill side you can see the shadows

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.210 
the uphill side you can see the shadows
those<00:03:58.359> come<00:03:58.659> from<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.319> tree<00:03:59.560> branches<00:04:00.040> right

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
those come from the tree branches right

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.800 
those come from the tree branches right
above<00:04:00.549> it<00:04:00.669> which<00:04:00.879> would<00:04:01.060> serve<00:04:01.299> as<00:04:01.480> a<00:04:01.510> drip

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
above it which would serve as a drip

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.190 
above it which would serve as a drip
line<00:04:02.129> if<00:04:03.129> it<00:04:03.370> rained<00:04:03.609> the<00:04:03.989> water<00:04:04.989> would<00:04:05.169> be

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
line if it rained the water would be

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.869 
line if it rained the water would be
hitting<00:04:05.500> right<00:04:05.769> about<00:04:06.040> where<00:04:06.220> those<00:04:06.400> shadows

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
hitting right about where those shadows

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.170 
hitting right about where those shadows
were<00:04:07.150> so<00:04:07.810> you<00:04:07.900> can<00:04:08.230> probably<00:04:08.829> depend<00:04:09.730> on<00:04:10.030> the

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
were so you can probably depend on the

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.460 
were so you can probably depend on the
fact<00:04:10.389> you<00:04:10.540> don't<00:04:10.629> get<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:10.840> lot<00:04:10.959> of<00:04:11.019> splash

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
fact you don't get a lot of splash

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.770 
fact you don't get a lot of splash
through<00:04:11.739> right<00:04:12.159> on<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.790> front<00:04:13.060> entrance

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.420 

that's<00:04:16.780> a<00:04:16.959> quick<00:04:17.139> easy<00:04:17.409> way<00:04:17.739> to<00:04:17.769> make<00:04:18.130> an

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
that's a quick easy way to make an

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.300 
that's a quick easy way to make an
a-frame<00:04:18.729> shelter<00:04:19.409> all<00:04:20.409> you<00:04:20.560> have<00:04:20.709> to<00:04:20.859> take<00:04:21.070> is
