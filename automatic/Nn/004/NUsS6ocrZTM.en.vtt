around blood well dad you don't even

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.260 
around blood well dad you don't even
know<00:01:11.549> what<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.700> title<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.000> going<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.210> be

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
know what the title is going to be

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.429 
know what the title is going to be
called<00:01:12.479> yet<00:01:12.659> I'm<00:01:12.810> gonna<00:01:12.960> have<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.170> think<00:01:13.350> it

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
called yet I'm gonna have to think it

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.280 
called yet I'm gonna have to think it
out<00:01:13.500> between<00:01:13.650> now<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.100> upload<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:15.290> but

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
out between now and upload this but but

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.539 
out between now and upload this but but
I<00:01:16.320> thought<00:01:16.500> should<00:01:16.680> be<00:01:16.740> unfortunate<00:01:17.520> to

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
I thought should be unfortunate to

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.060 
I thought should be unfortunate to
concede<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.090> goal<00:01:18.420> there<00:01:18.710> that<00:01:19.710> goes<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.890> bit

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
concede that goal there that goes a bit

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.340 
concede that goal there that goes a bit
of<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.189> midget<00:01:20.520> but<00:01:20.700> immediately<00:01:21.479> we<00:01:21.900> hit<00:01:22.140> back

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
of a midget but immediately we hit back

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.080 
of a midget but immediately we hit back
with<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.710> nice<00:01:22.920> little<00:01:22.950> power<00:01:23.430> shot<00:01:23.759> from<00:01:23.909> me

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
with a nice little power shot from me

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.200 
with a nice little power shot from me
there<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:25.530> then<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:25.950> pull<00:01:26.220> out<00:01:26.250> heels<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.150> a

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
was free free people playing so it's

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.449 
was free free people playing so it's
always<00:03:15.469> tough<00:03:15.650> on<00:03:15.829> you're<00:03:15.950> outnumbered<00:03:16.069> on

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
always tough on you're outnumbered on

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.270 
always tough on you're outnumbered on
virtual<00:03:16.819> pros<00:03:17.000> on<00:03:17.150> that<00:03:17.329> and<00:03:17.709> I<00:03:18.709> think<00:03:19.069> that<00:03:19.190> my

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
virtual pros on that and I think that my

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.800 
virtual pros on that and I think that my
life<00:03:19.459> over<00:03:19.669> the<00:03:19.849> back<00:03:19.940> ultra<00:03:20.269> defensive<00:03:20.659> just

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
life over the back ultra defensive just

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.149 
life over the back ultra defensive just
so<00:03:21.019> hard<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.319> break<00:03:21.530> down<00:03:21.680> as<00:03:21.889> you<00:03:21.949> can<00:03:22.069> see

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 
so hard to break down as you can see

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:23.289 
so hard to break down as you can see
there<00:03:22.310> we<00:03:22.370> only<00:03:22.459> got<00:03:22.579> one<00:03:22.639> shot<00:03:22.760> away<00:03:23.060> that

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
there we only got one shot away that

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.270 
there we only got one shot away that
first<00:03:24.049> half<00:03:24.290> so<00:03:24.620> we<00:03:24.709> need<00:03:24.829> the<00:03:24.859> second<00:03:25.159> hug

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280
