00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:13.981
The peace of Sabbath morning glimmers gently.

00:00:14.855 --> 00:00:28.630
Worldly clamour yields, fighting ceases.

00:00:29.603 --> 00:00:43.544
Hark, the bells of celebration peal from afar,

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:58.375
thence sounds a summons to the Lord's temple.

00:00:59.273 --> 00:01:13.240
Hark, the bells of celebration peal from afar,

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:28.082
thence sounds a summons to the Lord's temple.

00:01:30.517 --> 00:01:44.265
O Lord, evoke a spirit of celebration in our hearts,

00:01:45.292 --> 00:01:59.026
grant our souls redemption and peace!

00:02:00.011 --> 00:02:14.027
Give me strength from above

00:02:14.828 --> 00:02:28.644
that I may be your faithful servant.

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:43.530
Give me strength from above

00:02:44.444 --> 00:02:58.572
that I may be your faithful servant.

00:03:00.948 --> 00:03:14.862
Bright Sabbath morning! Fasten my mind

00:03:15.682 --> 00:03:29.603
on peace that lasts through the ages;

00:03:30.511 --> 00:03:44.525
on the hymn of praise that resounds in heaven

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:59.246
where your people can find rest.

00:04:00.174 --> 00:04:14.108
on the hymn of praise that resounds in heaven

00:04:14.888 --> 00:04:30.431
where your people can find rest.
