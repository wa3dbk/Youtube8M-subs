ceremony we're generally all shooting

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.550 
ceremony we're generally all shooting
from<00:02:13.790> three<00:02:14.270> angles<00:02:14.660> we<00:02:14.840> have<00:02:14.959> one<00:02:15.170> primary

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
from three angles we have one primary

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.280 
from three angles we have one primary
angle<00:02:16.040> into<00:02:16.430> secondary<00:02:17.090> angles<00:02:17.450> so<00:02:18.050> we<00:02:18.170> do

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
angle into secondary angles so we do

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.290 
angle into secondary angles so we do
something<00:02:18.590> that<00:02:18.709> we<00:02:18.890> refer<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.280> as<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.610> stack

something that we refer to as the stack

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.210 
something that we refer to as the stack
and<00:02:20.330> this<00:02:20.660> is<00:02:20.780> where<00:02:20.930> basically<00:02:21.230> one<00:02:21.650> cinema

everything from

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.420 
everything from

working<00:02:30.520> from<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:30.970> three<00:02:31.330> angles<00:02:31.480> we<00:02:31.810> end<00:02:31.960> up

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
working from the three angles we end up

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.110 
working from the three angles we end up
not<00:02:32.050> getting<00:02:32.410> in<00:02:32.620> each<00:02:32.680> other's<00:02:32.860> shots<00:02:33.280> so<00:02:34.090> we

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
thing is that since we're shooting from

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.600 
thing is that since we're shooting from
multiple<00:04:41.050> angles<00:04:41.260> anyway<00:04:41.830> were<00:04:42.070> generally

multiple angles anyway were generally

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.010 
multiple angles anyway were generally
always<00:04:42.909> going<00:04:43.000> to<00:04:43.090> have<00:04:43.150> an<00:04:43.509> additional

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
always going to have an additional

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.869
