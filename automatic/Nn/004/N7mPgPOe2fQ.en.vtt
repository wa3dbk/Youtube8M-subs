00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:29.130
 take a ktm duke 125 200 or 300 90 and 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.790
 grafted him everything that makes a sportswoman

 and 390 the new little sportswoman 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.820
 ktm's road is a little wonder 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.980
 simply because it adopts the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.980
 refinements needed to get a 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.250
 motorcycle and very enjoyable with 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.030
 an aesthetic ip represents refer to him 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.359
 all that makes a sportsman know 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.420
 halves bracelet a full fairing 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:01.770
 a saddle looks like a monohull but 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.570
 subtlety 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.070
 it's a passenger saddle it's not 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.190
 a hard shell that gives the impression 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.740
 to be single seater it's just hyper 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.050
 succeeded in the image of the bike whose 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.470
 finish is excellent this bike will be 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.960
 made in India 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.140
 place that juke we can also 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.310
 appreciate at the front the LEDs which emphasizes 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.740
 the 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.899
 city â€‹â€‹going back slightly on the 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.390
 deflectors a little wonder that 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.470
 In any case, we greatly appreciate 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.360
 beautiful visual slap 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.329
 let's not forget a very important point 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.579
 on these tunes it is 125 200 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:39.070
 or 300 90 they can be equipped with 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:41.289
 the bs and in France the decline will be same 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.970
 mounted as standard on imported models 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.560

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.649

 kilowatts the KTM RC 390 is 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.750
 compatible with the new license 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.940
 European at 2 she will also be very 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.069
 nice to go to stretch 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.390
 red on the runway the weekend that this 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:00.159
