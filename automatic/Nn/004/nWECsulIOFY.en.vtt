00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.890
 O 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.290
 O 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.910
 that he earns money 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.019
 we also do here within the real 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.019
 so it explores kraft 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.519
 only to show slow movements 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.150
 very quickly 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.150
 without many details 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.730
 I'll start 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.010
 to the picket it's a commodore I can pick up every year 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.830
 The advantage is that I can get a hero 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.900
 and I can be strong told the enemy era 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.530
 which has the advantage 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.420
 the disadvantage of there mode because 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.380
 the enemy can 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.380
 chose a hero who is has advantages over my 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.020
 in him 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.780
 I will 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.780
 so I thought I'd start over again, paulo souto mayor 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.170
 already dead 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.230
 Now let's go to the air mode. 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.230
 radical sent a pm 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.440
 or computer have randomly chosen an era for me not 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.410
 matter what the audience had the victory 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:25.330
 is the advantage is common or you get with 853 goldfrapp 25 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.550
 It is so successful in the age to use this goal of doses 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.700
 the way very well there 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.090
 have 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.490
 to surf 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.400
 is there disadvantage here you can fall when it is you will be able to 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:39.240
 play 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.900
 nadesan plays a lot of time 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.810
 it gets bad there 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.970
 Buddha or tupiniquim 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.260
 the automatic sample 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.689
 walter 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.920
 second module presidency 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.220
 this art consortium 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.900
 an advanced computer is randomly chosen a hero of 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.130
 intelligence is here in 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.200
 stay at your end 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.650
 who rescued her 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.010
 kimmel south show was the face 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.479
 the unasul 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.989
 he is clearly the intelligence hero for us and goes from 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.269
 agility 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.379
 is that the pavan behind it think the pt sees no advantage 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.420
 however the agencies we are here only see disadvantages here 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:26.199
 can have three hours of siege saw never played 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:27.800
 trad 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.800
 the goal changed the rule 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:34.119
 that's it 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:36.779
 it is 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:40.909
 dutra and doing other victory said that this was for everyone 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:43.079
 at the time 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.039

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:51.019
 world of bush 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.349
 and you're going to campaign so far 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.459
 maybe in the future probably did lose 1 

00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:01.139
 to participate in some confrontation a little thing 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.209
