00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:56.180
 and seeing that another built and this 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.430

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.680
 luck has big friendly monsters 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.540

 changing the hair or painting us the 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.020

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.450
 cares like nobody but draculaura is a 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.880
 vampiresa different from the others and that's 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.380
 turns into a very special monster 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.060
 with nothing to wear and in the last 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.670
 moment I will decide for the first of the 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.700
 team is not like the other vampires 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.060

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.890
