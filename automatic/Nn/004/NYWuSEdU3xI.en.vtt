00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.219
 good afternoon friends and yuri primachenko i 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.699
 welcome you to carpenter not channel 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.380
 I already talked about the fact that many 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.300
 the videos that I shoot they appear 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.060
 spontaneously depending on orders 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.250
 which i'm doing here in this case 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.269
 exactly the same spontaneous shooting 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.960
 asked me to do the grates on 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.960
 batteries 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.489
 but make them not just anyhow but 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.340
 it looked pretty 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.129
 there was a removable there was access to the faucets and 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.489
 so then I decided to do 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.850
 such here 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.910
 lattice it 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.680
 grilles to the edge in the corridor and the top 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.920
 part is like a 100 ladder on 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.940
 which can be put umbrella handbag 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:59.309
 cap and so on the decision was made 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:03.949
 assembled as follows glued 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:07.320
 front frame she stuck on simple 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:10.430
 standing connection thorn groove and that 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.590
 interestingly the upper part is 60 millimeters 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.740
 side 80 mm and bottom 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.470
 100 millimeters for what it is made it 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.470
 made to glue 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.430
 overlapped tanks and by the way I connected on 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.460
 lamellas we got here state 100 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:36.500
 millimeters and imposing 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:41.340
 and putting the decoration in the form of thread 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.530
 as you can see, then it will go down too 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.420
 pad but someone says you need 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.899
 call them pilasters but centimeter 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.240
 rail grooves profrizit even somehow 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.140
 call pilasters language is not 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.630
 turns and below will be 40 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.049
 millimeter plinth and so 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.299
 it turns out that we have the frame itself 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.009
 will remain visible part of 60 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.740
 millimeters ie will be respected 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.380
 some proportion 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.849
 the grille itself is made of oak plan 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.110
 Chick planochki 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.410
 Fugue blank valis on the wing and then 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.420
 on 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.560
 circulars were cut to a thickness of 3 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.140
 millimeter rear left edge of the cut in 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.660
 not that it will not be visible on this 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.440
 you can not pay attention to all was 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:35.930
 targeted by carnations naturally through 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:39.440
 glue with carnations from a pistol video about 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.709
 which is on my channel gun 4 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.709
 pro 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:51.740
 But here are ready two grids for batteries 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:54.080
 one slightly more than 1 slightly less stand 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.200
 they will be this right side against the wall 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:01.310
 it's left side against the wall so i'm 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.230
 using the opportunity given to me here 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.450
 used on the side for example there is a piece 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.910
 book which will not be visible but all 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.940
 the rest is oak floor kerala on the floor 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:15.520
 matt varnish he's and carvings made from 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.770
 linden but under tinted they were 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:24.820
 training light oak 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:26.680
 These are two high-rises I have 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:31.240
 on battery 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:34.190
 Well, labor costs are difficult to estimate because 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:38.740
 they were made in parallel with others 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:44.900
 some orders well, I think that no less 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:48.380
 those for both took a total of 15 16 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:52.940
 man hours plus material fret all 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:55.070
 the rest but still wanted to say that 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.940
 in general, then some details we have 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:01.700
 stayed with previous orders here to me 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.830
 I had to do only the plinth here 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.540
 short details were used that did not 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.060
 entered the steps and so on that is 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.830
 goes like 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.400
 use of resources in general 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:17.239
 who remain in the shop 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:20.320
 Here on such small products thanks 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:25.240

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.240
