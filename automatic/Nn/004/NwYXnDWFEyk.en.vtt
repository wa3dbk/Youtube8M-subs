00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
important one of the key things that I

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.009 
important one of the key things that I
like<00:04:19.859> to<00:04:20.010> look<00:04:20.099> at<00:04:20.280> personally<00:04:20.729> is<00:04:21.019> the

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
like to look at personally is the

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.050 
like to look at personally is the
ability<00:04:22.320> of<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:23.180> people<00:04:24.180> authoring<00:04:24.539> in<00:04:24.630> order

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
ability of the people authoring in order

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.800 
ability of the people authoring in order
work<00:04:25.180> to<00:04:25.960> identify<00:04:26.500> key<00:04:27.430> timing<00:04:27.760> points<00:04:28.330> when

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
work to identify key timing points when

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.870 
work to identify key timing points when
they<00:04:28.930> do<00:04:28.990> occur<00:04:29.250> so<00:04:30.250> you<00:04:30.310> know<00:04:30.580> even<00:04:30.730> though

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
they do occur so you know even though

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.120 
they do occur so you know even though
they're<00:04:31.030> taking<00:04:31.240> a<00:04:31.300> long-term<00:04:31.540> perspective

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
they're taking a long-term perspective

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.690 
they're taking a long-term perspective
timing<00:04:33.130> still<00:04:33.460> does<00:04:33.910> play<00:04:34.510> a<00:04:34.870> factor<00:04:35.669> so<00:04:36.669> I

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
timing still does play a factor so I

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.879 
timing still does play a factor so I
like<00:04:37.000> to<00:04:37.030> eval<00:04:37.419> in<00:04:37.960> all<00:04:38.139> you<00:04:38.620> know<00:04:38.650> whether

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
like to eval in all you know whether

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.500 
like to eval in all you know whether
you're<00:04:39.010> active<00:04:39.340> trading<00:04:39.610> or<00:04:39.910> long<00:04:40.300> term

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
you're active trading or long term

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.640

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
trading there's still that issue of

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.580 
trading there's still that issue of

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
timing so I was looking through past

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.750 
timing so I was looking through past
letters<00:04:45.010> of<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.610> Morgan<00:04:45.910> report<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:46.720> see<00:04:46.930> how

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
how it was with timing one thing that

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.940 
how it was with timing one thing that
they<00:04:51.040> definitely<00:04:51.460> got<00:04:51.639> right<00:04:52.030> was<00:04:52.710> and<00:04:53.710> here

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.480 
members that Morgan that exited his
speculative<00:05:08.350> positions<00:05:08.950> and<00:05:09.070> that<00:05:09.220> was<00:05:09.400> very

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
speculative positions and that was very

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.909
