big bill type home but I guess it's a 10
I<00:00:37.120> think<00:00:37.239> this<00:00:37.510> is<00:00:37.570> a<00:00:37.600> regular<00:00:37.870> size<00:00:38.020> for<00:00:38.199> 10<00:00:38.350> F

sharp<00:00:39.460> comes<00:00:40.059> with<00:00:40.239> good<00:00:40.449> luck<00:00:40.660> this<00:00:40.840> case<00:00:41.109> but

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
sharp comes with good luck this case but

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.619 
sharp comes with good luck this case but
it's<00:00:41.530> pretty<00:00:41.859> it's<00:00:42.460> just<00:00:42.699> a<00:00:42.820> regular<00:00:43.210> lack<00:00:43.449> of

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
it's pretty it's just a regular lack of

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.500 
it's pretty it's just a regular lack of
corn<00:00:43.989> and<00:00:44.590> it<00:00:44.800> has<00:00:45.070> a<00:00:45.309> wonderful<00:00:45.850> sound<00:00:46.090> as<00:00:46.390> you

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
some places but I think this is because

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.470 
some places but I think this is because
people<00:00:52.899> could<00:00:53.140> be<00:00:53.230> dinner<00:00:53.379> planner<00:00:53.800> and<00:00:54.480> but

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
people could be dinner planner and but

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.849 
people could be dinner planner and but
for<00:00:55.629> $800<00:00:56.260> days<00:01:00.510> they'll<00:01:01.510> start<00:01:01.870> something

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 
for $800 days they'll start something

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:05.250 
for $800 days they'll start something

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260

sharp<00:01:05.530> key<00:01:05.890> I<00:01:07.710> had<00:01:08.710> a<00:01:08.740> little<00:01:08.950> tip<00:01:09.880> with<00:01:10.060> that

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549
