00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
frame just like our production car we

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.150 
frame just like our production car we
build<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> frame<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.710> Bowling<00:00:37.980> Green

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
build the frame in Bowling Green

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.670 
build the frame in Bowling Green
Kentucky<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:39.210> forty<00:00:39.600> percent<00:00:39.930> stiffer<00:00:40.440> than

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
Kentucky it's forty percent stiffer than

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.340 
Kentucky it's forty percent stiffer than
the<00:00:41.010> c6.r<00:00:41.880> that<00:00:42.480> translates<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.170> better

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
the c6.r that translates to better

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.260 
the c6.r that translates to better
handling<00:00:43.860> on<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> track<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.610> better

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
handling on the track and better

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.569 
handling on the track and better
durability<00:00:45.690> over<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.290> long<00:00:46.530> term<00:00:46.559> races<00:00:47.309> 10

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.810 
12 and 24 hours the Corvette c7.r
features<00:00:51.780> direct<00:00:52.649> injection<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.460> engine

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
features direct injection in the engine

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.940 
features direct injection in the engine
just<00:00:53.850> like<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.450> the<00:00:54.570> Corvette<00:00:54.870> zo6<00:00:55.020> there's<00:00:55.829> so

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
just like on the Corvette zo6 there's so

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.100 
just like on the Corvette zo6 there's so
many<00:00:56.070> benefits<00:00:56.550> for<00:00:56.610> direct<00:00:56.910> injection<00:00:57.210> for

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
many benefits for direct injection for

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.170 
many benefits for direct injection for
more<00:00:58.260> precise<00:00:58.649> throttle<00:00:59.070> control<00:00:59.460> it's<00:01:00.059> more

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
more precise throttle control it's more

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.639 
more precise throttle control it's more
efficient<00:01:00.660> burn<00:01:00.840> inside<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.320> combustion

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
efficient burn inside the combustion

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.889 
efficient burn inside the combustion
chamber<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.850> provides<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.660> driver

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
chamber and that provides the driver

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.899 
chamber and that provides the driver
with<00:01:04.170> power<00:01:04.439> when<00:01:04.619> they<00:01:04.710> need<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.279> fuel

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
with power when they need it and fuel

Corvette<00:01:09.149> c7.r<00:01:09.779> we<00:01:10.409> bring<00:01:10.649> the<00:01:10.770> air<00:01:10.889> in<00:01:11.009> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
Corvette c7.r we bring the air in the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.919 
Corvette c7.r we bring the air in the
lower<00:01:11.310> air<00:01:11.579> intake<00:01:11.999> we<00:01:12.299> drive<00:01:12.569> it<00:01:12.719> through<00:01:12.869> a

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:12.929 
lower air intake we drive it through a

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:15.260 
lower air intake we drive it through a
tilted<00:01:13.289> radiator<00:01:13.709> to<00:01:13.920> cool<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.340> engine<00:01:14.759> we

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
tilted radiator to cool the engine we

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.789 
tilted radiator to cool the engine we
take<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.569> hot<00:01:15.749> air<00:01:15.990> out<00:01:16.170> through<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.619> hood

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
take the hot air out through that hood

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.889 
take the hot air out through that hood
extractor<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.909> there's<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.149> couple<00:01:18.329> benefits

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
extractor and there's a couple benefits

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:21.620 
extractor and there's a couple benefits
one<00:01:19.319> we<00:01:19.499> reduce<00:01:19.889> lift<00:01:20.249> and<00:01:20.520> two<00:01:21.149> we<00:01:21.329> improve

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
one we reduce lift and two we improve

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.389 
one we reduce lift and two we improve
downforce<00:01:22.109> and<00:01:22.380> that's<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.189> winning

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
downforce and that's a winning

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:25.819 
downforce and that's a winning
combination<00:01:23.999> for<00:01:24.539> the<00:01:24.569> racetrack<00:01:24.990> when<00:01:25.740> it

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
combination for the racetrack when it

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:27.949 
combination for the racetrack when it
comes<00:01:26.099> to<00:01:26.219> aerodynamics<00:01:26.399> the<00:01:27.119> Corvette<00:01:27.659> zo6

00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:27.959 
comes to aerodynamics the Corvette zo6

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:30.589 
comes to aerodynamics the Corvette zo6
has<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.799> most<00:01:29.069> down<00:01:29.340> force<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.789> any<00:01:30.119> Corvette

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:30.599 
has the most down force of any Corvette

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:32.480 
has the most down force of any Corvette
we've<00:01:30.779> ever<00:01:30.990> put<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:31.289> the<00:01:31.439> road<00:01:31.619> we

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
we've ever put on the road we

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.370 
we've ever put on the road we
co-developed<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.479> aerodynamics<00:01:34.109> for<00:01:34.289> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
co-developed the aerodynamics for the
