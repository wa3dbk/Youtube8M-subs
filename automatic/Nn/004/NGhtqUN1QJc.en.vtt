00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
around the scapula as you're working

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.080 
around the scapula as you're working
around<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:16.200> area<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.980> may<00:00:17.220> notice<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.820> bump

that you go over here and what this bump
is<00:00:22.200> is<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.739> lower<00:00:22.950> edge<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.700> trapezius

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.450 
is is the lower edge of the trapezius

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.769 
is is the lower edge of the trapezius
muscle<00:00:25.020> the<00:00:25.829> trapezius<00:00:26.640> attaches<00:00:27.360> from<00:00:27.390> the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
muscle the trapezius attaches from the

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.080 
muscle the trapezius attaches from the
occiput<00:00:28.259> from<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.009> nuchal<00:00:29.369> ligament<00:00:29.550> and

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
occiput from the nuchal ligament and

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.720 
occiput from the nuchal ligament and
spinous<00:00:30.720> processes<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.680> all<00:00:31.950> the<00:00:32.189> cervical

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
spinous processes of all the cervical

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.569 
spinous processes of all the cervical
and<00:00:32.850> thoracic<00:00:33.030> vertebrae<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.100> comes<00:00:35.340> up

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
and thoracic vertebrae so it comes up

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.720 
and thoracic vertebrae so it comes up
from<00:00:35.850> t12<00:00:36.510> coming<00:00:37.050> up<00:00:37.200> fairly<00:00:37.530> narrow<00:00:37.980> up<00:00:38.370> to

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
from t12 coming up fairly narrow up to

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.450 
from t12 coming up fairly narrow up to
the<00:00:38.940> edge<00:00:39.150> of<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.540> scapula<00:00:40.230> but<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.070> attaches

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the edge of the scapula but it attaches

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.620 
the edge of the scapula but it attaches
up<00:00:41.910> here<00:00:42.330> along<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.900> spine<00:00:43.470> of<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.830> scapula

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
up here along the spine of the scapula

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.360 
up here along the spine of the scapula
so<00:00:45.630> when<00:00:45.810> you're<00:00:45.990> working<00:00:46.200> right<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:46.890> here

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
what you're bouncing over is the lower

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.360 
what you're bouncing over is the lower
edge<00:00:50.400> of<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> trapezius<00:00:51.630> I<00:00:51.930> can't<00:00:52.920> tell<00:00:53.220> you

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
edge of the trapezius I can't tell you

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.160 
edge of the trapezius I can't tell you
how<00:00:53.640> many<00:00:53.700> times<00:00:54.240> I've<00:00:54.540> had<00:00:54.720> massage

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
how many times I've had massage

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.920

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
therapists work on me they find this

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.290 
therapists work on me they find this

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
bump and they say oh you've got a knot

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.900 
bump and they say oh you've got a knot
there<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.900> they<00:01:01.170> try<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.470> dig<00:01:01.740> it<00:01:01.890> out<00:01:02.040> and<00:01:02.760> I

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
there and they try to dig it out and I

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.789 
there and they try to dig it out and I
have<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.240> explain<00:01:03.600> no<00:01:03.870> that's<00:01:04.140> not<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> knot

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
have to explain no that's not a knot

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.219 
have to explain no that's not a knot
that's<00:01:05.640> muscle<00:01:06.060> that's<00:01:06.509> the<00:01:06.689> edge<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
that's muscle that's the edge of the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.020 
that's muscle that's the edge of the
muscle<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:07.950> supposed<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.490> be<00:01:08.729> there

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
muscle and it's supposed to be there

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.959 
muscle and it's supposed to be there
there's<00:01:09.899> no<00:01:10.170> real<00:01:10.409> value<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.189> working<00:01:11.789> this

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:11.969 
there's no real value in working this

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:13.819 
there's no real value in working this
because<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.869> not<00:01:13.079> even<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.469> muscle

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:13.829 
because this is not even a muscle

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:16.910 
because this is not even a muscle
attachment<00:01:14.609> the<00:01:15.299> trapezius<00:01:16.049> does<00:01:16.289> not<00:01:16.530> attach

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
attachment the trapezius does not attach

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.999 
attachment the trapezius does not attach
here<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.490> crosses<00:01:18.119> over<00:01:18.329> and<00:01:18.799> attaches<00:01:19.799> up

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
here it crosses over and attaches up

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.370 
here it crosses over and attaches up
here<00:01:20.340> along<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.729> spine<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.539> scapula

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
here along the spine of the scapula

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.520 
here along the spine of the scapula
so<00:01:23.340> working<00:01:23.639> this<00:01:24.030> bump<00:01:24.389> right<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.929> here<00:01:25.229> will

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
so working this bump right in here will

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.700 
so working this bump right in here will
only<00:01:25.740> serve<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.219> irritate<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.899> may<00:01:28.200> be<00:01:28.259> okay

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
only serve to irritate it it may be okay

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.260 
only serve to irritate it it may be okay
if<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.950> don't<00:01:29.159> like<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.579> person<00:01:29.789> but<00:01:30.210> I

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
really don't recommend working into this

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.449 
really don't recommend working into this
spot<00:01:33.090> here<00:01:33.569> there's<00:01:34.289> no<00:01:34.499> real<00:01:34.709> therapeutic

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:35.459 
spot here there's no real therapeutic

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:39.440 
spot here there's no real therapeutic
value<00:01:35.909> in<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:37.340> here<00:01:38.340> with<00:01:38.609> Darla's<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.240> can

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
value in that here with Darla's you can

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.929 
value in that here with Darla's you can
actually<00:01:39.840> see<00:01:40.139> the<00:01:40.350> fibers<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.069> trapezius

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
actually see the fibers of the trapezius

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.749 
actually see the fibers of the trapezius
working<00:01:42.600> as<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.439> middle<00:01:43.740> fibers<00:01:44.189> are<00:01:44.399> working

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
working as the middle fibers are working

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.870 
working as the middle fibers are working
to<00:01:44.909> retract<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.719> scapula<00:01:46.289> you<00:01:47.069> can<00:01:47.310> also<00:01:47.459> see

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
to retract the scapula you can also see

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:57.899 
to retract the scapula you can also see
the<00:01:48.030> lower<00:01:48.209> edge<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.899> trapezius

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.969
