00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.629
 very good everyone I'm good pussycat today 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.639
 I bring you the video leaving all the 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.640
 most important sounds that I have taken from 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.130
 the trànsit folder and nothing first 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.689
 What I want to clarify is that I have not 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.570
 completed the easter egg is worth 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.670
 I've just pulled out all the sounds 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.910
 of the trànsit map folder 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:32.269
 there was also another folder called 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:35.090
 survival and penalty worth and good simply 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:37.430
 I took the trànsit folder with a 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.670
 program and from the pirate play then 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.719
 you can get the sounds and all good 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.660
 the sounds that I have heard that you have 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.710
 in the channel of the group zeta I will leave it in 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.379
 the description 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.239
 have been heard on the map worth this not 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.470
 means that the sounds that I have 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.340
 found new you have to listen 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.120
 supposedly it's worth it because he was in 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.070
 the trànsit folder and it's more the egg 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.060
 of Easter does not end because there is more 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.399
 voices of maxis and rest of fame vouchers and 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.080
 good that now you will listen and nothing 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.840
 just to say it sexual is to leave it 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.930
 Of course I did not find the machine 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.090
 three weapons I just pulled the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.580
 sound of the three weapons machine in the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.700
 transit map I do not know if it is that 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.039
 better have left that audio track there 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.170
 already stored saved for future maps 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.990
 for future clces that connect with 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.970
 transit I have no idea but it's good 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.160
 just like the easter egg not that 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.539
 have not yet heard many of 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.850
 the voices that you are going to listen to 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.280
 continuation and good the first one that 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.460
 let's see is the maxis and good has 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.840
 seemed curious because it seems that is the 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.759
 first communication they have with 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.580
 us even before activating the 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.590
 electricity you know what 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.620
 speaks and that tells us to deactivate 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.600
 but this sound seems like a lot 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.820
 before doing that so I think that 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.550
 is that there are steps that must be done before 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.340
 of activating electricity is worth so 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.080
 I do not know I leave the sound and well this is 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.700
 a sound that I personally do not 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.270
 never heard 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.800
 and nothing if you have something to contribute 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.970
 comment it and now we continue to see others 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:25.720
 audios is worth to-to is not one of those 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:29.050
 horrible creatures excellent wearing 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.120
 decades looking for environments what I have 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.060
 what to say is is an importance for the 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.040
 humanity if you want to see this planet 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.040
 free from the curse of these zombies 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.340
 infamous and the monstrous evil that we 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.580
 control davis obey all my 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.610
 orders I can not make changes 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.060
 physical so you'll have to be in my 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.860
 hands only you can stop horrible 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.860
 and used rest 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.220
 well the next sound is maxis of 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.010
 again and this time it tells us to look for 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.599
 the card to free the good world 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.090
 this sound I had heard it but 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.880
 of christopher no no of the voice of maxis 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.100
 and well he comes to say the same thing but 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.550
 this time with maxis is worth and nothing here 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.770
 I leave the sound and we continue below 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.200
 has built a control mechanism 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.800
 but to program the computer 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.080
 you will need an application card 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.630
 you'll have to find her back here and 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.780
 activate the spike to save the 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.780
 humanity 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.940
 now comes a sound from the driver 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.970
 test that comes to say that you accept the 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.920
 reprogrammed route and it seems good that 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:53.500
 accept the card do not be born and 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:55.990
 change of direction and automatic route 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.240
 to an operation 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.640
 then I leave you also a sound 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.130
 I found in this folder next to the 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.220
 others and nothing seems like an alarm 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.220
 emergency 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.470
 now I leave you the sound of the machine 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.230
 three weapons that I have also taken out of this 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.240
 folder of the folder where 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.330
 they found all the sound files 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.600
 of trànsit about this sound I want 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.120
 say good if you look who's there 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.130
 played call of duty black ops 1 as 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.900
 he will have realized how good it sounds 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.990
 a donkey in the background 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.470
 and I remember leaking information 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.690
 on the call of dutty page in the forum 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.300
 that said something about looking for a donkey I do not know 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.160
 if they have a relationship or not but good 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.800
 it's the sound okay it sounds like a donkey 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.410
 background and I do not know if it will have to see relationship 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.090
 or they will put the machine later in the 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.449
 map of transit but good sound 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.449
 I was there 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.380
 memory 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.090
 good to finish the video I want to 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.430
 leave a sound that caught my attention 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.890
 and that has nothing to do with the 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.840
 sound of the bank door when you 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:29.500
 we throw a grenade and good now 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:34.210
 you will hear that this sound sounds like 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:37.810
 if a brick or a brick collapsed 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:40.480
 wall and good as I say what state 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.550
 listening by comparing it with that of the 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.590
 door of the bank that was the one that I believed 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.420
 that could be but that goes do not have 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.450
 no relationship because it sounds different 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:52.590
 It sounds like bricks and not like 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.590
 it sounds like the door of the bank 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.160
 well this has been all I hope that you 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.350
 I liked the video I tried 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:08.190
 leave you the most relevant sounds from 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:12.440
 my point of view boots like favorites and 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.440
 see you in the next video bye bye
