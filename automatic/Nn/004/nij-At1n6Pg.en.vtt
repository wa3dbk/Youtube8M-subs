00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.450 

if<00:00:18.360> you<00:00:18.540> followed<00:00:19.110> me<00:00:19.290> when<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.800> was<00:00:20.070> building

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
if you followed me when I was building

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.100 
if you followed me when I was building
this<00:00:20.580> bike<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:21.810> guess<00:00:22.770> the<00:00:22.980> original<00:00:23.700> plans

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
this bike I guess the original plans

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.230 
this bike I guess the original plans
from<00:00:25.110> atomic<00:00:25.650> zombie<00:00:26.220> great<00:00:26.580> place<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.060> go<00:00:27.210> to

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
from atomic zombie great place to go to

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.990 
from atomic zombie great place to go to
get<00:00:27.480> plans<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:29.099> built<00:00:29.340> six<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.759> them<00:00:29.910> all

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
get plans and I built six of them all

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.179 
get plans and I built six of them all
together<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.899> like<00:00:31.079> number<00:00:31.590> five

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
together this is like number five

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.160 
together this is like number five
and<00:00:32.310> as<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.970> built<00:00:33.210> them<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.510> course<00:00:33.750> like

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
and as I built them of course like

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.710 
and as I built them of course like
anybody<00:00:34.620> would<00:00:34.770> ns<00:00:35.190> as<00:00:35.399> atomic<00:00:36.000> zombie<00:00:36.480> says

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
anybody would ns as atomic zombie says

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.000 
anybody would ns as atomic zombie says
you're<00:00:37.110> going<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.290> change<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.710> lot<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.920> stuff

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
you're going to change a lot of stuff

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.670 
you're going to change a lot of stuff
and<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.489> did<00:00:38.730> change<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.120> lot<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.300> stuff<00:00:39.440> not<00:00:40.440> that

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
and I did change a lot of stuff not that

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.680 
and I did change a lot of stuff not that
much<00:00:40.890> it's<00:00:41.130> basically<00:00:41.489> Sol<00:00:41.850> atomic<00:00:42.329> zombie

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
much it's basically Sol atomic zombie

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.600 
much it's basically Sol atomic zombie
bite<00:00:42.899> but<00:00:43.710> there's<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.950> couple<00:00:44.130> of<00:00:44.280> things<00:00:44.489> I

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
bite but there's a couple of things I

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.100 
bite but there's a couple of things I
wanted<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:44.969> tell<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.239> about<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.750> if<00:00:45.989> you're

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
wanted to tell you about it if you're

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.700 
wanted to tell you about it if you're
into<00:00:46.320> bikes<00:00:46.910> these<00:00:47.910> wheels<00:00:48.330> I<00:00:48.720> don't<00:00:49.410> know<00:00:49.590> of

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
into bikes these wheels I don't know of

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.100 
into bikes these wheels I don't know of
anybody<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.400> sells<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.210> trike<00:00:51.540> and<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:51.900> is<00:00:52.080> a

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
anybody that sells a trike and this is a

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.160 
anybody that sells a trike and this is a
trike<00:00:52.500> with<00:00:53.460> 28<00:00:54.210> inch<00:00:54.390> wheels<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.900> it<00:00:54.930> maybe

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
trike with 28 inch wheels on it maybe

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.520 
trike with 28 inch wheels on it maybe
somebody<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.650> is<00:00:55.980> seen<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.310> yet<00:00:56.430> but<00:00:57.530> have

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
somebody that is seen it yet but have

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.080 
somebody that is seen it yet but have
you<00:00:58.650> ridden<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.950> road<00:00:59.160> bike<00:00:59.400> quite<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.700> bit<00:00:59.910> I

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
you ridden a road bike quite a bit I

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.170 
you ridden a road bike quite a bit I
realized<00:01:00.660> how<00:01:00.990> much<00:01:01.560> easier<00:01:01.890> road<00:01:02.610> bike<00:01:02.820> rolls

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
realized how much easier road bike rolls

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.690 
realized how much easier road bike rolls
and<00:01:03.480> say<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.630> mountain<00:01:04.049> bike<00:01:04.229> or<00:01:04.470> any<00:01:05.460> other

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
and say a mountain bike or any other

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.910 
and say a mountain bike or any other
thing<00:01:06.000> because<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.659> wheels<00:01:06.869> are<00:01:07.229> big<00:01:07.619> and

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
thing because the wheels are big and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.190 
thing because the wheels are big and
they're<00:01:08.790> very<00:01:09.060> narrow<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> rolling

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
they're very narrow so the rolling

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.280 
they're very narrow so the rolling
resistances<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.070> much<00:01:11.610> less<00:01:11.939> than<00:01:12.540> most<00:01:13.110> of

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
resistances is much less than most of

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.469 
resistances is much less than most of
these<00:01:13.350> which<00:01:13.619> have<00:01:13.770> 20<00:01:14.100> inch<00:01:14.220> wheels<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.700> now<00:01:15.450> I

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
these which have 20 inch wheels on now I

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.880 
these which have 20 inch wheels on now I
don't<00:01:15.659> think<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.079> makes<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.530> huge<00:01:16.799> difference

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
don't think that makes a huge difference

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.530 
don't think that makes a huge difference
on<00:01:17.460> smooth<00:01:17.939> level<00:01:18.210> hot<00:01:18.479> tub<00:01:18.750> but<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.890> a

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
on smooth level hot tub but on a

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.640 
on smooth level hot tub but on a
gravelly<00:01:21.540> Road<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:22.080> does<00:01:22.290> make<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> huge

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
gravelly Road it does make a huge

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.469 
gravelly Road it does make a huge
difference<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.640> roll<00:01:23.850> resistance<00:01:24.360> is

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
difference just the roll resistance is

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.350 
difference just the roll resistance is
so<00:01:24.630> much<00:01:24.780> smaller<00:01:25.020> but<00:01:25.890> for<00:01:26.760> me<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.330> a

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
so much smaller but for me this is a

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.719 
so much smaller but for me this is a
double-edged<00:01:27.840> sword<00:01:27.870> because<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.860> didn't<00:01:29.490> want

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
double-edged sword because I didn't want

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.030 
double-edged sword because I didn't want
by<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.090> set<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.950> trike<00:01:31.950> axles<00:01:32.580> what<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:32.850> did<00:01:33.090> was

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
by a set of trike axles what I did was

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.010 
by a set of trike axles what I did was
these<00:01:35.040> axles<00:01:35.670> came<00:01:36.210> from<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.479> pedal

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
these axles came from a pedal

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.580 
these axles came from a pedal
I<00:01:37.049> took<00:01:37.440> his<00:01:37.710> son<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:38.010> good<00:01:38.340> pedal<00:01:38.729> axles<00:01:39.210> and

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
I took his son of good pedal axles and

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.020 
I took his son of good pedal axles and
the<00:01:40.590> band<00:01:40.860> found<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.250> set<00:01:41.460> with<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:41.610> bearings

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
the band found a set with the bearings

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.850 
the band found a set with the bearings
the<00:01:42.180> same<00:01:42.450> as<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.690> road<00:01:42.960> bike<00:01:43.229> wheel<00:01:43.530> and

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
the same as a road bike wheel and

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.490 
the same as a road bike wheel and
married<00:01:44.670> them<00:01:44.820> together<00:01:45.030> now<00:01:45.990> how<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.350> this

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
married them together now how is this

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
married them together now how is this
worked<00:01:46.740> out<00:01:46.979> for<00:01:47.250> me

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
worked out for me

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.240 
worked out for me
well<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.420> probably<00:01:48.840> see<00:01:49.170> right<00:01:49.470> here<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:50.100> -

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
well you probably see right here that -

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.560 
well you probably see right here that -
something<00:01:50.640> taped<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.090> frame

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
something taped to the frame

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.590 
something taped to the frame
those<00:01:51.960> are<00:01:52.170> spokes<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:53.280> three<00:01:53.880> spokes<00:01:54.210> take

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
those are spokes this three spokes take

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.520 
those are spokes this three spokes take
to<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.869> frame<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.380> back<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.400> my<00:01:56.580> any<00:01:57.240> of

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
to the frame and back and my any of

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.789 
to the frame and back and my any of
tenyer<00:01:58.530> box<00:01:58.860> I've<00:01:59.640> got<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.880> spoke<00:02:00.150> wrench<00:02:00.330> and

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
tenyer box I've got a spoke wrench and

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.230 
tenyer box I've got a spoke wrench and
the<00:02:01.799> reason<00:02:02.100> for<00:02:02.220> that<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.549> because<00:02:02.790> these

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
the reason for that is because these

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.859 
the reason for that is because these
wheels<00:02:03.540> are<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:03.900> big<00:02:05.360> every<00:02:06.360> now<00:02:06.510> and<00:02:06.750> then

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
wheels are so big every now and then

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.169 
wheels are so big every now and then
when<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.439> corner<00:02:07.860> with<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.429> it's<00:02:08.789> happened

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
when I corner with it and it's happened

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.929 
when I corner with it and it's happened
four<00:02:09.420> times<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.560> believe<00:02:11.250> these<00:02:11.670> wheels

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:11.939 
four times in I believe these wheels

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:13.910 
four times in I believe these wheels
have<00:02:12.150> well<00:02:12.390> over<00:02:12.420> 2,000<00:02:13.260> miles<00:02:13.409> on<00:02:13.650> them<00:02:13.799> and

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
have well over 2,000 miles on them and

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.890 
have well over 2,000 miles on them and
in<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.159> 2,000

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
in that 2,000

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.300 
in that 2,000
I've<00:02:15.560> broken<00:02:15.890> four<00:02:16.400> or<00:02:16.519> five<00:02:16.730> spokes<00:02:18.310> usually

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
I've broken four or five spokes usually

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.070 
I've broken four or five spokes usually
just<00:02:19.610> going<00:02:19.819> straight<00:02:19.970> ahead<00:02:20.239> but<00:02:20.690> I<00:02:20.720> think

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
just going straight ahead but I think

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.540 
just going straight ahead but I think
they<00:02:21.379> were<00:02:21.500> stressed<00:02:21.800> when<00:02:22.040> I<00:02:22.099> was<00:02:22.280> turning

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
they were stressed when I was turning

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.130 
they were stressed when I was turning
because<00:02:23.060> when<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:23.390> turn<00:02:23.569> with<00:02:23.780> this<00:02:23.870> bigger

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
because when you turn with this bigger

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.890 
because when you turn with this bigger
wheel<00:02:24.349> you<00:02:24.530> really<00:02:24.920> load<00:02:25.129> it<00:02:25.310> so<00:02:26.060> I've<00:02:26.450> had<00:02:26.780> to

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
wheel you really load it so I've had to

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.839 
wheel you really load it so I've had to
change<00:02:27.110> spokes<00:02:27.500> I<00:02:27.680> did<00:02:27.860> have<00:02:28.010> to<00:02:28.129> change<00:02:28.760> the

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
change spokes I did have to change the

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.400 
change spokes I did have to change the
spokes<00:02:29.120> although<00:02:29.450> that<00:02:29.629> is<00:02:29.750> taking<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.110> sub

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
spokes although that is taking the sub

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.979 
spokes although that is taking the sub

swung it out put it in place and then

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.500 
swung it out put it in place and then
take<00:02:36.769> a<00:02:36.799> spoke<00:02:37.340> wrench<00:02:37.489> which<00:02:38.090> hooks<00:02:38.239> right

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
take a spoke wrench which hooks right

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.360 
take a spoke wrench which hooks right
there<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:38.840> just<00:02:38.930> spin<00:02:39.200> it<00:02:39.319> on<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.709> bring<00:02:40.280> the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
there and just spin it on and bring the

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.479 
there and just spin it on and bring the
wheel<00:02:40.549> right<00:02:40.730> back<00:02:40.940> into<00:02:41.180> true<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:42.620> they<00:02:43.310> are

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
wheel right back into true and they are

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.009 
wheel right back into true and they are
true<00:02:44.230> but<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:46.069> second<00:02:46.459> thing<00:02:46.580> is<00:02:46.849> like<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:47.720> said

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
true but the second thing is like I said

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.020 
true but the second thing is like I said
this<00:02:48.170> has<00:02:48.319> got<00:02:48.530> only<00:02:48.860> 2,000<00:02:49.549> miles<00:02:49.700> on<00:02:49.910> these

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
this has got only 2,000 miles on these

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.430 
this has got only 2,000 miles on these
wheels<00:02:50.239> and<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.569> tires<00:02:50.750> are<00:02:50.930> starting<00:02:51.349> to

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
wheels and the tires are starting to

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.150 
wheels and the tires are starting to
wear<00:02:51.620> actually<00:02:52.130> even<00:02:52.549> on<00:02:52.670> a<00:02:52.700> dirt<00:02:52.910> road<00:02:54.160> every

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
wear actually even on a dirt road every

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.589 
wear actually even on a dirt road every
500<00:02:55.700> miles<00:02:56.170> I've<00:02:57.170> had<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.560> take<00:02:57.769> and<00:02:58.599> take

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
500 miles I've had to take and take

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.600 
500 miles I've had to take and take
these<00:02:59.840> bearings<00:03:00.230> apart<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.769> repack<00:03:01.129> them<00:03:01.370> and

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
these bearings apart and repack them and

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.339 
these bearings apart and repack them and
retort<00:03:02.030> retorque<00:03:02.780> them<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:03.049> put<00:03:03.170> them<00:03:03.260> all

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
retort retorque them and put them all

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.759 
retort retorque them and put them all
back<00:03:03.379> together<00:03:03.769> and<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:05.000> other<00:03:05.120> day<00:03:05.390> I<00:03:05.769> didn't

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
back together and the other day I didn't

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.920 
back together and the other day I didn't
do<00:03:06.920> that<00:03:06.950> and<00:03:07.459> it<00:03:07.610> had<00:03:07.760> about<00:03:07.910> now<00:03:08.450> probably

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
do that and it had about now probably

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.500 
do that and it had about now probably
between<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.069> last<00:03:10.310> packing<00:03:10.819> probably<00:03:11.150> six<00:03:11.360> or

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
between the last packing probably six or

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.300 
between the last packing probably six or
seven<00:03:11.750> hundred<00:03:11.810> miles<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:12.890> I<00:03:12.950> was<00:03:13.099> right

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
seven hundred miles and I was right

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.339 
seven hundred miles and I was right
along<00:03:13.430> just<00:03:13.970> enjoying<00:03:14.450> myself<00:03:14.599> thinking<00:03:15.200> how

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
along just enjoying myself thinking how

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.380 
along just enjoying myself thinking how
cool<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:15.920> bike<00:03:16.099> this<00:03:16.310> was<00:03:16.549> and<00:03:16.819> how<00:03:16.910> durable

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
cool the bike this was and how durable

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.140 
cool the bike this was and how durable
it<00:03:17.599> was<00:03:18.069> and<00:03:19.069> just<00:03:19.100> about<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.609> time<00:03:19.760> I<00:03:19.819> thought

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
it was and just about the time I thought

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.030 
it was and just about the time I thought
to<00:03:20.480> my<00:03:20.600> mind<00:03:20.810> I<00:03:20.900> heard<00:03:21.019> a<00:03:21.109> clicking<00:03:21.350> sound<00:03:21.530> and

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
to my mind I heard a clicking sound and

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.449 
to my mind I heard a clicking sound and
that<00:03:22.280> wheel<00:03:22.489> over<00:03:22.700> there<00:03:22.819> I<00:03:23.239> look<00:03:23.810> down<00:03:24.079> and

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
that wheel over there I look down and

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.069 
that wheel over there I look down and
this<00:03:25.459> cabin<00:03:25.970> come<00:03:26.090> off<00:03:26.299> and<00:03:26.569> the<00:03:26.780> nut<00:03:26.959> it

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
this cabin come off and the nut it

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.979 
this cabin come off and the nut it
unscrewed<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:27.880> it<00:03:28.880> was<00:03:29.000> go<00:03:29.090> cook<00:03:29.389> cook<00:03:29.810> and

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
unscrewed and it was go cook cook and

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.180 
unscrewed and it was go cook cook and
every<00:03:30.139> time<00:03:30.290> we<00:03:30.380> clicked<00:03:30.620> it<00:03:30.769> to<00:03:30.889> a<00:03:30.920> ball

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
every time we clicked it to a ball

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.370 
every time we clicked it to a ball
bearing<00:03:31.430> out<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:31.970> before<00:03:32.660> I<00:03:32.690> got<00:03:32.840> to<00:03:32.989> stop<00:03:33.230> the

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
bearing out and before I got to stop the

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.270 
bearing out and before I got to stop the
wheel<00:03:33.560> froze<00:03:33.889> right<00:03:34.069> up<00:03:34.190> so<00:03:35.709> it's<00:03:36.709> it's<00:03:37.190> kind

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
wheel froze right up so it's it's kind

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.430 
wheel froze right up so it's it's kind
of<00:03:37.459> a<00:03:37.549> double-edged<00:03:37.880> sword<00:03:37.910> very<00:03:38.720> very<00:03:39.049> cheap

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
of a double-edged sword very very cheap

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.009 
of a double-edged sword very very cheap
but<00:03:40.010> it's<00:03:40.549> kind<00:03:41.150> of<00:03:41.239> high<00:03:41.329> maintenance<00:03:41.569> and

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
but it's kind of high maintenance and

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.289 
but it's kind of high maintenance and
it's<00:03:42.410> not<00:03:42.590> for<00:03:42.769> anybody<00:03:42.920> that<00:03:43.489> slides<00:03:43.940> around

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
it's not for anybody that slides around

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.360 
it's not for anybody that slides around
a<00:03:44.419> lot<00:03:44.599> so<00:03:44.900> you<00:03:45.380> know<00:03:45.410> I<00:03:45.500> just<00:03:45.590> ride<00:03:45.950> a<00:03:45.980> straight

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
a lot so you know I just ride a straight

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.770 
a lot so you know I just ride a straight
line<00:03:46.579> I'm<00:03:46.760> an<00:03:46.880> old<00:03:47.030> man<00:03:47.209> so<00:03:47.450> it's<00:03:47.569> not<00:03:47.750> a

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
line I'm an old man so it's not a

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.180 
line I'm an old man so it's not a
problem<00:03:48.019> and<00:03:48.169> it<00:03:48.260> works<00:03:48.440> for<00:03:48.680> me<00:03:48.829> but<00:03:48.950> I

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
problem and it works for me but I

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.159 
problem and it works for me but I
probably<00:03:49.669> will<00:03:50.150> if<00:03:50.359> I<00:03:50.480> build<00:03:50.690> another<00:03:50.930> bike
