00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.639
 So I show with all the details 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:15.750
 how to make an ordinary piece on an arch 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:22.100
 cardboard secured with tape so that it does not 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:25.760
 moved the knife nothing more needed 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.760
 doing right before my eyes 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.310
 and 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.530
 Here I have a contour Rome bet 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.030
 if more for him this part can be 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.230
 make it clear above 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.230
 here as you please 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:42.920
 but that 's not the point is that the wing 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:45.290
 not quite straight not quite straight but in 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.890
 neighborhood in the door mate with 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.140
 by the doors 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:52.730
 has a characteristic rounding inward 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.989
 so it will be necessary to do more 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:04.750
 one pattern namely the pattern of this one 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:04.750
 law of rounding I see that so far 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.840
 from here so far straight and about 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:15.459
 rounding went from here 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.459
 also a piece of trimming 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.160
 cartons 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.410
 I attach it this way 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:52.250
 that's what I'll cut out while outlined 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:55.030
 it can be seen that the line is not straight has slightly 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.030
 rounded shape 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.569
 that's essentially all the making 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:06.520
 template is all very simple so here 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:11.340
 do as you see ustein us not be 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:14.729
 need and what will come of it 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.729
 I will show further
