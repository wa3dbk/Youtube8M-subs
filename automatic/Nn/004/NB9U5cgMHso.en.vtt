under here I already tried it on my hand
earlier<00:02:19.100> so<00:02:19.340> my<00:02:19.459> hair<00:02:19.640> was<00:02:19.790> it<00:02:19.970> like<00:02:20.780> it<00:02:20.900> was

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
straight before so and I think it got it

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.560 
straight before so and I think it got it
wavier<00:02:24.500> so<00:02:24.890> it<00:02:25.190> looks<00:02:25.700> good<00:02:25.880> it<00:02:25.940> feels<00:02:26.209> clean

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
it everywhere and i already use this
