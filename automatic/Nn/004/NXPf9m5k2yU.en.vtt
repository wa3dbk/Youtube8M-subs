00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
four of our first five games on the road

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.139 
four of our first five games on the road
so<00:02:07.600> that<00:02:07.780> that's<00:02:07.960> a<00:02:08.259> difficult<00:02:08.849> task<00:02:09.849> in

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
so that that's a difficult task in

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.720 
so that that's a difficult task in
itself<00:02:10.209> but<00:02:10.750> yeah<00:02:11.260> I<00:02:11.319> feel<00:02:11.349> we've<00:02:11.769> you<00:02:12.700> know

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
itself but yeah I feel we've you know

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.250 
itself but yeah I feel we've you know
we've<00:02:12.819> embraced<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.390> start<00:02:13.660> pretty<00:02:13.810> well<00:02:13.900> and

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
we've embraced to start pretty well and

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.339 
we've embraced to start pretty well and
having<00:02:14.980> come<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.220> South<00:02:15.489> Africa<00:02:15.849> I<00:02:16.060> think<00:02:16.780> yeah

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
having come to South Africa I think yeah

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:18.720 
having come to South Africa I think yeah
it's<00:02:17.530> someone<00:02:17.830> offered<00:02:18.099> this<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.250> from<00:02:18.670> the

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
it's someone offered this to from the

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.699 
it's someone offered this to from the
first<00:02:18.970> three<00:02:19.349> particularly<00:02:20.349> playing<00:02:20.590> the

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
first three particularly playing the

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.470 
first three particularly playing the
Brumbies<00:02:21.129> away<00:02:21.370> in<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.670> Waratahs<00:02:22.090> away<00:02:22.360> we

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
Brumbies away in the Waratahs away we

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.270 
Brumbies away in the Waratahs away we
would<00:02:22.569> have<00:02:22.660> taken<00:02:22.989> it<00:02:23.200> well<00:02:23.769> I<00:02:23.799> think<00:02:23.980> if<00:02:24.190> you

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
would have taken it well I think if you

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.729

huge<00:02:34.840> influence<00:02:35.170> on<00:02:35.379> the<00:02:35.470> way<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:35.739> we<00:02:35.860> played

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
huge influence on the way that we played

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.550 
huge influence on the way that we played
again<00:02:36.400> we<00:02:37.390> certainly<00:02:37.690> like<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:37.930> play<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.500> game

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560

pivotal<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.370> I<00:02:42.579> think<00:02:43.299> is<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.049> ride<00:02:44.380> huh

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
pivotal to that I think is a ride huh

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.670 
pivotal to that I think is a ride huh
yeah<00:02:45.599> I<00:02:46.599> haven't<00:02:47.049> said<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.290> lot<00:02:47.410> of<00:02:47.530> him

young guy that's probably suffered over

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.809 
young guy that's probably suffered over
the<00:02:56.470> last<00:02:56.620> few<00:02:56.799> years<00:02:56.890> from<00:02:57.190> play<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.430> number<00:02:57.760> of

positions but now when he first came

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.410 
positions but now when he first came
onto<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.099> scene<00:03:00.280> as<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.459> young<00:03:00.700> guy<00:03:00.879> and<00:03:01.180> was

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
onto the scene as a young guy and was

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.569 
onto the scene as a young guy and was
playing<00:03:01.750> ten<00:03:02.079> yeah<00:03:02.560> it<00:03:02.890> showed<00:03:03.280> that<00:03:03.310> he<00:03:03.549> had

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
playing ten yeah it showed that he had

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.180 
playing ten yeah it showed that he had
enormous<00:03:03.910> ability<00:03:04.480> this<00:03:04.840> year<00:03:05.049> and<00:03:05.260> Jake<00:03:05.980> came

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
enormous ability this year and Jake came

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.920 
enormous ability this year and Jake came
in<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.489> started<00:03:06.640> very<00:03:06.910> quickly<00:03:07.180> that<00:03:07.510> patrick

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
in and started very quickly that patrick

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.270 
in and started very quickly that patrick
lambie<00:03:08.200> will<00:03:08.290> play<00:03:08.500> ten<00:03:08.769> you'll<00:03:08.950> play<00:03:09.130> with

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.610 
lambie will play ten you'll play with
nowhere<00:03:09.549> else<00:03:09.609> for<00:03:09.790> him<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.299> I<00:03:11.109> think<00:03:11.470> that's
