00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 If you are feeling you know how to buy with 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.950
 this ultimate team project goes through 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.529
 fifa with them hit point like a 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.650
 very fast service selling things 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.450
 connect it with paulo to have an additional 800 km 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.210
 of the hospital than paulo decided then 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.789
 Welcome to another quilombo episode. 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.680
 walken we have a new team and 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.080
 we also have a subscriber returned to 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.750
 to quote the berthing team congratulations 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.580
 you got this team from last 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.859
 time rafael marques and boateng 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.019
 therefore we have basically a defense and 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.850
 a large mechanical part postage by 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.350
 Tim of the Mexicans but let's go then 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.780
 time evil and diego rafael marques moreno 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.180
 rpm and defensive midfielders after 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.260
 classes are aquino and saved and in front 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.239
 we have three players from the game asmoc a 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.550
 leading up to and why aris 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.620
 perceives the treatment guarantee a player 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.420
 more of the area plus a spearhead 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.460
 more difficult because we have the kevin prince 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.260
 boateng behind god also help of 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.140
 have good condition as 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.199
 also attacked in two in the market we have 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.150
 in 2002 the most herrera and pmn 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.700
 sensitive to offensive 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.890
 size helped a lot the free sound attack 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.510
 and two ants all the time over there 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.920
 worked in the field 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.070
 then we have two very fast wings 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.799
 saved here in the guar is still in a 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.600
 brutal scene that is and goes very far 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.080
 try to finish as the so called 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.000
 further in terms of three central and 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.700
 two hiv rapids and strawberries are the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.490
 who play harder to school and 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.110
 we can say that Kelly is the capital or 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.610
 more experienced man and is also a 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.619
 man on the four balls standing too 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.659
 some book like that despite this 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.100
 happen because sometimes unfortunately 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.810
 we have the gold and the author was 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.640
 assembled to confuse with many 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.040
 many of us will make teams 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.509
 he also froze south americans is south 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.369
 Americans with states players 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.060
 Together I thought of myself or here. 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.219
 war can only betray but what cotto does not 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.780
 wanted to do this and made the team of light 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.820
 as I had thought 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.560
 I do not know if anyone else does 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.290
 It's true that I got the comments 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.610
 crazy Czech had hit and 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.170
 Then I only saw more of the month 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.929
 some teams forward but I think 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.730
 I kept the eleven as it is and how 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.380
 but we have then saved it in the 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.780
 first group game ever 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.630
 two goals from marks very well there 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.610
 It's all too much to keep her and klara. 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.230
 Brown wanted to talk about the finalization of 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.670
 somewhat near as today I have a 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.040
 very powerful combat here we have several 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.050
 in action it can be said that history 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.120
 it has only oscillated but I have a control 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.760
 very reasonable ball and how can you see 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.820
 he's a lot of people and he really has a 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.360
 awesome speed change 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.660
 aging ae 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.750
 and can unbalance 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.660
 I kick the attack and together 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.310
 with morgan the two together are many 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.930
 are quite different and so 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.030
 complete their other that there is already a 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.800
 part two giving little but I will 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.710
 time for the aris to take a 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.900
 crossing to is not to do I do not know 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.360
 well what has happened here this soul 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.460
 in 40 in such would be the end result 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.350
 this was not the Tupi that the game itself 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.360
 I did not want to show the prison but as I already 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.820
 the news was the game we dominate 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.530
 against a very strong team and we will have 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.840
 then our first victory we passed 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.210
 for the second game is against one more 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.490
 good team a very strong team that 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.340
 the ine is in the Moor market armed 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.440
 kit is a criticism as we all have 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.740
 in fifa is simply combined a 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.750
 an animal that wins the game is 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.330
 likely to come here and there it's like 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.780
 I was talking as much rock as he was 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.910
 It's two players in 2005 who have orkut 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.130
 high therefore well support the attack 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.350
 complement mothers very fast today 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.390
 and the father still has a good shot and 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.240
 so you can balance very well 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.010
 but it is however in the second part not 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.600
 will be able to escape if humans what 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.670
 I came to make a beautiful hat show 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.459
 is that the last hour you have with a 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.720
 brutal letter by chance of the two 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.610
 interventions that I have time 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.890
 save and swears it was my not having 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.709
 leaving was to make a feat and maybe I 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.760
 I spoke the hat but unfortunately she 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.560
 got 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.130
 I did not exactly see the force with which 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.110
 to take off was quite 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.640
 final was a very good level game but it is 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.380
 from here on in that the 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.290
 marquis taiwan said pawel gil on the table 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.090
 that I'm going to sing I sing 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.650
 stupidest would not increase that 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.989
 I kicked the marks off I thought 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.760
 it goes there and she's only paid is 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.200
 you did not win because you were a 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.390
 Stupid canton the 90 minutes I do not know 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.070
 I do not remember just one now, I see 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.290
 I remember kicking the ball out with 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.950
 brands do not know how to make a funk xote 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.720
 It creates not kicked the ball out to me but 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.700
 I remember thinking, I really do not forget 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.860
 all this is clear the 90 minutes 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.780
 command than teaching this will do the 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.700
 goal and did not deserve but deserved like 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.790
 From now on everything is very balanced 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.010
 we have evaluated that the boy in belgium 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.830
 three points just like us and let's play 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.380
 then against ronaldo side to side and 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.300
 me these telemedicine Trofense 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.550
 a very strong team 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.500
 victory is mandatory here otherwise 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.660
 we are alone with the episode and persecuted 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.640
 but we got in and aris ends up 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.290
 make a goal two minutes too well 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.220
 get a mark very well and it 's very 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.350
 fast 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.600
 it's very good to make a full table a touch 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.520
 escapes and gain just ahead O company 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.530
 how to live here already in an enterprise 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.180
 have a climb the other never look again 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.450
 then everton managed to finish well 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.370
 even I always tried to kill her close 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.650
 in finalizing zone closer yesterday 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.480
 State goes now when it is wrong but today it is 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.120
 more complicated but then I have the 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:36.200
 even ronaldo who do this kind of 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:39.440
 and finalizations at goal is a play 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:44.240
 much and I played in August this trix 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.650
 skills I do not know that I also think that 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.200
 was qualified that the three points 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.570
 obligatorily so it turned out to be 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.460
 a good opponent but here we see that the 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.650
 ariza who will shower aquino 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.240
 already in the second part and is the extra 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.640
 Ordinary how you fail these 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.310
 plays but finally let's go to the end 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.170
 of the game was a very much prey game 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.020
 needed this victory plan 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.700
 was used to the fullest here oasa mogi 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.160
 will gain enhanced the year to make the 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.930
 goal in the 86th minute and it's a goal 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.430
 important because I have the 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.290
 impression it is not we have this game 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.140
 we could stay behind means we 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:20.540
 we created problems and I think I think 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.720
 thus equalizing equalizer can pass 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:26.240
 but never making ends meet 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.650
 then win against this guy who already 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.370
 was qualified and how have we done 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.350
 on here 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.110
 The truth is that if I had not won 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.910
 is the gas of belgium had not passed 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.800
 so the win just 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.050
 even getting first in the group is 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.760
 very happy but sunshine this book goes then 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.130
 stay here for the next 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.660
 The episode will then move to the 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.910
 eighth and quarterfinals so no 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.590
 I lose I'll stay here already know 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.580
 discuss in video lake county 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.580
 A big hug in the afternoon.
