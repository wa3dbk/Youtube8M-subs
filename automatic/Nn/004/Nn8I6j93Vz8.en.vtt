 what does your image represent today 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.910

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.740

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.520

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:23.670

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.450

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:51.480
 perfect what's wrong is this 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.480

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:01.200
 what should we look for now well 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.200
