00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
at least eight like they should have a

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.270 
at least eight like they should have a
bounce-back<00:02:13.569> here<00:02:13.930> but<00:02:14.110> even<00:02:14.590> then<00:02:14.950> they<00:02:15.099> did

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
bounce-back here but even then they did

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.640 
bounce-back here but even then they did
only<00:02:15.700> win<00:02:15.849> two<00:02:16.090> games<00:02:16.360> last<00:02:16.690> year<00:02:16.930> so<00:02:17.140> it's<00:02:17.500> not

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
only win two games last year so it's not

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.050

too<00:02:17.830> hard<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:18.069> bounce<00:02:18.310> back<00:02:18.519> from<00:02:18.580> that<00:02:18.790> but<00:02:19.000> I

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
too hard to bounce back from that but I

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.910 
too hard to bounce back from that but I
think<00:02:19.120> they<00:02:19.300> should<00:02:19.330> do<00:02:19.599> a<00:02:19.629> lot<00:02:19.989> better<00:02:20.379> this
