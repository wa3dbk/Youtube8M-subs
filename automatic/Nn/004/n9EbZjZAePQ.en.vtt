 fantastic looks like a real e 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.140
 own shaders on pc with and from that 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.600
 these fantasticks shadows that were here 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.890
 in the blocks it allows very very beautiful and 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.750
 maybe I'll do some more examples 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.090

 we have a visual at the same 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.140
 principle of the herb that you are 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.539
 that fashion I made his friends here 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.430
 italy as in the moves both the grass e 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.949
 both the leaves of the trees and thus create 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.339
 really very nice effect 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.369
 just a few pops move anyway 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.979
 the effect does it as you can see from the 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.960
 consumption this shaders is a texture 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.390
 pack to simply install with 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.790
 just a simple tech note on the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.220
 stage at strandard block lancer e 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.869
 install this texture pack that you have 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.909
 look how beautiful the texture is 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.100
 fantastic promises a choose 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.290

 they are very many effects that you introduced 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.189
 then the thing in a single shader 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.329
 excellent I recommend you try 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.060
