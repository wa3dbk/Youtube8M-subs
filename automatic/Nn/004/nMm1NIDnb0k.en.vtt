00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:28.920 

and<00:03:18.700> need<00:03:19.659> the<00:03:19.810> bazooka<00:03:20.170> guide<00:03:20.349> to<00:03:20.560> watch

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.610 

so<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:30.830> there's<00:03:31.520> also<00:03:31.700> a<00:03:32.120> break<00:03:32.870> back<00:03:33.050> here<00:03:33.320> so

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
so and there's also a break back here so

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:43.040 
so and there's also a break back here so
just<00:03:33.890> get<00:03:34.430> on<00:03:34.550> the<00:03:34.820> same<00:03:35.000> place<00:03:35.210> I<00:03:35.360> guess
