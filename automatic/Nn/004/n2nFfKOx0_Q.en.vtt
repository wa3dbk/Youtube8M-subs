00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:14.910
 experiment experiment with us getel in 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.369
 quality 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:33.410
 and motor generator here with us 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:38.329
 used here we used 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:42.300
 one winding in quality 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.410
 overclocking here it turns out 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.879
 winding 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:54.000
 defiler two wires dangle on four 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:56.039
 coils here and one of the wires i 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.660
 I use as a generator that's 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:04.710
 pushing the coil here I did 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:09.710
 gap and plug in the oscilloscope here 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:12.090
 from here and from here, there is a gap and to this 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:17.460
 generating windings I connect here 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:20.600
 light bulb as load we will see 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.600
 what will come of it 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:32.200
 12 volt power connect and measure 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.200
 D.C. 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:43.950
 now we just overclock a maximum without 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:48.869
 we have only one load 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.869
 one coil 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.310
 Here we see that the current we have achieved nothing 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.970
 091 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.970
 amps 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.689
 wherein 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.040
 at the same time we see such ping 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.040
 i.e 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.970
 is coming 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:58.140
 up well plus minus in the woods yes that is 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:02.490
 at 12 volts and everything is as it should be 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:05.640
 and here these drink up and down we 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:09.110
 here it's not so good to see somewhere at level 5 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.110
 volt down and 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.930
 220 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:21.820
 true and the future without wine at somewhere you 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.130
 At level 5, the 15 volt goes such a prong 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:30.190
 such 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:33.810
 character fast pulse digging well what 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:37.990
 called internet free energy 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.890
 Well, that is, this is how it would be 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.970
 classic 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.970
 and here it is 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:56.920
 and here it is it turns out that 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.100
 catches coil when changing 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:03.190
 pulses when the positive pole and 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.880
 negative changes because goalkeepers 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.040
 let's set aside a magnet here 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:13.140
 it turns out without an air gap you 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:15.470
 here where is solid magnet and fire 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.050
 the positive pole of the genus is replaced 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:22.410
 negatively so these are these 

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:24.830
 enough manor stupid but not so 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.130
 large as we assume the case when we 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.330
 hang on the rotor separate 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:34.210
 he is there a long distance 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:38.530
 then love reaches 100 people 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:42.310
 volt means 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.490
 connect the load gap i mean i 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:49.020
 here I broke 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.020
 this is not connected here 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:58.600
 turn on more important this is what we have before this 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.600
 connected 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.350
 and 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.590
 succeeded 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.590
 and here they answer 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:28.190
 and so with this, I'll start naturally 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.190
 dropped purity 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.240
 about 2 times 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:49.530
 Well, the light is on 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.530
 quite brightly blinding 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.380
 we have a picture 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.400
 charm again 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.890
 are needed 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.949
 this is the generation at the beach 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.940
 and the time of the file rnai winding which 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:13.680
 passes next to the working winding then 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.550
 There is this the, that he profusely on 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.550
 to generate 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.630
 she is 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:42.400
 at the same time the current increased by exactly 100 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:46.390
 milliampere 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:51.300
 just a light bulb is hard to say but on 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:59.440
 advice and that is, it works brightly 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:07:01.470
 This is a light bulb with us all so as not to lie 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.470
 and 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:08.520
 light bulb we have 48 volts 1 1 faith 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.560
 and 

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.140
 here 

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:47.249
 on 

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:47.249
 such an experiment
