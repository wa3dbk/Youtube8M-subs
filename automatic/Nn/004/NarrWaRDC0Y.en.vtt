00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
warp is that Crossfield bill I was

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.680 
warp is that Crossfield bill I was
talking<00:06:32.490> about<00:06:32.550> it's<00:06:32.940> not<00:06:33.000> really<00:06:33.210> build<00:06:33.480> it's

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
talking about it's not really build it's

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.890 
talking about it's not really build it's
more<00:06:33.810> like<00:06:34.020> a<00:06:34.170> area<00:06:34.860> of<00:06:34.980> the<00:06:35.100> map<00:06:35.280> now<00:06:35.700> I<00:06:36.510> can
