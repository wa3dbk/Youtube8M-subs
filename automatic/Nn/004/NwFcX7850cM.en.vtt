 difficult but it doesn't seem to me there either 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.729
 really make me a punishment of that bag 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.850
 I will be with passion because I believe is 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.850

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.560

 I have a beer for me 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.900
 found it 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.269
 I liked it and I thought it was good 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.819
 frankly i didn't expect that 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.819
 had injured that's just would go well 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.280
 let me pronounce but no I had 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.440
 expected why because I think it's one 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.480
 very very very difficult state 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.880
 requires a lot of discipline and I need you 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.110
 say for you from the start 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.280
 save your attitude 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.630
 yes it can get a little better now and then 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.489
 but your attitude that you retain until it 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.370
 end that discipline that you feel in you 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.690
 dance is very very impressions and I know 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.400
 not here this thing is on a certain 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.720
 way and I love words and I love 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.370
 of descriptions but I am still 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.900
 always looking for the right one 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.420
 describe what I think of you 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.220
 and how that you then so that there is something that 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.290
 still unknown to me and I am 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.840
 searching every week for what is it 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.769
 he does that so different but 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.769
 quality quality 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.080

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.330
 finally and can make what you are 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.670
 again been a wonderful partner 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.260
 and from the moment you have two 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.000
 looks one is to your own 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.380
 direction so where you look and then 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.540
 the moments when that your eyes look at 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.710
 each other and that varnish and that of them 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.910
 start to the end and so simply 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.040

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.250

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:17.370

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.770
 the middle section where real music is like that 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.600
 I think it goes up when it goes 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:24.150

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.960
