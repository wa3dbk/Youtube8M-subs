00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.970
 It brings some little extras that are 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.390
 wonderful 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:44.160
 the drawing of the covers

 a year after it ended 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.710
 that he finished his work 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.710
 and a few more extras 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.680
 by andic lost 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.980
 this is what brings sea ​​see 1602 written 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.100
 by television editorial 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.610
 what is good about the idea of ​​in the game 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.770
 and 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:22.940
 was that if Stanley's inventions of 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.880
 this peak of jack kirby have survived 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.160
 for seventy-odd years and they continue 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.680
 as current as they once were 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.190
 they were when they were created what 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:39.140
 would happen if these same characters 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:42.600
 they go to 1602 which is the time where 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.690
 the migration of all england begins 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.630
 to the new colonies of america and 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.040
 basically that was the idea respecting 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.360
 the personality of each of the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.960
 characters 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.050
 daredevil acts as regularly what 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.680
 would the classic daredevil who wrote 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.680
 frank miller 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.210
 Everything is great 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:11.640
 Peter Parker is a great detail several 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.380
 of the names that the characters had 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.600
 sean marvel adapted the time in the 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.880
 case of wanda and petro for example 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.940
 when the case of external peter parker 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:27.100
 a peter parker for all the time is ni 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.100
 it's not even police the flowers 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.060
 and Professor Carlos Javier 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.900
 Andy Kubert's art is wonderful and 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.850
 amazing 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.650
 could be 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:47.290
 for hours watching a panel per panel 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.980
 everything that wants to express everything 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.230
 the movement that uses 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.440
 one of the things that they mention us in the 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.780
 game and end shop and then is to put the 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.390
 situations are the characters in a 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.350
 very different situation 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.540
 he basically wanted to get away from 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.160
 basically the war machine that they are 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.530
 the Avengers 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.990
 written mostly during the last 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.820
 decade I did not want to do that he wanted 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.130
 tell more to a fantasy story 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.560
 a story of adventure and based on the 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.500
 situation that puts it does it 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:28.250
 It really is fantastic what it does 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.470
 the game and I highly recommend them to 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.830
 the mar velitas to the not mar velitas 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:38.010
 read what they get whatever it is about 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:43.280
 analyze what really 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.280
 it's worth this committee what they are worth 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:50.090
 believe me it's just fantastic the 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.030
 interpretation that the game and a 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.500
 the characters in moving them the 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:00.820
 converts in the temporary makes them 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.890
 a classic long time good the other 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.380
 the reason why I have not recorded videos 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.060
 lately it's because I lost the camera 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.550
 with which he regularly made the videos 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.550
 I'm recording practically from the 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:15.310
 cellular then it had been difficult for me 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.950
 much the way of making videos and you 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.190
 will excuse the reason for the pulse of 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.139
 maraquero I have several pending reader 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.210
 as you can see 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.930
 some of them already outlined in the 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.930
 comic sector mx 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:34.389
 approximately wait for a review of 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.960
 ataco taitan a single and I do not want more 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:42.040
 this give will surely tell you more than 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.650
 this because he is the manga expert 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.220
