you<00:03:45.390> can<00:03:46.320> just<00:03:46.530> play<00:03:46.769> it<00:03:46.799> through

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
you can just play it through

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.880 
you can just play it through
traditionally<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:49.200> thing<00:03:49.380> about<00:03:49.410> it<00:03:49.650> is

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
traditionally and the thing about it is

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.350 
traditionally and the thing about it is
is<00:03:50.100> when<00:03:50.340> you<00:03:50.400> play<00:03:50.549> one<00:03:50.730> of<00:03:50.760> these<00:03:50.880> levels<00:03:51.090> it

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
is when you play one of these levels it

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.120 
is when you play one of these levels it
actually<00:03:51.810> affects<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.290> storyline<00:03:52.890> because

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
actually affects the storyline because

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.039 
actually affects the storyline because
it<00:03:53.250> affects<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.700> what's<00:03:53.970> going<00:03:54.269> on<00:03:54.420> in<00:03:54.660> the

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
it affects the what's going on in the

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.930 
it affects the what's going on in the
cold<00:03:55.290> war<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.829> the<00:03:55.980> time<00:03:56.519> a<00:03:56.549> geopolitical

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
level and it branches off and and that's

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.340 
level and it branches off and and that's
really<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.760> case<00:04:00.030> with<00:04:00.269> actually<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.900> you

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
a really hard decision and some of these

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.789 
a really hard decision and some of these
are<00:04:20.390> going<00:04:20.420> to<00:04:20.540> be<00:04:20.630> like<00:04:20.840> really<00:04:21.590> intense

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
are going to be like really intense

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.800 
are going to be like really intense
decisions<00:04:22.400> and<00:04:22.580> and<00:04:22.790> the<00:04:23.240> story<00:04:23.510> will<00:04:23.780> change

decisions and and the story will change

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.660 
decisions and and the story will change
as<00:04:24.200> a<00:04:24.230> result<00:04:24.410> of<00:04:24.740> that<00:04:24.800> it's<00:04:25.130> unlikely<00:04:25.310> that

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
as a result of that it's unlikely that

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.640 
as a result of that it's unlikely that
you<00:04:25.940> and<00:04:26.120> I<00:04:26.150> will<00:04:26.330> have<00:04:26.480> the<00:04:26.630> same<00:04:26.810> ending<00:04:27.440> in

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
you and I will have the same ending in

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.710 
you and I will have the same ending in
this<00:04:27.950> game<00:04:28.190> and<00:04:28.370> we'll<00:04:28.490> be<00:04:28.640> able<00:04:28.760> to<00:04:28.910> you<00:04:29.630> know

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
this game and we'll be able to you know

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.700 
this game and we'll be able to you know
I<00:04:29.750> think<00:04:29.840> it'll<00:04:29.990> encourage<00:04:30.230> people<00:04:30.530> to<00:04:30.560> want

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
I think it'll encourage people to want

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.470 
I think it'll encourage people to want
to<00:04:30.800> go<00:04:30.830> back<00:04:31.040> and<00:04:31.340> maybe<00:04:31.760> make<00:04:31.970> some<00:04:32.150> different

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
to go back and maybe make some different

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.750 
to go back and maybe make some different
choices<00:04:32.660> and<00:04:33.080> and<00:04:33.260> we're<00:04:33.980> excited<00:04:34.220> about<00:04:34.430> that

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
choices and and we're excited about that

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.430 
choices and and we're excited about that
because<00:04:34.790> you<00:04:35.540> know<00:04:35.660> we're<00:04:35.900> putting<00:04:36.260> all<00:04:36.410> kinds

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
differently you would have just

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.720 
differently you would have just
rappelled<00:05:30.710> down<00:05:30.919> and<00:05:31.160> been<00:05:31.280> on<00:05:31.400> the<00:05:31.520> ground

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730 
rappelled down and been on the ground

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.550 
rappelled down and been on the ground
and<00:05:31.970> provided<00:05:32.360> support<00:05:32.510> on<00:05:32.900> the<00:05:33.050> ground<00:05:33.260> level

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
and provided support on the ground level

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.490 
and provided support on the ground level
varies<00:05:34.100> you<00:05:34.310> know<00:05:34.690> that's<00:05:35.690> a<00:05:35.780> very<00:05:36.080> subtle

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
varies you know that's a very subtle

simple choice event that we have going

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.220 
simple choice event that we have going
in<00:05:39.260> that<00:05:39.410> in<00:05:39.650> that<00:05:39.710> level<00:05:40.160> you<00:05:40.430> could<00:05:40.550> really

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.230 
in that in that level you could really

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.870 
in that in that level you could really
see<00:05:42.230> though<00:05:42.530> with<00:05:43.040> all<00:05:43.250> the<00:05:43.430> other<00:05:43.610> gameplay

modes<00:05:44.300> just<00:05:44.630> how<00:05:45.050> much<00:05:45.200> variety<00:05:45.440> and<00:05:45.740> even<00:05:46.160> in

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
modes just how much variety and even in

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.530 
modes just how much variety and even in
that<00:05:46.370> level<00:05:46.580> that<00:05:46.790> we<00:05:46.910> showed<00:05:47.150> you<00:05:47.330> it<00:05:47.419> was

we saw yeah absolutely there's the the

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.100 
we saw yeah absolutely there's the the
driving<00:06:09.020> flying<00:06:09.580> there's<00:06:10.580> been<00:06:10.880> the<00:06:11.450> hints<00:06:11.990> of

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
driving flying there's been the hints of

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.010 
driving flying there's been the hints of
