off to check on them so there we go

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:56.159 
off to check on them so there we go
excellent<00:04:54.389> so<00:04:55.389> only<00:04:55.690> eighty<00:04:55.960> eight<00:04:56.139> percent

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
excellent so only eighty eight percent

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.189 
excellent so only eighty eight percent
this<00:04:56.740> time<00:04:57.009> I<00:04:57.280> think<00:04:58.120> with<00:04:58.270> better<00:04:58.479> timing<00:04:58.840> and

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 
this time I think with better timing and

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.189 
this time I think with better timing and
chaining<00:05:00.330> some<00:05:01.330> of<00:05:01.449> these<00:05:01.569> together<00:05:01.810> a<00:05:02.020> little

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
chaining some of these together a little

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.200 
chaining some of these together a little
better<00:05:02.409> we<00:05:03.099> could<00:05:03.280> probably<00:05:03.430> push<00:05:03.759> that<00:05:03.940> a<00:05:04.000> lot

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
better we could probably push that a lot

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.200 
better we could probably push that a lot
higher<00:05:04.470> but<00:05:05.470> that's<00:05:05.650> not<00:05:05.860> my<00:05:06.009> intent<00:05:06.370> so<00:05:06.819> with

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
higher but that's not my intent so with

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.879 
higher but that's not my intent so with
