doing side haul which is actually quite
originally<00:00:22.050> unique<00:00:22.289> in<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.500> industry<00:00:22.890> it's

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
originally unique in the industry it's

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.000 
originally unique in the industry it's
always<00:00:23.460> been<00:00:24.080> the<00:00:25.080> traditional<00:00:25.560> way<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.830> off

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
always been the traditional way is off

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.529 
always been the traditional way is off
the<00:00:26.130> transom<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.789> lot<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.060> people<00:00:27.210> still

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
the transom so a lot of people still

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.080 
the transom so a lot of people still
like<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:27.990> mount<00:00:28.410> for<00:00:28.740> whatever<00:00:28.859> reasons<00:00:29.400> mount

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
like to mount for whatever reasons mount

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.030 
like to mount for whatever reasons mount
their<00:00:30.269> transducers<00:00:30.840> off<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.320> transom<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
their transducers off the transom of the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.650 
their transducers off the transom of the
bow<00:00:32.219> that's<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.969> back<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.360> boat<00:00:33.510> where

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
bow that's the back of the boat where

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.970 
bow that's the back of the boat where
the<00:00:33.780> motor<00:00:33.989> sits<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:35.309> here<00:00:35.610> we<00:00:35.730> have<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
the motor sits so here we have the

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:54.670 
the motor sits so here we have the
transducer<00:00:37.980> here<00:00:39.500> on<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.620> back<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:42.290> penis

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.849 

and<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.770> can<00:00:55.890> see<00:00:56.039> it's<00:00:56.190> very<00:00:56.250> submerged<00:00:57.030> here

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
and you can see it's very submerged here

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.250 
and you can see it's very submerged here
so<00:00:58.859> it's<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.609> four<00:00:59.820> horsepower<00:01:00.180> Mercury<00:01:00.719> four

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
so it's a four horsepower Mercury four

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.910 
so it's a four horsepower Mercury four
stroke<00:01:01.620> on<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.430> boat<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.899> 12<00:01:04.199> foot

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
stroke on the boat and it's 12 foot

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
this boat and it was on the transom

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.720 
this boat and it was on the transom
fully<00:02:49.050> submerged<00:02:49.530> in<00:02:49.800> it<00:02:49.920> it's<00:02:50.160> rock-solid

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
fully submerged in it it's rock-solid

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.700 
fully submerged in it it's rock-solid
and<00:02:51.390> I'll<00:02:51.540> just<00:02:51.690> show<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:51.900> quickly<00:02:52.230> before<00:02:52.500> I

and I'll just show you quickly before I
end<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:52.980> video<00:02:53.070> here<00:02:53.630> take<00:02:54.630> it<00:02:54.660> off

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:07.510 

and<00:03:01.070> you<00:03:02.070> can<00:03:02.280> see<00:03:03.230> what<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.320> looks<00:03:04.500> like<00:03:04.590> here

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.160 

and<00:03:10.460> that<00:03:11.460> that<00:03:11.970> whole<00:03:12.180> thing<00:03:12.450> I<00:03:12.720> wanted<00:03:13.110> to

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
and that that whole thing I wanted to

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.780 
and that that whole thing I wanted to
show<00:03:13.380> you<00:03:13.440> also<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.860> there's<00:03:14.130> extendable

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
show you also that there's extendable

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.370 
show you also that there's extendable
arms<00:03:15.090> here<00:03:15.390> so<00:03:15.630> we've<00:03:15.780> got<00:03:15.930> an<00:03:16.020> extra

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
arms here so we've got an extra

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.260 
arms here so we've got an extra
extension<00:03:16.710> here<00:03:17.100> so<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.730> whole<00:03:17.910> thing<00:03:18.120> here

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
extension here so the whole thing here

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.090 
extension here so the whole thing here
is<00:03:18.420> each<00:03:18.570> one<00:03:18.600> of<00:03:18.780> these<00:03:18.930> is<00:03:19.110> a<00:03:19.140> 3.5<00:03:20.070> inch

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
is each one of these is a 3.5 inch

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.880 
is each one of these is a 3.5 inch
segment<00:03:20.850> so<00:03:21.600> this<00:03:21.750> thing<00:03:21.960> here<00:03:22.200> is<00:03:22.380> basically

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
segment so this thing here is basically

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.610 
segment so this thing here is basically
between<00:03:23.130> 6<00:03:23.610> &amp;<00:03:23.760> 7<00:03:23.910> inches<00:03:24.330> right<00:03:24.510> here<00:03:24.570> so<00:03:25.110> if

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
between 6 &amp; 7 inches right here so if

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.410 
between 6 &amp; 7 inches right here so if
you<00:03:25.830> need<00:03:25.860> to<00:03:26.010> reach<00:03:26.250> down<00:03:26.460> long<00:03:26.880> way<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:27.270> can

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
you need to reach down long way you can

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.120 
you need to reach down long way you can
even<00:03:27.570> buy<00:03:27.750> another<00:03:28.050> extension<00:03:28.590> from<00:03:28.740> us<00:03:28.920> or

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
even buy another extension from us or

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.700 
even buy another extension from us or
more<00:03:29.460> than<00:03:29.640> one<00:03:29.760> extension<00:03:30.300> to<00:03:30.870> get<00:03:31.050> this<00:03:31.230> way

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
more than one extension to get this way

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.440 
more than one extension to get this way
up<00:03:31.920> top<00:03:32.220> on<00:03:32.460> your<00:03:32.550> boat<00:03:32.730> if<00:03:32.880> you<00:03:33.000> wanted<00:03:33.270> to

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
up top on your boat if you wanted to

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.270 
up top on your boat if you wanted to
stick<00:03:33.660> way<00:03:33.870> down<00:03:34.110> in<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.350> water<00:03:34.560> further<00:03:35.010> down

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
stick way down in the water further down

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.000 
stick way down in the water further down
so<00:03:36.060> if<00:03:36.330> you<00:03:36.420> have<00:03:36.540> an<00:03:36.660> odd<00:03:36.810> form<00:03:37.230> haul<00:03:37.590> on<00:03:37.890> your

so if you have an odd form haul on your

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.270 
so if you have an odd form haul on your
boat<00:03:38.840> you<00:03:39.840> can<00:03:40.020> get<00:03:40.170> extension<00:03:40.740> arms<00:03:41.070> to

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
boat you can get extension arms to

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.910 
boat you can get extension arms to
overcome<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.210> odd<00:03:42.750> form<00:03:43.170> so<00:03:43.440> you<00:03:43.530> can<00:03:43.590> still

overcome the odd form so you can still
get<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.160> transducer<00:03:44.730> in<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:44.940> water<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.530> not

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
get the transducer in the water and not
