00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
hi I'm Tina from mini ball design and I

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.620 
hi I'm Tina from mini ball design and I
just<00:00:07.980> finished<00:00:08.630> building<00:00:10.219> the<00:00:11.219> m7<00:00:12.059> stove<00:00:12.389> the

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
just finished building the m7 stove the

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.150 
just finished building the m7 stove the
new<00:00:12.780> prototypes<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.559> this<00:00:13.769> one<00:00:13.950> we're<00:00:14.070> going

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
new prototypes of this one we're going

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.580 
new prototypes of this one we're going
to<00:00:14.219> call<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.420> m7<00:00:16.049> it's<00:00:16.199> up<00:00:16.379> on<00:00:16.529> the

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
to call it is the m7 it's up on the

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.900 
to call it is the m7 it's up on the
homepage<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:17.490> just<00:00:18.119> listed<00:00:18.590> cannibal<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.910> also

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
homepage I just listed cannibal and also

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.880 
homepage I just listed cannibal and also
lifted<00:00:21.330> my<00:00:21.480> new<00:00:21.660> Stoke<00:00:22.080> stand<00:00:22.500> which<00:00:22.680> I've

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
lifted my new Stoke stand which I've

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.089 
lifted my new Stoke stand which I've
simplified<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.970> lot<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.109> lowered<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.830> price

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
simplified a lot and lowered the price

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.800 
simplified a lot and lowered the price
on<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:27.269> uh<00:00:27.830> watch<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:29.039> video<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.699> I'll<00:00:30.510> show

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810

you all the different aspects of the m7
and<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.270> soap<00:00:33.600> stand<00:00:34.579> and<00:00:35.579> then<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.059> can<00:00:36.270> go

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
and the soap stand and then you can go

00:00:36.390 --> 00:02:50.819 
and the soap stand and then you can go

so I hope this is popular stove it's
certainly<00:02:56.780> priced<00:02:57.230> correctly<00:02:57.849> very<00:02:58.849> simple

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
certainly priced correctly very simple

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:04.030 
certainly priced correctly very simple
stove<00:03:00.280> on<00:03:01.299> the<00:03:02.299> idea<00:03:02.959> of<00:03:03.079> the<00:03:03.200> transient<00:03:03.739> way

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
stove on the idea of the transient way

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.580 
stove on the idea of the transient way
you<00:03:04.099> can<00:03:04.579> put<00:03:05.329> alcohol<00:03:05.510> in<00:03:05.959> it<00:03:05.989> put<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.290> lid<00:03:06.560> on

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
you can put alcohol in it put the lid on

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.619 
you can put alcohol in it put the lid on
put<00:03:07.010> it<00:03:07.099> your<00:03:07.189> pack<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:07.790> then<00:03:08.120> just<00:03:08.359> take<00:03:08.510> it

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
put it your pack and then just take it

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.690 
put it your pack and then just take it
out<00:03:08.719> later<00:03:09.049> and<00:03:09.319> cook<00:03:09.769> with<00:03:09.980> it<00:03:10.099> and<00:03:10.280> if<00:03:10.609> you

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
out later and cook with it and if you

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.610 
out later and cook with it and if you
don't<00:03:10.879> use<00:03:11.030> all<00:03:11.239> the<00:03:11.359> fuel<00:03:11.629> we<00:03:11.750> can<00:03:11.930> just<00:03:12.139> put

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
don't use all the fuel we can just put

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.149 
don't use all the fuel we can just put
it<00:03:12.709> out<00:03:12.829> put<00:03:12.859> the<00:03:13.219> lid<00:03:13.400> back<00:03:13.430> on<00:03:13.819> again<00:03:14.530> now<00:03:15.530> the

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 
it out put the lid back on again now the

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.360 
it out put the lid back on again now the
lid<00:03:16.430> is<00:03:16.900> pretty<00:03:17.900> watertight<00:03:18.409> but<00:03:18.980> I<00:03:19.010> wouldn't

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
lid is pretty watertight but I wouldn't

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.740 
lid is pretty watertight but I wouldn't
recommend<00:03:19.400> filling<00:03:20.000> it<00:03:20.150> up<00:03:20.239> and<00:03:20.450> putting<00:03:20.629> it

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
recommend filling it up and putting it

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.240 
recommend filling it up and putting it
somewhere<00:03:20.930> upside<00:03:21.469> down<00:03:21.680> because<00:03:21.829> it<00:03:22.069> will

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
somewhere upside down because it will

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.780 
somewhere upside down because it will
see<00:03:22.579> but<00:03:23.510> if<00:03:23.810> you<00:03:24.049> put<00:03:24.260> in<00:03:24.379> two<00:03:24.560> ounces<00:03:25.069> which

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
see but if you put in two ounces which

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.449 
see but if you put in two ounces which
is<00:03:25.970> enough<00:03:26.239> for<00:03:26.269> about<00:03:26.959> three<00:03:27.349> boils<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:27.950> yeah

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
is enough for about three boils and yeah

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.399 
is enough for about three boils and yeah
with<00:03:28.760> no<00:03:28.939> wind<00:03:30.970> you<00:03:31.970> can<00:03:32.389> put<00:03:32.629> the<00:03:32.750> lid<00:03:32.930> on<00:03:32.959> the

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:33.409 
with no wind you can put the lid on the

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.789 
with no wind you can put the lid on the
carbon<00:03:33.919> felt<00:03:34.220> will<00:03:34.810> hold<00:03:35.810> that<00:03:36.109> alcohol<00:03:36.530> and

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
carbon felt will hold that alcohol and

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.309 
carbon felt will hold that alcohol and
keep<00:03:36.950> it<00:03:37.129> from<00:03:37.430> pooling<00:03:38.389> anywhere<00:03:38.689> so<00:03:39.200> there's

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
keep it from pooling anywhere so there's

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.869 
keep it from pooling anywhere so there's
no<00:03:39.439> problem<00:03:39.739> but<00:03:40.040> I'd<00:03:40.129> still<00:03:40.370> keep<00:03:40.579> it<00:03:40.730> right

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
no problem but I'd still keep it right

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.509 
no problem but I'd still keep it right
side<00:03:41.150> up<00:03:41.209> but<00:03:41.989> it's<00:03:42.349> pretty<00:03:42.620> tight<00:03:42.889> yeah<00:03:43.489> I

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
side up but it's pretty tight yeah I

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.339 
side up but it's pretty tight yeah I
would<00:03:43.819> carry<00:03:44.060> it<00:03:44.180> inside<00:03:44.329> the<00:03:44.659> pot<00:03:44.900> in<00:03:45.019> my<00:03:45.049> pack

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
would carry it inside the pot in my pack

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.149 
would carry it inside the pot in my pack
no<00:03:45.590> problem<00:03:46.040> at<00:03:46.129> all<00:03:46.219> but<00:03:46.819> time<00:03:47.510> will<00:03:47.629> tell<00:03:47.689> I
