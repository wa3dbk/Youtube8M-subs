00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.509
 hello everyone again kaluga 2 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.760
 Today we talk about the development branch 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.969
 Germany heavy tanks up to e100 and up 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.179
 mouse well then let's start with the machines 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.550
 sandy generally start let's spz 1 m with 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.230
 Level one and I will say that in principle 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.990
 the car is pretty good and 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.820
 for the sandbox itâ€™s just okay 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.820
 bang me I liked it more than 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.550
 ms-1 in that it has such pc1 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.679
 cheerful gun 2 cm she 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.320
 suffers from a double shot 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.770
 so and general cool sample tank 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.360
 and for 2 phase 3 a and for three i'm nothing 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.100
 I will not say cars sandy 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.739
 fast problems are gone 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.010
 cause we will start already serious 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.660
 conversation with shell 4 and parquet machine with 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.149
 at the fifth level and in principle she 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.920
 It looks pretty good than what course 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.449
 on thirty four because in general that 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.910
 probably this was the reality of life 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.640
 by some opponent 34 the most so and in 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.519
 present and cruel and that there is 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.310
 seven and a half centimeters cannon with 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.110
 damage 183 breaking 110 for the fifth 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.780
 level is pretty good in principle 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.460
 breaking enough damage too 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.530
 rate of fire temporarily from vision 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.180
 also quite a even level but 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.930
 the only thing is that accuracy may not be 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.330
 the coolest 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.340
 even when we install the tower of us 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.470
 slightly increased strength and in general 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.060
 the tank is pretty good yes he doesn't 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.030
 a lot of armor in general then its 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.280
 thirty-four is also not super much 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.140
 speed of about so good 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.000
 level is like thirty-four and 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.530
 let him probably even get it from that 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.880
 same 34 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.890
 and here is how Caesar goes on in eco 3601 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.049
 speech but this car is generally wonderful 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.479
 considering new levels of battles now 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.340
 if you hit the sixth level, then you 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.710
 can pull out very cool you 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.320
 body armor 100 millimeters communicate from 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.790
 the sides and armor of the tower you will have too 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.719
 pretty good one hundred eighty 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.030
 eighty 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.500
 have become a diamond and fitness who punch well 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.120
 it is clear that of course the lower neris 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.490
 desirable order 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.330
 and here we have a gun 88 appears 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.930
 centimeters with damage as much as 367 and breakdown in 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.970
 132 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.520
 Of course the breakthrough may be slightly small. 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.470
 against the eight fight but in every 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.870
 case damage does quite good and 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.420
 makes the enemies think again on 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.760
 so mob get on you or not plus 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.130
 the car is quite fat and armored 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.590
 although the speed does not shine further goes 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.270
 tiger-1 is in principle excellence and 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.450
 century 3001 h 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.730
 he fatter more armor from him too 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.730
 pretty good if you tank a diamond 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.540
 and goes the most magnificent weapon which i 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.660
 just adore 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.190
 400 damage breakdown 203 high 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.530
 rate of fire is an excellent time to 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.660
 keeping awesome just easy 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.420
 wonderful tool of course when you 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.310
 turn it off to top then you just 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.860
 will be happy as a small child with 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.440
 such a tool to play very fun 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.350
 Well go on to the Royal 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.300
 tiger is my favorite tank and in general 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.280
 a lot of things I can't tell you about him 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.160
 but probably for this there is a video on 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.959
 channel that you can watch 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.760
 I will say only one car now bend 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.170
 as before bend it may be 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.570
 now of course you are not so much 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.170
 , new tanks, new to them 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.640
 would be but still very good and in 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.880
 principle there are two options 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.650
 gun installations 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.239
 The first is to leave stock tools with 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.489
 splendid rate of fire 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.010
 good damage and good penetration plus 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.380
 excellent accuracy or set 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.910
 second or third cannon on 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.490
 best second I do not know what everyone 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.100
 the third is worth it I did not ride on it for a long time 2 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.900
 audio has great damage to punch and 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.580
 even higher than stock guns 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.510
 but of course it has a low 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.670
 rate of fire 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.190
 somewhere around 10 seconds there will be a recharge 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.020
 maybe a little less and temporarily 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.210
 the vision is also of course a little longer and 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.400
 accurate slightly worse but in general maybe it 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.170
 not so critical yet i would choose myself 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.280
 100 to release and ride with her there 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.980
 rate of fire four and a half 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.430
 seconds just like a machine gun scribbling in 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.320
 of enemies 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.630
 well, plus of course, good armor 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.590
 Of course, too, with their flaws 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.960
 lower armor sheet 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.660
 and on the tower there is no shock breaks through but if 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.180
 start playing then you will receive 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:18.870
 just great fun going on 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.120
 There is 75 Well, what is there to say? 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.400
 nothing worth it just superior 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.260
 royal tiger but what could be better 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.120
 royal tiger yes even from private 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.050
 armor and improved guns to the general then 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.290
 probably nothing 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.490
 there were a lot of armor here 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.080
 now only the lower one breaks through 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.360
 bronelist on the turrets very, very 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.850
 small is this commander's tower and 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.000
 breaking through quite difficult vacation cruises 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.490
 and there are 11 12 and 8 centimeters with 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.190
 good one-time damage low 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.560
 rate of fire and low accuracy with 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.450
 time reduction but damage and penetration 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.790
 here of course just not gorgeous norm 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.830
 and so at beginners of course already rises 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.200
 usually dilemma what to download first if 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.760
 like a German heavy tank mouse and 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.910
 Sheets I will answer so 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.650
 cars are good in their own way but e100 costs 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.720
 download only to those who expect 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.730
 play with a premium account and farm 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.820
 silver for premium because just on 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.650
 bb play on it is not very fun and so 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.170
 let's start e100 first then 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.000
 here we are not two guns 12 and 8 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:21.750
 centimeters like on mars or 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.630
 15 cm than what flaws in 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.190
 of this weapon breaking through shell 235 what 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.320
 not so much of course 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.390
 colossal one-time damage is not very 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.000
 high accuracy long time information 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.400
 low rate of fire the main thing is this 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.960
 with such accuracy to aiming something not 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.050
 sees about punch and very little it 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.660
 makes play on golden shells and 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.790
 so the tank will eat silver or 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.910
 gold is very strong 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.530
 and therefore if you suddenly download it 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.020
 leave stock gun goods 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.210
 I ask why you shook e100 if 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.910
 Mau with the same instrument looks where 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:00.390
 more fun armor into it more 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.760
 low places are not so huge and 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.100
 plus guns are absolutely nothing 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.090
 different to e100 of course a little bit 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.400
 faster than we 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.310
 but here we have and the types of armor and more 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.740
 thicker so decide in principle yourself 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.350
 I have video on these cars on 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.260
 channel you can watch them and choose 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.660
 imagine some of them well, but in general 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:25.140
 principle, the branch is not bad, especially starting 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:29.460
 somewhere level 6 7 and then begins 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:31.260
 just tell the virtuoso and the tiger and e75 all 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.990
 just like clockwork traversed 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.790
 and any efforts do not deliver what you 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:39.470
 decide what to download and was with you 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.470
 circle tv all see you soon
