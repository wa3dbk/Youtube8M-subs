00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:11.880
 transform my school 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.799
 a tour guide concentrates on this course 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.890
 on the transformation process of 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.500
 in on the way out to the vision and 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.320
 their implementation towards a learning culture 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.970
 the potential for development 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.430
 every school can only own itself 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.019
 change what we think about the departure 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.920
 we can do this is to 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.380
 to inspire 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.630
 We can show you examples 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.489
 can imagine aspects of good schools 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.070
 we can provide assistance for 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.899
 the processes of change we can do completely 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.790
 work up a lot what others have already done 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.649
 have and what to train in yours now 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.640
 development process helps and exactly that 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.500
 methods do help positions and above 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.660
 all work community of makers 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:57.840
 draw this course from yes what have 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.079
 we made in the sbz we have everything 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.229
 Away, just do away everything old 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.090
 thought and have us just the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.070
 Findings that exist in the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.330
 education psychology in the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.260
 brain research that have it a try 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.960
 looked at and what do we know basis 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.240
 for learning is relationship but we go 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.369
 still further we say the old ones 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.610
 classical subjects are not enough 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.250
 the challenges that we are in 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.750
 the eyes look like we really do 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.189
 Master the big ones 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.380
 social challenges like 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.250
 climate change resource shortage degree 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.880
 transformed back to a pose of 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.200
 common to a world where we are 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.340
 plays a bigger role than that 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.340
 competition against each other 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.380
 and the exchange with other people 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.560
 who have also decided theirs 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.170
 to do something with a vision 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.270
 they learn everything that is possible and imaginable 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.479
 is when you get on the road 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.950
 to transform your own school 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.009
 I think that there are many beautiful ones 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.080
 feel that the way they are on the way 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.850
 is not optimal it is possible 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.280
 students me well it's the teachers 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.930
 not good and the parents feel too 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.970
 not well with this school and what 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.660
 there happens and there is 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.510
 actually only one 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.590
 Conclusion that means we have to 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.160
 us unite parents with the teachers with 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.650
 the students 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.930
 It must be an alliance in every single one 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.500
 School be closed between those 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.060
 They work on children 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.940
 to develop potential for potential 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.959
 can be in the parents with the 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.340
 teachers and teachers with engineers like that 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.930
 connect that alliance then too 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.440
 able to think together 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.110
 where they want to live together as long as parents 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.670
 against the teachers need to work or 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.019
 Parents feel that the teachers 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.060
 to do something different than what they do 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.260
 want and as long as the student has that 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.980
 Feel that the teachers have you 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.230
 actually only by any 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.180
 examina want to lead them there too 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.109
 to be read by the teachers in 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.090
 good and bad 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:07.010
 as long as that is the case, this alliance can be 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.570
 nonexistent because of this alliance 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.030
 the school can not exist me 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.290
 to develop a common mind that can 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.320
 not even together with goals 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.850
 develop and such a system what 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.180
 in a sense , not knowing where to go 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.489
 want 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.930
 because you do not agree that is 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.100
 wonderful directly her bar 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.900
 that is wonderful and manipulable and 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.240
 time and again with new reforms 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.980
 shake bahr now heard 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.980
 In this case, most of the time, they come 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.940
 in the sense of potential development 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.890
 this course is not just based on 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.900
 but also on 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.400
 personal reflection and development 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.430
 as well as on actions in her 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.690
 school environment 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.150
 every week becomes a new one for you 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.150
 chapter for editing unlocked 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.370
 always share both text and video 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.130
 has and in phases in addition 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.080
 methods suggestions offered in each 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.000
 Chapters hide three tasks 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.460
 the so-called head heart and hand 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.260
 their work with them 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.420
 share with learners and be like that 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.870
 inspire and complement each other 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.970
 can head tasks are thinking orders 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.910
 to you your opinions and thoughts 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.340
 Capturing heart's tasks are reflections 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.799
 Orders to you referring to them as 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.070
 transformation actor or actor 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.470
 refer to hand duties are actions 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.780
 which it is necessary to implement and the 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.000
 share experience 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:35.810
 The course comprises twelve chapters over 14 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.120
 weeks start in the direction of potential 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.610
 unfolding basic processes 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.090
 one starts to strengthen and dreams 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.680
 community information essence design 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.110
 continue to learn implementation 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.100
 personal noise reflection and transfer 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.740
 in school life 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.250
 yes, what is the conclusion in the concept 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.380
 bring 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.420
 Of course this is very strong in the center 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.880
 the question is how are the learning structures 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.010
 the children designed it as the center 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.140
 the organization but also the 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.360
 adult structures 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.470
 They are also looking at how 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.260
 we want to work together 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.490
 ask how often do we meet like 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.360
 the flow of information what is it 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.610
 role of the parents but also so we ask 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.530
 make something completely new here we know 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.030
 not at all if it works like that 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.770
 We actually like quality assurance 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.450
 They make sure that we are 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.120
 that also achieve what we achieve 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:30.510
 want 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:32.190
 how to run information and how to be 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.870
 we slowly and there we come very am 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.360
 conclusion to an organization the 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.430
 always learning and not learning now 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.740
 a product has made a project and 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.080
 what has been implemented and now in again 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.970
 this new form petrified but 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.010
 that is always learning in 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.170
 small steps to change and that 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.810
 this walk is easy to get to 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.340
 normality then sometime heard and in 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.970
 You can do a transformation process 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.890
 watch very long frame conditions 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.050
 and leave that relatively open what exactly 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.970
 it comes out of it is such a result 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.190
 comes by itself if you have certain 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.860
 goes through steps and thereby has that 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.510
 not unjust character but 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.600
 really has the possibility of this 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.370
 to attract concrete school and to her 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.230
 very accurate school to see what is 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.000
 nice that we want what is going well 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:21.000
 what are our potential it will not work 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.500
 only about the potential of the children and the 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.870
 teacher but also the organization 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.250
 This essential organization was one thing 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.979
 own character has its own 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.500
 has personality and how can we 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:33.270
 this organization is something to accompany 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.910
 which will be even closer to us 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.950
 even closer to us and this is just 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.720
 in fact the sum is more 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.100
 individual parts of the potential of the school 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.790
 is more than the potential of the individual 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.790
 members 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:54.660
 sign up now at your school in 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.660
 departure
