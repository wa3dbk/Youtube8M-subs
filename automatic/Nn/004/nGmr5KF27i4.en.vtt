00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:07.110
 welcome to my kitchen 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.710
 today we are going to prepare a rich soup of 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.520
 patacones like this I have approximately 2 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.610
 green 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.410
 The size of the patacones will be 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.530
 according to the taste of the person can be 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.810
 of this size it can be so bigger 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.350
 then I'm going to show you after 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.800
 the sad how are they going to stay here I have 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.360
 a liter of chicken broth in which 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.180
 I'm going to make has pepper salt and 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.100
 I feel the garlic powder species 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.650
 onion in strong here I have this 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.760
 doing in the unit follow the green 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.370
 to make patacones we started with 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.420
 the pain 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.269
 the green for 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.489
 whenever so it is not then 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:59.559
 it can be turned around but I say 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:02.640
 each person agrees that the 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.640
 size you want 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.530
 but you also go for more 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.530
 uy 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:23.390
 we are pending to flip it 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:29.799
 color on the bottom and then already 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.799
 we said it so that the other part lasts 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.130
 we already take them out look how he's out there 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.829
 because then we will see it again 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.250
 when we need it in the pasta 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.250
 cinnamon 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.030
 now let's explain it in the pasta 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.030
 put 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.290
 with a small hand first hand 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.729
 ah 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.490
 we put plastic bag so you do not 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.250
 it sticks to us from the classrooms I reserve it more 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.990
 here while we do the others for 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.990
 throw it back to fry 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.140
 ah 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.220
 Look, this one was a little bit more 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.890
 thick is good because when they are thrown 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.400
 to the broth or do not separate a little and 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.069
 respect and the others remain whole then 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.219
 we are going to see it 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.910
 now we talk about this we are still missing 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:36.360
 Some 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.150
 a little bit of funk 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.610
 to taste there are people who will not 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.860
 because the broth already have salt that is not 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.310
 we will go hand and put them to 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.310
 fry 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.569
 why 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:08.330
 I am very salty from the stories that I 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:10.490
 love the areas and winds are the whole 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:15.500
 let's hope these are flipped 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:20.420
 and we already take them out look how they are 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.970
 and now we take it out and incorporate it into 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.480
 broth 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.480
 ah 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.379
 and so we are frying all 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.200
 we take the pieces 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.260
 these are the last ones and they are already 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.940
 look at the countries that are now the 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.940
 we add mayors 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.740
 yes 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:19.750
 we have the fish stock we are going to 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.750
 boil 10 minutes 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.360
 and look what a delight 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.270
 to which I tell you how we are going to 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.970
 serve within ten thousand or three things 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:37.449
 we come back to serve you 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:40.990
 it boiled ten minutes now 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:43.289
 now we're going to pass it and we're going to 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.289
 to serve 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.520
 I love the leaves 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:05:00.159
 and we serve it look how it waits in a 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:05:04.869
 liter and two large green appointments but if 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:07.379
 you want it thicker then more 

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:07.379
 green 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:23.380
 When you serve it, you can sprinkle it 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:23.380
 over cilantro parsley I want it that way 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.860
 until next time and thanks for watching
