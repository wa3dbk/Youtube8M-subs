00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.790
 hello in this lesson we will learn 

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:10.249
 go plastic here at the moment we have 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.070
 broken helicopter blade see yes 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:16.520
 here's a super glue and glue I will not work 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.250
 because she just fall off here 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.400
 Now I will teach you how to solder plastic 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.050
 so that he was like new to begin with 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.980
 soldering iron and a file system that's so 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.990
 he was purely desirable to go asexually 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:37.160
 because he will stay on 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:40.880
 plastic and get something like this 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:48.079
 of this here i eat not cleaned 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:50.989
 soldering iron okay enough means 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.309
 to spoil the plastic you need to do 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:59.140
 homogeneous mass 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:01:04.549
 that is, it needs to be unsoldered inside 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:10.159
 so here and make such grooves like this 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:14.680
 here we do now and now all these 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.680
 the holes that we made need to close 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:26.980
 here so neatly gloss over 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.980
 back here and so and 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:38.450
 Here we have a homogeneous plastic 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:45.409
 which melted and reappeared 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:48.710
 whole here basically everything is a little bit now 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:56.119
 slightly sharpen the file to all 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:59.569
 It was exactly here please whole 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.459
 you can paste the area back into your 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:04.130
 a toy and 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:07.970
 flying can also be repaired 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:12.009
 any plastic things well, in principle 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.009
 that's all you need is nothing more
