00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
and it wasn't like one of those cystic

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.880 
and it wasn't like one of those cystic
acne<00:01:33.210> kind<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.840> pimples<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.290> was<00:01:34.439> thus<00:01:34.560> windows

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
acne kind of pimples it was thus windows

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.550 
acne kind of pimples it was thus windows
on<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.310> surface<00:01:35.970> surface<00:01:36.570> kind<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.110> pickle<00:01:37.409> so
