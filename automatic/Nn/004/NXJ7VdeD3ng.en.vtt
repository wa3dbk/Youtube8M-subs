00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.670
Greetings! This is LGR here just with a
quickly made video to talk about a

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.170
subject that hundreds of people have already sent me, on Twitter and Facebook, and probably will over

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.370
the next week so I'm just going to go ahead and talk about it now,

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.330
and that is that Maxis has officially
shut down,

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.570
as of today, and EA has confirmed it,

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.210
Let me make this clear though, and
some people seem to be confused, this has

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.900
nothing to do with "The Sims" team,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.600
that's another Maxis studio,  "The
Sims" studio making "The Sims 4" and everything

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:37.309
"The Sims" isn't effected, but old school Maxis is gone, officially,

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.649
That's super sad; it's also completely expected. To be clear, this is the Emeryville studio

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.980
at Maxis, the ones who made The Sims 1, The Sims 2,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.920
Sims Online, SimCity (2013), Spore, Darkspore, and a bunch of expansions

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.960
and stuff in between that.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.770
But yeah, this was the direct
descendant like old-school Maxis who made

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.340
all the classic Sim games that I grew
up with and loved, so it's just sad to

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.590
see them gone but,

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.890
you know for me, personally, it's kinda
mixed

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.500
for a couple reasons. For one, I've kind of
lamented their passing long ago when

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.320
Will Wright left the company after making
Spore.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.549
Now this, I mean, this just kinda makes
it official

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.140
which, again, I'm mixed on that even
though I love Maxis; I really did like

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.689
the ambition and some of these games that they made. You know, Spore, I thought, was

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.280
incredibly interesting if

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.409
very flawed. Darkspore, same thing;
interesting ARPG kinda thing, but like,

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:33.770
eh, whatever

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.329
SimCity (2013): Ugh, DRM.

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.460
and just lackluster mechanics and
whatnot and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.540
you know. So it made sense; they had a
bunch of failures and everything but it

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.600
doesn't matter at the same time. Right
now all I want to do is just say

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.420
friggin huge condolences to all the 
super talented people that were working there

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.049
I followed a lot of them on Twitter, and seeing all the tweets and everything is

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.520
really kinda heart-wrenching, and it's
awful and

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.920
I hope that they enjoyed that large
fridge full of beer before the day was out;

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.000
that looked maybe a little satiating for some, but
yeah.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.610
I don't have much more to say except

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.850
I just wanted to acknowledge it because
it's historical, man; it's the end of an era,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.530
it's bittersweet because like I said a
lot of their games were highly

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.670
criticized and for good reason

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.180
they fell short but I just want to shout
out to

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.650
a legendary epic developer and

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.830
end it here with a quote, and that is

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.580
"It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.730
or where the doer of deeds could have
done them better.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.870
The credit belongs to the man who was
actually in

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.110
the arena, who errs, who comes short

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.090
again and again, because there is no
effort without error

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.440
and shortcoming. Also, EA sucks."

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.830
That's the end of the quote; thanks for
watching.
