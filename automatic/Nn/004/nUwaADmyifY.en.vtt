00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.000 
alternately we could also just use it
from<00:05:00.199> one<00:05:01.199> of<00:05:01.260> the<00:05:01.349> ones<00:05:01.470> we've<00:05:01.620> already<00:05:01.770> added

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
to our counts but for some reason it's

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.850 
to our counts but for some reason it's
not<00:05:03.860> inserting<00:05:04.860> that<00:05:05.010> so<00:05:05.190> that's<00:05:05.310> fine<00:05:06.860> watch
