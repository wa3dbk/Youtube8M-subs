00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:16.199
 yes I have that from more 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.199
 second and third 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.619
 I have been better off with the robbery 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.609
 I think there is so much from the fire department 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.339
 state other children were 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:31.539
 In addition, a lot of toppers because she's money is the cut and I already stood that to the 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.470
 branding and 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.470
 one of the top men would become the old method 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.940
 the three leaders 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.590
 and let it be about ten years later I am only really empathic with the 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.710
 that I also that of a living birds that is also one 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.420
 so beautiful living now about 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.820
 a year or 6 4 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.820
 I slowly gained the trust of this group of geese 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.240
 that's what the year i found i think too 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.520
 are you wrong we asked more if they could film it but I have me 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.120
 was already known I thought I had something 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.580
 it will be a team but I am now I have such a bond with them that I am you 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.770
 that we are ready for nothing 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.520
 that is further improvement 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.270
 to shorten 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.200
 it is the leader of the group 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.220
 7 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.250
 rumors about spain and greece 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.790
 the spotted can play that I find a lot cleared 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.700
 it's a nasty full 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.940
 and I find the judge know 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.420
 the writer uttered 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.420
 both just real kapsones wave state 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.050
 that will still be a grand slam, you already know a mischievous horsemen that is 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.850
 full of goldie 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.020
 it is enormously late in the day that passes 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.070
 you find that I think then just the mac that I think is just too easy 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.289
 the ground knows that the state just that also has wings but this is not such 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.530
 That show is not like that 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.660
 I think it's nice that you are kind of 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.660
 I myself also have enormous modesty 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.660
 because I think I can just start saying I'm better than mouris 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.039
 but 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:18.719
 that he does not want anyway 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.719
 the bronze owl 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:27.099
 nature people sharm el sheikh can enjoy an escape route dump it 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.419
 in our smith's behavior 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:32.449
 and it is crazy about the soft pussy starling 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:35.919
 there is enough misery in the world 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:40.439
 what could be better there good news about the Long-eared Owl that was good news 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.439
 about the Long-eared Owl 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:44.719
 with almost impossible 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.540
 and that while she was at one of the most limited feyenoord is in it 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.799
 Dutch language area 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.309
 that five years with such an attitude 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:55.869
 I am a big winner did it all 

00:02:55.869 --> 00:03:00.549
 I often say to other Farc the bronze owl has ruined out for the other 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:01.929
 five holes 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:04.929
 after a book i am how hot it is i am now in a kind 

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.959
 I have experienced that dude matic and wait and see 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.379
 the troubled book 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.499
 it is that becomes a viewing 

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:14.789
 thus put nadal 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:16.330
 but that's not it being one 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.849
 worked in the approximately sixteen parts and I am 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.389
 with the winter it was over 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.569
 I'm about to be that now 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.259
 impressed 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:28.259
 about us open 800 900 pages 

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:31.049
 then it is brought in 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.569
 it is behind it 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.779
 I have finished the first three chapters 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:40.059
 all very emotional very nice full full I want to take food as it is 

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:44.629
 and of course that will be 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:46.830
 I think that even two parts already 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.809
 zeist 

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:51.259
 its cleanest your rear 

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:52.989
 it is a 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.969
 I think that maybe the favorite is my favorite follow 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.319
 what you often do with gray white 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.479
 that's nice then, I spent a couple of hours watching yesterday 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:03.419
 not this one 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.419
 15 hours in the water 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.549
 This is the other series that stand than just the perpetrator 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:12.760
 and then afraid of that he sees that wilders are hanging a piece of plastic on it 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.589
 work 

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:18.379
 and so put that thinking that she has been thinking for a week now that there is one 

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:20.509
 competing is a whole 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:21.600
 time writes 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.729
 grins with ici he writes about nutrition 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:29.330
 Long-eared Owls are known to take him away from other ferguson's nest 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.539
 and thanks to the extensive explanation 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.550
 and that they can both wear 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.659
 That is also very special for a woman to disrupt the boat 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:39.770
 we have that 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.180
 when I found my empty pallets after a weekend it turned out 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.479
 closer to the one meter diameter in the living room of a piece 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:47.370
 faster 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.729
 nipple piercings gasoline and egg timer 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.070
 but that also does not go with the hand of which I like to be kicked 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:01.139
 fireproof is hewitt days that 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.039
 it's alright 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.689
 well done 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:10.889
 inspired the people you hear after a skype bombing that had been completed 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:13.889
 employees of typhus dog councils 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.759
 you just have to determine the way in between 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:19.409
 because what he writes about birds seems to me the dogs' desires 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:21.490
 no bread from it 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.029
 Western countries that fear me 

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:28.150
 suspect that is correct because what I say but what he says but again full 

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:28.430
 support 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.219
 so just say what the bird writers don't bother much 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:34.699
 I am still addressed what I am trying to do about it seriously 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:36.370
 according to the writer 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.370
 This does not mean that bullshit about pork tenderloin 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.770
 so please really start this happening to the stopper part of the 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.020
 time along 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.860
 to talk to jefferies 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.449
 Binckbank was going to fly with all if that was a nice weather on the internet 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:56.669
 I also think he was talking to him 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.729
 I think if you look closely you just see that 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.969
 they grab those but actually a piece of those geese you know 

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:08.469
 that's all I want now or not to stop thinking about my performance 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:11.469
 Dear I think so don't look like this 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:16.049
 So it's like a cargo bike where the kids are there for the youth 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:21.469
 we just have seven points for twelve, you know 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:25.620
 he is now a child so what is that for questioning this season was after his 

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:26.259
 action part
