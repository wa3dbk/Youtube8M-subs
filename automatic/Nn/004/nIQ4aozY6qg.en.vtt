alright<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.059> from<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.660> point<00:00:39.870> on<00:00:40.020> I'm<00:00:40.260> going

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
alright so from this point on I'm going

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.840 
alright so from this point on I'm going
to<00:00:40.559> assume<00:00:40.800> two<00:00:41.100> things<00:00:41.340> one<00:00:41.640> you're<00:00:41.820> a

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
to assume two things one you're a

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.290 
to assume two things one you're a
beginner<00:00:42.210> two<00:00:42.360> flashing<00:00:43.290> roms<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:44.280> your<00:00:45.090> phone

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
beginner two flashing roms to your phone

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
is rooted and has clockworkmod recovery

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.369 
is rooted and has clockworkmod recovery
running<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.450> reason<00:00:48.750> I'm<00:00:48.899> assuming<00:00:49.350> that

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
running so the reason I'm assuming that

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.139
