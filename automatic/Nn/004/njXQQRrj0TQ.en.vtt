00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
presently at the Burger plant we have

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.630 
presently at the Burger plant we have

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
small amount of co2 that we will be

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.580 
small amount of co2 that we will be
injecting<00:03:09.550> into<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:10.300> test<00:03:10.540> well<00:03:10.810> this<00:03:11.290> test

injecting into the test well this test
well<00:03:11.800> is<00:03:12.100> probably<00:03:12.550> going<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:12.820> be<00:03:13.140> drilled<00:03:14.140> and

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
well is probably going to be drilled and

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.530 
well is probably going to be drilled and
