00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
the horrible synthetic II like fabrics

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.069 
the horrible synthetic II like fabrics
that<00:03:32.489> are<00:03:32.579> not<00:03:32.910> comfortable<00:03:33.209> in<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.540> heat<00:03:33.870> but

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
that are not comfortable in the heat but

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.599 
that are not comfortable in the heat but
the<00:03:34.200> men's<00:03:34.440> stuff<00:03:34.709> because<00:03:35.010> of<00:03:35.130> shape<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:35.579> much

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
the men's stuff because of shape so much

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.099 
the men's stuff because of shape so much
simpler<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.269> designs<00:03:36.569> are<00:03:36.720> much<00:03:36.840> simpler

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
simpler and the designs are much simpler

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.479 
simpler and the designs are much simpler
the<00:03:37.319> fabric<00:03:37.680> tends<00:03:37.919> to<00:03:38.069> be<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.190> bit<00:03:38.250> better

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
the fabric tends to be a bit better
