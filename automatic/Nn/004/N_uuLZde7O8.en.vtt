 how friends of youtube will not be 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.580
 wants to be your retro gaming friend 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.040
 I come with 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.820
 a little help for you for those who 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.820
 they have a gameboy advance 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.619
 well also that it also serves as 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:27.510
 better for those who have a gameboy 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:31.050
 classic color or pocket that is like 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.330
 illuminate the screen of your game boy but 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.130
 not really inside but that 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:39.329
 making a 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.280
 a lamp as 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.350
 or those that sell and if they do not have money 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.239
 to buy the same treatment you can 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.879
 manufacture and it's from the siesta is here we go 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.979
 the presentation of my office product 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.560
 we give you the product presentation 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:56.900
 What do you think 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.670
 one hundred percent of mine has done for me not 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.020
 I copied anything is the idea to me I was 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.590
 it happened only and here it is 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.310
 lamp for the game boy advance 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.140
 good here 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.450
 at this moment I do not know how 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.500
 explain how to do it 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.180
 lamp but 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.650
 I do not have the materials to 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.510
 doing it is not going to apply to you 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.010
 but I will explain them in a very 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.170
 simple 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.380
 good what they have to have are 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.299
 two cables 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.670
 of these delgaditos of copper wire 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:35.350
 forgiveness and that they are in the peeled tips 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.409
 because these bring with plastic 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.090
 5 peel protector tips 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.929
 Well the second thing is to have a little bit of 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.430
 this a small vial and what they are going 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:51.830
 to be going to him 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:56.240
 that speaks yellow is the negative 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:59.160
 then the negative goes to sue the earth 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.490
 then this yellow one is going to go to the 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.490
 battery 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.330
 will go to the negative pole of the stack 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.700
 and it's going to go on the bottom of the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.110
 flashlight or the lamp of the 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.700
 ampolleta is going to go here in the part of 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.910
 down you are going to tape it 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.240
 isolate the part from here below 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.000
 remember 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.320
 negative going on the bottom or be 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.910
 in this case the negative will be yellow 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.240
 goes here at the bottom of the 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.630
 flashlight have to see it 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.880
 and the black that is the positive goes in the 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.320
 part of here next to the lantern that 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.140
 You can not see it because I have it very 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.310
 well glued with insulating tape but it's going 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:45.010
 in this part of the lantern and under 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.230
 positive of the stack with that would be everything and 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.000
 here you can roll it up I'm going to 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.840
 put I put you synthet front around 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.750
 and there's his lamp for game boy 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.069
 advance and now I'm going to teach you how to 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.330
 mount it to work 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.640
 what they have to do is 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.190
 to give current source to this 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.780
 to give you energy 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.160
 we are going to have to use the same batteries 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.440
 of the gameboy 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.210
 because I had put with another stack 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.860
 heart but it did not work because it 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.490
 fell and did not light the screen well 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.510
 better we are going to take the cover 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.689
 to the gameboy 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.400
 as you can see there are the batteries with me 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:28.079
 these batteries I have problems because they are 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.439
 rechargeable so I do not have problems 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:33.330
 then as I told you in black it goes 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:36.410
 positive 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.410
 and yellow goes 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.810
 negative 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.440
 is going to have a moment now upside down 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.460
 as agreement very well 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.460
 this did not succeed 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.190
 they moved on a little bit because you have to 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.650
 put it well 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.450
 and it's wrong 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.319
 you have to put it to analyze had left 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.319
 and there it is there is 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.530
 you can see well 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.630
 is that this wire comes out here 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.350
 in front are well put and walk more 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.120
 well there it is 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.880
 how good it installs lights and it's on 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.110
 and you will put the lid so that 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.110
 tighten and do not get out 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.070
 but they have to be well placed now 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.350
 I do not stay well put in that accommodate 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.940
 the for 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.560
 this Maria who does not want like 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.560
 detach the world 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.550
 there is 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.410
 so 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:48.270
 here he is careful because he moves 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:51.990
 then there is light for your good boy 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:55.170
 advance then a good one is 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.690
 completely dark for you not 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:00.360
 I think it's going very well but I see 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.010
 perfect the gameboy screen already 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.910
 they have to better be in the 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:08.249
 surface to affirm the 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.069
 at this time 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:15.559
 this yellow wire that is staying a 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:15.559
 little bad put 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.060
 they have to be careful not to move 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.060
 both the 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.140
 payton 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.140
 and now let's turn it on 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:34.229
 you do not see almost anything you are not going to see 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.590
 almost nothing if I see clear on the screen 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.590
 of the gameboy 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:47.300
 now there will be nothing for example I 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:50.149
 let's fix this thing we have to 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:53.919
 put her have to get used to this 

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:53.919
 that I just did it so it takes away 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.850
 and there I see clarito 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:03.550
 but I do not think I see anything 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:06.660
 so I see fine it's not for 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:09.070
 practically nothing is seen in the 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.670
 camera but so with the light off I 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.670
 I see very well 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:20.529
 so see you in the pokemon center 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:22.539
 you do not see it well but good 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:25.109
 I hope you liked the tutorial 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:28.620
 or whatever you want to call tutorial 

00:06:25.109 --> 00:06:31.410
 I invent an invention that I made 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:34.810
 the same truth works just that there is 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:38.550
 than learning how to accommodate the 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:40.230
 the cables have to stop the cables 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:44.840
 good guys I hope you liked the 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:44.840
