so<00:01:08.360> optical<00:01:08.690> que<00:01:08.780> mas<00:01:08.930> is<00:01:09.110> a<00:01:09.350> really<00:01:09.620> cool

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
so optical que mas is a really cool

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.980 
so optical que mas is a really cool
technology<00:01:10.370> we<00:01:10.940> extended<00:01:11.330> a<00:01:11.420> 10<00:01:11.570> to<00:01:11.659> 15<00:01:11.960> years

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
technology we extended a 10 to 15 years

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.450 
technology we extended a 10 to 15 years
in<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.290> future<00:01:12.440> the<00:01:12.740> beginnings<00:01:13.250> of<00:01:13.310> it's

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
in the future the beginnings of it's

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.040 
in the future the beginnings of it's
already<00:01:13.670> there<00:01:13.850> so<00:01:14.330> it's<00:01:14.450> a<00:01:14.510> cloak<00:01:14.750> that<00:01:14.900> you

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050
