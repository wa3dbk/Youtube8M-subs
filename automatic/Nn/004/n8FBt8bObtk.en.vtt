cures asthma as a smaller diameter but
the<00:03:09.109> puff<00:03:09.469> again<00:03:09.769> is<00:03:10.640> bigger<00:03:11.030> to<00:03:11.870> ensure<00:03:12.349> a

diameter<00:03:17.420> of<00:03:17.569> the<00:03:17.689> tube<00:03:17.930> ensures<00:03:18.379> that<00:03:18.409> the

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
diameter of the tube ensures that the

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.179 
diameter of the tube ensures that the

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:22.189 
sudden gets good access to the high

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.000 
sudden gets good access to the high
larynx<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:23.120> he's<00:03:23.599> able<00:03:23.780> to<00:03:23.930> do<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.829> surgery
