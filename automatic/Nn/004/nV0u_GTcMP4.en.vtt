00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.809
 because the summer is already ending and 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:16.040
 you have to start covering notebooks 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:18.110
 they prepared reports backpacks all around 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.450
 everything and today we are going to make a nice 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.890
 case for back to school this is 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.980
 the material with which we will work 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.359
 we have a piece of cloth of 25 x 20 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.689
 well here is a little crooked there 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:33.199
 to match what a closure that measures 20 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.360
 centimeters but cash measures 14 and a 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:38.420
 little red felt the mold of the 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.089
 manzanita a little felt black needle 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.000
 with green thread and needle with red thread what 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:48.080
 first thing we do is fold in half 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.839
 our canvas and hit the closing of 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.530
 agreement and then you will sew them 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.320
 sides 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.210
 here we have already cooked the sides and 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.850
 what we are going to do is we are going to 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.970
 flip and I'll show you how you 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.739
 I provided and how did I decide what 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.980
 size make the apple 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:10.970
 what I did was that I doubled like that 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:13.700
 and double ace to form a triangle and 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.130
 know the dimension that my 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.590
 apple then nothing else what I did was 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.720
 It leads to good I love her so 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.380
 nothing else I started to trace the center of 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.149
 here 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.520
 you know that apples like that 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.159
 there they have a measure where then they 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.100
 They come out like little hairs here and I have left 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.710
 very cachetona on this side because the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.229
 profile is a little bit more and you already have the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.020
 proportion of your apple here we already have 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.030
 the apple cropped then what 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.470
 we're going to do is we're going to put 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.560
 some pins and we're going to start 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.500
 trim 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.770
 here I have my apple cut the 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.159
 I will try to see how it looks is 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.390
 very nice 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:03.259
 and then with a little bit of this cloth 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.479
 black let's make him the stick 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.360
 super simple let's do the 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.910
 hairs that will carry down what 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.799
 we try there it looks good it looks super 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.049
 nice and then with one of these 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:18.049
 bits that we left are going to do 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:20.420
 the little leaf this is with pure remnant friend 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:23.299
 it looks amazing with a little thread 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.340
 green let's detail the little leaf because 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.819
 If you want to be noticed more, look for that 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.819
 Gypsy 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:40.020
 - it was very pretty looks super good here 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.940
 We have two or we sew it or stick it 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.069
 with silicone right now I think we're going 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.560
 to stick with silicone so that it is 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.430
 flown and this is very happy list for 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.319
