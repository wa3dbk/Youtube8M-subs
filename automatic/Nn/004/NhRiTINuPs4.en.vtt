00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 and it has been the last great manufacturer in 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.020
 get to the tablet sector results 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.240
 curious that he has given his 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.280
 rivals but at the same time after the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.089
 make contact with your tablet that 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.100
 we understand that because the sony tablet 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.310
 comes to the market as a tablet in 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.990
 different in essence its design breaks with 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.510
 the chronic that the other brands 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.240
 offer and far from competing for a 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.580
 Slim design what you have created are and is 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.580
 experience of pure and simple use ' 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.969
 you can not compete with the rest of 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.339
 brands doing the same thing so they are and 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.110
 He thought about improving certain aspects 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.120
 the ergonomics give a touch of 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.219
 exclusivity with its design in the form of 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.649
 leaf folded despite being 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.589
 substantially thicker than the others 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.719
 The sony tablet turns out to be the most 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.229
 comfortable of libya not of those who have 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.229
 tried 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.110
 finished in high black plastic 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.870
 quality and color silver 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.080
 the design of the sony tablet captures the 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.810
 user just look at it your wedge design 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.450
 not only is it aesthetic but it has two 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.670
 very important functions accommodate the 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.979
 buttons or connection ports inside and 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.920
 create good ergonomics conditions 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.680
 to catch the tablet on the air or improve 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.390
 writing on a table thanks to the 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.390
 native inclination that contributes 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.630
 the sony tablet that has the 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.939
 typical power and volume buttons 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.310
 besides the cargo port in the part 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.189
 bottom and a lid that hides the port 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.030
 usb and the memory card slot 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:55.630
 Yes, no sign of an HDMI 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.630
 nowhere 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.900
 ah 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.150
 inside the tablet that of are and not 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.520
 could change as much as outside 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.989
 more its characteristics are the same 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.970
 that most Android tablet 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.030
 we talk about a dual processor 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.610
 core nvidia tegra 2 a day of great 16 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.270
 gb storage screen of 9.4 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.330
 inch hd wifi gps etcetera etcetera 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.340
 the hardware does not stand out practically from the 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.739
 rest but if it does the good 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.319
 optimization that does that level in your 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.300
 own interface that runs on android 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.820
 3.2 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.000
 also the screen offers an answer 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.040
 incredible touch I would even dare to 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.180
 say it's the best we 've tried 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.180
 to date 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.190
 the combination of these two sections 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:04.430
 makes the user experience versus the 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.640
 sony tablet s be as it should be in a 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.400
 device that costs 400 or 500 euros 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.840
 we can see in no way 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.209
 slowdowns when doing scroll lack of 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.000
 fluency or that the interface moves to 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.280
 stumbling and the sony tablet gives a 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.130
 good choice to other tablet in this 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.680
 section therefore say that fluency 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.110
 and the answer screen tablet s 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.660
 of sound place it as the best tablet 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.290
 of the moment according to our tests and 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.290
 impressions 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.930
 if the sony tablet has another point 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.000
 strong in your software first highlight 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.400
 the good work of the engineers in the 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.620
 Android customization the essence of 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.500
 this is still present above all 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.170
 on the desktop some have been included 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.450
 widget but the important change is in 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.849
 the carousel of applications that like 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.640
 we see positively change from the basic 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:02.950
 android 3.2 and it shows much more 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.950
 interactive on the sony tablet 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.169
 the tablet is incorporated two cameras in the 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:18.269
 frontal is a discrete vga camera of 0 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.519
 3 megapixels to perform 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.250
 video calls while the back 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.740
 ups quality up to 5 megapixels 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.169
 the photos that can be made with them 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.020
 they are normal but the video is quality 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:33.770
 full hd and highlights more than on the ground 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.770
 of photography 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.949
 in terms of content consumption they are 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.470
 including their platforms in music 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:51.600
 unlimited and unlimited video two 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.910
 services with which the user can 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.160
 rent or buy music movies or 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.130
 pay for monthly flat rate in the 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.650
 audio case are also and has included 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.080
 your sony reader platform so that the 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.440
 user of your tablet have easy access 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.419
 to the purchase of electronic books in order 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.010
 of accounts the manufacturers have given 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.229
 realize that not only can you 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.150
 make a device more profitable, but 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:18.090
 contents that are offered after sales 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.460
 they can be as or more profitable than the 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.180
 own tablet but ask them to 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.180
 amazon or apple 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.820
 The third point to highlight is the sensor 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.490
 infrared of the sony tablet s yes yes 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.740
 you heard right includes a sensor in the 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.169
 upper edge that serves to use the 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.000
 sony tablet as a remote control of 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:42.330
 the television or any device 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.370
 that uses this technology sony has 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.290
 included a database of thousands of 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.600
 equipment but if we do not come up with ours 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:51.240
 we can configure the command in the mode 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.940
 learning this section is very cool 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.370
 to change the channel with the tablet and 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:00.350
 that we will generally use the pileup in 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.350
 the sofa in front of the television 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.910
 as a result of sony analysis 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.280
 tablet s after testing it during 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.260
 hours my assessment is deeply 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.960
 positive as I said at the beginning 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:19.960
 it is surely the android tablet more 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.780
 Comfortable and complete ergonomic fluid that 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.520
 we can find for now true is 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.290
 that does not serve to hesitate before the 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.720
 colleagues having a sheet of paper 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.400
 electronic but the reality is that the 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.710
 tablets have become a device 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.900
 to walk around the house and except in 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.960
 physical comparisons we like the 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:40.930
 format that has given him sony cast in 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.000
 missing those and an exit hdmi but they are and 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.310
 has included a good connection service 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.890
 line for those who have a 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.750
 television with internet connection the 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:52.240
 rest of sections as simplicity 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.910
 content consumption and so on has 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:59.100
 liked a lot so we value the sony 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:59.100
 tablet s with an 8 out of 10
