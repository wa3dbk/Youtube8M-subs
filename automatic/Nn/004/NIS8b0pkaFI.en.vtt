and<00:01:50.310> those<00:01:50.640> add<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.149> your<00:01:51.270> combo<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.840> get

and those add to your combo and get

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.980 
and those add to your combo and get
eliminated<00:01:52.530> at<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.770> same<00:01:52.950> time
