00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:06.370
 servus people good jude friends like on 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.910
 start this year, there is again new 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:14.020
 video to after 3 x 3 door in minecraft and 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.240
 how to build it zack zack 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.060
 she is also pretty fast and so on 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.550
 and businessman thieves with the new 1.5 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.190
 update that once from 5 update has yes 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.680
 Fixed some bugs and their new one 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.920
 things added in what was redstone 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.619
 and my old door the size 7 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.989
 as a second that is broken then de 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.120
 No longer specified and it was just 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.129
 even so I still have a door 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.379
 had the dimensions of 7 x 3 already something 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.839
 older still works but me 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.960
 wanted to continue in 1.5 for the 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.429
 all has the dimensions 7 times 2 has me 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.940
 set again and is me too 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:50.649
 successful 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.079
 that's even faster and faster 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.359
 Although here is the size 7 again 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:01.690
 2 times 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:01:03.100
 and now you're sure to ask for that 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.530
 just not just forward but 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.570
 also have a little idea how will 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.430
 This piste was built earlier 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.049
 that we still had a block and 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.159
 then just redstone on it is now 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.119
 no longer necessary due if 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.399
 we here 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.219
 have redstone or just built 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.640
 blog just the diagonal to the best 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:23.680
 stands 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.310
 that would not happen 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.299
 we put a second run under it 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.369
 and yes, if I just now 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.090
 activated then that too happens 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.679
 is expected 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.960
 however, it may be best 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:40.030
 be built diagonally if under the 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.310
 runways or side of the post what 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.049
 always a blog update take place 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.509
 that is, if the block somehow 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.880
 updated when driving from retracts 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.939
 everything can be best 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.969
 even somehow moved and even 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.590
 we have that then so if that itself 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.999
 now off and here it will be 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.520
 there is still nothing happening 

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:02.530
 but if we activate this here now 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.119
 and now just the blocked down 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.609
 move while this just built 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.220
 then you will see that both are dating 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:11.440
 drive yes and so does the whole thing 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.500
 here too, last ones do the same 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.090
 tutorial and we drive 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.680
 also with our doubletwist 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.100
 extender this is our bottom and 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.930
 Let's set our second runway 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.060
 so then we will have these two afterwards 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.360
 Check blocks in from the door 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.940
 we can and we use our input 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.470
 to the switch 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.760
 now here comes a repeater on the 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.310
 third stage of a blog leads and 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.320
 Here's redstone on it 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.110
 still not put here so now 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.880
 here we redstone redstone and here one 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.880
 repeater on the fourth level 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.750
 Now we prefer to worry about this 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.610
 now possible by pushing the ship 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.080
 and then it lies on a block 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.270
 then not changed but that 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.770
 just the blog about it is so 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.959
 At any rate, she will elicit 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.810
 Here comes a torch to the wall 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.820
 not on the floor against the wall and here 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.170
 he comes back blog about how 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.910
 a torch itself in short it is us 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.380
 Almost finished except that we are here 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.720
 now look at the redstone and 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.970
 piste and here's a blog 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:26.730
 drum so now we have our failure 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:29.340
 mechanism and now we fix that in 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.590
 which we hold the block just without that 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.870
 we do it all so we put here 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.239
 new feature on the fourth level then 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.209
 is it in the blog as you ski over accounts 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:42.000
 piste goes under never comes peter 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:47.040
 here comes redstone here is coming again 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.350
 blog redstone and come under here 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.760
 another pizza on the fourth 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.910
 step 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.410
 here comes a blog as redstone comes 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:59.459
 and here it comes 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:03.709
 Block model on it and on the slopes still 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.709
 blog so now we are already done 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.920
 how you see everything works and now 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:13.920
 we still have the rest of the best we 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.920
 set now for the first time our frame 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.459
 I 've noticed again lay announces 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.459
 we announce 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.260
 I hope it will not be that bad 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:28.260
 so now we have our frame and 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:34.510
 For the first time ours are doing just fine 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:37.450
 so and so here comes up why 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.390
 arrest and once here on the 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:46.300
 redstone torch about it and about it then 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:48.280
 we catch it all this way and now 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.320
 we connect to the whole 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.760
 I take the blue wool for that 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.670
 is green is for the mechanism 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.220
 down blue is for the rest and that 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.570
 Let's just do it here 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.570
 just do it again a second torch 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.740
 Do not pay attention to the blog 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.440
 because it does not matter 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.930
 and it comes again blockier comes 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.540
 again a blog you just have to 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.520
 endure the fabric here make her 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.980
 know what I mean 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:18.160
 Out of the throat your door is here 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.350
 then lure and here comes just that 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.270
 I just found you have spoken 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.300
 So you can not use it again here 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.419
 Just leave it out and here comes 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.940
 repeater back 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:32.830
 here happy ones come in this 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.760
 to connect all now to connect 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.950
 use connect 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:42.040
 Here is another login with him 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.200
 the and it is still here on another 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.360
 blog in and the slopes we have to 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.620
 No more will be easy by next 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.020
 mourned the slopes 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.360
 in the past we always had one 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.590
 Of course, redstone lamps do that 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.040
 activated we do not need that now 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.960
 more 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.240
 that means we have a lot to cost 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:04.210
 We do not need to save a lamp 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:06.250
 build and it all works so fast 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.440
 The whole tutorial is done 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:12.930
 Now you can still give her your walk 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.930
 next to build and zack zack zack zack zack 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.280
 if you switch the whole thing 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:32.090
 Wiring volt should not be set like that 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:34.130
 it does not work you have to watch that 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.460
 this app store will stay that way 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:43.100
 put repeater here and then the whole 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:45.530
 do it this way so set yours 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:48.290
 switch and the whole works well 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.210
 impeccable and yes I hope so 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.830
 equal like 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.250
 thumbs up really gives it once 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:57.140
 a lot of work is completely new to revise 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:07:01.120
 and yes I say goodbye skin 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.120
 people and 1000
