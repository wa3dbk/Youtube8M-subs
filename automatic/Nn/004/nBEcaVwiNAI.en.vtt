I'm looking forward to this year so I

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.410 
I'm looking forward to this year so I

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
for the year now keep in mind that just

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.380 
for the year now keep in mind that just
because<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.220> game<00:00:17.490> doesn't<00:00:17.760> show<00:00:18.029> up<00:00:18.150> on<00:00:18.270> this

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
because a game doesn't show up on this

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.670 
because a game doesn't show up on this
list<00:00:18.449> doesn't<00:00:18.840> mean<00:00:18.990> I'm<00:00:19.199> not<00:00:19.230> looking

forward<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.039> it

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
forward to it

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.099 
forward to it
we<00:00:20.580> only<00:00:20.730> have<00:00:20.939> room<00:00:21.119> for<00:00:21.180> 10<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.810> just

we only have room for 10 and just

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.630 
we only have room for 10 and just
because<00:00:22.350> your<00:00:22.590> game<00:00:22.830> doesn't<00:00:23.220> make<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.430> list

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640

right<00:00:37.739> here<00:00:37.770> every<00:00:38.370> time<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.879> have<00:00:39.300> actually

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
right here every time I have actually

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.840 
right here every time I have actually
never<00:00:40.079> played<00:00:40.680> an<00:00:40.860> uncharted<00:00:41.309> game<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.760> I'm

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
never played an uncharted game so I'm

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.819 
never played an uncharted game so I'm
hoping<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.450> will<00:00:42.570> allow<00:00:42.840> me<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.260> ease<00:00:43.469> into

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
hoping this will allow me to ease into

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.190 
hoping this will allow me to ease into
the<00:00:44.010> series<00:00:44.399> I'm<00:00:44.910> just<00:00:45.570> looking<00:00:45.840> forward<00:00:46.050> to

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
the series I'm just looking forward to

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.080 
the series I'm just looking forward to
because<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.620> gameplay<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.489> PlayStation

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
because the gameplay and the PlayStation

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.600 
because the gameplay and the PlayStation
experience<00:00:48.300> looked<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.620> good<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.399> looks

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
experience looked so good this looks

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.610 
experience looked so good this looks
like<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.000> kind<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.360> action-adventure<00:00:52.170> game<00:00:52.379> I

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
like the kind of action-adventure game I

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.189 
like the kind of action-adventure game I
expect<00:00:52.980> from<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.789> next-gen<00:00:54.239> my<00:00:54.600> only

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
expect from the next-gen my only

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.779 
expect from the next-gen my only
reservation<00:00:55.410> about<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.309> game<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
reservation about this game and the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.610 
reservation about this game and the
reason<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.180> number<00:00:57.420> 10<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.109> list<00:00:58.320> is

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
reason it's number 10 on the list is

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.319 
reason it's number 10 on the list is
because<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.609> PlayStation<00:00:59.820> experience

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
because that the PlayStation experience

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.479 
because that the PlayStation experience
some<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.199> gameplay<00:01:01.500> footage<00:01:01.800> looked<00:01:02.399> a

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
some of the gameplay footage looked a

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.860 
some of the gameplay footage looked a
little<00:01:02.699> bit<00:01:02.789> buggy<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.539> little<00:01:03.780> bit

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
little bit buggy and a little bit

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.600 
little bit buggy and a little bit
glitchy<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.439> we<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.100> hope<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.280> those

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
glitchy and we have to hope that those

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.429 
glitchy and we have to hope that those
get<00:01:05.909> finished<00:01:06.180> by<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.780> time<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.170> game<00:01:07.290> is

halo 5 single-player campaign the reason
this<00:01:34.650> game<00:01:34.860> almost<00:01:35.400> didn't<00:01:35.790> make<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.030> list<00:01:36.210> is

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
this game almost didn't make the list is

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.380 
this game almost didn't make the list is
because<00:01:36.600> 343<00:01:37.409> city<00:01:37.650> has<00:01:37.799> dropped<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.159> ball<00:01:38.310> so

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
because 343 city has dropped the ball so

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.160 
because 343 city has dropped the ball so
terribly<00:01:39.390> with<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.659> Master<00:01:39.960> Chief

collection and a lot of people are

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.789 
collection and a lot of people are
really<00:01:42.180> really<00:01:42.750> concerned<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.590> game

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
really really concerned that this game

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.770 
really really concerned that this game
is<00:01:43.950> not<00:01:44.399> going<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.880> be<00:01:44.970> up<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.240> par<00:01:45.420> when<00:01:45.659> it's

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
is not going to be up to par when it's

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.469 
is not going to be up to par when it's
released<00:01:46.020> fingers<00:01:46.950> crossed<00:01:47.310> they<00:01:47.820> can't<00:01:48.210> get

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
released fingers crossed they can't get

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.240 
released fingers crossed they can't get
this<00:01:48.630> one<00:01:48.689> wrong<00:01:49.020> can<00:01:49.320> they<00:01:49.500> coming<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.100> at

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
this one wrong can they coming in at

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.760 
this one wrong can they coming in at
number<00:01:50.399> 8<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:51.000> blood-borne<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.110> now<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.560> is

number 8 is blood-borne and now this is

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.830 
number 8 is blood-borne and now this is
probably<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.220> weird<00:01:53.490> entry<00:01:53.880> because<00:01:54.149> I'm<00:01:54.509> not

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
probably a weird entry because I'm not

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.499 
probably a weird entry because I'm not
the<00:01:55.140> biggest<00:01:55.380> fan<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.920> Dark<00:01:56.430> Souls<00:01:56.490> 1<00:01:56.969> &amp;<00:01:57.090> 2<00:01:57.240> I've

the biggest fan of Dark Souls 1 &amp; 2 I've
never<00:01:57.930> completed<00:01:58.439> either<00:01:58.590> what<00:01:59.100> really

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
never completed either what really

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.459 
never completed either what really
piques<00:01:59.729> my<00:01:59.820> interest<00:01:59.969> in<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.689> game<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.229> the

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
piques my interest in this game is the

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.770 
piques my interest in this game is the
setting<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:01.920> they've<00:02:02.219> chosen<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:03.000> idea<00:02:03.540> of

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
setting that they've chosen the idea of

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.730 
setting that they've chosen the idea of
a<00:02:03.899> Victorian<00:02:04.850> gothic<00:02:05.850> horror<00:02:06.439> nightmare<00:02:07.439> game

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
a Victorian gothic horror nightmare game

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.249 
a Victorian gothic horror nightmare game
is<00:02:07.979> awfully<00:02:08.849> interesting<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.509> me<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.810> if<00:02:10.170> it

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
is awfully interesting to me and if it

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.479 
is awfully interesting to me and if it
has<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.590> Dark<00:02:10.830> Souls<00:02:11.069> gameplay<00:02:11.459> that

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
has that Dark Souls gameplay that

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.280 
has that Dark Souls gameplay that
everybody<00:02:11.910> raves<00:02:12.150> about<00:02:12.330> then<00:02:12.959> that's<00:02:13.110> going

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
everybody raves about then that's going

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.790 
everybody raves about then that's going
to<00:02:13.410> be

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
to be

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.530 
to be
interesting<00:02:14.190> for<00:02:14.370> me<00:02:14.460> to<00:02:14.550> try<00:02:14.790> I'm<00:02:15.300> actually

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
interesting for me to try I'm actually

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.690 
interesting for me to try I'm actually
not<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.870> big<00:02:16.050> fan<00:02:16.350> of<00:02:16.380> scary<00:02:16.920> games<00:02:17.310> but

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
not a big fan of scary games but

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.730 
not a big fan of scary games but
recently<00:02:18.120> whenever<00:02:18.570> a<00:02:18.630> new<00:02:18.810> scary<00:02:19.230> game<00:02:19.440> comes

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
recently whenever a new scary game comes

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.170 
recently whenever a new scary game comes
out<00:02:19.860> me<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.340> my<00:02:20.460> friends<00:02:20.820> have<00:02:20.940> gotten

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
out me and my friends have gotten

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.460 
out me and my friends have gotten
together<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.570> play<00:02:21.720> them<00:02:21.930> together<00:02:22.050> because

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
together to play them together because

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.650 
together to play them together because
it's<00:02:22.650> just<00:02:22.800> so<00:02:22.980> fun<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.640> watch<00:02:23.820> people<00:02:23.880> react

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
it's just so fun to watch people react

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.270 
it's just so fun to watch people react
together<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.710> think<00:02:25.920> that's<00:02:26.100> something

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
together and I think that's something

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.650 
together and I think that's something
we'll<00:02:26.490> probably<00:02:26.730> end<00:02:26.910> up<00:02:27.150> doing<00:02:27.390> with<00:02:27.540> at

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
we'll probably end up doing with at

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.120 
we'll probably end up doing with at
least<00:02:27.750> part<00:02:28.020> of<00:02:28.110> blood-borne<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.740> I'm<00:02:28.980> really

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
least part of blood-borne and I'm really

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.920 
least part of blood-borne and I'm really
looking<00:02:29.340> forward<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.850> that<00:02:30.030> speaking<00:02:30.750> of

but<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.400> like<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.910> idea<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.510> parkour<00:02:40.470> Plus

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160

but I like the idea of parkour Plus
zombie<00:02:41.760> survival<00:02:42.180> frankly<00:02:42.930> this<00:02:43.170> game<00:02:43.380> looks

zombie survival frankly this game looks
like<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:44.040> well<00:02:44.400> done<00:02:44.820> Dead<00:02:45.210> Island<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:45.930> has<00:02:46.140> a

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
like a well done Dead Island that has a

lot more features and a lot more depth

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.830 
lot more features and a lot more depth
and<00:02:48.720> hopefully<00:02:49.350> hopefully<00:02:50.570> some<00:02:51.570> of<00:02:51.750> the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
emotion that keeps us all coming back to

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.940 
emotion that keeps us all coming back to
the<00:02:54.030> Walking<00:02:54.450> Dead<00:02:54.480> at<00:02:55.020> number<00:02:55.410> six<00:02:55.680> is<00:02:55.920> the

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
order 1886 and I expect this to be a

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.340 
order 1886 and I expect this to be a
very<00:02:59.490> controversial<00:03:00.360> pick<00:03:00.810> for<00:03:01.050> a<00:03:01.080> lot<00:03:01.230> of

very controversial pick for a lot of

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
people now there's been a lot of

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.130 
people now there's been a lot of
controversy<00:03:02.880> surrounding<00:03:03.660> in<00:03:03.750> this<00:03:03.930> game

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
controversy surrounding in this game

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.720 
controversy surrounding in this game
especially<00:03:04.350> when<00:03:04.770> it<00:03:04.860> comes<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.100> graphical

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
especially when it comes to graphical

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.150 
especially when it comes to graphical
quality<00:03:05.880> versus<00:03:06.840> framerate<00:03:07.200> but<00:03:07.890> I<00:03:07.920> actually

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160

exploration and that may end up being a
terribly<00:05:29.430> boring<00:05:29.670> or<00:05:29.940> it<00:05:30.060> might<00:05:30.180> be<00:05:30.330> terribly

exciting or it might be somewhere in

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.610 
exciting or it might be somewhere in
between<00:05:32.640> but<00:05:33.270> if<00:05:33.360> this<00:05:33.480> delivers<00:05:33.960> even<00:05:34.080> on<00:05:34.590> a

like Daggerfall and Mara Wynne and

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.690 
like Daggerfall and Mara Wynne and
Skyrim<00:06:03.870> I<00:06:04.110> thought<00:06:04.650> to<00:06:04.830> myself<00:06:04.980> why<00:06:05.669> can't

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
Skyrim I thought to myself why can't

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.659 
Skyrim I thought to myself why can't
they<00:06:06.419> do<00:06:06.480> that<00:06:06.840> for<00:06:07.050> Legend<00:06:07.410> of<00:06:07.530> Zelda<00:06:07.950> and<00:06:08.070> now

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:08.669 
they do that for Legend of Zelda and now

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.750 
they do that for Legend of Zelda and now
they<00:06:09.030> finally<00:06:09.419> have<00:06:09.990> now<00:06:10.980> my<00:06:11.130> big<00:06:11.340> concern<00:06:11.640> of

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
they finally have now my big concern of

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.760 
they finally have now my big concern of
course<00:06:11.880> is<00:06:12.090> that<00:06:12.300> Nintendo<00:06:12.870> has<00:06:12.900> never<00:06:13.350> made<00:06:13.710> a

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
course is that Nintendo has never made a

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.460
