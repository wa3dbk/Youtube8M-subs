00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.530
 very good to all that such a sailor 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.539
 for me my point is and if you are looking 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.490
 a system for placing monitors in 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:14.680
 parallel today we present the proposal 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.590
 that offers us art and support for 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.660
 monitors z3 pro which allows us 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.310
 place up to a total of 3 monitors in 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.410
 parallel in a very simple way and 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.330
 ordered but also includes a series 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.970
 of very interesting functions which 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.140
 we will see in the following analysis 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.060
 we started with the part of a boxing 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.879
 try to yield them pro and as you can see 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.289
 the box is nothing small arctic it 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.690
 characterized by being a company 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:39.610
 respectful with the environment and this 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.829
 It is seen in the packing system 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.930
 which is compact and functional and how it 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.210
 appreciate the support was very good 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.950
 protected within this we remove the 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.469
 protective corks and the first thing that 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.030
 we see are two boxes that contain the 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.250
 rest of the support components 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.320
 monitor and these are accompanied by a manual 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.390
 of instructions we will proceed to take 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.100
 carefully the support arms of the 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.070
 monitor since they are large 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.629
 dimensions and considerable weight 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.670
 we remove the protective corks that 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.470
 has on both ends and with this already 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.590
 we have removed the monitor support 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.719
 arctic z 3 pro we pass below 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.000
 to see the rest of the components that came 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:18.369
 in the other two boxes in the first 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.140
 we found three clamping blades for 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.420
 place the monitors in the stand 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.750
 we also locate the feeder 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.939
 hub usb that has the z3 pro for another 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.860
 side we also find a base of 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.860
 aluminum alloy that in addition to 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.380
 include the hub usb has a thread 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.600
 to place the mast that will support the 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.700
 clamping arms below 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.679
 we found two bags that include 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.270
 all the necessary accessories for 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:44.950
 perform the installation of any 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.140
 monitor type compatible with the 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.360
 support and also to place so 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.060
 simple the arctic of theaters but to 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.250
 our table we finally have for a 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.099
 side the clamping tourniquet of the 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.409
 set of the stand to the table and also 

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:01.689
 the mast that will support the arms 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.179
 joining these with the base previously 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.950
 described and with this we conclude with the 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.259
 unboxing of the support for monitors 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.420
 arctic 103 pro 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.430
 as you can see the cetal is pro is a support 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.069
 for monitors really complete but 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.409
 let's see more in detail the support for 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.360
 monitors arctic iceta 3 pro flame the 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:21.760
 attention from the start both 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.860
 in dimensions as by its weight in color 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.659
 Matte black highlights the two big 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.159
 metal clamping arms for 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:29.019
 side monitors that are 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:31.090
 fully articulated and are 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.500
 united in the axis of the system place where 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.480
 is the support for monitor 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.879
 central with soft and rounded lines 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.920
 the support transmits a feeling of 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.780
 robustness since its structure is not 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.790
 light or discreet though once 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.859
 assembled will only be in our sight the 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.109
 basis of the set the resistance of the 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:48.790
 support is not questionable since it employs 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.340
 a structure that supports installation 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.560
 of three monitors up to 27 inches and 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.959
 a maximum weight of 30 kilograms of 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.409
 metallic material the base stands out for its 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.389
 4 usb 3.0 ports hub we found a 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:03.849
 connector on each side and another on the 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:05.440
 top clamping between the base 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.239
 and the monitors system the 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.849
 complete a cylindrical metal mast 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.099
 with a much more discreet silver finish 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.510
 that the other elements also have 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.480
 a plastic grommet for the 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.010
 central wiring 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.200
 to hide the rest of the cables from the 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.879
 side monitors or even cables 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.519
 of any peripheral connected to the pc 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.400
 the article is pro has a system 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.659
 subject to cables throughout its structure 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.519
 each of the sections of the arms of 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:30.739
 subject has embellishers 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.870
 plastic that have the mission to hold 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.370
 any cable that we want to place of 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.410
 so that these will be hidden from 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.599
 our eyesight and they will not be hanging by 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.980
 behind the table or the support 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.110
 we can forget to mention the possibility 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.030
 of rotating rotate and vascular to our 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.700
 I crave any of the three monitors 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.190
 we can take care of them and rotate them in all 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.930
 the directions and so adjust them from the 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.709
 most convenient way to our 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.420
 needs 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.370
 the possibilities are truly 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.349
 broad and will depend on each user 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.019
 has the system in the way that best suits you 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.970
 agree for a PC player the option 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.099
 more interesting is to have the system 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.049
 of three monitors jon horizontal one 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.420
 next to the other to extend the screen 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.040
 main to the laterals and thus have 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.319
 a much more gaming experience 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.690
 immersive in this way 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.639
 arctic support of theaters pro as a 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.079
 solution to keep in mind 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.420
 we come to the features part 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.970
 techniques and we see how the artist 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.310
 It has some very interesting functions and 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.230
 is that the afternoon arctic but far from 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.060
 being a simple support has a series of 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.160
 aspects to highlight as they are their 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.280
 dimensions that are 180 centimeters 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.990
 long 14 centimeters wide and 51 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.030
 centimeters of depth to which there are 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.400
 that add your weight that is around 8 with 2 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.380
 kilograms the main material of your 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.290
 structure is of aluminum aggregation 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.690
 abc 12 and supports monitors with support 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.150
 Standard vesa between 13 and 27 inches 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.010
 with a maximum weight pro monitor of 10 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.140
 kilograms and taking into account that the 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.360
 Support supports 3 monitors in parallel 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.270
 can support a total of 30 kilograms 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.850
 It also includes a hub with 4 USB ports 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.530
 with additional power system 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.570
 It holds cables for the wiring of the 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.760
 monitors or other elements and to 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.260
 finish remember we have all 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.300
 the necessary accessories for your 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.820
 installation and place any monitor 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.650
 compatible with the system and it's time 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.330
 of asking the question really deserves 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.970
 worth a stand of monitors like the 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.500
 arctic eta 3 pro we value different 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.570
 aspects such as the great management of 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.760
 space that offers compatibility with 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.280
 different types of monitors see your 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:31.040
 ordering system 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.840
 for 4 usb 3.0 ports that includes and the 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.210
 great regulation capacity offered 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.520
 we will find that something can turn out 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.890
 bulky and that needs a desk 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.690
 robust is for all that from game 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.480
 we grant to monitor support 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:47.450
 artist z3 pro our award of 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.250
 Platinum we recommend it and with this 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.110
 we conclude for today we hope that I have 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.970
 Antic teatre exploded so much 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.950
 like us a monitor support 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.450
 what we recommend you already know as always 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.920
 that the description of the video denies the 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.290
 link to the full analysis of it 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.880
 Victor Moreno for an insult is up 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.770
 the next 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.510
 If you liked the video, give me 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.820
 like and do not forget to tell us 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:11.440
 down do not miss more videos like this 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.440
