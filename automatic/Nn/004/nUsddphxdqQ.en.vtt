00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
give you guys a little update I had to

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.430 
give you guys a little update I had to
redo<00:00:41.250> all<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.489> water<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.510> sucked<00:00:43.020> if<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.290> did

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
redo all this water it sucked if I did

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.740 
redo all this water it sucked if I did
it<00:00:43.530> wrong<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.829> first<00:00:43.860> time<00:00:44.190> what<00:00:45.180> happened<00:00:45.600> is

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
it wrong the first time what happened is

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.900 
it wrong the first time what happened is
I<00:00:46.550> created<00:00:47.550> infinite<00:00:48.239> streams<00:00:49.160> by<00:00:50.160> not

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
I created infinite streams by not

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.700 
I created infinite streams by not
placing<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.539> what<00:00:51.719> what<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.020> needed<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.530> do

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
placing like what what I needed to do

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.700 
placing like what what I needed to do
one<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.640> redoing<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.570> by<00:00:54.750> placing<00:00:55.020> placing<00:00:55.620> in

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
one of redoing is by placing placing in

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.170 
one of redoing is by placing placing in
that<00:00:55.860> block<00:00:56.129> right<00:00:56.340> there<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.730> doing<00:00:56.910> all<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
that block right there and doing all the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.270 
that block right there and doing all the
way<00:00:57.270> across<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.170> created<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.649> one<00:00:58.980> row<00:00:59.160> of

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
way across so I created a one row of

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.410 
way across so I created a one row of
infinite<00:00:59.640> streams<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.120> went<00:01:00.300> out<00:01:00.390> and

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
infinite streams and I went out and

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.750 
infinite streams and I went out and
knocked<00:01:00.780> all<00:01:00.989> these<00:01:01.170> blocks<00:01:01.469> out<00:01:02.690> and<00:01:04.580> also<00:01:05.580> as

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
knocked all these blocks out and also as

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.380 
knocked all these blocks out and also as
esnc<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.330> used<00:01:06.570> half<00:01:07.670> half<00:01:08.670> blocks<00:01:08.970> right<00:01:09.150> there

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
esnc I used half half blocks right there

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.260 
esnc I used half half blocks right there
and<00:01:09.630> basically<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:11.070> because<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.970> monsters

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
and basically it's because the monsters

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.160 
and basically it's because the monsters
are<00:01:12.330> going<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.510> get<00:01:12.600> right<00:01:12.720> here<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.080> they're

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
are going to get right here and they're

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.230 
are going to get right here and they're
going<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.320> fall<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.680> top<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.280> there's

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
going to fall on top of it and there's

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.340 
going to fall on top of it and there's
not<00:01:15.450> going<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.630> be<00:01:15.689> anywhere<00:01:15.960> else<00:01:16.020> trigger

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
not going to be anywhere else trigger

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.510 
not going to be anywhere else trigger
them<00:01:16.560> because<00:01:16.860> they're<00:01:17.009> going<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.189> jump<00:01:17.400> in

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
them because they're going to jump in

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.190 
them because they're going to jump in
and<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.700> going<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.939> fall<00:01:18.210> back<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.600> there<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:21.200> you

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
and I going to fall back in there so you

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.810 
and I going to fall back in there so you
know<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.350> don't<00:01:22.860> know<00:01:22.920> if<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.130> makes<00:01:23.159> sense<00:01:23.580> or

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
know I don't know if that makes sense or

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.310 
know I don't know if that makes sense or
not<00:01:23.880> but<00:01:24.299> that's<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:24.810> what's<00:01:25.049> going<00:01:25.259> to

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
not but that's just what's going to

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.859 
not but that's just what's going to
happen<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.700> only<00:01:26.820> did<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.330> why<00:01:27.509> just

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
happen and I only did it to why just

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.810 
happen and I only did it to why just
because<00:01:28.460> any<00:01:29.810> they<00:01:30.810> can't<00:01:31.049> spawn<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.530> water<00:01:31.820> so

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
because any they can't spawn in water so

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.520 
because any they can't spawn in water so
any<00:01:32.970> farther<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.689> they're<00:01:33.840> not<00:01:33.930> gonna<00:01:34.140> spawn

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
any farther and they're not gonna spawn

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.429 
any farther and they're not gonna spawn
um<00:01:35.659> we've<00:01:36.659> got<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.900> little<00:01:36.990> bit<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.229> lag

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439

that's<00:03:36.010> been<00:03:36.280> requested<00:03:36.879> is<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:38.220> how<00:03:39.220> do<00:03:39.280> mine

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
that's been requested is the how do mine

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.539 
that's been requested is the how do mine
for<00:03:40.269> diamonds<00:03:40.449> and<00:03:40.989> i<00:03:41.979> think<00:03:42.280> i'm<00:03:42.370> going<00:03:42.459> to

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
for diamonds and i think i'm going to

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.509 
for diamonds and i think i'm going to
start<00:03:42.729> that<00:03:42.940> and<00:03:43.769> there's<00:03:44.769> there's<00:03:45.250> two

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
start that and there's there's two

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:46.860 
start that and there's there's two
different<00:03:45.669> techniques<00:03:45.940> basically<00:03:46.599> to<00:03:46.720> mine

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
different techniques basically to mine

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.960 
different techniques basically to mine
for<00:03:46.900> diamonds<00:03:47.229> efficiently<00:03:48.010> and<00:03:48.370> i'll<00:03:48.940> show

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
for diamonds efficiently and i'll show

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.830 
for diamonds efficiently and i'll show
that<00:03:49.479> it's<00:03:50.319> vertical<00:03:50.530> and<00:03:50.829> horizontal<00:03:51.840> mining

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
that it's vertical and horizontal mining

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.740 
that it's vertical and horizontal mining
basically<00:03:53.440> I'll<00:03:54.040> show<00:03:54.190> that<00:03:54.220> in<00:03:54.459> my<00:03:54.760> my

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
basically I'll show that in my my

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.830 
basically I'll show that in my my
largest<00:03:56.049> shaft<00:03:56.579> are<00:03:57.579> more<00:03:57.639> tight<00:03:58.150> I'm<00:03:58.449> so<00:03:58.629> kind

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
largest shaft are more tight I'm so kind

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.089 
largest shaft are more tight I'm so kind
of<00:03:58.900> get<00:03:59.019> done<00:03:59.139> with<00:03:59.290> this<00:03:59.319> project<00:03:59.620> I'm<00:03:59.979> going

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
to have to put walls I think I'm going

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.559 
to have to put walls I think I'm going
to<00:04:02.169> make<00:04:02.349> the<00:04:02.470> walls<00:04:02.849> like<00:04:03.849> the<00:04:04.030> walls<00:04:04.209> on<00:04:04.389> that

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
to make the walls like the walls on that

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.839 
to make the walls like the walls on that
side<00:04:04.870> not<00:04:05.590> like<00:04:05.859> basically<00:04:06.519> the<00:04:06.639> wall<00:04:06.819> that

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
side not like basically the wall that

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.879 
side not like basically the wall that
would<00:04:07.030> go<00:04:07.209> right<00:04:07.389> here<00:04:07.780> and<00:04:08.290> go<00:04:08.650> all<00:04:08.739> the<00:04:08.829> way

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
would go right here and go all the way

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.429 
would go right here and go all the way
up<00:04:09.069> I<00:04:09.400> think<00:04:09.849> we<00:04:09.909> have<00:04:09.939> to<00:04:10.120> make<00:04:10.239> it<00:04:10.439> either

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 
up I think we have to make it either

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:14.909 
up I think we have to make it either
stand<00:04:11.889> stone<00:04:12.189> or<00:04:12.340> sand<00:04:12.790> um<00:04:13.259> because<00:04:14.259> spiders

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:14.919 
stand stone or sand um because spiders

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.560 
stand stone or sand um because spiders
whatever<00:04:15.310> spiders<00:04:15.729> from<00:04:15.849> crawl<00:04:16.180> up<00:04:16.299> just<00:04:16.479> so

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
whatever spiders from crawl up just so

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.640 
whatever spiders from crawl up just so
that<00:04:16.690> they<00:04:16.810> want<00:04:16.989> to<00:04:17.049> be<00:04:17.109> able<00:04:17.169> to<00:04:17.289> get<00:04:17.380> up<00:04:17.470> here

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
that they want to be able to get up here

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.110 
that they want to be able to get up here
and<00:04:17.680> then<00:04:17.859> also<00:04:18.400> think<00:04:18.669> I'm<00:04:18.729> going<00:04:18.820> to<00:04:18.880> light

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
and then also think I'm going to light

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.180 
and then also think I'm going to light
it<00:04:19.150> up<00:04:19.419> and<00:04:20.039> fully<00:04:21.039> enclose<00:04:21.519> that<00:04:21.549> and<00:04:22.919> just<00:04:23.919> so

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
it up and fully enclose that and just so

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.370 
it up and fully enclose that and just so
that

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
that

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.660 
that
okay<00:04:26.250> basically<00:04:27.150> just<00:04:27.330> so<00:04:27.450> that<00:04:28.670> launches

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
okay basically just so that launches

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.190 
okay basically just so that launches
when<00:04:29.850> spun<00:04:30.090> on<00:04:30.210> top<00:04:30.420> and<00:04:30.690> they'll<00:04:30.840> just<00:04:30.990> spawn

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
when spun on top and they'll just spawn

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.180 
when spun on top and they'll just spawn
below<00:04:31.500> and<00:04:31.850> as<00:04:32.850> you<00:04:33.000> can<00:04:33.150> see<00:04:33.180> I<00:04:33.690> messed<00:04:34.650> up<00:04:34.950> an

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
below and as you can see I messed up an

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.210 
below and as you can see I messed up an
hour<00:04:35.310> a<00:04:35.340> lot<00:04:35.520> of<00:04:35.700> creeper<00:04:36.030> to<00:04:36.120> get<00:04:36.240> in<00:04:36.330> here<00:04:36.510> and

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
hour a lot of creeper to get in here and

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.460 
hour a lot of creeper to get in here and
actually<00:04:38.220> I<00:04:38.400> can<00:04:38.580> fix<00:04:38.760> that<00:04:38.940> right<00:04:39.000> now<00:04:39.470> messed

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470

think once i finish this and make making
sure<00:05:04.230> to<00:05:04.290> always<00:05:04.500> be<00:05:04.800> nighttime<00:05:05.010> it<00:05:05.730> would<00:05:05.820> be

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
sure to always be nighttime it would be

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.390 
sure to always be nighttime it would be
much<00:05:06.060> better<00:05:08.210> after<00:05:09.210> that<00:05:09.600> I<00:05:10.110> eventually<00:05:10.980> plan

much better after that I eventually plan

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.800 
much better after that I eventually plan
