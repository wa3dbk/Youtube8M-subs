they're both bench maids and this will

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.020 
they're both bench maids and this will
probably<00:00:32.730> look<00:00:33.500> easily<00:00:34.500> familiar<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.160> any

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
knife in general and definitely what I

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.140 
knife in general and definitely what I
would<00:01:21.259> consider<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.710> being<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.150> vague

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
would consider to being that vague

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.200 
would consider to being that vague
category<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.900> gentlemen's<00:01:25.799> folder<00:01:26.189> which<00:01:27.030> is

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
category of gentlemen's folder which is

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.700 
category of gentlemen's folder which is
again<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:28.100> top<00:01:29.299> criteria<00:01:30.299> for<00:01:30.600> for<00:01:31.020> my

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
again the top criteria for for my

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.780 
again the top criteria for for my
collection<00:01:32.930> so<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.229> some<00:01:34.710> specifics<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:35.670> uh

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
collection so for some specifics it's uh

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.249 
collection so for some specifics it's uh
it's<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.780> lock<00:01:36.960> back<00:01:39.110> drop<00:01:40.110> point<00:01:40.350> blade<00:01:41.210> really

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
it's a lock back drop point blade really

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.469 
it's a lock back drop point blade really
streamlined<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.820> sleek<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.960> steel<00:01:46.560> is

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
streamlined and sleek and the steel is

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.539 
streamlined and sleek and the steel is
it<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.600> called<00:01:48.869> d2<00:01:50.119> which<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> tool<00:01:51.930> steel

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
it is called d2 which is a tool steel

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.100 
it is called d2 which is a tool steel
from<00:01:53.549> what<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.790> understand<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.570> just<00:01:54.810> reading

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
from what I understand and just reading

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.929 
from what I understand and just reading
up<00:01:55.500> on<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:56.299> the<00:01:57.299> bench<00:01:57.450> main<00:01:57.719> site<00:01:58.369> I<00:01:59.369> guess

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
up on it on the bench main site I guess

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.600 
up on it on the bench main site I guess
it's<00:02:00.119> an<00:02:00.270> air<00:02:00.540> hardened<00:02:01.079> it's<00:02:01.409> as<00:02:01.590> an<00:02:02.280> air

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
it's an air hardened it's as an air

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.179 
it's an air hardened it's as an air
hardened<00:02:03.119> tool<00:02:03.329> steel<00:02:03.689> which<00:02:04.560> offers<00:02:04.979> good

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
hardened tool steel which offers good

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.219 
hardened tool steel which offers good
corrosion<00:02:05.579> resistance<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.659> excellent

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
corrosion resistance and excellent

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.290 
corrosion resistance and excellent
mileage<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.950> wear<00:02:08.220> resistance<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:09.090> good

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
mileage and wear resistance a good

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.380 
mileage and wear resistance a good
choice<00:02:09.479> for<00:02:09.539> hard<00:02:10.080> use<00:02:10.319> applications<00:02:11.239> so<00:02:12.239> it's

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
choice for hard use applications so it's

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.550 
choice for hard use applications so it's
got<00:02:12.510> some<00:02:12.540> stainless<00:02:13.260> steel

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
got some stainless steel

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.210 
got some stainless steel
properties<00:02:13.950> but<00:02:14.190> from<00:02:14.910> what<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.060> understand

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
properties but from what I understand

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.839 
properties but from what I understand
it's<00:02:17.220> not<00:02:17.400> completely<00:02:18.150> 100%<00:02:19.520> rust-proof<00:02:20.520> so

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
it's not completely 100% rust-proof so

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.140 
it's not completely 100% rust-proof so
it<00:02:21.569> should<00:02:21.750> definitely<00:02:21.840> be<00:02:22.140> taken<00:02:22.970> with<00:02:23.970> some

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
it should definitely be taken with some

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.770 
it should definitely be taken with some
care<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:24.870> it's<00:02:25.709> not<00:02:25.920> stored<00:02:26.310> with<00:02:26.780> any

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
care so that it's not stored with any

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.370 
care so that it's not stored with any
moisture<00:02:28.880> but<00:02:29.880> it's<00:02:30.000> very<00:02:30.319> it's<00:02:31.319> very

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
moisture but it's very it's very

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.520 
moisture but it's very it's very
handsome<00:02:31.709> is<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.130> as<00:02:32.760> I've<00:02:33.170> been<00:02:34.170> pointing

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
handsome is that as I've been pointing

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.040 
handsome is that as I've been pointing
out<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:36.660> rockwell<00:02:37.110> hardness<00:02:37.880> rating<00:02:38.880> is<00:02:39.239> 60

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
out the rockwell hardness rating is 60

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.479 
out the rockwell hardness rating is 60
to<00:02:40.200> 62<00:02:40.680> which<00:02:41.099> is<00:02:41.599> the<00:02:42.599> highest<00:02:42.870> i<00:02:43.560> think<00:02:44.160> that

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
to 62 which is the highest i think that

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.250 
to 62 which is the highest i think that

and you can just make up the spring on

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.870 
and you can just make up the spring on
the<00:03:10.380> inside<00:03:10.910> for<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:11.970> lock<00:03:12.209> back<00:03:12.420> mechanism
