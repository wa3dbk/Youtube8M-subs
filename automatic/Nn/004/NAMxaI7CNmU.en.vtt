I recommend it though the next thing
that<00:02:26.100> I<00:02:26.220> would<00:02:26.310> recommend<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:26.970> really<00:02:27.209> nice

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
that I would recommend is a really nice

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.510 
that I would recommend is a really nice
foot<00:02:27.810> moisturizer<00:02:28.350> or<00:02:28.560> foot<00:02:28.800> treatment<00:02:29.040> this

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
foot moisturizer or foot treatment this

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.250 
foot moisturizer or foot treatment this
is<00:02:29.670> one<00:02:29.819> from<00:02:29.970> exhibits<00:02:30.540> which<00:02:30.750> actually<00:02:31.110> does

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
is one from exhibits which actually does

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.440 
is one from exhibits which actually does
skin<00:02:31.560> care<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.069> this<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.520> called<00:02:32.819> heal<00:02:33.060> repair

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
skin care and this is called heal repair

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.150 
skin care and this is called heal repair
so<00:02:34.050> what<00:02:34.200> happens<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:34.650> when<00:02:34.920> I'm<00:02:35.010> done

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
so what happens is that when I'm done

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.890 
so what happens is that when I'm done
using<00:02:35.370> this<00:02:35.670> I'll<00:02:36.000> usually<00:02:36.150> put<00:02:36.480> this<00:02:36.660> on

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
using this I'll usually put this on

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.270 
using this I'll usually put this on
because<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.230> really<00:02:37.500> helps<00:02:37.739> to<00:02:37.890> lock<00:02:38.040> and

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
because it really helps to lock and

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.530 
because it really helps to lock and
