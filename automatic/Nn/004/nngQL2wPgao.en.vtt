00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609 
as far surfing is concerned I'd never

as far surfing is concerned I'd never
thought<00:01:36.969> of<00:01:37.179> that<00:01:37.289> that's<00:01:38.289> an<00:01:38.530> entirely<00:01:38.920> novel

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
thought of that that's an entirely novel

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.740 
thought of that that's an entirely novel
question<00:01:40.359> for<00:01:41.109> me<00:01:41.320> and<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:43.240> think<00:01:43.840> probably<00:01:44.439> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
question for me and I think probably the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.980 
question for me and I think probably the
legacy<00:01:46.750> will<00:01:46.929> go<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:47.200> something<00:01:47.890> like<00:01:48.130> this<00:01:48.810> uh

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
legacy will go to something like this uh

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.090 
legacy will go to something like this uh
