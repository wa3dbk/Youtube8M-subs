00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
up so you know just kind of practice

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.139 
up so you know just kind of practice
clicking<00:00:32.399> on<00:00:32.489> things<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.759> don't<00:00:32.820> even<00:00:32.910> have<00:00:33.090> to

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
clicking on things I don't even have to

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.729 
clicking on things I don't even have to
like<00:00:33.270> seriously<00:00:33.780> try<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.170> last<00:00:34.350> hit<00:00:34.620> all

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
like seriously try and last hit all

like seriously try and last hit all
those<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:35.190> probably<00:00:35.460> should<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:36.630> get<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
those we probably should to get the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.209 
those we probably should to get the
habit<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.440> see<00:00:37.649> for<00:00:37.800> example<00:00:38.070> I'm<00:00:38.129> gonna

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
habit of it see for example I'm gonna

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.069 
habit of it see for example I'm gonna
miss<00:00:38.430> one<00:00:38.640> there<00:00:38.879> but<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.899> know<00:00:39.989> I'm<00:00:40.050> just

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
miss one there but you know I'm just

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.900 
miss one there but you know I'm just
kind<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.350> clicking<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:41.040> sort<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.550> making<00:00:41.700> it

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
kind of clicking and sort of making it

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.639 
kind of clicking and sort of making it
hard<00:00:42.210> for<00:00:42.300> myself<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:42.870> general<00:00:43.230> I'm<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.500> lot

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
hard for myself in general I'm a lot

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.020 
hard for myself in general I'm a lot
more<00:00:43.680> harder<00:00:44.100> than<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.579> normally<00:00:44.850> click

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
more harder than it is to normally click

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.790 
more harder than it is to normally click
on<00:00:45.180> things<00:00:45.360> like<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.719> know<00:00:45.960> try<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.590> cancel

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
on things like I you know try and cancel

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.090 
on things like I you know try and cancel
the<00:00:47.160> Auto<00:00:47.309> Attack<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.940> stuff<00:00:48.090> like<00:00:48.210> that

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
the Auto Attack and stuff like that

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.889 
the Auto Attack and stuff like that
cancel<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.160> animation<00:00:50.420> I'm<00:00:51.420> not<00:00:51.660> really<00:00:51.750> sure

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
cancel the animation I'm not really sure

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.209 
cancel the animation I'm not really sure
what<00:00:52.020> that's<00:00:52.170> called<00:00:52.410> there's<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.680> name<00:00:52.890> for<00:00:52.920> it

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
on the screen watch my reflexes ones but

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.789 
on the screen watch my reflexes ones but
like<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.479> really<00:01:18.810> really<00:01:19.020> noticed<00:01:19.320> first<00:01:19.530> game

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
like I really really noticed first game

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.080 
like I really really noticed first game
of<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.950> day<00:01:19.979> especially<00:01:20.189> even<00:01:20.610> after<00:01:20.880> doing

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
of the day especially even after doing

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.359 
of the day especially even after doing
this<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.390> still<00:01:21.570> not<00:01:21.720> ideal<00:01:21.960> but<00:01:22.710> it's<00:01:22.830> gonna

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
this it's still not ideal but it's gonna

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.590 
this it's still not ideal but it's gonna
be<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> lot<00:01:23.850> better<00:01:24.030> than<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.420> would<00:01:24.570> be

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
be a lot better than it would be

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:32.240 
be a lot better than it would be
otherwise

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.590 

and<00:01:33.250> they'll<00:01:33.549> probably<00:01:33.729> keep<00:01:34.090> doing<00:01:34.360> this<00:01:34.420> to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
and they'll probably keep doing this to

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.179 
and they'll probably keep doing this to
like<00:01:34.780> take<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.170> tower<00:01:35.380> down<00:01:35.619> or<00:01:35.950> busy

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
like take the tower down or busy

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.039 
like take the tower down or busy
otherwise<00:01:36.430> feel<00:01:36.729> comfortable<00:01:37.270> with<00:01:37.840> what's

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
otherwise feel comfortable with what's

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:49.350 
otherwise feel comfortable with what's

this<00:02:53.379> is<00:02:53.530> how<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:53.680> like<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:53.980> mitigate<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.549> a

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
this is how I like to mitigate it a

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.270 
this is how I like to mitigate it a
little<00:02:54.909> bit<00:02:55.060> I'm<00:02:55.150> gonna<00:02:55.329> assume<00:02:55.709> no<00:02:56.709> I'm<00:02:56.829> not

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
little bit I'm gonna assume no I'm not

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.800 
little bit I'm gonna assume no I'm not
just<00:02:57.400> gonna<00:02:57.459> sue<00:02:57.669> I'm<00:02:57.849> gonna<00:02:58.120> definitively

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
just gonna sue I'm gonna definitively

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.270 
just gonna sue I'm gonna definitively
say<00:02:58.959> everyone's<00:02:59.470> first<00:02:59.739> game<00:02:59.980> is<00:03:00.099> always

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
say everyone's first game is always

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.190 
say everyone's first game is always
probably<00:03:00.760> going<00:03:01.120> to<00:03:01.209> be<00:03:01.299> weaker<00:03:01.930> than<00:03:01.959> their

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
probably going to be weaker than their

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.949 
probably going to be weaker than their
later<00:03:02.409> games<00:03:02.680> just<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.040> varying<00:03:03.489> degrees<00:03:03.959> in

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
later games just to varying degrees in

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.379 
later games just to varying degrees in
my<00:03:05.109> case<00:03:05.349> I<00:03:05.560> feel<00:03:05.799> this<00:03:06.010> really<00:03:06.310> helps<00:03:06.549> me<00:03:06.700> so

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
my case I feel this really helps me so
