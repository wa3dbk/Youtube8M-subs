 bad eye challenges every week 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.539

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.789
 that you are still a regular on your 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.529

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.970
 several theme challenges get up from the 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.679

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:26.289
 hidden cameras rejects invites the

 twenty or so hidden cameras 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.080

 trap people so I love yes they 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.059
 asked me to do that and then I 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.410
 accepted because I think with a good 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.239
 challenge and then only I know 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.100
 absolutely no challenges at each to 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.300
 every show a future you do that you 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.039
 go but I will not have the choice of the 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.140
 you do is very obviously the 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:46.120
 find in the wrong step but we see them 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.590
 images of subway hidden girl td 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.559
 Jeremy I like it too. 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.390
 challenges like or Sagem and had fun 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.719
 all and there would have been two weeks to 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.890
 trouble 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.420
 we met in front 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.520
 precisely when one does not do yes no 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.600
 me what did you answer some of 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.600
 my questions 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:08.410
 to relay really something to 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.440
 little says no it's too much it's going too far 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.090
 something not a martyr listening 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.680
 I do not eat tracks firstly 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.150
 it's not at all the actual pisses 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.770
 of amendments game peppers still that 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.020
 will not happen and then all that 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:25.810
 includes the nudity of keeping me anyway 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:27.310
 a little embarrassment no no not often my 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.560
 brave lady hides something but 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.300
 Jeremy is a morning show that we 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.940
 will not go into the industry but we go 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.900
 at 12 hockey tiempo the elite end 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.820
 italy doritos infernal chilli so 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.920
 difficult to answer my question while 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.870
 in August approach I tested the weight of 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.280
 this morning started j but more ahead 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.260
 the more it becomes picard 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.090
 yes but extremely same time that is 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:56.890
 what do not you do is because 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:59.979
 that you get up on fumes and I 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:05.860
 not support this game it's once I 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:07.330
 spent an end is one of balance sheets 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.310
 the world's strongest you ate a 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.740
 I had you literally 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.090
 gentlemen crying and then I would like my 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.130
 blonde my blonde who eat very very 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.300
 very spicy innovative modes I tell you 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.610
 believe not that it's so strong 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.140
 so we tried and after two spouses 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.030
 is more serious students who burned the 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.709
 car was not burning that I do not support 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.360
 and there is not so bad the land but it 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.050
 you really look nice to 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.640
 how are you 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.959
 no 2 still five minutes of 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.090
 chronicles so are you going higher 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.730
 wrong to ask you another question you say 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.500
 that you have no idea of ​​what 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.060
 that we see offering as challenge of which you 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.530
 do not talk at all about a meeting with 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.269
 patrick ten years we are not so 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.489
 to go fishing not with you for 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.050
 know what I would not like as I 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.730
 do now people are 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.290
 friendly on his paws they can 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.450
 admit like you in trouble in 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.010
 waiting with smes troubles on there 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.410
 sees slower resells his marines and 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.930
 more to deflect ips and then I will ask 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.950
 the second part which is this a small 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.330
 waze seed is good no no I love you 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.920
 see well so alain it's not water 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:14.500
 they drink milk or bread not 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:16.590
 but it's torres to those slots have 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.410
 nothing to 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:24.890
 that's it but I like that because any 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.890
 practice for just for laugh Sunday 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:34.140
 it's you want but the deficits is going 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.000
 aim at other comedians have advised the 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.110
 of the public who will be a summer victim 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.819
 it's a good question 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.379
 that to arrive I thank you for the 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.580
 pause and I made the answer to the 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.080
 answer is that that is exciting 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.620
 is that I do not absolutely know this 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.569
 what will happen 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.220
 barco forced to raise it a bit like 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.420
 gwen be 1 so we say I'm enjoying it 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.370
 you send me to the city of 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.190
 send me your shows will send 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.569
 anywhere where they will think it 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.890
 going to be fun and then I'll have to 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.970
 do not have the choice of course 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.440
 just for laughs would say it became 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.790
 a club can continue to eat because 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.510
 it's still morning games through 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.739
 rival 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.269
 it's a show that's been going on 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.980
 a few years is it a beautiful 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.420
 challenge for you to find yourself in this 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.769
 show yes it's a nice challenge 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.180
 I had made the last with others 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.220
 kind of capsule but as I love 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.569
 to beat people but yes and 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.250
 then and then patrick I think that's 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.810

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.609
