00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.420 
plug sounds with the whole groove and
the<00:01:59.780> bassline

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.890 

once<00:02:07.430> let's<00:02:07.820> listen<00:02:08.090> to<00:02:08.180> the<00:02:08.300> track<00:02:08.510> without

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:08.900 
once let's listen to the track without

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:14.860 
once let's listen to the track without
the<00:02:09.050> code<00:02:12.850> just<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:14.090> groove<00:02:14.300> and<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.690> bass

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
the code just the groove and the bass

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.260 
the code just the groove and the bass
and<00:02:15.770> when<00:02:15.980> you<00:02:16.070> put<00:02:16.250> on<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.490> chords<00:02:16.760> you<00:02:17.060> see

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
and when you put on the chords you see

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.610 
and when you put on the chords you see
how<00:02:17.420> much<00:02:17.600> difference<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:18.200> gives<00:02:18.410> it<00:02:18.590> just

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
how much difference it gives it just

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.470 
how much difference it gives it just
from<00:02:19.100> it<00:02:19.340> just<00:02:19.370> changes<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.060> whole<00:02:20.210> track

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
from it just changes the whole track

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.870 
from it just changes the whole track

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
this is a nice deep house track so let's

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:44.430 
this is a nice deep house track so let's
listen<00:02:36.140> to<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.350> once<00:02:36.560> again<00:02:36.710> with<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.460> corner

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.510 

well<00:02:45.440> what<00:02:45.620> I've<00:02:45.710> done<00:02:45.920> with<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:46.160> chord<00:02:46.400> is

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
well what I've done with the chord is

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.280 
well what I've done with the chord is
also<00:02:46.850> that<00:02:47.180> after<00:02:47.510> playing<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.900> chord<00:02:48.140> and

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
also that after playing the chord and

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.990 
also that after playing the chord and
then<00:02:48.380> slicing<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:48.920> up<00:02:49.070> and<00:02:49.280> using<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.760> sound

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
then slicing it up and using the sound

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000 
then slicing it up and using the sound
from<00:02:50.150> es2<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.810> play<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.290> chord<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:51.650> sounds

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
from es2 to play the chord it sounds

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.130 
from es2 to play the chord it sounds
really<00:02:52.580> nice<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:52.970> with<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.150> Mik<00:02:53.300> but<00:02:53.570> I<00:02:53.780> have

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
really nice and with the Mik but I have

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.870 
really nice and with the Mik but I have
processed<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.650> sound<00:02:54.890> like<00:02:55.400> I<00:02:55.520> told<00:02:55.700> you<00:02:55.820> I

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
processed the sound like I told you I

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.660 
processed the sound like I told you I
always<00:02:56.270> put<00:02:56.900> an<00:02:57.050> equalizer<00:02:57.470> on<00:02:57.590> my<00:02:57.830> sound<00:02:58.130> well

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
always put an equalizer on my sound well

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.330 
always put an equalizer on my sound well
I<00:02:58.700> wanted<00:02:59.150> I<00:02:59.570> would<00:03:00.140> not<00:03:00.440> say<00:03:00.560> I<00:03:00.680> wanted<00:03:01.100> it<00:03:01.220> but

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
I wanted I would not say I wanted it but

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.490 
I wanted I would not say I wanted it but
every<00:03:01.730> deep<00:03:01.970> house<00:03:02.210> track<00:03:02.600> when<00:03:03.050> the<00:03:03.170> chords

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
every deep house track when the chords

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.690 
every deep house track when the chords
are<00:03:03.650> played<00:03:03.680> of<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.070> pads<00:03:04.310> are<00:03:04.520> played

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
are played of the pads are played

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.980 
are played of the pads are played
they're<00:03:04.880> slightly<00:03:05.240> muffled<00:03:05.660> you<00:03:05.750> know<00:03:05.840> so<00:03:05.930> it

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
they're slightly muffled you know so it

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.330 
they're slightly muffled you know so it
gives<00:03:06.170> you<00:03:06.260> a<00:03:06.290> little<00:03:06.410> bit<00:03:06.530> of<00:03:06.620> a<00:03:06.709> dark<00:03:06.980> field

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
gives you a little bit of a dark field

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.980 
gives you a little bit of a dark field
so<00:03:07.850> what<00:03:08.000> I've<00:03:08.120> done<00:03:08.300> is<00:03:08.360> kept<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.810> low

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
so what I've done is kept the low

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.140 
so what I've done is kept the low
frequencies<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.709> way<00:03:09.860> they<00:03:10.040> are<00:03:10.130> but<00:03:10.520> just<00:03:11.030> to

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
frequencies the way they are but just to

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.850 
frequencies the way they are but just to
give<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:11.480> track<00:03:11.780> a<00:03:11.930> little<00:03:12.080> bit<00:03:12.320> more<00:03:12.530> volume

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
give the track a little bit more volume

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.980 
give the track a little bit more volume
a<00:03:13.220> little<00:03:13.550> bit<00:03:13.700> more<00:03:13.970> clarity<00:03:14.330> and<00:03:14.450> to<00:03:14.690> make<00:03:14.870> it

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
a little bit more clarity and to make it

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.900 
a little bit more clarity and to make it
you<00:03:15.200> know<00:03:15.320> a<00:03:15.500> sound<00:03:16.040> clean<00:03:16.430> when<00:03:16.790> you're

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
you know a sound clean when you're

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.520 
you know a sound clean when you're
listening<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:17.300> to<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:17.570> mix<00:03:17.780> I<00:03:17.900> have<00:03:17.930> increased

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
listening it to the mix I have increased

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.870 
listening it to the mix I have increased
the<00:03:18.650> highs<00:03:18.860> in<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.190> midst<00:03:19.489> of<00:03:19.520> the<00:03:19.640> track<00:03:19.850> a

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
the highs in the midst of the track a

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.290 
the highs in the midst of the track a
little<00:03:20.030> bit

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
little bit

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.890 
little bit
so<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:21.739> plucky<00:03:22.100> chord<00:03:22.370> has<00:03:22.970> got<00:03:23.270> low

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
so the plucky chord has got low

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.810 
so the plucky chord has got low
frequencies<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.590> way<00:03:24.739> they're<00:03:24.950> unchanged

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
frequencies the way they're unchanged

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.479 
frequencies the way they're unchanged
slightly<00:03:26.810> increased<00:03:27.260> mids<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:27.739> highs<00:03:27.830> in<00:03:28.370> the

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
slightly increased mids and highs in the

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.970 
slightly increased mids and highs in the
EQ<00:03:28.880> one<00:03:29.780> thing<00:03:29.959> which<00:03:30.080> I<00:03:30.200> like<00:03:30.350> to<00:03:30.380> use<00:03:30.680> again

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
EQ one thing which I like to use again

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.310 
EQ one thing which I like to use again
in<00:03:31.100> most<00:03:31.250> of<00:03:31.430> my<00:03:31.580> tracks<00:03:31.880> is<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.780> compressor

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
in most of my tracks is the compressor

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.290 
in most of my tracks is the compressor
that's<00:03:33.830> something<00:03:34.190> which<00:03:34.310> I<00:03:34.430> use<00:03:34.640> often<00:03:35.150> on

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
that's something which I use often on

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.360 
that's something which I use often on
and<00:03:35.480> practically<00:03:36.110> most<00:03:36.320> of<00:03:36.560> my<00:03:36.709> tracks<00:03:36.980> so

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
and practically most of my tracks so

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.710 
and practically most of my tracks so
I've<00:03:37.489> also<00:03:37.640> put<00:03:37.850> on<00:03:37.940> a<00:03:37.970> compressor<00:03:38.360> on<00:03:38.480> this

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
I've also put on a compressor on this

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.330 
I've also put on a compressor on this
track<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.290> compressor<00:03:39.680> basically<00:03:40.100> what<00:03:40.220> it

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
track the compressor basically what it

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.740 
track the compressor basically what it
does<00:03:40.370> it<00:03:40.700> it<00:03:40.790> just<00:03:40.940> gives<00:03:41.090> a<00:03:41.209> little<00:03:41.239> bit<00:03:41.570> of<00:03:41.660> a

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
does it it just gives a little bit of a

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.810 
does it it just gives a little bit of a
feel<00:03:42.050> and<00:03:42.230> it<00:03:42.500> brings<00:03:42.709> the<00:03:42.920> sound<00:03:43.190> out<00:03:43.400> there

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
feel and it brings the sound out there

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.479 
feel and it brings the sound out there
so<00:03:44.300> I've<00:03:44.570> used<00:03:44.630> a<00:03:44.870> compressor<00:03:45.350> as<00:03:45.500> well<00:03:45.860> on<00:03:46.040> the

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
so I've used a compressor as well on the

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.729 
so I've used a compressor as well on the
chords<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:47.110> another<00:03:48.110> thing<00:03:48.320> which<00:03:48.440> I've<00:03:48.560> done

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
chords and another thing which I've done

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:58.830 
chords and another thing which I've done
is<00:03:48.920> if<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:49.130> listen<00:03:49.459> to<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.670> sound<00:03:50.000> carefully

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.540 

the<00:03:59.840> sound<00:04:00.110> is<00:04:00.290> being<00:04:00.530> slightly<00:04:00.860> filtered

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
the sound is being slightly filtered

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.050 
the sound is being slightly filtered
let's<00:04:02.030> listen<00:04:02.360> to<00:04:02.480> this<00:04:02.630> in<00:04:03.010> solo<00:04:04.010> and<00:04:04.190> what

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
let's listen to this in solo and what

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.760 
let's listen to this in solo and what
you'll<00:04:05.210> notice<00:04:05.240> is<00:04:05.720> that<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:06.350> sound<00:04:06.590> is

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
you'll notice is that the sound is

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.040 
you'll notice is that the sound is
muffled<00:04:07.040> it<00:04:07.370> suddenly<00:04:08.000> becomes<00:04:08.420> clean<00:04:08.870> and

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
muffled it suddenly becomes clean and

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.630 
muffled it suddenly becomes clean and
then<00:04:09.350> it<00:04:09.440> goes<00:04:09.650> back<00:04:09.860> to<00:04:10.010> being<00:04:10.130> muffled<00:04:10.580> I

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
then it goes back to being muffled I

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.730 
then it goes back to being muffled I
have<00:04:10.940> used<00:04:11.270> a<00:04:11.420> filter<00:04:11.780> for<00:04:11.930> it<00:04:12.080> once<00:04:12.560> again

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
have used a filter for it once again

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.320 
have used a filter for it once again
like<00:04:13.070> I<00:04:13.190> told<00:04:13.370> you<00:04:13.459> friends<00:04:13.760> have<00:04:13.880> not<00:04:14.120> used

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
like I told you friends have not used

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.790 
like I told you friends have not used
anything<00:04:14.570> third-party<00:04:15.260> and<00:04:15.350> all<00:04:15.590> these

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
anything third-party and all these

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.520 
anything third-party and all these
filters<00:04:16.070> EQs<00:04:16.790> and<00:04:16.850> compressors<00:04:17.000> are<00:04:17.720> built<00:04:18.380> in

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
filters EQs and compressors are built in

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.620 
filters EQs and compressors are built in
with<00:04:18.739> Logic<00:04:19.070> Pro<00:04:19.100> X<00:04:19.280> so<00:04:19.880> let's<00:04:20.150> listen<00:04:20.420> to<00:04:20.510> the

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
with Logic Pro X so let's listen to the

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.590 
with Logic Pro X so let's listen to the
pluck<00:04:20.870> called<00:04:21.680> solo<00:04:22.280> and<00:04:22.550> see<00:04:22.970> how<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:23.210> filter

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
pluck called solo and see how the filter

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:30.390 
pluck called solo and see how the filter
sounds<00:04:23.870> with<00:04:24.020> it<00:04:26.410> in<00:04:27.410> it<00:04:27.500> getting<00:04:27.740> clear<00:04:29.290> and

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
sounds with it in it getting clear and

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.600 
sounds with it in it getting clear and
there<00:04:31.400> we<00:04:31.490> go<00:04:31.669> and<00:04:31.880> back<00:04:32.720> down<00:04:33.340> so<00:04:34.340> what<00:04:34.490> we've

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
there we go and back down so what we've

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.700 
there we go and back down so what we've
done<00:04:34.790> is<00:04:34.970> we've<00:04:35.120> made<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.510> track<00:04:35.750> muffled<00:04:36.500> all

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
done is we've made the track muffled all

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.890 
done is we've made the track muffled all
the<00:04:37.130> way<00:04:37.250> but<00:04:37.760> just<00:04:38.060> when<00:04:38.210> we<00:04:38.330> are<00:04:38.390> making<00:04:38.570> some

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
the way but just when we are making some

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.120 
the way but just when we are making some
change<00:04:39.200> in<00:04:39.350> the<00:04:39.440> track<00:04:39.620> you<00:04:39.740> know<00:04:39.770> like<00:04:39.980> how

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
change in the track you know like how

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.890 
change in the track you know like how
you<00:04:40.160> would<00:04:40.400> put<00:04:40.550> an<00:04:40.669> effect<00:04:41.090> instead<00:04:41.780> of

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
you would put an effect instead of

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.840 
you would put an effect instead of
putting<00:04:42.080> the<00:04:42.230> effect<00:04:42.590> I<00:04:42.740> just<00:04:43.160> use<00:04:43.310> the<00:04:43.460> filter

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
putting the effect I just use the filter

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.060 
putting the effect I just use the filter
to<00:04:43.880> take<00:04:44.419> it<00:04:44.570> higher<00:04:44.840> higher<00:04:45.320> make<00:04:45.650> it<00:04:45.800> clean

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
to take it higher higher make it clean

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.650 
to take it higher higher make it clean
give<00:04:46.340> it<00:04:46.460> those<00:04:46.610> high<00:04:46.850> frequencies<00:04:47.419> and<00:04:47.540> then

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
give it those high frequencies and then

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.390 
give it those high frequencies and then
suddenly<00:04:47.840> make<00:04:48.140> it<00:04:48.260> muffled<00:04:48.620> so<00:04:49.040> that<00:04:49.190> just

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
suddenly make it muffled so that just

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.350 
suddenly make it muffled so that just
shows<00:04:49.550> that<00:04:49.580> you<00:04:49.760> know<00:04:49.820> something<00:04:50.180> is<00:04:50.300> going

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
shows that you know something is going

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.180 
shows that you know something is going
to<00:04:50.540> happen<00:04:50.840> and<00:04:50.930> then<00:04:51.350> yes<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:51.680> next<00:04:51.919> sound<00:04:52.040> is

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
to happen and then yes the next sound is

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.420 
to happen and then yes the next sound is
introduced<00:04:52.640> so<00:04:53.320> with<00:04:54.320> the<00:04:54.470> cord<00:04:54.710> plugs<00:04:55.010> what

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
introduced so with the cord plugs what

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.240 
introduced so with the cord plugs what
we<00:04:55.610> have<00:04:55.820> is<00:04:56.030> the<00:04:56.419> ES<00:04:56.690> to<00:04:56.840> sound<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:57.740> equalizer

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
we have is the ES to sound the equalizer

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.850 
we have is the ES to sound the equalizer
the<00:04:58.940> compressor<00:04:59.510> and<00:04:59.720> last<00:05:00.470> but<00:05:00.650> not<00:05:00.800> the

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
the compressor and last but not the

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.500 
the compressor and last but not the
least<00:05:00.950> the<00:05:01.280> filter<00:05:01.700> which<00:05:02.120> gives<00:05:02.360> it<00:05:02.479> that

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
least the filter which gives it that

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.080 
least the filter which gives it that
nice<00:05:02.990> edge<00:05:03.229> to<00:05:03.290> the<00:05:03.710> sound<00:05:03.950> let's<00:05:04.760> listen<00:05:05.000> to

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
nice edge to the sound let's listen to

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.860 
nice edge to the sound let's listen to
the<00:05:05.210> whole<00:05:05.419> thing
