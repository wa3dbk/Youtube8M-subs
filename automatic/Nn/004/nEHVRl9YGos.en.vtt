00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.610
 Hello 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.399
 ah 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.490
 very good I am pray 115 good as 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.340
 you'll know you've just released a teaser trailer 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.900
 of the tlc 320 of black ops 2 with enough 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.490
 information that can be useful for us 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.550
 know more about the new map of 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.099
 zombies and notice that the dlc comes out on 2 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.160
 July on xbox a month later will come out on 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.840
 ps3 and pc I'm really sorry for it 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.420
 they will have to wait as they always do 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.340
 first of all I'm going to leave you in the background 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.110
 the parts of the trailer only the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.250
 zombie parts and while I'm going 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.380
 saying data that has been saying 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.630
 zielinski ivonne leave general data 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.060
 on the right and more specifically 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.430
 about zombie map they say that this tlc 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.470
 will contain the 4 multiplayer maps one 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.710
 of them is a remastering of the map 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.330
 samic of whites 1 and a zombie map a 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.460
 new zombie experience to which they have 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.079
 called barry accompanied by a 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.270
 evolution of the favorite weapon of the 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.710
 community they say is the raya martin 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.480
 we are going to structure the video of the 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.070
 follows because I really like to 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.600
 me the organization is worth so in 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.670
 first place let's talk about data 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.190
 general then the map areas 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.070
 exterior and interior history 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.920
 characters etcetera the enemies map the 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.380
 new erc the size of the map and weapons 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.060
 especially the stripe march and while I'm going 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.000
 talking about all this I will go too 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.400
 let's also go see the ideas and 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.350
 opinions on the interest of the pont del 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.270
 map and other things I hope you like it 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.579
 the video 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.890
 it is a map located in a 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.719
 forgotten western city what 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.429
 that has made stars according to zielinski 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.100
 has been to take any city at 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.409
 west and put it underground how can we 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.090
 see the zombies wear outfits from that of 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.860
 an underground city of the west 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.229
 forgotten in time citizens 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.990
 adventurers are all zombies the 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.869
 description offered by treyarch is 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.090
 Green players will face their 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.700
 biggest fears trapped in a city 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.689
 forgotten of the old west infected with 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.689
 waves of undead 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.600
 now talking about the physical map the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.700
 map alone it seems that it is a 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.860
 entire city we have both the streets 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.750
 to say it somehow external 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.370
 where there will be zones of lights and 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.200
 shadows through the gaps in the 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.760
 roof so it does not look like we're going to 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.770
 be very well the subsoil as 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.290
 we thought some but we will be 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.210
 about 20 meters away, no more 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.040
 it seems that we can also enter to almost 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.370
 all not to say all the buildings 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.110
 the little houses one thing to emphasize is that 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.480
 I said before the lights and the shadows 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.160
 it's daytime and it's an area that does not 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.810
 seems to have been very affected by the 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.300
 rockets although I do not know if we can get to 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.760
 go outside to check 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.530
 On the one hand I'm going to talk about the outside 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.470
 the outside looks like a desert area 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.810
 arid does not look like an underground 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.090
 artificial but natural and already there the 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.130
 citizens have built the city there 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.140
 even an area with graves as if 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.120
 outside a mini cemetery but I think that 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.560
 that area with grave is part of the yard 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.990
 of the main mansion from which now 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.820
 we will talk 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.400
 As for interior areas there is a 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.500
 tavern I think also here in this 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.390
 image are in a church or do not know if 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.460
 it's another part of the tavern before 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.290
 there is also a building with a balcony 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.970
 it could be like the town hall where 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.050
 was the mayor of the town if you 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.030
 you are going to have to go through 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.710
 some buildings like that town hall 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.330
 to go from area to area because 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.700
 there are obstacles that block some of 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.190
 the streets there is a candy store 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.310
 lollipops the sheriff's house and most 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.440
 surprising is how is this mansion of 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.090
 background that could be related to me 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.280
 I think it's largely related 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.500
 with interest, think maybe here 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.810
 we have to activate a last tower not 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.360
 and I do not know if the roof of the mansion that 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.580
 you are seeing protruding from the subway 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.590
 so he could have his peak out and 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.730
 could serve as a tower 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.290
 Also, if you notice the lights are 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.460
 turned on so I think this 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.040
 mansion is going to be important and 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.630
 possibly the axis of interest in 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.700
 As for other map data about 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.440
 characters and that the zombies have an eye 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.940
 blue is controlled by risto feng so 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.280
 that the events take place after 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.160
 die rise we control amnesty and marton 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.840
 samuel and rahman and according treyarch as in 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.830
 this map we will face 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.720
 our greatest 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.250
 they say we're going to learn a lot from 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.510
 these four characters may be 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.880
 learn more about your past or something 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.220
 focusing now the enemies 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.140
 specials I have not seen any enemy 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.490
 special apart from a survivor that 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.170
 Survivor is in the house 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.540
 of being and so it probably is 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.360
 a prisoner who before our arrival 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.670
 will miss open your cell and you can 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.410
 behave according to treyarch as 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.670
 enemy or you can also collaborate with 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.400
 us that is already our decision 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.780
 according to how we like it and I suppose 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.730
 that like all the novelties of each 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.220
 map will be part of some step of the icf 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.320
 tÃ©rek maybe to help maxis 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.200
 we have to kill him and to help 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.840
 risto henry not kill him or vice versa or 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.370
 maybe this guy allows us to access 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.320
 areas that we could not do without 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.150
 your help or something but come on maybe it's 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.910
 important to unlock some 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.830
 things to be able to do things from that map 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.530
 and other little things on the map now talking 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.080
 about new but there is a new drink 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.120
 It is shown three times in the trailer but 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.310
 in one of them the lid a zombie in another 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.780
 some tables and in another rahman although of 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.720
 moment although at a certain time 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.450
 we can stop the video and see it is a 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:23.720
 shaped drink if wide as the 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.730
 Tomtom tombstone drink with little lights 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.290
 the sides pinkish red and we do not know 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.090
 well still what it does but yes that 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.790
 is in that room that I said before that 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.350
 it was like a church but I do not think 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.180
 that is a church but as the part 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.070
 behind the restaurant or some 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.930
 Largest restaurant 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.610
 I do not know how big the map will be 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.650
 it does not look like it's going to be there either 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.910
 big even if it's a whole city not 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.190
 it is really a city but a 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.410
 village but as we have areas of 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.390
 exterior interior areas several floors 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.250
 and I even suppose I have the idea that 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.020
 in a house especially in the mansion 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.790
 let's go down to floors 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.250
 inferior because it is not so bad either 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:00.230
 even in the previous video I showed 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.300
 an image of von der haar's twitter 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.670
 where a zombie looked like in a 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.800
 narrow aisle of artificial mine a 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.540
 real mine made by humans by 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.610
 what maybe apart from this city 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.260
 underground there are other areas like a 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.130
 mine or maybe we can even go out to 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.130
 outside who knows 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.479
 another thing on the map now in relation to 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.120
 weapons is also spoken of a new 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:23.979
 martz root weapon and shoot bursts 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.020
 it seems to be and with much more power 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:28.599
 being able to traverse several omits one 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.909
 bullet but one important thing is worth this 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:32.889
 weapon can be used in any 

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:35.500
 of the white zombie maps 2 is 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:37.990
 say this is not the magic weapon the 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.909
 wonder weapon of Birditt but in 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.430
 there will be a weapon completely 

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:43.960
 different apart from this queen that 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.470
 we can use from now on all 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.600
 the maps as I said 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:52.080
 as for normal weapons it has been seen 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.610
 one in 1911 a p of w I do not know I'm not 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.140
 a lot of weapon I do not understand a lot of weapons 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.610
 but I think that no weapon has been seen 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.230
 different that we have not always had 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.870
 or in the box or on the walls so 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:03.120
 it will be the usual thing I suppose and nothing more in 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.340
 summarize an old west city with 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.680
 outdoor areas and houses as shops 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.270
 bars and a very mysterious mansion the 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.100
 four protagonists of trÃ nsit and die 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.750
 rice with many things to tell us a 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.360
 new enemy the sheriff's prisoner 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:17.220
 that can make friend or enemy a 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.690
 new drink and a weapon that has nothing 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.370
 what to do with berries but it will be 

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:23.550
 available on all maps the rai
