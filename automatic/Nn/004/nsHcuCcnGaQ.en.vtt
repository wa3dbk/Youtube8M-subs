functions are adjustable one hand but

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.620 
functions are adjustable one hand but
they're<00:03:59.600> not<00:03:59.750> really<00:04:00.530> vital<00:04:01.370> functions<00:04:02.330> like

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
they're not really vital functions like

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.840 
they're not really vital functions like

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
right here I'm just going to test out

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.670 
right here I'm just going to test out
the<00:04:07.190> HDMI<00:04:07.820> oh<00:04:07.850> you<00:04:08.180> can<00:04:08.330> see<00:04:08.510> right<00:04:08.720> now<00:04:08.900> it

the HDMI oh you can see right now it

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.810 
the HDMI oh you can see right now it
works<00:04:09.860> just<00:04:10.100> fine<00:04:10.280> if<00:04:10.460> you're<00:04:10.550> going<00:04:10.640> to<00:04:10.730> use

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
works just fine if you're going to use

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.360 
works just fine if you're going to use
this<00:04:10.910> for<00:04:11.090> an<00:04:11.150> HT<00:04:11.480> PC<00:04:11.900> it's<00:04:12.080> really<00:04:12.380> just<00:04:13.160> plug

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
this for an HT PC it's really just plug

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.580 
this for an HT PC it's really just plug
and<00:04:13.490> play<00:04:13.670> so<00:04:14.150> here's<00:04:14.360> a<00:04:14.420> video<00:04:14.660> stress<00:04:15.290> test

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
and play so here's a video stress test

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.470 
and play so here's a video stress test
this<00:04:15.710> is<00:04:15.890> a<00:04:15.920> little<00:04:16.730> clip<00:04:16.910> h<00:04:17.290> HD<00:04:18.580> 1080p<00:04:19.580> and<00:04:20.030> it

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
this is a little clip h HD 1080p and it

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.690 
this is a little clip h HD 1080p and it
spikes<00:04:20.810> up<00:04:20.989> to<00:04:21.140> 42<00:04:21.650> megabits<00:04:22.070> per<00:04:22.130> second<00:04:22.610> so

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
spikes up to 42 megabits per second so

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.180 
spikes up to 42 megabits per second so
this<00:04:22.820> is<00:04:22.970> really<00:04:23.680> stressing<00:04:24.680> the<00:04:24.950> video

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
this is really stressing the video

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.070 
this is really stressing the video
capabilities<00:04:25.880> and<00:04:26.090> of<00:04:26.150> course<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.630> core<00:04:26.930> i5

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080

here's a little gaming stress test and

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.510 
here's a little gaming stress test and
this<00:04:41.540> is<00:04:41.780> let<00:04:42.560> me<00:04:42.740> see<00:04:42.980> Battlefield<00:04:43.460> Bad

lowest settings possible and

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.940 
lowest settings possible and
unfortunately<00:04:50.780> it's<00:04:51.050> just<00:04:51.320> not<00:04:51.590> really

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
unfortunately it's just not really

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.740 
unfortunately it's just not really
playable<00:04:52.400> I<00:04:52.490> know<00:04:52.550> it<00:04:52.730> looks<00:04:52.910> kind<00:04:53.180> of<00:04:53.240> ok<00:04:53.570> on

this video but it's choppy as soon as

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.670 
this video but it's choppy as soon as
the<00:04:56.480> effects<00:04:56.930> go<00:04:57.080> here<00:04:57.290> I<00:04:57.320> am<00:04:57.470> in<00:04:57.590> a

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
the effects go here I am in a

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.080 
the effects go here I am in a
multiplayer<00:04:58.130> game<00:04:58.250> as<00:04:58.490> soon<00:04:58.640> as<00:04:58.730> the<00:04:58.790> guns

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
multiplayer game as soon as the guns

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.420 
multiplayer game as soon as the guns
start<00:04:59.390> firing<00:04:59.590> and<00:05:00.590> the<00:05:00.710> particle<00:05:01.100> effects

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
start firing and the particle effects

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.400 
start firing and the particle effects
and<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.640> dust<00:05:01.910> the<00:05:02.390> framerate<00:05:02.750> takes<00:05:03.110> a<00:05:03.230> hit

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
and the dust the framerate takes a hit

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.770 
and the dust the framerate takes a hit
and<00:05:03.650> you<00:05:03.830> can't<00:05:04.130> play<00:05:04.310> competitively<00:05:05.090> online

and you can't play competitively online

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.870 
and you can't play competitively online
so<00:05:06.290> maybe<00:05:06.560> you<00:05:06.710> can<00:05:06.800> play<00:05:06.919> single-player<00:05:07.340> but

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
so maybe you can play single-player but

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.970 
so maybe you can play single-player but
this<00:05:08.660> game<00:05:08.840> was<00:05:09.020> meant<00:05:09.200> for<00:05:09.260> online<00:05:09.620> play<00:05:09.800> of

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
better as well much smoother all that so

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:19.350 
better as well much smoother all that so
this<00:05:18.249> is<00:05:18.370> going<00:05:18.520> to<00:05:18.669> sort<00:05:18.849> of<00:05:18.879> wrap<00:05:19.030> up<00:05:19.210> my

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.920 
this is going to sort of wrap up my
review<00:05:19.539> as<00:05:20.349> you<00:05:20.409> can<00:05:20.650> see<00:05:20.830> the<00:05:20.979> unit<00:05:21.639> is<00:05:21.930> as

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
review as you can see the unit is as

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.869 
review as you can see the unit is as
this<00:05:23.050> minimalist<00:05:23.650> kind<00:05:24.069> of<00:05:24.159> understated<00:05:24.550> look

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:24.879 
this minimalist kind of understated look

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:27.510 
this minimalist kind of understated look
and<00:05:25.150> it's<00:05:26.050> much<00:05:26.379> nicer<00:05:27.009> than<00:05:27.189> the<00:05:27.249> other

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
and it's much nicer than the other

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.730 
and it's much nicer than the other
budget<00:05:28.419> 15-inch<00:05:28.930> notebooks<00:05:29.259> that<00:05:29.349> I<00:05:29.439> looked

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
budget 15-inch notebooks that I looked

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.920 
budget 15-inch notebooks that I looked
at<00:05:29.979> now<00:05:30.879> things<00:05:31.150> that<00:05:31.240> I<00:05:31.360> liked<00:05:31.599> about<00:05:31.719> this

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
at now things that I liked about this

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.689 
at now things that I liked about this
laptop<00:05:32.169> I<00:05:32.560> like<00:05:32.740> the<00:05:32.889> fact<00:05:33.129> that<00:05:33.249> it's<00:05:33.490> pretty

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
laptop I like the fact that it's pretty

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:36.269 
laptop I like the fact that it's pretty
powerful<00:05:33.939> it<00:05:34.719> has<00:05:34.870> a<00:05:34.900> Sandy<00:05:35.379> Bridge<00:05:35.560> Core<00:05:36.009> i5

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:36.279 
powerful it has a Sandy Bridge Core i5

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:38.730 
powerful it has a Sandy Bridge Core i5
processor<00:05:36.960> so<00:05:37.960> it's<00:05:38.379> going<00:05:38.560> to<00:05:38.620> handle

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
processor so it's going to handle

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.260 
processor so it's going to handle
everything<00:05:39.069> I<00:05:39.249> want<00:05:39.460> to<00:05:39.580> do<00:05:39.699> as<00:05:39.879> long<00:05:40.060> as<00:05:40.180> it

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
everything I want to do as long as it

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.059 
everything I want to do as long as it
doesn't<00:05:40.419> involve<00:05:40.719> heavy<00:05:40.960> gaming<00:05:41.499> what<00:05:41.860> I<00:05:41.889> also

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:42.069 
doesn't involve heavy gaming what I also

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:44.730 
doesn't involve heavy gaming what I also
really<00:05:42.400> liked<00:05:42.610> was<00:05:43.060> the<00:05:43.240> keyboard<00:05:43.779> and<00:05:44.020> the

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
really liked was the keyboard and the

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.800 
really liked was the keyboard and the
synaptics<00:05:45.400> trackpad<00:05:45.999> although<00:05:46.389> I<00:05:46.419> wish<00:05:46.629> the

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
synaptics trackpad although I wish the

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.510 
synaptics trackpad although I wish the
trackpad<00:05:47.020> was<00:05:47.289> a<00:05:47.319> little<00:05:47.620> bit<00:05:47.740> bigger<00:05:47.979> what<00:05:48.490> I

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
trackpad was a little bit bigger what I

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.580 
trackpad was a little bit bigger what I
really<00:05:49.210> didn't<00:05:49.479> like<00:05:49.599> was<00:05:49.779> laptop<00:05:50.199> was<00:05:50.439> the
