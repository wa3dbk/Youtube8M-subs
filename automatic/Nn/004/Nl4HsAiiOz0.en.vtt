00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.380 
hey guys it's Heather and I'm here to do
a<00:00:02.820> quick<00:00:03.000> review<00:00:03.750> on<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:04.470> Louis<00:00:04.799> Vuitton

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.390 
a quick review on the Louis Vuitton

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.169 
a quick review on the Louis Vuitton
small<00:00:06.390> agenda<00:00:07.130> I<00:00:08.130> believe<00:00:08.760> that<00:00:08.940> there's<00:00:09.120> a

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
small agenda I believe that there's a

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.120 
small agenda I believe that there's a
mini<00:00:09.480> size<00:00:09.780> which<00:00:10.050> is<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.200> smallest<00:00:10.620> so<00:00:10.950> this

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
mini size which is the smallest so this

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.270 
mini size which is the smallest so this
is<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.460> second<00:00:11.969> from<00:00:12.750> smallest<00:00:13.170> size<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.250> guess

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
is the second from smallest size I guess

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.470 
is the second from smallest size I guess

and such I was between this and the
medium<00:00:49.289> size<00:00:49.590> because<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:51.510> medium<00:00:51.840> size

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.510 
looked more practical for me especially

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
probably the best option the medium one

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.190 
probably the best option the medium one
was<00:01:36.720> very<00:01:37.259> nice<00:01:37.590> but<00:01:38.369> as<00:01:38.970> far<00:01:39.659> as<00:01:39.689> being<00:01:39.960> in

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.200 
was very nice but as far as being in
your<00:01:40.350> bag<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.890> takes<00:01:41.070> up<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.369> lot<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.549> space<00:01:41.909> and

your bag it takes up a lot of space and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.840 
your bag it takes up a lot of space and
this<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.869> perfect<00:01:43.110> size<00:01:43.619> like<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.070> mean<00:01:44.340> my

if those ones have a lid or not the

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.180 
if those ones have a lid or not the
Fisher<00:05:39.490> stowaway<00:05:40.389> pen<00:05:40.690> is<00:05:41.020> also<00:05:41.560> another<00:05:41.949> one

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
Fisher stowaway pen is also another one

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.700 
Fisher stowaway pen is also another one
that<00:05:42.250> fits<00:05:42.639> this<00:05:42.969> and<00:05:43.270> then<00:05:43.719> the<00:05:43.930> walky<00:05:44.229> pen

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710

lost<00:05:51.940> the<00:05:52.210> lid<00:05:52.419> and<00:05:52.569> then<00:05:52.690> they<00:05:52.840> had<00:05:53.050> the<00:05:53.620> pen

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
lost the lid and then they had the pen

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.159 
lost the lid and then they had the pen
in<00:05:54.069> the<00:05:54.099> little<00:05:54.520> that<00:05:55.029> they<00:05:55.060> had<00:05:55.479> it<00:05:55.659> in<00:05:55.779> here

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:56.169 
in the little that they had it in here

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.529 
in the little that they had it in here
but<00:05:56.409> you<00:05:56.680> know<00:05:56.800> it<00:05:56.860> was<00:05:56.979> without<00:05:57.279> a<00:05:57.310> top<00:05:57.669> so<00:05:58.210> I

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539 
but you know it was without a top so I

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:00.749 
but you know it was without a top so I
mean<00:05:59.110> it<00:05:59.380> would<00:05:59.650> stay<00:05:59.919> within<00:06:00.099> here<00:06:00.400> but<00:06:00.550> I

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 
mean it would stay within here but I

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:02.790 
mean it would stay within here but I
wouldn't<00:06:01.120> like<00:06:01.300> mine<00:06:01.569> that<00:06:01.599> way<00:06:01.930> and<00:06:02.199> then

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800

and<00:06:56.330> it<00:06:56.420> peels<00:06:56.780> so<00:06:57.500> for<00:06:58.130> something<00:06:58.430> that<00:06:58.790> I'm

00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:58.910 
and it peels so for something that I'm

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.990 
and it peels so for something that I'm
going<00:06:59.120> to<00:06:59.270> be<00:06:59.390> using<00:06:59.660> daily<00:07:00.410> I<00:07:00.790> wanted<00:07:01.790> this

going to be using daily I wanted this
and<00:07:02.330> I<00:07:02.840> think<00:07:03.230> I<00:07:03.380> chose<00:07:03.710> the<00:07:04.040> correct<00:07:05.530> refill

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:06.530 
and I think I chose the correct refill

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.970 
and I think I chose the correct refill
the<00:07:07.190> one<00:07:07.460> day<00:07:07.910> on<00:07:08.150> a<00:07:08.180> page<00:07:08.510> for<00:07:09.260> me<00:07:09.470> because<00:07:09.950> I

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:09.980 
the one day on a page for me because I

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.050 
the one day on a page for me because I
write<00:07:10.490> a<00:07:10.850> lot<00:07:11.690> I<00:07:11.810> write<00:07:12.200> very<00:07:12.230> big<00:07:12.710> and<00:07:13.580> there's

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.060 
write a lot I write very big and there's

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.670 
write a lot I write very big and there's
room<00:07:14.390> to<00:07:14.720> write<00:07:14.930> a<00:07:15.290> decent<00:07:16.040> amount<00:07:17.260> if<00:07:18.260> you

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.680 
room to write a decent amount if you

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.130 
room to write a decent amount if you
write<00:07:19.010> more<00:07:19.370> or<00:07:19.670> if<00:07:19.910> you<00:07:20.060> write<00:07:20.210> small<00:07:20.750> and

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:21.140 
write more or if you write small and

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.790 
write more or if you write small and
still<00:07:21.830> think<00:07:22.100> that's<00:07:22.370> not<00:07:22.580> enough<00:07:22.930> you<00:07:23.930> might

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800 
still think that's not enough you might

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.500 
still think that's not enough you might
want<00:07:25.040> to<00:07:25.100> get<00:07:25.190> the<00:07:25.340> medium<00:07:25.640> agenda<00:07:26.120> but<00:07:26.330> this

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:26.510 
want to get the medium agenda but this

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.750 
want to get the medium agenda but this
one's<00:07:26.750> sufficient<00:07:27.440> I've<00:07:27.980> also<00:07:28.250> seen<00:07:28.700> people

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:28.760 
one's sufficient I've also seen people

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.680 
one's sufficient I've also seen people
which<00:07:29.540> you<00:07:29.900> can<00:07:30.560> look<00:07:30.830> up<00:07:31.150> they<00:07:32.150> did<00:07:32.300> not<00:07:32.420> like

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:32.690 
which you can look up they did not like

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.450 
which you can look up they did not like
this<00:07:32.900> one<00:07:33.140> so<00:07:33.440> they<00:07:33.560> were<00:07:33.620> able<00:07:33.860> to<00:07:34.010> take<00:07:34.280> out

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:34.460 
this one so they were able to take out

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.520 
this one so they were able to take out
the<00:07:34.640> center<00:07:34.940> and<00:07:35.330> they<00:07:35.810> made<00:07:36.020> this<00:07:36.140> into<00:07:36.500> a

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:36.530 
the center and they made this into a

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.710 
the center and they made this into a
passport<00:07:36.890> cover<00:07:37.550> which<00:07:37.910> i<00:07:38.090> think<00:07:38.150> is<00:07:38.480> pretty

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 
passport cover which i think is pretty

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.400 
passport cover which i think is pretty
interesting<00:07:38.840> so<00:07:39.800> I<00:07:40.190> got<00:07:40.670> this<00:07:40.850> size<00:07:41.360> first<00:07:41.690> it

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:42.410 
interesting so I got this size first it

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:43.840 
interesting so I got this size first it
doesn't<00:07:42.590> work<00:07:42.800> out<00:07:42.980> I<00:07:43.220> can<00:07:43.430> make<00:07:43.520> it<00:07:43.640> into<00:07:43.730> a

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:43.850 
doesn't work out I can make it into a

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.460 
doesn't work out I can make it into a
passport<00:07:44.060> cover<00:07:44.510> and<00:07:44.690> get<00:07:44.810> the<00:07:44.900> medium<00:07:45.230> size

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:45.470 
passport cover and get the medium size

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:47.110 
passport cover and get the medium size
but<00:07:45.980> that's<00:07:46.130> pretty<00:07:46.370> much<00:07:46.490> it<00:07:46.700> guys<00:07:46.790> if<00:07:47.030> you
