00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
four interceptions for him and the loss

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.900 
four interceptions for him and the loss
to<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.779> bills<00:00:07.040> some<00:00:08.040> people<00:00:08.309> picked<00:00:08.519> it<00:00:08.670> some

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
to the bills some people picked it some

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.240 
to the bills some people picked it some
people<00:00:09.030> didn't<00:00:09.570> has<00:00:09.840> Tim<00:00:10.200> Tebow<00:00:10.590> been<00:00:10.800> exposed

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
people didn't has Tim Tebow been exposed

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.640 
people didn't has Tim Tebow been exposed
I<00:00:11.730> don't<00:00:12.540> think<00:00:12.719> it's<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:12.929> function<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.469> him

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
I don't think it's a function of him

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.959 
I don't think it's a function of him
being<00:00:13.889> exposed<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.400> think<00:00:14.580> during<00:00:14.880> this

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
being exposed I think during this

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.540 
being exposed I think during this
process<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:16.199> team's<00:00:16.500> played<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.220> lot<00:00:17.520> better

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
process the team's played a lot better

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.670 
process the team's played a lot better
and<00:00:18.090> they've<00:00:18.240> won<00:00:18.510> games<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.109> he's<00:00:19.260> gotten<00:00:19.590> a

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
and they've won games and he's gotten a

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.439 
and they've won games and he's gotten a
lot<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.890> credit<00:00:20.340> for<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.850> in<00:00:21.330> this

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
lot of credit for that and in this

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.269 
lot of credit for that and in this
situation<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:22.109> team<00:00:22.320> didn't<00:00:22.650> play<00:00:22.980> very<00:00:23.220> well

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
situation the team didn't play very well

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.340 
situation the team didn't play very well
and<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.580> don't<00:00:23.640> think<00:00:23.820> he<00:00:24.150> should<00:00:24.810> take<00:00:25.019> all<00:00:25.230> the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
and I don't think he should take all the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.240 
and I don't think he should take all the
blame<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.619> don't<00:00:25.769> think<00:00:25.920> he<00:00:25.980> should<00:00:26.160> have

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
blame I don't think he should have

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.620 
blame I don't think he should have
gotten<00:00:26.430> all<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.699> credit<00:00:27.029> during<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.359> streak

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
gotten all the credit during that streak

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.300 
gotten all the credit during that streak
and<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.230> don't<00:00:28.380> think<00:00:28.560> he<00:00:28.680> takes<00:00:28.890> all<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.279> blame

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
and I don't think he takes all the blame

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.299 
and I don't think he takes all the blame
here<00:00:30.410> it<00:00:31.410> was<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.590> punt<00:00:31.830> return<00:00:32.099> for<00:00:32.130> a

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
here it was a punt return for a

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.010 
here it was a punt return for a
touchdown<00:00:32.340> they<00:00:32.880> don't<00:00:33.059> kickoff<00:00:33.360> return<00:00:33.690> call

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
touchdown they don't kickoff return call

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.530 
touchdown they don't kickoff return call
back<00:00:34.290> out<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.829> defense<00:00:35.280> played<00:00:35.540> extremely

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
back out the defense played extremely

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.440 
back out the defense played extremely
well<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.960> one<00:00:37.200> thing<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.129> did<00:00:38.640> see<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.180> as

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
well the one thing that I did see is as

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.319 
well the one thing that I did see is as
he<00:00:40.140> holds<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.680> ball<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:41.940> trying<00:00:42.210> to

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
he holds the ball and and it's trying to

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.000 
he holds the ball and and it's trying to
make<00:00:42.480> plays<00:00:42.809> what<00:00:43.200> you're<00:00:43.379> gonna<00:00:43.500> get<00:00:43.770> and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
make plays what you're gonna get and

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.049 
make plays what you're gonna get and
this<00:00:44.129> isn't<00:00:44.309> going<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.610> change

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
this isn't going to change

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.639 
this isn't going to change
sometimes<00:00:45.840> he's<00:00:45.989> gonna<00:00:46.079> make<00:00:46.230> some<00:00:46.410> great

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
sometimes he's gonna make some great

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.139 
sometimes he's gonna make some great
plays<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:47.100> he<00:00:47.280> has<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.640> past<00:00:47.820> and

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
plays like he has in the past and

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.400 
plays like he has in the past and
sometimes<00:00:48.899> you're<00:00:49.020> gonna<00:00:49.110> get<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
sometimes you're gonna get the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.959 
sometimes you're gonna get the
interception<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.039> he<00:00:50.160> threw<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.879> know

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
interception that he threw you know

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.580 
interception that he threw you know
there's<00:00:51.390> one<00:00:51.750> where<00:00:52.110> he's<00:00:52.230> running<00:00:52.410> around

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
there's one where he's running around

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.619 
there's one where he's running around
for<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.949> long<00:00:53.250> time<00:00:53.610> you're<00:00:54.120> gonna<00:00:54.180> get<00:00:54.360> some<00:00:54.570> of

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
for a long time you're gonna get some of

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.939 
for a long time you're gonna get some of
these<00:00:54.690> strip<00:00:55.050> sacks<00:00:55.379> you're<00:00:55.530> gonna<00:00:55.649> get<00:00:55.770> some

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
these strip sacks you're gonna get some

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.340 
these strip sacks you're gonna get some
other<00:00:56.100> sacks<00:00:56.570> especially<00:00:57.570> coming<00:00:57.899> from<00:00:58.050> his

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
other sacks especially coming from his

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.200 
other sacks especially coming from his
Blind<00:00:58.710> Side<00:00:58.949> he<00:00:59.550> doesn't<00:00:59.850> have<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.969> great

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
Blind Side he doesn't have a great

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.660 
Blind Side he doesn't have a great
awareness<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.440> area<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.370> terms<00:01:02.579> of

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
awareness in that area so in terms of

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.219 
awareness in that area so in terms of
him<00:01:02.850> being<00:01:03.030> exposed<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.570> don't<00:01:03.809> think<00:01:04.019> that's

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
him being exposed I don't think that's

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.380 
him being exposed I don't think that's
the<00:01:04.350> that's<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.949> case<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.339> think<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.360> a

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
the that's the case I think this is a

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.450 
the that's the case I think this is a
young<00:01:06.780> developing<00:01:07.350> quarterback<00:01:07.890> who<00:01:08.220> is

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
young developing quarterback who is

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.070 
young developing quarterback who is
gonna<00:01:08.970> go<00:01:09.180> through<00:01:09.210> these<00:01:09.479> problems<00:01:09.750> maybe

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
gonna go through these problems maybe

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.929 
gonna go through these problems maybe
like<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.350> whole<00:01:10.500> team<00:01:10.740> was<00:01:11.040> excused<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.760> all

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
like the whole team was excused and all

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.200 
like the whole team was excused and all
right<00:01:12.060> pile<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.540> Jamel<00:01:16.310> this<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.520> what<00:01:18.060> it

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
right pile on Jamel this is what it

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.670 
right pile on Jamel this is what it
boils<00:01:18.240> down<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.659> when<00:01:19.049> you're<00:01:19.229> considered<00:01:19.619> a

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
boils down to when you're considered a

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.230 
boils down to when you're considered a
starting<00:01:19.950> quarterback<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.310> NFL<00:01:20.520> if<00:01:21.090> you're

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
starting quarterback in NFL if you're

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.249 
starting quarterback in NFL if you're
gonna<00:01:21.360> get<00:01:21.540> all<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.720> credit

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
gonna get all the credit

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.899 
gonna get all the credit
even<00:01:22.530> if<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.770> don't<00:01:22.950> necessarily<00:01:23.310> deserve

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
even if you don't necessarily deserve

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.760 
even if you don't necessarily deserve
all<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.180> credit<00:01:24.210> when<00:01:24.930> they<00:01:24.960> win<00:01:25.259> when<00:01:25.680> they

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
all the credit when they win when they

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.819 
all the credit when they win when they
lose<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.400> goes<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.970> goes<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.540> other<00:01:27.570> way<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.229> I

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
lose it goes it goes the other way and I

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.050 
lose it goes it goes the other way and I
don't<00:01:28.920> think<00:01:29.100> Denver<00:01:29.430> was<00:01:29.640> necessarily

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
don't think Denver was necessarily

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.090 
don't think Denver was necessarily
exposed<00:01:30.509> because<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.869> think<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.890> things
