at<00:03:54.190> natale<00:03:55.190> as<00:03:55.400> well<00:03:55.579> I<00:03:55.609> think<00:03:55.730> that<00:03:55.970> says

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
at natale as well I think that says

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.410 
at natale as well I think that says
other<00:03:56.810> than<00:03:56.989> that<00:03:57.549> nothing<00:03:58.549> all<00:03:58.760> that<00:03:58.819> great

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
other than that nothing all that great

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.539 
other than that nothing all that great
so<00:03:59.930> at<00:04:00.139> least<00:04:00.200> we<00:04:00.380> got<00:04:00.530> one<00:04:00.859> good<00:04:01.069> player<00:04:01.280> it
