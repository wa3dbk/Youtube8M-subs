00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:15.949
 the 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.460
 and here this time only to do that it remains to find for my 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.790
 first commented gameplay 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.070
 according to the coast team's lawyer 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.560
 while I hope you enjoyed this year and up 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.670
 present closed 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.670
 that the city is there 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.610
 you know and regarding the stars 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.540
 what you are going to see is really 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.770
 I sent this video call this is so I hope for once 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.829
 they go to the end of the pack and then I think I really have the level 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.010
 on the stone being given to the quality of my wheat guy 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.850
 so I'm not going to get too much into two topics since that's colavitti 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.700
 just released I will rather swing a little my impressions on the 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.280
 ball little things that I could test 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.720
 see the gt level at the beginning of this part there I am only at level 10 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.390
 hours 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.600
 the levels are going so slowly so I know a lot of things 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.020
 Meanwhile 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.070
 and there you saw that I did not break my head I took the first 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.700
 first soldier's weapon and I took the first very early in the summer 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.650
 dadis minutes sieving time revealing cgt this part 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.730
 so that's my life I do not remember anymore she's in the title of the ssii 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.070
 excuse me j 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.460
 and again for the global 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.460
 I just started my third and last title with the mastodons 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.100
 and I already have blues so who is the dog and the right then 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.070
 we are going to start 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.119
 by approaching the mapei team 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.500
 kruger it's due to patrols and kids 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:15.150
 I think I'm not too familiar with things so I do not really 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.299
 watched all 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.299
 so I develop it mastodon 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:33.369
 we had even accepted a what to say what 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.859
 heba rocket launcher 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:55.279
 likewise if 

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:58.279
 he is not 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.139
 the cac40 remains sequels if a year before and that remains useless 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.139
 Helen Mandroux the superb 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:22.189
 I'm a bit used to afp 

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:27.949
 simon but not too much because already his fans who lost foot to unlock it I 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:30.949
 believe I say no nonsense 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:41.119
 already at a nice series 5 be wary 

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:52.369
 so not the qinghai-tibet railway will not even believe me 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.939
 so I think it's flat 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:07.649
 baysse that you're direct here anyway worry 

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:10.649
 So here for the mastodon foucher success 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:36.619
 and I think I'll continue with it because I did 

00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:39.889
 for April 10 to the other for 100 e he is high 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.610
 and putting in pictures the bosses appreciated and I could super I got 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.580
 focused on standby 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.190
 on that one 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.190
 then at 24 zero 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:56.929
 so it's not the case to say for now it's not bad to the passage my 

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:59.929
 dear that a little who is so you see the chief executive who breaks 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:03.799
 if in addition we go directly 5 it turns out that it's a shame because the 

00:05:03.799 --> 00:05:05.559
 men of the profession not 

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:07.150
 a mortar or a 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.650
 is going a hit not a yard on one of these accounts 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.650
 after that it's my opinion that I'm going to change some 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.689
 tomic is not too worried dubai rather talk a little about the game 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:34.009
 most people are going to have to christmas 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.560
 I personally allow a surprise 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.560
 - exempted super proud 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:48.259
 I did a double like that at close range 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:53.689
 a famous shot he was carrying 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:03.930
 I remember that in his book is not too late 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.590
 in the wb years when someone was doing to satisfy that already a triple 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.350
 to the point a multitude we saw well the last symposium of tibet after 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.120
 have not sent very well in the mouse what I want to say to people 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.120
 the mark you know at the top left because the mini-map 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:35.139
 there charles 

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:46.589
 when sharia and six 

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:49.100
 to beat a comment too 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.009
 it is recommended to anyone 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:55.960
 and I tell you to approached his motherboards on stage at nantes 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.009
