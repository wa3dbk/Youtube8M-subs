00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 while some foods stimulate the 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.359
 cognitive function and improve memory 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.670
 others have a devastating effect on 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.580
 the brain knows 11 foods that 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.679
 annihilate your intelligence 1 products 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.260
 sweet sugar and sweet products 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.690
 They are not only bad for your waist but 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.880
 for brain function the consumption to 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.410
 long term sugar can create a 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.019
 a lot of neurological problems 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.510
 and affect memory by reducing the 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.970
 ability to learn avoids products 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.690
 precooked sugar corn syrup and 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.489
 foods with high fructose content 2 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.260
 alcohol is known that alcohol harms the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.239
 long-term liver but what does not 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.129
 you know is that it also causes what is 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.379
 know as brain fog a 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.690
 feeling of mental confusion that affects 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.570
 the ability to think clearly and the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.030
 thankfully these symptoms 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.039
 they are reversible whenever you stop 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.730
 drink alcohol or at least reduce the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.649
 consumption to one or two doses per week 3 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.719
 junk food a recent study of the 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.670
 University of Montreal revealed that the 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.100
 junk food changes the chemistry of the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.810
 brain generates symptoms associated with the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.520
 depression and anxiety 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.070
 to symptoms similar to those of the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.259
 abstinence also affects production 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.509
 of dopamine an important chemical that 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.850
 generates a sense of well-being and that 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.860
 supports cognitive function the ability 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.610
 of learning the motivation and 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.500
 memory 4 fried foods almost all 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.250
 processed foods contain 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.840
 chemical products coloring additives 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.060
 artificial flavors and preservatives 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.369
 that cause hyperactivity in children and in 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.320
 adults fried foods or 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.049
 processed slowly destroy the 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.450
 nerve cells of the brain some 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.399
 oils are more dangerous than others the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.640
 of sunflower is considered one of the 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.830
 most toxic 5 processed food or pre 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.439
 cooked just like food 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.909
 fried processed or precooked food 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.520
 it also affects the nervous system 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.679
 central and elevates the risk of developing 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.360
 a degenerative disorder of the brain in 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.990
 the future as the disease of 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.640
 alzheimer 6 very salty foods all 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.950
 we know that salty foods 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.989
 affect blood pressure and health 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.060
 cardiac but what you did not know is that 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.760
 can affect cognitive function and 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.680
 harm your ability 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.260
 Said otherwise salty foods 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.870
 affect your intelligence has been shown 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.790
 that the consumption of salty foods and 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.980
 nicotine have the same effects as 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.579
 drugs because they cause symptoms of 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.459
 Severe abstinence and cravings 7 cereals 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.900
 except whole grains all kinds of 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.970
 grains have an impact on the 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.159
 functioning of the brain and health 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.200
 in general except for whole grain 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:42.810
 rich in fiber and that prevent 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.909
 arterial aging if you consume 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.769
 regular grains your body runs the 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.690
 risk of aging faster and 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.450
 experience memory loss and 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.129
 mental confusion tries to change the 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.379
 regular carbohydrates by 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:58.829
 complex carbohydrates like oats and 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:00.299
 the barley 8 proteins processed the 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.489
 proteins are the blocks of 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.959
 building muscles and they are very 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.900
 important for the proper functioning 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.359
 of your body the meat is the richest 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.129
 high quality protein source but 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:13.650
 avoid the protein excessively 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.739
 processed like salami sausages and 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.870
 others opt for fish especially the 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.890
 tuna and salmon dairy products 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.770
 Nuts and seeds 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.020
 Avoid trans fats at all costs 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.450
 Trans fats do not just cause problems 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.400
 cardiac and obesity but are also 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.770
 bad for your brain since they do it 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.840
 Slow affect reflections and quality 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.480
 of response other than the risk of 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.820
 stroke if they are consumed during 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.010
 they can contract the brain for a long time 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.260
 something similar to the contraction caused 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.940
 for Alzheimer's disease this 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.040
 brain volume reduction is 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.770
 produces because trans fats harm 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.750
 the arteries 10 sweeteners 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.910
 artificial is true that the 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.130
 artificial sweeteners contain 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.890
 fewer calories than sugar but they do 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.290
 more harm than good if they are used during 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.470
 a long time can cause brain damage 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.430
 and interfere with your cognitive ability 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.790
 especially if you use large 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.800
 daily amounts 11 nicotine 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.690
 although nicotine is not really a 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.970
 food product damages the brain 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.489
 by restricting the flow of 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.470
 blood to this important organ together 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.080
 with the regular flow of glucose and 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.580
 oxygen the nicotine also affects the 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.290
 production and the function of 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.400
 neurotransmitters tightening the 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.500
 the capillaries 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.540
 the blood vessels that play a role 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.380
 fundamental when it comes to the 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.380
 brain function
