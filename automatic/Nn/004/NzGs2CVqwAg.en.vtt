00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
but it's doing very well so it's I think

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.290 
but it's doing very well so it's I think
we<00:00:42.870> have<00:00:43.079> done<00:00:43.260> quite<00:00:43.950> good<00:00:44.309> bikes<00:00:44.610> also<00:00:44.910> 30

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
we have done quite good bikes also 30

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.670 
we have done quite good bikes also 30
years<00:00:45.629> ago<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.079> also<00:00:46.620> 40<00:00:47.520> 50<00:00:48.030> 60<00:00:48.480> 70<00:00:48.930> 80<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.379> 90

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
years ago and also 40 50 60 70 80 and 90

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.869 
years ago and also 40 50 60 70 80 and 90
years<00:00:49.890> ago<00:00:50.750> of<00:00:51.750> course<00:00:52.079> there<00:00:52.350> are<00:00:52.550> around<00:00:53.550> 30

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
years ago of course there are around 30

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.270 
years ago of course there are around 30
years<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.420> between<00:00:54.890> engineering<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:56.010> course

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
years in between engineering of course

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.700 
years in between engineering of course
the<00:00:56.760> actual<00:00:57.180> products<00:00:57.690> are<00:00:57.840> much<00:00:57.989> faster<00:00:58.260> and

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the actual products are much faster and

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.950 
the actual products are much faster and
better<00:00:59.039> but<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.520> think<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.879> especially<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
better but I think in especially in the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.329 
better but I think in especially in the
in<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.440> heavy<00:01:02.370> off-road<00:01:03.110> the<00:01:04.110> GSC<00:01:04.530> are<00:01:04.890> 80<00:01:05.159> is

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
in the heavy off-road the GSC are 80 is

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.820 
in the heavy off-road the GSC are 80 is
doing<00:01:05.760> doing<00:01:06.720> as<00:01:06.900> well<00:01:07.140> as<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.439> other<00:01:07.590> ones

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
doing doing as well as the other ones

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.039 
doing doing as well as the other ones
because<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.340> quite<00:01:08.549> light<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.060> it's

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
because it's quite light and it's

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.469 
because it's quite light and it's
smaller<00:01:10.470> than<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.890> other<00:01:11.010> ones<00:01:11.250> but<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
smaller than the other ones but on the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.200 
smaller than the other ones but on the
roads<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:13.170> guys<00:01:13.350> was<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> new<00:01:13.860> one<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.580> faster

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
roads the guys was a new one on a faster

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.429 
roads the guys was a new one on a faster
but<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:15.930> think<00:01:16.170> it's<00:01:16.320> pretty<00:01:17.189> well<00:01:21.110> I'm<00:01:22.110> quite

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
but I think it's pretty well I'm quite

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.359 
but I think it's pretty well I'm quite
impressed<00:01:23.100> how<00:01:23.670> how<00:01:23.970> well<00:01:24.180> she<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.479> driving

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
impressed how how well she is driving

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.890 
impressed how how well she is driving
introduced<00:01:26.369> more<00:01:26.580> than<00:01:26.640> 20,000<00:01:27.630> there<00:01:27.750> night

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
introduced more than 20,000 there night

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.749 
introduced more than 20,000 there night
so<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.350> guess<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.920> there<00:01:29.100> are<00:01:29.220> still<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> lot<00:01:29.729> of

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
so I guess that there are still a lot of

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.999 
so I guess that there are still a lot of
them<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.810> owners<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.200> these<00:01:31.439> bikes<00:01:31.770> are

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
them and the owners of these bikes are

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.690 
them and the owners of these bikes are
taking<00:01:32.430> very<00:01:32.670> much<00:01:32.939> care<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.450> them<00:01:34.670> yeah<00:01:35.670> I

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
taking very much care of them yeah I

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.569 
taking very much care of them yeah I
