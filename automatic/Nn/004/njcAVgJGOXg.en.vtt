 Autism and learning 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.469
 force 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.890

 here these animals of sharp senses 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.620
 that usually dominate the ecosystem that 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.020
 they also have learned to live together 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.190
 and to participate in the rehabilitation of 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.320
 children we can go down to play with him 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.840
 nothing will happen to us the animals 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.640
 they are conditioning us we can 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.180
 work for them to be effective 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.980
 also the children are going to work 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.820
 socialization to go interacting 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.560
 better above all to fix your attention 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.780
 therapists parents and felines 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.540
 form equipment to rehabilitate children 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.280
 with autism and learning problems 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.860
 in all fop diagnostics 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.460
 we favor what integration to 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.869
 psychological social level and above all 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.700
 will help us in the effectiveness and 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.950
 sensitivity of children we know that 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.590
 there are diagnoses such as autism that 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.210
 the affective part is blocked this is 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.070
 just one of the functions of this 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.400
 Great sanctuary 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.610
 where tigers panthers leopards live 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.070
 pumas and lions but this is nothing more than 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.270
 the result of bond affection 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:49.420
 affective we have with animals 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.420
 of little baby scream of 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.439
 and that affective bond has been reflected 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:57.090
 in reproducing hundreds of them 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.979
 that we have been so successful in the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.719
 reproduction of felines that we achieved 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.299
 have a reproduction rate of almost 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:07.020
 100 cats per year and the ingredient 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.209
 unique as mysterious as it could be 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.970
 seem or extraordinary simply the 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.640
 animal affection is of incredible strength and 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.440
 skill revered predators that today 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.040
 they face a battle against 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.049
 extinction of its species 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.359
 the functions the zoos preserve 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:26.420

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:28.790
 the three functions and share these 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.620

 this zoo has created a bank 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.670
 genetic to guarantee continuity 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:39.220
 in the reproduction of felines 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.720
 we have genetic material to distribute 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.800
 to other zoos and even others 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.830

 begins to gain ground in front of his 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.000
 possible extinction
