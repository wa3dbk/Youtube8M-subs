00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
able to do this should be very very

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.400 
able to do this should be very very
simple

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
simple

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.800 
simple
alright<00:02:12.620> so<00:02:13.400> let's<00:02:13.730> go<00:02:13.880> ahead<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:14.090> put<00:02:14.630> our

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
alright so let's go ahead and put our

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.800 
alright so let's go ahead and put our
next<00:02:15.350> 26<00:02:15.710> because<00:02:16.100> that's<00:02:16.250> what<00:02:16.400> this<00:02:16.460> is<00:02:16.520> for

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
next 26 because that's what this is for

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.150 
next 26 because that's what this is for
into<00:02:17.810> bootloader<00:02:18.020> mode<00:02:18.260> so<00:02:18.590> we<00:02:18.710> can<00:02:18.860> run<00:02:18.980> the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
into bootloader mode so we can run the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.660 
into bootloader mode so we can run the
flesh<00:02:19.400> off<00:02:19.580> alright<00:02:20.830> so<00:02:21.830> here's<00:02:22.010> my<00:02:22.070> nexus<00:02:22.430> 6

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
flesh off alright so here's my nexus 6

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.190 
flesh off alright so here's my nexus 6
i'm<00:02:22.910> going<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.150> go<00:02:23.240> ahead<00:02:23.270> it's<00:02:23.750> powered<00:02:24.080> off

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
i'm going to go ahead it's powered off

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.110 
i'm going to go ahead it's powered off
already<00:02:24.470> i'm<00:02:24.860> going<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.100> go<00:02:25.190> ahead<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:25.730> hold

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
already i'm going to go ahead and hold

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.940 
already i'm going to go ahead and hold
volume<00:02:27.850> down<00:02:28.850> and<00:02:29.270> power<00:02:29.620> this<00:02:30.620> is<00:02:30.740> going<00:02:30.890> to

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
volume down and power this is going to

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.430 
volume down and power this is going to
put<00:02:31.550> me<00:02:31.580> into<00:02:31.850> the<00:02:32.030> bootloader<00:02:32.240> there<00:02:33.200> it<00:02:33.320> is

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
put me into the bootloader there it is

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.470 
put me into the bootloader there it is
right<00:02:33.470> there<00:02:33.710> is<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.070> bootloader<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.670> then

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
right there is the bootloader and then

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.440 
right there is the bootloader and then
from<00:02:36.020> here<00:02:36.550> you<00:02:37.550> got<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.760> make<00:02:37.880> sure<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.210> have

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
an unlocked bootloader so right here it

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.490 
an unlocked bootloader so right here it
says<00:02:40.340> device<00:02:40.850> is<00:02:41.180> unlocked<00:02:41.750> status<00:02:42.260> code

says device is unlocked status code

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.890 
says device is unlocked status code
three<00:02:42.860> that's<00:02:43.610> very<00:02:43.880> important<00:02:44.390> that<00:02:44.870> you

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
have it unlocked bootloader because

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.030 
have it unlocked bootloader because
otherwise<00:02:46.160> you<00:02:46.340> cannot<00:02:46.580> flash<00:02:46.880> this<00:02:47.180> firmware

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
otherwise you cannot flash this firmware

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.230 
otherwise you cannot flash this firmware

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770 
actually connect for in fastboot so

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:19.870

we're going to do a reboot bootloader

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.219 
we're going to do a reboot bootloader
really<00:04:20.359> quickly<00:04:20.720> with<00:04:21.169> a<00:04:21.200> plug-in<00:04:21.530> and

really quickly with a plug-in and

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.550 
really quickly with a plug-in and
sometimes<00:04:24.229> what<00:04:24.380> I<00:04:24.410> find<00:04:24.680> is<00:04:24.860> fast<00:04:25.280> food

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
sometimes what I find is fast food

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.990 
sometimes what I find is fast food

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
and start working instantly there you go

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.110 
and start working instantly there you go
it<00:04:27.150> did<00:04:27.330> work<00:04:27.510> so<00:04:28.200> from<00:04:28.980> here<00:04:29.130> just<00:04:29.370> let<00:04:29.910> it<00:04:30.030> go

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
it did work so from here just let it go

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.610 
it did work so from here just let it go
it's<00:04:30.300> going<00:04:30.419> to<00:04:30.510> do<00:04:30.630> a<00:04:30.660> couple<00:04:30.870> reboots<00:04:31.350> here

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
it's going to do a couple reboots here

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.220 
it's going to do a couple reboots here
it<00:04:32.160> flashes<00:04:33.060> the<00:04:33.180> bootloader<00:04:33.540> it<00:04:33.690> does<00:04:33.870> reboot

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
it flashes the bootloader it does reboot

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.680 
it flashes the bootloader it does reboot
your<00:04:34.380> flashes<00:04:34.860> I<00:04:34.889> think<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.250> radio<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:36.180> it

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
your flashes I think the radio and it

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.720 
your flashes I think the radio and it
does<00:04:36.870> a<00:04:36.900> reboot<00:04:37.350> you<00:04:37.530> can<00:04:37.680> see<00:04:37.889> that<00:04:37.919> also<00:04:38.490> and

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
does a reboot you can see that also and

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.450 
does a reboot you can see that also and
then<00:04:39.480> it's<00:04:40.080> going<00:04:40.260> to<00:04:40.350> go<00:04:40.470> ahead<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:41.010> flash

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
then it's going to go ahead and flash

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.490 
then it's going to go ahead and flash
boot<00:04:42.360> recovery<00:04:42.990> system<00:04:43.919> cache<00:04:44.760> user<00:04:45.389> data<00:04:45.780> all
