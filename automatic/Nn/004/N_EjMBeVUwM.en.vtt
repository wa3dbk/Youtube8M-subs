00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
underneath my bare minerals and I've

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.780 
underneath my bare minerals and I've
seen<00:01:46.740> really<00:01:46.950> great<00:01:47.159> results

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
seen really great results

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.700 
seen really great results
but<00:01:48.270> like<00:01:48.390> I've<00:01:48.540> said<00:01:48.780> I've<00:01:49.049> also<00:01:49.259> been<00:01:49.500> using

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
but like I've said I've also been using

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.280 
but like I've said I've also been using
it<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.070> its<00:01:50.250> own<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:51.119> it's<00:01:51.750> pretty<00:01:51.930> rare<00:01:52.259> for

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
it on its own and it's pretty rare for

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.929 
it on its own and it's pretty rare for
me<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.710> feel<00:01:52.829> confident<00:01:53.369> going<00:01:53.490> out<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:53.850> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
me to feel confident going out in the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.149 
me to feel confident going out in the
world<00:01:54.119> not<00:01:54.630> needing<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.020> wear<00:01:55.290> foundation<00:01:55.860> and

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
world not needing to wear foundation and

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.670 
world not needing to wear foundation and
this<00:01:56.640> gives<00:01:56.850> me<00:01:56.939> just<00:01:57.270> enough<00:01:57.450> coverage<00:01:58.049> that

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
this gives me just enough coverage that

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.010 
this gives me just enough coverage that
I<00:01:58.740> feel<00:01:59.100> like<00:01:59.399> my<00:01:59.579> skin<00:01:59.850> looks<00:01:59.880> okay<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.899> it's

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
I feel like my skin looks okay and it's

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.469 
I feel like my skin looks okay and it's
not<00:02:01.200> as<00:02:01.469> heavy<00:02:01.920> as<00:02:02.070> some<00:02:02.549> tinted<00:02:02.729> moisturizers

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
not as heavy as some tinted moisturizers

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.270 
not as heavy as some tinted moisturizers
are<00:02:03.689> like<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.229> feel<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:04.409> tinted<00:02:04.710> moisturizers

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
are like I feel like tinted moisturizers

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.300 
are like I feel like tinted moisturizers
are<00:02:05.490> almost<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:06.060> middle<00:02:06.450> ground<00:02:06.689> where<00:02:07.310> you

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
are almost that middle ground where you

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.029 
are almost that middle ground where you
get<00:02:09.179> some<00:02:09.509> coverage<00:02:10.020> but<00:02:10.259> it's<00:02:10.410> not<00:02:10.560> enough

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
get some coverage but it's not enough

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.470 
get some coverage but it's not enough
coverage<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:11.700> your<00:02:11.849> skin<00:02:12.060> doesn't<00:02:12.239> really

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
coverage so your skin doesn't really

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.210 
coverage so your skin doesn't really
look

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
look

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.550 
look
but<00:02:13.580> they<00:02:13.700> feel<00:02:14.150> like<00:02:14.540> foundation<00:02:15.170> so<00:02:15.470> you

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
but they feel like foundation so you

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.560 
but they feel like foundation so you
have<00:02:15.800> that<00:02:15.980> heaviness<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.880> you<00:02:17.270> don't<00:02:17.450> have

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
have that heaviness and you don't have

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.210 
have that heaviness and you don't have
the<00:02:17.750> weightless<00:02:18.080> feeling<00:02:18.470> of<00:02:18.740> you<00:02:18.980> know<00:02:19.070> no

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
the weightless feeling of you know no

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.160 
the weightless feeling of you know no
