00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.750
 good these attached to a new video 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.490
 well then details about the new 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.169
 hell you already know in the hells that 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.280
 it will be called second are and good that 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:13.140
 basically it will be like saying a title 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.350
 of launch of playstation 4 we have 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.390
 are 4 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.240
 presumably this year good we will have 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.610
 a temper on this June 3 in monkey that 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.230
 say of the game you already know to be seems to be 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.730
 that the game will pass a 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.230
 kind of universe for summer like 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.730
 has also happened in this last of irma 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.680
 and basically the main character 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.900
 will be a young American with the appearance 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.570
 carefree and his name will be without 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.280
 good row it seems that this time 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.560
 the protagonist will like it very much 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.350
 its power not quite the opposite with what 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.910
 went with cold that basically because the 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.600
 I hated I did not want to have that weight that 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.609
 responsibility 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.269
 those powers do not by some means not 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:55.160
 I wanted to have them because everyone played 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.780
 in firm giving them currently are 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.210
 Total and recommended players you see 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.949
 it's exclusive to playstation 3 and for me 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.629
 It is one of the best not to say so 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.640
 the way because it offers you a lot 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.110
 you were offered many things 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.049
 that maybe other games do not 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.450
 offer we will have more before more variety 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.520
 of powers and attacks no more than 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.470
 what we had the previous games the 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.049
 electricity will not be the only one 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.060
 the only power that we will have seems to us 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.470
 that we can also handle the smoke of 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.350
 done almost by the beginning of the game 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.819
 apparently it will be seen that maybe 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.369
 can handle the smoke by throwing bombs 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:31.759
 smoke doing all sorts of things with 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.860
 a monkey we can also throw balls of 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.289
 fire or teleport even 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.880
 I guess that will be a little bit more 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.470
 limited they basically wanted to give 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.510
 of sants 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.970
 air I do it to what is the title not a 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.850
 little more renewed with many more attacks 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.130
 with much more variety not the subject 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.810
 main game will basically be that 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.690
 everything is very controlled by police and 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.650
 it seems that even 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.930
 they will meddle too much what life is 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.610
 deprived of the population and such and not 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.740
 will let you do certain things that 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.450
 usually by itself they let you do the 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.600
 main protagonist also of the sinn 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.220
 he will be a lover of urban style 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.230
 of urban art you already know graffiti and 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.240
 this kind of thing the color something not 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.910
 we have a dress very similar to the 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.590
 that we would have on the streets they are 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.760
 the typical graffiti artists and such with 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.290
 little is not going to have an air that is going to 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.570
 I like it a lot because I like it a lot 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.520
 that style so good nothing else 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.490
 you have new images also in the 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.900
 description I'll put them also are 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.000
 images that come from the magazine 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.800
 gameinformer and good is a images that 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.060
 I do not know if they are employment not because if they are 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.250
 gameplays are totally fucking 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.790
 amazing, you know it will be style 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.409
 sandbox within the limits no 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.849
 just not nothing more kids I all and 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:46.090
