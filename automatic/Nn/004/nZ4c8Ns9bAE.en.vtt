beyond the current LTE the addition
we're<00:00:35.280> looking<00:00:35.520> at<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.730> voice<00:00:36.000> over<00:00:36.329> LTE

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
we're looking at the voice over LTE

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.479 
we're looking at the voice over LTE
which<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.469> on<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.649> big<00:00:37.829> challenges<00:00:38.340> are

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
which is on the big challenges are

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.459 
which is on the big challenges are
making<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.820> work<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.210> real<00:00:39.329> world<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:40.350> we

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
making it work in the real world so we

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.020 
making it work in the real world so we
have<00:00:40.590> several<00:00:40.890> demonstrations<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.850> voice

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
have several demonstrations of voice

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.360 
have several demonstrations of voice
over<00:00:42.360> LTE<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:43.290> some<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.590> key<00:00:43.770> technologies

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
over LTE and some the key technologies

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.029 
over LTE and some the key technologies
involved<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:45.120> making<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.660> work<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
involved in making that work so the

testing<00:01:04.290> for<00:01:04.710> lte-advanced<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:06.180> means<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
testing for lte-advanced this means the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.270 
testing for lte-advanced this means the
next<00:01:06.810> generation<00:01:07.260> technology<00:01:07.890> is

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
next generation technology is

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.670 
next generation technology is
implemented<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.299> proven<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.409> we<00:01:10.530> can

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
implemented and proven and we can

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.469 
implemented and proven and we can
demonstrate<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.460> higher<00:01:11.700> data<00:01:11.970> rates<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
demonstrate the higher data rates of the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.480 
demonstrate the higher data rates of the
new<00:01:12.659> technology<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.799> we're<00:01:13.920> able<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.310> show

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
new technology so we're able to show

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.420 
new technology so we're able to show
today<00:01:14.850> 300<00:01:15.750> megabits<00:01:16.170> data<00:01:16.560> rate<00:01:16.860> download

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
today 300 megabits data rate download

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.210 
today 300 megabits data rate download
using<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.479> standard<00:01:18.990> using<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.770> technique

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
using this standard using the technique

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.880 
using this standard using the technique
known<00:01:20.729> as<00:01:20.790> carrier<00:01:21.330> aggregation<00:01:21.710> so<00:01:22.710> here<00:01:22.860> we

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
known as carrier aggregation so here we

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.090 
known as carrier aggregation so here we
set<00:01:23.159> up<00:01:23.250> two<00:01:23.490> separate<00:01:24.119> carriers<00:01:24.540> each<00:01:25.100> 150

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
set up two separate carriers each 150

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.980 
set up two separate carriers each 150
megabits<00:01:26.490> downlink<00:01:26.939> aggregate<00:01:27.810> them

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
megabits downlink aggregate them

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.080 
megabits downlink aggregate them
together<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.920> as<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.100> net<00:01:29.310> data<00:01:29.579> rate<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
together so as a net data rate to the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.569 
together so as a net data rate to the
user<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.780> 300<00:01:31.320> megabits<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.400> easily

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
user of 300 megabits and this is easily

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.670 
user of 300 megabits and this is easily
seen<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.270> Analects<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.600> equipment<00:01:34.140> where

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
seen on the Analects of equipment where

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.749 
seen on the Analects of equipment where
we<00:01:34.799> shoe<00:01:35.040> show<00:01:35.640> two<00:01:35.909> separate<00:01:36.590> 150<00:01:37.590> megabit<00:01:38.009> 20

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
we shoe show two separate 150 megabit 20

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.550 
we shoe show two separate 150 megabit 20
megahertz<00:01:39.030> carriers<00:01:39.659> running<00:01:40.409> together

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
megahertz carriers running together

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.520 
megahertz carriers running together
simultaneously<00:01:41.540> so<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.659> now<00:01:42.869> gives<00:01:43.140> us<00:01:43.380> a

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
simultaneously so this now gives us a

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.859 
simultaneously so this now gives us a
non-contiguous<00:01:44.689> carrier<00:01:45.689> aggregation

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
non-contiguous carrier aggregation

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.200 
non-contiguous carrier aggregation
technique<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.729> carrier<00:01:48.060> aggregation

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
technique so this carrier aggregation

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.499 
technique so this carrier aggregation
shows<00:01:49.020> us<00:01:49.320> how<00:01:49.950> carriers<00:01:50.430> can<00:01:50.670> overcome<00:01:51.360> the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
shows us how carriers can overcome the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.719 
shows us how carriers can overcome the
problem<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:51.990> bandwidth<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.070> capacity

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
problem of bandwidth and capacity

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.429 
problem of bandwidth and capacity
because<00:01:54.540> now<00:01:54.689> they<00:01:54.869> can<00:01:55.020> use<00:01:55.200> two

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
because now they can use two

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.740 
because now they can use two
simultaneous<00:01:56.219> pieces<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.700> spectrum<00:01:57.210> to

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
simultaneous pieces of spectrum to

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.719 
simultaneous pieces of spectrum to
service<00:01:58.079> one<00:01:58.110> user<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:59.130> give<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.399> double<00:01:59.700> the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
service one user and give you double the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.730 
service one user and give you double the
data<00:01:59.969> rate<00:02:00.299> on<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:01.020> network

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
data rate on the network

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.799 
data rate on the network
