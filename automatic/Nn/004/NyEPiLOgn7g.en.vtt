00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:41.109
 piercing half the side of the 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:44.309
 covers with the help of the tongs for 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.309
 avoid injuring us 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:01.060
 a pair of the caps will be pierced by 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:04.239
 both sides and the third one only 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:08.850
 already perforated continues painting with 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.850
 white paint and we wait for it to dry 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.070
 dry the lids with a pointed brush 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.070
 thin I will make your face 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.760
 with black paint I will make some points 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.310
 that will be eyes and mouth 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.760
 the eyes will be in a couple of more points 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.760
 big 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.740
 and for the mouth score in the form of v 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.190
 in the second stage I'll do a couple of 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.190
 points 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:15.080
 and also with the third one in such a way 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:18.140
 that are more or less aligned 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.410
 with the orange paint I will realize its 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.620
 forget the good pulse because 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.880
 here the shape of the nose you can make it 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.880
 followed 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.040
 inserted the thread into the needle let's go 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.340
 joining the covers by the perforations 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.550
 what we did at the beginning doing several 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.550
 knots 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:09.299
 I am the only nile because personally 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:11.329
 This makes your marriage stronger 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:15.109
 you can use any other glue 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.109
 resistant of your preference 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.640
 with the felt I will cut one more picture 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.170
 larger than the diameter of the cap 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:34.159
 I will hit at eye level and cut 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.159
 giving it a hat shape 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.300
 If you do not have a good pulse at the moment of 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:55.330
 cut you can first draw it on the 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.330
 felt and then cut it 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:06.840
 with the thin red ribbon decorate the 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.840
 hat sticking this around 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:16.040
 and the decorated ribbon will wrap it 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.040
 simulating a scarf and I'll stick 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:36.860
 with him clean black pipes we will make 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:40.350
 handyman we calculate the size and cut 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:44.760
 also with the remainder we cut some 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.970
 smaller sections and join twisting 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.970
 the 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:03.509
 ready the little hands we will stick them to the 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:06.960
 sides giving it a nice touch 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:09.319

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:20.540
 again I will give a stitch and cancel 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:23.320

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.320
 stick it 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:40.099
 to finish you can place a 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:43.429
