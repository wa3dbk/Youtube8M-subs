just wasn't too happy with it it wasn't

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.520 
just wasn't too happy with it it wasn't
the<00:00:57.309> focus<00:00:58.309> it<00:00:59.239> was<00:00:59.359> a<00:00:59.420> soft<00:00:59.660> focus<00:00:59.960> it<00:01:00.230> wasn't

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
the focus it was a soft focus it wasn't

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.139 
the focus it was a soft focus it wasn't
a<00:01:00.559> hard<00:01:00.769> crisp<00:01:01.190> focus<00:01:01.579> that<00:01:01.670> I<00:01:01.730> was<00:01:01.910> looking

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
a hard crisp focus that I was looking

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.140 
a hard crisp focus that I was looking
for<00:01:02.829> so<00:01:03.829> I<00:01:04.159> went<00:01:04.400> ahead<00:01:04.519> and<00:01:04.640> sent<00:01:04.879> that<00:01:05.030> one

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
for so I went ahead and sent that one

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.030 
for so I went ahead and sent that one
back<00:01:05.330> but<00:01:06.200> i<00:01:06.230> did<00:01:06.590> did<00:01:07.070> keep<00:01:07.340> this<00:01:07.580> sigma

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
back but i did did keep this sigma

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.100 
back but i did did keep this sigma
70-300<00:01:10.040> millimeter<00:01:10.700> lens<00:01:11.000> and<00:01:11.300> the<00:01:11.330> main

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
70-300 millimeter lens and the main

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.670 
70-300 millimeter lens and the main
reason<00:01:12.140> is<00:01:12.650> because<00:01:13.160> i<00:01:13.310> already<00:01:13.460> had<00:01:13.820> a<00:01:14.090> 72<00:01:15.050> 300

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
reason is because i already had a 72 300

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.250 
reason is because i already had a 72 300
with<00:01:15.920> canon<00:01:16.310> but<00:01:16.850> this<00:01:17.120> is<00:01:17.360> just<00:01:17.480> built<00:01:17.960> a

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
with canon but this is just built a

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
with canon but this is just built a
hundred<00:01:19.010> times<00:01:19.220> better<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:20.150> internal<00:01:20.990> motor

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
hundred times better the internal motor

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.880 
hundred times better the internal motor
mechanisms<00:01:22.280> are<00:01:22.460> a<00:01:22.520> lot<00:01:22.730> better<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.780> it<00:01:24.500> just

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
mechanisms are a lot better and it just

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.920 
mechanisms are a lot better and it just
uh<00:01:24.980> whenever<00:01:25.460> you're<00:01:25.790> continuously<00:01:26.360> focusing

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
uh whenever you're continuously focusing

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.040 
uh whenever you're continuously focusing
on<00:01:27.020> action<00:01:27.410> you<00:01:28.010> can<00:01:28.130> just<00:01:28.280> hear<00:01:28.790> the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
on action you can just hear the

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.900 
on action you can just hear the
difference<00:01:30.050> equality<00:01:30.680> so<00:01:31.400> I<00:01:31.430> went<00:01:31.640> ahead<00:01:31.730> and

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
difference equality so I went ahead and

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.550 
difference equality so I went ahead and
stuck<00:01:32.510> with<00:01:32.630> this<00:01:32.780> one<00:01:33.280> and<00:01:34.690> as<00:01:35.690> promised<00:01:36.500> i

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
stuck with this one and as promised i

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.780
