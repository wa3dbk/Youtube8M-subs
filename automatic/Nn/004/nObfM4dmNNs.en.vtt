00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.940
 Hmm 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.180
 me 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.870
 Bolt on turbo system 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.950
 to n engine 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:36.299
 Equipped with turbo and turbo based 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:40.030
 Lower compression based on legacy components 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:47.590
 I made a pain and used it 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:49.810
 All set to achieve an output such as over 400 horsepower with a boost 1.2 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:54.620
 Let's install it on the vehicle 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:58.970
 I'm feeling the engine Normal fa 22 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:07.180
 a was in the state with the turbo attached, but not at all 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:07.180
 There are things of great good feeling because acceleration feeling from the easy to the other ride is heard 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.720
 Double zr spec c 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.590
 Of budget specifications 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.470
 Damping force 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.290
 Spring rate 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.030
 full length 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.810
 I installed it with fear here and came to shakedown 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.230
 It is Betan type 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:33.670
 In a great heroine of adjustment range 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.670
 I think it will be better and better just to put the damping of the damper 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:10.630
 Where I think the country of Fukuba is the most difficult 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:12.710
 This in a state that say little or also with slope in this corner or slanted 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.069
 I can not go straight to the brakes 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.670
 In that sense 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.340
 Brake control performance there 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.510
 Needed 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.510
 There are many parts 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.690
 this time 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:33.040
 That input 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:38.219
 It is impossible to say that the caliper has a great basilica and control is also high. 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.219
 I think that thanks to the brakes is a great passing score 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:48.120
 We are developing the front bumper installed this time on the premise of commercialization. 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.360
 Characteristics of Kurijo 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.890
 I think about the priority design 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.220
 In addition, the injection of the outside air 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:00.420
 Hole that can be done efficiently 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.420
 We have added processing 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.100
 Leaves of most stallion was impressed today 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:13.810
 There was no trouble 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:16.650
 In that sense there is no trouble in terms of the engine and no problems at all in the footsteps or driveline 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.660
 Also not trouble at all 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.000
 The fact that we could run the whole session 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:26.220
 that 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:30.500
 Well and parts to the user's is to thing really good considering that the feedback 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.500
 It is a part that I thought was wonderful 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.260
 About the engine 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:40.500
 Both the output durability is very firmly out 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.770
 Run for a day without trouble 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:48.580
 The data that can be dried and connected to here is the first 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:53.750
 I think that it was the very harvest of today that it was able to be taken 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:05:00.490
 After all, with a high target but I think that there is no easy 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:00.490
 I think if you finish the real z towards there
