00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hi it's marco dr von today 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.810
 small video presentation of a 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.639
 smartphone accessory a little 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.200
 particular you're going to see it it does not 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.700
 This is not a case is not a case 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.809
 shell 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.070
 But yet of course the brand 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.660
 our dreams the brand does not dream that I have 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.070
 already had the opportunity to present 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.480
 many times a brand that 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.340
 makes cases anyway it's 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.600
 like that we knew that they are 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.560
 clearly top-of-the-range cases 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.000
 is clearly on a mark that is 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.340
 positioned in the high end with 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.080
 productions very very well done in 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.019
 sometimes leather some of its products 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.279
 his handmade leather work in France 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.290
 but anyway all 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.870
 products are handmade 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.950
 so that's a peculiarity and on 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.000
 products that are so clearly or 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.500
 two guys one is always in a 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.090
 high-end environment acer than 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.129
 when we do not receive the box we are in 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.050
 one in a spirit of branding we have 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.190
 this is really breathing I say it for 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.719
 the tenth time but it breathes the top 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.340
 range but we are on the accessory 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.840
 quite particular so I just came 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.460
 to receive the box I already had 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.030
 the opportunity to see the accessories that 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.530
 I will show you today 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.120
 previously but here I come just 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.780
 to receive this version it's time 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.879
 so we see you present it 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.379
 so the box just put 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.640
 books and necessarily when she 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.530
 arrives it comes in the form of 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.090
 envelope envelope bull was 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.049
 extremely well protected so this is where 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.750
 that the box that already protects 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.010
 the accessory is itself protecting that 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.810
 it's the first thing is protected in 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.360
 a bubble envelope as usual 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.860
 the case is itself protected 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.790
 famous box is protected in a bag 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.259
 plastic 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.000
 it's to tell you the attention to detail 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.080
 of the mark that is to say that it is 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.580
 typically the kind of box that you 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.960
 could you be able to offer the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.610
 gift like no need lamballe 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.619
 and I just need to do that 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.810
 I'm here, it's really typically the 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.150
 kind of gift products to be made or 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.680
 to do is then once one withdraws 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.810
 the little plastic bag in which 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.090
 rightly found that the box 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.220
 box that is in jpeg format and a 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.570
 stupidity lid and then finally no I do not 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.829
 do not know put me in the put me 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.869
 that suddenly in the commentary 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.640
 if I'm wrong I think it's a 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.100
 format vote holster really covered 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.630
 we are in the spirit of the brand 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.040
 it's always the same thing of a box 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.250
 cardboard but which is a kind of decoration 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.360
 a little leather sewing elsewhere he 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.520
 must know that it is part of 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.840
 ranges of leather that are treated by our 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.670
 schedules a range there is even a range 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.719
 sewing 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.590
 so we find the marking our dreams 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.380
 the logo our dreams 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.700
 ok furmark saint tropez 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.690
 it is marc tropÃ©zienne the wii since 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.880
 its French brands which is based in 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.170
 saint tropez they changed logo he 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.849
 not very long ago and there are 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.959
 people a pretty cool blog on which they 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.680
 are afraid of the brand regularly I 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.970
 find it nice 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.890
 that's a little logo 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.150
 extra of our dreams then 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.489
 little peculiarity one is on a 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.410
 product which is called the name dream 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.630
 pad for alger nexus 5 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.530
 lg nexus 5 it's not specifically 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.300
 alger nexus 5 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.130
 it's just the size of the phone 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.330
 nexus 5 he might have had to call him 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.660
 otherwise they may have had to call 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.830
 our dreams pad lsx she finally good million 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.510
 of heads had to do a specific thing there 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.989
 on yes so there is a small form 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.420
 you will see him 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.130
 lg nexus 5 but it's still ok 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.730
 a lot of other color phones 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.620
 indigo 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.530
 because that's the level it's at home 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.790
 a beautiful gold color the accessory is 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.709
 always packed in his little bag 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.709
 a year under in his little pouch 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.060
 so I remember bubble wrap that 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.560
 protects the box that itself is 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.420
 protected by a bag the accessory is 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.440
 protected by a case we go far when 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.310
 even among our neighbors at the 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:08.720
 protection and inside we find that 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:11.420
 lindigo the our dreams so pad our nos 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.950
 indigo pad dreams so what is that 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.150
 it is neither more nor less than 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.500
 kind of accessory that you have placed 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.739
 on your desk that will allow you 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.850
 two things primo if you do not use 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.250
 on your phone 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.690
 it will prevent you from scratching your phone 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.660
 by putting it on a hard surface like 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.790
 a table that's the first thing 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.319
 so that's kind of protection 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.489
 not permanent since it is not 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.540
 stuck on your phone but it's a 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.940
 extra protection when you 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.660
 phone recharge and it can be 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.250
 useful 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.750
 I insist on that it will save you 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.060
 still a lot of mistakes on the back of 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.069
 your mobile the little logo our dreams is 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.269
 at the top so we have a shape here that 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.889
 allows you to well stabilized the 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.730
 phone inside after in 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.500
 the other side 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.849
 as I wanted 10 and marked for the 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.170
 nexus 5 yes because it takes over the 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.830
 dimensions that are sufficient for a 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.420
 nexus 5 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.830
 after I think it goes with 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.640
 outright other phones it's not 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.120
 the problem is just a question 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.099
 time axis then second advantage of 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.110
 this woman of this famous forgiveness our 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.160
 pad dreams that's it that was where you 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.360
 can you just then 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.090
 I hope I will not do too much 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.129
 nonsense hello here you have it all 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.420
 simply be able to pass the microphone cable 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.400
 usb so it allows you to synchronize 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.729
 to charge your phone you go 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.979
 to be able to pass it here and then 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.959
 knock down here this little seven little 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.060
 fasteners and stabilize the cable that's 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.130
 so the two advantages they are so 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.240
 present here clearly is to protect 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.590
 your phone when you ask about 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.419
 a table to prevent them from taking and 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.900
 therefore these protections of the back of the 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.150
 phone 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.789
 secondly it's stabilization 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.470
 precisely a micro usb cable for 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:38.880
 synchronized phone charging avoid 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.930
 always to walk around with the case 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.150
 to try to find 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.229
 he slips down the floor good he falls by 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.000
 earth pardon we must go get it 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.260
 and that's what it allows you all 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.120
 to simply create a kind of station 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.860
 home at your phone 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.340
 here and you wash your hands 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:56.490
 tense the task she is magnetized so 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.410
 it's made of 100% leather leather 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.550
 no sense handmade and seams 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.770
 it's well done it's clean it's beautiful 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.880
 and it's indigo it's a color that 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.650
 I had already had the opportunity to 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.570
 present either a case including the case 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.070
 from week to dark side if my memories 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.690
 are good that they were also of this 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.680
 same indigo color that I promise you 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.000
 besides to see the video all 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.490
 just to see the color level 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.590

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.950
 is it's a beautiful product like

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.800
 range for phone accessories
