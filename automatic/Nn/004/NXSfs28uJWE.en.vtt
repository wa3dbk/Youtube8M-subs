00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.170 
and it was very hard to use as a phone
again<00:02:17.079> so<00:02:17.349> my<00:02:17.799> only<00:02:17.980> choice<00:02:18.280> was<00:02:18.519> to<00:02:18.579> sell<00:02:19.000> that

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
again so my only choice was to sell that

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.199 
again so my only choice was to sell that
thing<00:02:19.319> or<00:02:20.319> get<00:02:20.890> rid<00:02:21.099> of<00:02:21.129> it<00:02:21.459> myself

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
thing or get rid of it myself

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.210 
thing or get rid of it myself
so<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:22.900> pretty<00:02:23.230> much<00:02:23.319> took<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:23.769> to<00:02:23.890> Verizon

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
so I pretty much took it to Verizon

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.309 
so I pretty much took it to Verizon
Wireless<00:02:24.849> and<00:02:25.120> they<00:02:25.360> gave<00:02:25.720> me<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.930> pretty<00:02:26.200> good

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
Wireless and they gave me a pretty good

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.210 
Wireless and they gave me a pretty good
price<00:02:26.680> even<00:02:27.099> though<00:02:27.159> it<00:02:27.459> was<00:02:27.640> blacklisted

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
price even though it was blacklisted

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.649 
price even though it was blacklisted
they<00:02:30.220> still<00:02:30.519> went<00:02:30.700> ahead<00:02:30.819> and<00:02:31.120> took<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:31.450> phone

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
they still went ahead and took the phone

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.339 
they still went ahead and took the phone
I<00:02:31.930> pretty<00:02:32.200> much<00:02:32.319> got<00:02:32.950> like<00:02:33.129> $200<00:02:34.030> or<00:02:34.930> so<00:02:35.140> which

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
you could use a blacklisted device if it

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.550 
you could use a blacklisted device if it
is<00:04:21.639> a<00:04:22.110> GSM<00:04:23.669> version<00:04:24.669> of<00:04:24.789> the<00:04:24.940> phone

Verizon no not not Verizon but I'll

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.360
