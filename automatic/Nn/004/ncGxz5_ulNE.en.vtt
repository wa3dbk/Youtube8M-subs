00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:09.590
 the choice of the best cultivars of 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:12.099
 coffee is one of the first steps to 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.509
 ensure good productivity and 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:17.360
 consequently the profitability of 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.489
 tillage for the state of rondÃ´nia as 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.489
 The most commonly used cultivars are 

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:25.820
 coffea canephora species 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:28.040
 of the conilon and robust groups in this video 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.890
 Let's show you how to choose the plants. 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.759
 and to make seedlings production of 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.759
 coffee conilon 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.920
 for the producer of rondÃ´nia the main 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.170
 should be used is the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.640
 today with improvement 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.180
 and the production of seedlings 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.480
 clonal we have productivity of 100 to 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.030
 150 sacks per hectare or compared to 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.809
 years ago, there were only 20 sacks per 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.230
 hectare 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.199
 so here in this plant we have renner 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.910
 and an activity distributed to the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.550
 throughout the plant in terms of 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.340
 productivity should take into account the 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.920
 amount of branches per rosettes 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.130
 number of grains per rosette and 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.050
 fruit maturity uniformity 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.410
 from the base to the branch account 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.930
 is also not ideal to use 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.720
 plants bearing fruit 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.360
 green or ripe or with the presence of 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.880
 ripe fruits and flowers because at the moment 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.300
 landing will be 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.190
 grains and flowers will be felled 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.680
 compromising the productivity of the next 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.420
 year another very important criterion 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.369
 that should be used when the 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.670
 choice of cultivar is the architecture of 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.319
 The plant has tall plants and 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.979
 low-sized plans 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:55.140
 this will be the criterion that must be very 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.110
 well chosen because he will decide 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.860
 what will be the spacing used in the 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.810
 Agriculture 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.000
 my left side has a plant 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.459
 can see that she has a 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.660
 small stature a plant that will have a 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:10.760
 activity very well served by the 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.730
 your architecture 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.690
 already on the right has a plant with the 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.810
 larger size 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.580
 a photon high in this way in height 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.640
 and a plant diameter should be 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.280
 taken into account if the producer 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.800
 choose one size to cultivate high one 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.250
 spacing must be greater between 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.420
 plants if the option is for cultivars of 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.480
 smaller size 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.190
 the spacing must be reduced further 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.860
 characteristic that the producer must 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.709
 to observe is that conilon coffee has a 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.520
 smaller and is more tolerant of 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.490
 dry 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.660
 already the robust one has larger size and plants 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.660
 tolerant to rust 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.590
 production of clonal seedlings is 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.760
 necessary that there be what we call 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.769
 clonal garden the clonal garden nothing 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.050
 more is that an area usually 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.630
 located next to the nursery and 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.830
 for the production of cuttings for 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.780
 seedling production 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.760
 the plant should be stimulated to 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.819
 production of cuttings through 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.150
 wingspan of the tropics or 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:22.299
 be the vertical branches of the plant now 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.400
 We are going to prepare the plan for emission 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.420
 of new votes through the 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.700
 engagement 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.190
 initially cleaning the 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.160
 almost every year. 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.290
 change and ask for the tropic that 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.110
 have few leaves of the ground only part 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.170
 where there is the production of leaves that 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.940
 the production of energy will serve as 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.040
 of new highlights 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.590
 so this is a clean branch ready for 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.799
 be a branch of the branch to be 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.510
 should be exposed to the sun 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.760
 stimulating the new growth 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.670
 can be done with assistance 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.670
 of a wire attached to the branch and wrapped in 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.730
 a stake that will be fixed to the ground 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.400
 there must be shame 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.019
 way the plant does not stay is what 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.040
 the garis do not face the 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:14.500
 interior of the streets in the cafe so 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.250
 disrupts the normal cultural 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.519
 culture 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.979
 so we have a plant completely 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.590
 prepared for missions rotations all 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.520
 years within four to six years 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.950
 months 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.410
 but generating here to take away the 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.630
 polls to take the nursery to the 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.940
 planting the cuttings each 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.780
 plant has the capacity to 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.479
 producing 200 to 400 piles for 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.229
 production of clonal seedlings to know 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:48.760
 clean up by voting all 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:52.419
 the productive branches for and followed 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.729
 previous make the leaf cut leaving 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:59.740
 two thirds of this sheet 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:02.710
 so that the molt can feed to the 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.110
 issuance of the roots the size of the stake 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.900
 must have each other 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.670
 the six centimeters and the cut in the branch 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.220
 should be done from four to five 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:14.010
 centimeters below the insertion of 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.320
 leaves and one centimeter above 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.120
 these stakes must be immersed without 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.610
 By acidic solution confuses 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.040
 approximately five minutes to 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.190
 to eliminate possible diseases from the 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.590
 after cutting and treating the 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.810
 stakes are ready to be taken 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.510
 to the nursery and planted in sacks 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.510
 polyethylene and polyethylene bags 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:39.330
 shall be folded in the bottom and 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:42.150
 sides containing holes in its half 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.080
 to allow the drainage of the 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.360
 Water 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.720
 bags with stakes should be 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.400
 placed in irrigated nurseries 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.250
 constantly keeping moisture in the air 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.500
 around 90% 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.380
 the first shoots of new seedlings 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.260
 begin to emerge from 45 days 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:04.530
 after planting and seedlings should be 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.330
 remain in the nursery for about 120 a 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.850
 150 days 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.250
 during this period it will be necessary to 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:14.240
 with pest infestation and 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:17.400
 diseases and nutrition of seedlings 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:20.280
 before being taken to the field the 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:23.190
 plants must be the one killed so 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.320
 should be gradually increased 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.720
 sun exposure 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.790
 in the case of acquisition of seedlings 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.840
 The producer should be attentive to 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:34.770
 because the seedlings must be 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.100
 certified with genetic 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:40.440
 and the living list must be 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:45.410
 accredited in the Ministry of Agriculture 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.410
 livestock and supplies and reindeer
