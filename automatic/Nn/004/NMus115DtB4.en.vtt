impressive<00:02:31.370> for<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.760> game<00:02:31.970> from<00:02:32.330> this<00:02:32.989> era<00:02:33.290> also

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
impressive for a game from this era also

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:44.809 
impressive for a game from this era also
the<00:02:33.830> music<00:02:33.950> is<00:02:34.720> rocking<00:02:35.720> that<00:02:35.959> 90s<00:02:36.739> style

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.420 

this<00:02:45.569> also<00:02:45.810> has<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.200> few<00:02:46.560> cars<00:02:46.799> you<00:02:46.950> won't<00:02:47.129> find

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:50.189 
many other places like the Ford GT 90 I

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:51.709 
many other places like the Ford GT 90 I
can't<00:02:50.519> think<00:02:50.700> of<00:02:50.730> any<00:02:50.969> other<00:02:51.060> game<00:02:51.359> that<00:02:51.569> has

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:51.719 
can't think of any other game that has

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:55.880 
can't think of any other game that has
the<00:02:51.930> GT<00:02:52.969> 93<00:02:53.969> too

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890
