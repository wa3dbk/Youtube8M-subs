 [Music] 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:14.670
 this video is an offer of infinity 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:17.070
 play and there guys out there 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.600
 I hope you do today the video about the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.279
 things we loved believe 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.029
 really worked in the games of 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.800
 Pokémon 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.660
 especially when you record power 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.789
 online rather than speaking in a 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.680
 corsa lie he confirmed 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.640
 probably trying to make fun of her 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.099
 your face 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.690
 And yes, this has happened to me for 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.520
 example who played pokémon yellow 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.320
 I 've never heard anyone say that 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.239
 cousin of the neighbor had 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.070
 evolve pikachu and was always a 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.930
 Bizarre kind of story is with a 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.700
 sequence of trainers use only one 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.680
 blow until you get the fall of 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.200
 thunder that you had to deposit seven 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.090
 times the item to use later, and then who 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.840
 I had this patience, I lost a lot 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:05.690
 time trying to stop 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:07.920
 [Music] 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.020
 outside the other conversations that 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.790
 about the evolution of pikachu the truth is 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.619
 this dog version and is based 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.900
 In the anime so much who does not enter the time is 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:29.340
 good and refuses and voip that acted in. 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:30.140
 of coca cola stay what you want 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.249
 do 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.249
 [Music] 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:46.320
 thus becomes the only mode of flight this 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.810
 puppy is switching to 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.729
 another blue version or network alike 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.729
 and then use the thunder stone 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.750
 Then I was able to evolve only when 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.149
 You return to see blood is 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.690
 how he cracked and could not get out 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.780
 Vintage is good 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.780
 [Music] 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.370
 the big difference that the game presented 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.410
 was the amount of Pokémon names 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.870
 what you could have on your team and how 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.240
 you recruited space on the team but with 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.440
 the famous Pokémon its variations and 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.390
 this made the game even more 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.400
 spectacular you can choose which you 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.330
 I do not know that just that everything is not as 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.010
 so easy 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.830
 if you were in a battle your grandfather 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.660
 was with full hp it was always more 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.070
 difficult to capture with 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.660
 sure you would spend a lot of 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.730
 pokémon to work out and if you 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.190
 make the project more correct is to 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.860
 album with low hp and paralysis of 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.350
 preference to capture much easier 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.510
 only that even knowing this everybody and 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.250
 I say everyone even had one 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.510
 infallible technique to achieve 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.450
 to catch a pokémon 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.770
 mine was still tightening the good 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.450
 at the time the Pokémon touch the 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.160
 Pokemon and I do not know if you're going 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.200
 understand exactly but after this 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.000
 happened you kept pressing 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.370
 making a circular motion along with 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.130
 the pokémon and face does not have the least sense 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.310
 in doing so but it is absolutely 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.260
 automatic 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.690
 I feel retarded doing this on 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.430
 true but I will continue no matter 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.380
 several other techniques you hear around 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.090
 that was to press the avaí the kiss one of the 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.970
 others was to press the directional to 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.620
 down with the button pressed and there goes 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.180
 and then comment on any of your 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.580
 infallible technique 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.010
 another bizarre theory that circulated 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.260
 it was on the subject in a deep image 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.850
 karp is that same 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.880
 this pokémon zinha that only has one 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.549
 utility ship evolve you guys 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.829
 no doubt a single purpose of pokémon 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.290
 so wronged that he only learns the 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:54.450
 Normal Mode Techniques Out Power 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.450
 splash that has the ability to do 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.299
 but the boot that came up is that this 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.040
 splash damage car technique had 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.110
 ability to kill instantly 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.819
 any pokémon of any light 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:17.709
 only that the chance of this happening to 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:19.630
 0.1 000 000 000 00 1% and many people 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.430
 You believed me, I'm not going to deny it either. 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.220
 but I did not have the patience that some 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.020
 people had to try and try and 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.940
 try and try some more to see 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.190
 if you could do this magic bbb10 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.110
 show up just not right 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.460
 including internet videos based on 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:40.880
 In this rumor, but it's all a lie. 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:42.500
 [Music] 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.480
 I remember one of the greatest mysteries 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.520
 of the first generation of the game of pokémon 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.340
 it was the damn truck standing on the side of 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.080
 ss in many if spoke several theories 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.090
 were built around this truck 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.310
 but what got caught was underneath that 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.560
 there was a good truck there and a thousand there 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.750
 inside and ready from there began 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.730
 I hunted mine to get this 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.650
 supposed pokémon with 1 thousand 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.170
 You need to get the truck out of the way. 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.070
 and for this it is necessary to use the h m 4 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.140
 weird 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.000
 But that's when many broke the face. 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.440
 because that hm is only achieved later 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.970
 that the ship is leaving 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.040
 the people began to think of a 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.220
 way to get strong before the ship 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.960
 go and of course is to get the hang of it 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.570
 so inside the ship after you 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.040
 gets the cut h1n1 you need 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.020
 her to get on with the game 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.030
 You would have to miss the next battle. 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.190
 to restart at the last pokémon center 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.880
 that you used that probably was in 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.260
 red 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.150
 from there you could go on without 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.280
 and the ship would still be there 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.600
 after you could surf strong 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.430
 You could go back to the place to 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.260
 finally got his thousand 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.510
 The great thing is that all of this does not 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.520
 went from an illusion the way is only 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.110
 an ornament on the stage there is no secret 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.820
 none on this path 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.660
 and this was yet another suffering for the 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.660
 addicted to 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.890
 and to close who is this honey sauce 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.450
 well sure everyone who played the 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.100
 second generation 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.690
 but about the story they told about 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.150
 before the launch of the second 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.290
 because it is in the eastern part of 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.540
 were presented 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.340
 some new pokémons that would be part 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.300
 of the gold and silver version 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.790
 only at that time the information 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.680
 I got here in the morning. 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.930
 had a very fertile imagination for 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.400
 If you look closely at this, 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.320
 pokémon will notice some similarity with 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.990
 the dog mainly in the time that 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.150
 there were only 151 and not even 7 million and 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.160
 800 thousand people today and this similarity 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.710
 it was just that they needed to create a 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.780
 new lie about the pokémon honey is over 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.910
 turning pica blue in the west 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.830
 Everyone should remember this and it stings. 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.840
 blue was simply the aquatic version 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.670
 of pikachu plus a lot of means 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.410
 absurdities have been invented to 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:51.750
 such a well-known pokémon was you 

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.890
 get the version pikachu and it evolves 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.360
 up to level 100 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.970
 then you passed the 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.910
 pokémon group a gay gay cable and wore 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.620
 water stone and bonuses or say more 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.730
 anything 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.730
 [Music] 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.520
 and this is what was a video to remember 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.440
 some of the lies we have fallen into. 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.790
 childhood adolescence playing this series 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.380
 fantastic games 

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.870
 nowadays these rumors are easily 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.910
 discarded but at the time it took 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.980
 but too long even to find out that 

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:21.390
 that was just a lie but 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.220
 drinks to be really have 

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.540
 liked it so leave your like 

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.450
