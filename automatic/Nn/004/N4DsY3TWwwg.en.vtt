quite surprised at how well you seemed
to<00:01:05.880> thinking<00:01:06.270> my<00:01:06.480> skin<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.050> honest<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:08.090> it

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
to thinking my skin to be honest and it

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.450 
to thinking my skin to be honest and it
made<00:01:09.360> my<00:01:09.480> skin<00:01:09.540> feel<00:01:09.960> super<00:01:10.260> soft<00:01:10.620> which<00:01:11.040> I

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
made my skin feel super soft which I

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.150 
made my skin feel super soft which I
guess<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.850> always<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> plus<00:01:12.630> with<00:01:12.840> makeup<00:01:13.160> up

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
guess is always a plus with makeup up

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.130 
guess is always a plus with makeup up

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:51.460 
feel cakey at all it just blended in
really<00:01:50.420> well<00:01:50.450> I'm<00:01:50.810> not<00:01:50.929> sure<00:01:50.990> whether<00:01:51.289> that

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
really well I'm not sure whether that

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.440 
really well I'm not sure whether that
was<00:01:51.560> because<00:01:51.619> of<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.670> face<00:01:52.880> primer<00:01:53.179> that<00:01:53.299> I

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
was because of the face primer that I

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.210 
was because of the face primer that I
used<00:01:53.689> before<00:01:53.750> or<00:01:54.289> just<00:01:54.320> because<00:01:54.770> of<00:01:54.920> its<00:01:55.070> a

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
used before or just because of its a

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.520 
used before or just because of its a
really<00:01:55.399> good<00:01:55.640> formula<00:01:55.939> but<00:01:56.929> I<00:01:57.110> guess<00:01:57.320> it's

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
really good formula but I guess it's

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.620 
really good formula but I guess it's
kind<00:01:57.829> of<00:01:57.950> both<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:58.970> being<00:01:59.240> as<00:01:59.329> they<00:01:59.479> work

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
kind of both and being as they work

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.480 
kind of both and being as they work
together<00:01:59.810> and<00:02:00.259> then<00:02:00.799> I<00:02:00.829> just<00:02:01.009> put<00:02:01.070> some<00:02:01.340> powder

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
together and then I just put some powder

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.910 
together and then I just put some powder
on<00:02:01.640> top<00:02:01.700> just<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:02.119> set<00:02:02.360> it

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.190 

fer<00:02:07.920> my<00:02:07.979> eyebrows<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.910> just<00:02:09.179> used<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.750> stylized

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
fer my eyebrows I just used the stylized

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.070 
fer my eyebrows I just used the stylized
brow<00:02:10.590> shaping<00:02:11.070> gel<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.630> to<00:02:12.630> be<00:02:12.750> honest<00:02:12.990> I

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
brow shaping gel and to be honest I

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.270 
brow shaping gel and to be honest I
didn't<00:02:13.260> really<00:02:13.290> expect<00:02:13.500> much<00:02:13.950> from<00:02:14.010> this

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
didn't really expect much from this

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
at all and didn't call together but they

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.570 
at all and didn't call together but they
felt<00:02:27.120> quite<00:02:27.330> natural<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.370> stayed<00:02:29.370> exactly

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
felt quite natural and stayed exactly

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.770 
felt quite natural and stayed exactly
where<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.030> put<00:02:30.300> them

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.650 

and<00:02:34.170> then<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.709> just<00:02:34.920> caught<00:02:35.130> in<00:02:35.340> my<00:02:35.660> eyelashes

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
and then I just caught in my eyelashes

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.020 
and then I just caught in my eyelashes
in<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.050> lash<00:02:37.230> tastic<00:02:38.010> full<00:02:38.370> sliquid<00:02:38.819> lash

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
in the lash tastic full sliquid lash

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.110 
in the lash tastic full sliquid lash
mascara<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:41.130> wand<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.520> actually<00:02:41.940> quite

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
mascara and the wand is actually quite

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.460 
mascara and the wand is actually quite
big<00:02:42.480> but<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:43.260> found<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.830> easier<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:45.380> put<00:02:46.380> the

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
big but I found it easier to put the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.000 
big but I found it easier to put the
mascara<00:02:46.920> on<00:02:47.160> my<00:02:47.220> eyes<00:02:47.520> beaners<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.740> find<00:02:49.740> that<00:02:49.950> I

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
mascara on my eyes beaners I find that I

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.699 
mascara on my eyes beaners I find that I
can<00:02:50.340> do<00:02:50.700> this<00:02:50.819> better<00:02:51.030> with<00:02:51.300> bigger<00:02:51.709> brushes

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
can do this better with bigger brushes

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.410 
can do this better with bigger brushes
really<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:54.950> so<00:02:55.950> yeah<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.430> can<00:02:56.730> see<00:02:56.910> how<00:02:57.150> if<00:02:57.300> you

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
really and so yeah I can see how if you

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.440 
really and so yeah I can see how if you
do<00:02:57.600> two<00:02:57.870> or<00:02:57.989> three<00:02:58.170> coats<00:02:58.380> of<00:02:58.590> this<00:02:59.450> mascara

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
do two or three coats of this mascara

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.510 
do two or three coats of this mascara
then<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:01.170> would<00:03:01.500> give<00:03:01.709> you<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:01.920> effect<00:03:02.370> of

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
then it would give you the effect of

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.610 
then it would give you the effect of
false<00:03:02.760> lashes

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.100 

and<00:03:07.099> find<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.030> off-camera<00:03:08.390> applied<00:03:08.840> some

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
and find the off-camera applied some

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.020 
and find the off-camera applied some
paint<00:03:09.409> the<00:03:09.530> line<00:03:09.709> waterproof<00:03:10.280> eyeliner<00:03:10.519> the

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
paint the line waterproof eyeliner the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.449 
paint the line waterproof eyeliner the
applicator<00:03:11.629> is<00:03:11.810> actually<00:03:12.170> quite<00:03:12.319> long<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.890> so

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
applicator is actually quite long and so

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.979 
applicator is actually quite long and so
it<00:03:13.519> makes<00:03:13.670> it<00:03:13.849> easier<00:03:14.120> to<00:03:14.150> apply<00:03:14.450> for<00:03:14.510> someone

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
it makes it easier to apply for someone

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.670 
it makes it easier to apply for someone
like<00:03:15.140> me<00:03:15.319> is<00:03:15.349> terrible<00:03:15.950> at<00:03:16.010> water<00:03:16.190> eyeliner
