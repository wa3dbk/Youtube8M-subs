range so now let's talk a bit about the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.729 
range so now let's talk a bit about the
Moto<00:00:49.620> e<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.670> packs<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.000> 4.3<00:00:51.870> inch<00:00:51.899> screen<00:00:52.199> with<00:00:52.710> a

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
resolution of 540 by 960 that gives it a
