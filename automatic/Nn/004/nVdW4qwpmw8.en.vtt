00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.270
 during the First World War the 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:13.349
 us in front of which was the 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:16.660
 president thomas woodrow wilson 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.680
 they abandon the Moorish patron for the first time 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.770
 and decides to make fiduciary money for 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.230
 pay for such huge expenses and 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.810
 end of the war to help the 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.050
 reconstruction of europe 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:36.250
 that's how the us lived during the years 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.020
 20 and 30 but the fiat money never 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.520
 It has been good 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:45.990
 for the US out of its crisis 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.480
 despite the efforts of the 30s 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.720
 the truth is that the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.460
 World War II so that all the 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.969
 armament industry of the usa 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:02.070
 and it was a great pull of the economy and so 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.680
 to be able to recover 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.620
 that fiduciary money that abandonment of 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.620
 Moorish patron was in the USA 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.110
 until World War II during 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.110
 which and before its completion is 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:24.300
 produces the bretton woods conference 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:28.860
 where nations argue over the 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:31.350
 feasibility of continuing to operate with a 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.409
 fiduciary dollar 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.680
 we are not going to tell because it is quite 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.680
 interesting 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.250
 here in the middle of world war 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.720
 1944 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.470
 meet in the so-called conference of the 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.300
 spirit wood 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:57.570
 44 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:00.660
 personalities belonging to the 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.500
 European allies united states and 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.500
 some countries 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.600
 South Americans 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.630
 the money from the us the one that was 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.370
 supplying for the war 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.990
 I was losing value so 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.480
 again 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.300
 since at the end of the first war 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.760
 world was temporarily abandoned another 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.319
 way is the way to have money 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.719
 trust 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:30.060
 this money as we know it is not worth 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:34.560
 nothing loses value quickly 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:38.040
 greenwood a conference is held for 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.370
 know what to do with money and how 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.720
 fund both the war and the rest 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.670
 of the economy of the states 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:51.459
 here among so much personality 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:54.800
 there are two that shine for their ideas 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:58.670
 North American ar and white 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:03.319
 who advocates going back to the other mode 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:05.920
 so that the dollar does not lose value 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.760
 and on the other hand 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.310
 The British John Maynard Keynes 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:16.370
 governor of the bank of england the 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.910
 which defends a theory 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.800
 very socialist 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.730
 defends the creation of a single currency 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.920
 and in those then and defend 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.400
 that is recorded to the states and 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.030
 Companies that have a surplus 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.849
 for that money to be able to promote 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.780
 consumption and fair redistribution 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:41.720
 Of wealth 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.580
 this sounds almost communist 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:49.250
 but 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:53.660
 it did not sound so bad when in 1933 the 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:57.090
 President Roosevelt applied 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:01.270
 Keynes theories 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:04.920
 to be able to return to the usa 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.920
 to a normal state 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:11.020
 that they did not have since the depression 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.020
 economic of 1929 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.620
 here 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.390
 kane is what I had in mind starting 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.150
 of the success that his policy with 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.889
 roosevelt two great are created 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.979
 institutions 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:29.050
 that survive to this day 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:32.500
 international monetary 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.379
 which is like a kind of deposit for 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.169
 that a country with problems can go 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:42.889
 punctually to him 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:45.740
 and leave a local crisis 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:48.789
 the world bank is also created 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.789
 but global 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:56.950
 the central bank of central banks 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:59.280
 of the world who is going to commission 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:04.520
 that bank transactions 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:06.260
 internationals fit more right 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.630
 thus 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:13.440
 Heinz is knocked out 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:17.390
 and in this bretton woods conference 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.780
 the gold standard is restored 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:24.450
 and the dollar comes out 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.450
 as a world currency 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:31.049
 about 1960 a curious fact occurs 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:33.820
 in the currency exchange that is not very 

00:05:31.049 --> 00:05:36.250
 known at the popular level 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.580
 the allies who had won the war 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:42.220
 and Alasia a few years were led 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.180
 both economically and militarily by 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.670
 The USA 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.500
 they had 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.870
 for its gold convertible ticket 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:55.200
 circulating around the world 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.680
 however in france the president 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.400
 saleh board 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.720
 he was quite angry with the us 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.720
 since they did not allow them 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.940
 have the atomic bomb 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.700
 salt the words counterattacked the 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:14.720
 Americans asking them to do 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:17.960
 honor their word and give them everything 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.780
 the gold corresponding to the dollars 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:24.350
 convertibles than in france 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:26.729
 in the USA then you were in 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:30.839
 jaguar as president 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:32.289
 without water a man of honor did not know what 

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:34.780
 what to do 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:37.900
 I did not want to 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.980
 get rid of luck by luck for the 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.170
 U.S 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.689
 next to eisenhower there was a 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:47.030
 much more hybrid vice president 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:49.610
 and if my son 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.960
 france had a huge amount of 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:56.190
 gold convertible banknotes 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:59.500
 the usa had that gold in reality 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:01.840
 but they were not going to let go one way 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.620
 is the same 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.990
 I hid your gold 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.249
 declare tickets illegal 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:13.019
 convertibles 

00:07:09.249 --> 00:07:16.809
 and left France without attending to your request 

00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:18.280
 simply declare that money as 

00:07:16.809 --> 00:07:21.220
 illegal 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:25.020
 from that moment the states 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:27.750
 united to issue bills 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:30.230
 only gives an authorization to 

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:32.900
 federal reserve bank 

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:36.470
 the state no longer issues bills and the 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:39.180
 federal reserve issues banknotes 

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:41.950
 called fiduciary money 

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:44.620
 or tickets 

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:47.730
 that were not backed up absolutely 

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.730
 you are welcome
