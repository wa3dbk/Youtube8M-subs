00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
of the important things is this bass

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.080 
of the important things is this bass
thing<00:00:49.739> that's<00:00:49.920> going<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.399> if<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.670> look<00:00:50.850> I'm

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
thing that's going and if you look I'm

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.810 
thing that's going and if you look I'm
using<00:00:51.300> my<00:00:51.570> thumb<00:00:51.860> my<00:00:52.860> forefinger<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.610> my

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
using my thumb my forefinger and my

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.090 
using my thumb my forefinger and my
middle<00:00:54.030> finger<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.690> each<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.530> bass<00:00:55.739> middle

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
middle finger on each of the bass middle

middle finger on each of the bass middle
and<00:00:56.430> top<00:00:56.579> strings<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.329> I'm<00:00:57.420> actually

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
and top strings and I'm actually

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.720 
and top strings and I'm actually
pinching<00:00:58.260> them<00:00:58.500> all<00:00:58.710> together<00:01:00.770> and<00:01:01.770> I'm<00:01:02.520> just

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
pinching them all together and I'm just

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.630 
pinching them all together and I'm just
putting<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.719> little<00:01:04.140> move<00:01:04.320> here<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
putting in a little move here on the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.490 
putting in a little move here on the
middle<00:01:05.820> string<00:01:06.330> on<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.720> third<00:01:06.990> fret<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.439> I'm

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
middle string on the third fret and I'm

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.570 
middle string on the third fret and I'm
just<00:01:07.680> bending<00:01:08.159> slightly<00:01:13.280> you<00:01:14.280> can<00:01:14.490> actually

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
just bending slightly you can actually

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.789 
just bending slightly you can actually
put<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.119> across<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.350> bottom<00:01:16.650> two

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
put that across of the bottom two

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.770 
put that across of the bottom two
through<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.159> middle<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> lower<00:01:17.729> string

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.390 

that<00:01:21.780> goes<00:01:22.020> right<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.619> way<00:01:22.650> through<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.159> song

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
that goes right the way through the song

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.039 
that goes right the way through the song
and<00:01:23.549> that's<00:01:23.640> an<00:01:23.820> important<00:01:24.299> thing<00:01:24.330> about

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
and that's an important thing about

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.280 
and that's an important thing about
playing<00:01:25.590> slide<00:01:25.890> guitar<00:01:26.540> it's<00:01:27.540> not<00:01:27.750> all<00:01:27.990> about

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
playing slide guitar it's not all about

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.050 
playing slide guitar it's not all about
the<00:01:28.470> slide<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.130> slide<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.640> almost<00:01:29.909> a

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
the slide the slide is almost a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:55.690 
the slide the slide is almost a
decoration<00:01:30.720> on<00:01:30.869> top

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.250 

so<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.760> see<00:01:57.000> how<00:01:57.150> that<00:01:57.180> finger<00:01:57.660> kept<00:01:57.900> coming

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
so you see how that finger kept coming

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:30.560 
so you see how that finger kept coming
in<00:01:58.440> I<00:02:00.710> play<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.770> slide<00:02:28.910> okay<00:02:29.910> so<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.360> just

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
in I play the slide okay so I just

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.230 
in I play the slide okay so I just
talked<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.750> little<00:02:30.959> bit<00:02:31.230> about<00:02:31.850> the<00:02:32.850> setup<00:02:33.180> of

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
talked a little bit about the setup of

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.060 
talked a little bit about the setup of
the<00:02:33.360> guitar<00:02:33.720> this<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:33.959> set<00:02:34.290> up<00:02:34.410> fairly<00:02:34.920> low

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
the guitar this is set up fairly low

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.600 
the guitar this is set up fairly low
action<00:02:36.350> certainly<00:02:37.350> down<00:02:37.620> at<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.070> nut<00:02:38.310> and

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
action certainly down at the nut and

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.699 
action certainly down at the nut and
here<00:02:39.240> in<00:02:39.510> fact<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.840> may<00:02:39.959> be<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.110> little<00:02:40.260> bit<00:02:40.500> low

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
here in fact it may be a little bit low

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.100 
here in fact it may be a little bit low
because<00:02:40.970> quite<00:02:41.970> easy<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.420> rattle<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.840> frets

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
because quite easy to rattle the frets

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.410 
because quite easy to rattle the frets
and<00:02:43.709> up<00:02:44.010> here<00:02:44.220> it's<00:02:44.459> as<00:02:44.640> high<00:02:44.820> as<00:02:45.000> you'd<00:02:45.150> want

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
and up here it's as high as you'd want

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.240 
and up here it's as high as you'd want
it<00:02:45.690> at<00:02:45.959> about<00:02:46.140> two<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:46.769> half<00:02:46.950> three

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
it at about two and a half three

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.430 
it at about two and a half three
millimeters<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.150> don't<00:02:48.720> need<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.019> get<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.320> are

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
millimeters you don't need to get to are

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.620 
millimeters you don't need to get to are
setting<00:02:49.769> up<00:02:49.890> any<00:02:50.160> higher<00:02:50.459> than<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:50.940> there's

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
setting up any higher than that there's

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.509 
setting up any higher than that there's
quite<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.900> lot<00:02:52.200> of<00:02:52.230> misconceptions<00:02:53.040> I<00:02:53.190> think

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
quite a lot of misconceptions I think

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.130 
quite a lot of misconceptions I think
about<00:02:53.700> people<00:02:53.880> who<00:02:54.150> want<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.420> play<00:02:54.570> slide<00:02:54.959> it

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
about people who want to play slide it

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.410 
about people who want to play slide it
on<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.500> cigar<00:02:55.800> box<00:02:56.010> guitar<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.580> they<00:02:57.060> think

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
on the cigar box guitar and they think

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.410 
on the cigar box guitar and they think
because<00:02:58.260> they're<00:02:58.440> playing<00:02:58.709> slide<00:02:59.209> they<00:03:00.209> need

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
because they're playing slide they need

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.540 
because they're playing slide they need
high<00:03:00.750> action<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.890> doesn't<00:03:02.280> matter<00:03:02.430> about

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
high action and it doesn't matter about

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.220 
high action and it doesn't matter about
getting<00:03:03.030> these<00:03:03.209> strings<00:03:03.690> down<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.140> the

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
getting these strings down to the

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.500 
getting these strings down to the
fretboard<00:03:04.500> whether<00:03:05.280> it's<00:03:05.489> frets<00:03:05.730> or<00:03:06.000> fretted

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
fretboard whether it's frets or fretted

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.170 
fretboard whether it's frets or fretted
and<00:03:06.690> I<00:03:07.680> think<00:03:08.040> that's<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.459> wrong<00:03:08.760> assumption

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
and I think that's a wrong assumption

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.390 
and I think that's a wrong assumption
false<00:03:09.660> assumption<00:03:10.200> what<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:10.799> really<00:03:11.040> need

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
false assumption what you really need

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.280 
false assumption what you really need
are<00:03:11.549> some<00:03:11.820> fairly<00:03:12.150> heavy<00:03:12.420> strings<00:03:12.930> at<00:03:13.230> a

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
are some fairly heavy strings at a

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.110 
are some fairly heavy strings at a
fairly<00:03:13.709> high<00:03:13.830> tension<00:03:14.700> that's<00:03:14.910> going<00:03:15.060> to

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
fairly high tension that's going to

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.510 
fairly high tension that's going to
resist<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.840> pressure<00:03:15.930> of<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.130> slide

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
echo flange phase or whatever so you

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.980 
echo flange phase or whatever so you
hear<00:03:34.950> in<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:35.160> guitar<00:03:35.550> and<00:03:35.760> my<00:03:35.970> playing<00:03:36.360> you're

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
hear in the guitar and my playing you're

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:43.880 
hear in the guitar and my playing you're
not<00:03:37.020> hearing<00:03:37.740> it<00:03:38.090> covered<00:03:39.090> up<00:03:39.590> by<00:03:40.590> effect<00:03:42.890> okay

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
action are we behave in a normal guitar

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.970 
action are we behave in a normal guitar
maybe<00:03:49.950> only<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.490> millimeter<00:03:50.820> or<00:03:51.330> two<00:03:51.710> most<00:03:52.710> of

damping<00:04:33.630> it<00:04:33.750> slightly

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.150 

it's<00:04:59.479> a<00:04:59.600> very<00:04:59.870> simple<00:05:00.199> piece<00:05:00.500> but<00:05:00.770> it<00:05:00.919> does

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
it's a very simple piece but it does

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.460 
it's a very simple piece but it does
require<00:05:01.419> accuracy<00:05:02.419> level<00:05:02.780> with<00:05:02.930> is<00:05:03.080> sliding

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
require accuracy level with is sliding

require accuracy level with is sliding
I'll<00:05:04.009> just<00:05:04.190> go<00:05:04.370> through<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.699> slide<00:05:04.970> bit<00:05:05.860> we<00:05:06.860> go

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:07.009 
I'll just go through the slide bit we go

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:13.420 
I'll just go through the slide bit we go
from<00:05:07.310> open<00:05:08.830> fourth<00:05:10.180> fifth<00:05:11.410> seventh<00:05:12.410> and<00:05:12.620> was<00:05:13.400> a

from open fourth fifth seventh and was a

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:24.730 
from open fourth fifth seventh and was a
pinching<00:05:18.880> up<00:05:19.880> to<00:05:20.090> the<00:05:20.210> knife<00:05:23.650> sliding<00:05:24.650> up

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
pinching up to the knife sliding up

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.969 
pinching up to the knife sliding up
there<00:05:24.919> to<00:05:25.009> the<00:05:25.100> phone<00:05:26.500> then<00:05:27.500> I'm<00:05:27.650> sort<00:05:27.919> of

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
there to the phone then I'm sort of

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:32.980 
there to the phone then I'm sort of
whamming<00:05:28.639> up<00:05:28.820> and<00:05:29.030> down<00:05:30.820> with<00:05:31.820> a<00:05:31.849> slide<00:05:32.210> flat

whamming up and down with a slide flat

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:52.270 
whamming up and down with a slide flat
across<00:05:33.320> all<00:05:33.680> frets<00:05:50.530> can<00:05:51.530> play<00:05:51.740> with<00:05:51.949> that<00:05:52.099> the

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
across all frets can play with that the

00:05:52.280 --> 00:06:17.690 
across all frets can play with that the
slide

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.940 

well<00:06:18.300> that<00:06:18.450> was<00:06:18.570> my<00:06:18.690> amplifier<00:06:19.020> just<00:06:19.410> breaking

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:19.950 
well that was my amplifier just breaking

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.010 
well that was my amplifier just breaking
on<00:06:20.220> there<00:06:20.430> with<00:06:20.580> the<00:06:20.670> battery<00:06:21.000> going<00:06:21.180> flat<00:06:21.480> so

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
on there with the battery going flat so

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.290 
on there with the battery going flat so
I<00:06:22.080> think<00:06:22.170> that's<00:06:22.500> about<00:06:23.280> time<00:06:23.550> to<00:06:23.610> fish<00:06:23.880> so<00:06:24.270> I

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
I think that's about time to fish so I

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.690 
I think that's about time to fish so I
hope<00:06:24.540> that's<00:06:24.690> been<00:06:24.840> a<00:06:24.990> bit<00:06:25.230> of<00:06:25.320> a<00:06:25.410> help<00:06:25.620> to<00:06:26.550> get

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
hope that's been a bit of a help to get

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.160 
hope that's been a bit of a help to get
you<00:06:26.820> on<00:06:26.880> the<00:06:27.000> way<00:06:27.030> to<00:06:27.210> playing<00:06:27.600> you've<00:06:27.960> got<00:06:28.140> a

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.170 
you on the way to playing you've got a

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.380 
you on the way to playing you've got a
move
