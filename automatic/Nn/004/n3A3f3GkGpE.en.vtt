00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.140
 welcome on this occasion we are going to 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:32.700
 talk about the alarm 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:35.220
 m 5.504 the alarm or eme 5.504 are 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.120
 designed for those vehicles that 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:42.180
 own original factory plant 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.530
 a transmitter or a remote control for 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.850
 Door lock and unlock 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:53.390
 the alarm has a reset button led 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.870
 Board relegate short current sensor 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.310
 External impact harness or wiring 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:04.600
 Mermaid installation is the tone 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:07.300
 the module is attached is installed together with 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.880
 the pulses of blocking and unblocking 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.430
 doors when we lock the doors 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.050
 with the original remote control of plant 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:19.000
 the alarm will activate when 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:23.530
 we unlock the door the alarm is 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.760
 deactivate it disarms alarm owns two 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:31.390
 types of three types of anti- assaults one 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.750
 by opening door one by beginning and the 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.240
 third through a presence control 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.880
 like a presence control by 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.740
 of course the advantage of the alarm 5.504 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.720
 apart from working with your remote control 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:52.300
 original plant can we schedule 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.659
 any kind of good remote control 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:59.200
 be series 2a or series 2 p 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.630
 of four buttons the alarm goes to 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.359
 work is going to be all the functions of 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.780
 a one wayne genius alarm with the 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:10.060
 additional control that we program or 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.200
 let's have the signal of 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.200
 opening of paul 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.580
 opening of paul let's have the before 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.350
 high per transmitter we will have the 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.410
 Same locking and unlocking functions 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.480
 of door exclusion of the sensor 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.050
 impact all the functions that 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.690
 have a wang wei alarm also after 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.280
 It has a programming table 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.940
 functions 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.340
 with programmed genius control we are going to 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.940
 have all the functions that a 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.020
 one wing alarm who is this wants 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.270
 say we're going to lock and unlock 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:54.200
 weapons of that weapon before assault with the 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:58.370
 asterisk opening of the trunk channel or 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.780
 channel 2 and channel 3 buttons also 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.530
 we have to deactivate or cancel the 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.310
 reset button 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.790
 this is with the optional golden control 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.400
 james through the programming table 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.030
 of functions we can program both the 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.190
 functions that are for control 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.650
 optional geniuses and the functions that go 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.210
 to be done through control 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.650
 original plant 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:33.670
 with the reset button we could enter and 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.340
 leaving the valid mode is also going to 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.400
 serve to enter the table of 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.560
 programming functions as in a 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.430
 wang wei alarm control is used 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:48.520
 remote and the genius remote control for 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:53.500
 activate or deactivate a function in this 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:56.170
 case the 5,500 4 alarm goes to 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.810
 use the locking pulses and 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.310
 unlock the door to enable or 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:05.650
 disable a function in this explained 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.470
 we enter the tablet programming or 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.650
 programmable functions we pass the key 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.800
 Ignition ignition off 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.420
 we press the button r and 65 times and the 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.510
 alarm goes into programming 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.700
 functions we press n amount of 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.990
 times to the function we want 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:29.440
 program we press 1 2 or 3 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.479
 we wait for the siren of three whistles already in 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.430
 this when he gives the three whistles he goes to 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:36.340
 wait if we want to enable or 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.190
 disable a function 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.949
 We hit the button on the door for 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.919
 block the door and enable the 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:48.430
 function if we give it to unlock the 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:51.100
 door we disable the function for 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.470
 leave the mode we pass the key 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.639
 start of programming forgiveness 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.040
 functions 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:59.199
 we pass the key start off 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.110
 power on and the 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.700
 programming function this alarm 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.120
 work 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.800
 detects it 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.349
 three types of pulse 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.509
 one that is through the white wire that 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:15.460
 are the indicator lights when 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:18.099
 we lock and unlock the doors 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.970
 with the original remote control and another is 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:25.240
 with the combination of wires that two 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.520
 cables go to the locking motor and 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:31.360
 door unlocking 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.520
 now there are vehicles that do not have light or 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.580
 that do not emit light when it is blocked and 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.800
 unlocks the door in this case 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.669
 we enter programming of functions and 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:46.150
 we eliminate the light detection function 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:49.180
 now let's connect four wires two 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:52.419
 that go to the door engine that goes to 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:55.930
 detect one when a positive wing to the 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:59.229
 block a positive when unlocking and 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:01.569
 two that would go to the command switch of the 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:04.810
 door on which the alarm goes to 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:07.090
 detect if the door is to block or 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:10.590
 unlock with the control switch of the 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.750
 door or with the remote control 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.780
 if the doors are blocked by the 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.969
 switch to the door of the door does not 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.549
 nothing 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:21.889
 if the alarm is armed by means of 

00:06:19.549 --> 00:06:24.439
 original remote control and we give the 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:27.379
 switch on the door to unlock the 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:29.780
 alarm does not hang stays the alarm 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:33.650
 navy 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:36.020
 the impact sensor is improved with 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:39.080
 less sensitivity in which we can 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:42.710
 give an adjustment so you have notice in 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:46.070
 almost the entire area of the vehicle while 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:49.550
 the vehicle receives a strong blow or 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:52.900
 abrupt the alarm is going to shoot relay 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:56.419
 of short current so that the 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:59.810
 immobilize the vehicle at the moment in 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:07.060
 that we set the alarm with the blocking of 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:07.060
 120-watt 6-tone siren doors
