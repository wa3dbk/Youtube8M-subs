00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.449
 good 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.449
 that in the goal goes 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.340
 I'm from my whore now it 's a bit 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.340
 timely 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.910
 in technical sessions that you want to like 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.009
 our things seems appropriate to me 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.930
 kind of makeup that we can 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.930
 we have good as maquillo yo 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.270
 because you neither to me photos or I do not have 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.530
 yours 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.410
 of negative that was criticized that is a 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.650
 support i am fanatical 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.650
 good 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.960
 with the faults 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:03.300
 here I'm going to travel you think 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.300
 predictions 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.679
 because if we put in contexts where 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.679
 have more 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.690
 It's very important 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.350
 there is a specific element 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.350
 the 21 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.250
 or not 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.759
 do not 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:52.470
 good since we're going to use everything 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.760
 which is the part of a shovel 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.760
 inside the brush 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.120
 so 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.840
 pretty good 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.020
 recently a clear bristle 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.580
 only of us stop losing 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.900
 of the new suggestions worth it if 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.410
 you read more comfortably although it is said 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.410
 correctors 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.630
 just as free 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.870
 yes 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.190
 everything that this game stays 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.190
 this part of the heap 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.700
 and here 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.420
 on the 19th 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.410
 is 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.610
 for the medium, always leave several 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.080
 days 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.080
 let's use him 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.560
 it's like that 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.560
 it's pure pain 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.600
 align everything that is the line of 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.130
 above 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.130
 and the bottom half 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.550
 in this case of singing 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.170
 today we are going to do this let's give it a 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.709
 brush to form it and that is not so 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.709
 strong 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.880
 see more numbers 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:23.210
 it's a more challenging life image and 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.910
 then what we do is download it there 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.490
 I will lower the shed 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.690
 it is very easy to make strips is very easy 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.690
 say why 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:39.150
 then I always used a color that 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.250
 in this case it is that art has the 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.590
 function of principles used colors 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:49.180
 that are more orange and brown than me 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:52.009
 are better colors of the blondes 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.969
 then fuck me 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:58.020
 he is doing very well when we have 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:01.289
 gray hair and stockings 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.330
 cookies we put ourselves as we are 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.160
 almost all of us put on what we 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.889
 produce 7 and we give you at the end with a 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.009
 Dark color 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:13.580
 well down 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:16.129
 I'm going to clarify the blending of this wine 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.389
 that the idea is very strong 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:18.710
 sold today's makeup is that if 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.510
 we paint our eyes a lot, we paint them 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.290
 mouth a lot 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.290
 we will be 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.280
 good perfect 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.710
 as if we have very painted eyes 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:37.210
 useful lessons in this sector 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.210
 and what he says lips 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.729
 and we are going to paint color like this 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:49.520
 the color that looks a lot like the color d 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.980
 divine is missing the most important part 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.670
 for me 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.670
 it's a marker 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.810
 usually 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.970
 what the tab does is fundamental 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:11.440
 painted anything but difficult because of the 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:14.100
 three lives for bill is important 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.680
 the oils 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.580
 divine and we are and are ready to 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.849
 Salt 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.330
 we see up here in this part and in the 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:25.760
 from below also 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.970
 perfect 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.300
 after things very well we say is 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.300
 obviously 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:38.199
 this is a bus that I bought maybe 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:46.759
 what it does is give it luminosity 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.759
 then we did good sexy 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:54.870
 normally to photoshop 

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:02.999
 as fast says a sunrise with 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:02.999
 loquillo 

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:18.300
 As for love
