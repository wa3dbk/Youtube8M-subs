00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690 

I<00:00:00.120> have<00:00:00.870> entrusted<00:00:01.199> me<00:00:01.530> here<00:00:01.740> a<00:00:01.770> micro

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
I have entrusted me here a micro

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.700 
I have entrusted me here a micro
irrigation<00:00:03.240> or<00:00:03.780> watering<00:00:04.230> system<00:00:04.560> that's

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
irrigation or watering system that's

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.010 
irrigation or watering system that's
available<00:00:04.799> on<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.310> garden<00:00:05.640> Java<00:00:05.850> EE<00:00:06.359> now<00:00:06.960> the

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
available on the garden Java EE now the

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.259 
available on the garden Java EE now the
idea<00:00:07.440> of<00:00:07.710> this<00:00:07.919> particular<00:00:08.340> system<00:00:08.700> is<00:00:08.970> that

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
idea of this particular system is that

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.410 
idea of this particular system is that
we<00:00:09.750> had<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:09.900> series<00:00:10.290> of<00:00:10.320> pots<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:11.150> baskets<00:00:12.150> and

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
we had a series of pots and baskets and

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.720 
we had a series of pots and baskets and
maybe<00:00:12.870> isolated<00:00:13.620> beds<00:00:13.830> what<00:00:14.370> we<00:00:14.519> might<00:00:14.670> want

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
maybe isolated beds what we might want

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.710 
maybe isolated beds what we might want
to<00:00:14.940> do<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.450> set<00:00:16.020> up<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.609> mini<00:00:17.609> irrigation<00:00:18.300> system

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
to do is set up a mini irrigation system

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.810 
to do is set up a mini irrigation system
where<00:00:19.140> we<00:00:19.410> connected<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.920> single<00:00:20.189> trap<00:00:20.550> and

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
where we connected to a single trap and

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.790 
where we connected to a single trap and
the<00:00:21.390> idea<00:00:21.689> would<00:00:21.930> be<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.080> once<00:00:22.439> we<00:00:22.590> set<00:00:22.769> up

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
the idea would be that once we set up

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.830 
the idea would be that once we set up
the<00:00:22.949> system<00:00:23.340> now<00:00:23.609> actually<00:00:24.000> watered<00:00:24.449> all<00:00:24.689> we

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
the system now actually watered all we

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.269 
the system now actually watered all we
have<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.050> do<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.289> we<00:00:25.380> just<00:00:25.410> turn<00:00:25.769> on<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.920> tap

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
have to do is we just turn on the tap

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.000 
have to do is we just turn on the tap
and<00:00:26.609> what<00:00:27.119> happens<00:00:27.449> next<00:00:27.630> time<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.800> that

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
and what happens next time and is that

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.880 
and what happens next time and is that
the<00:00:29.130> water<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.820> distributed<00:00:30.359> at<00:00:31.109> each<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
the water is distributed at each of the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.139 
the water is distributed at each of the
different<00:00:31.920> locations<00:00:32.489> we<00:00:32.850> want

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
different locations we want

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.510 
different locations we want
so<00:00:33.450> it's<00:00:33.750> both<00:00:33.930> ever<00:00:34.260> kind<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.890> efficient<00:00:35.280> and

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
so it's both ever kind of efficient and

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.280 
so it's both ever kind of efficient and
also<00:00:35.730> hopefully<00:00:36.239> with<00:00:36.390> your<00:00:36.420> very<00:00:36.750> very<00:00:36.930> even

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
also hopefully with your very very even

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.150 
also hopefully with your very very even
spread<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.680> water<00:00:37.890> okay<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:40.010> so<00:00:41.010> I'm<00:00:41.070> just

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
spread of water okay so and so I'm just

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.049 
spread of water okay so and so I'm just
going<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.340> give<00:00:41.489> an<00:00:41.550> overview<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.879> what's

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
going to give an overview of what's

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.430 
going to give an overview of what's
involved<00:00:42.300> in<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.570> kit<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.960> then<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.140> few<00:00:43.379> a

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
involved in the kit and then a few a

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.959 
involved in the kit and then a few a
demonstration<00:00:43.980> quickly<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.520> how<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.670> might<00:00:44.850> be

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
demonstration quickly of how it might be

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:45.619 
demonstration quickly of how it might be
put<00:00:45.120> together

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
put together

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.750 
put together
so<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.140> key<00:00:46.289> key<00:00:46.620> first<00:00:46.829> parenthood<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.579> this

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
so the key key first parenthood is this

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.450 
so the key key first parenthood is this
micro<00:00:48.539> hose<00:00:49.260> pipe<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:49.860> have<00:00:50.010> here<00:00:50.280> it's

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
micro hose pipe that we have here it's

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.910 
micro hose pipe that we have here it's
totally<00:00:50.700> 23<00:00:51.420> metres<00:00:51.750> long<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.199> it's<00:00:52.829> a

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
totally 23 metres long and it's a

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.630 
totally 23 metres long and it's a
continuous<00:00:53.489> non<00:00:54.480> porous<00:00:54.780> pipe<00:00:55.199> okay<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.399> what

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
continuous non porous pipe okay so what

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.510 
continuous non porous pipe okay so what
we<00:00:56.730> have<00:00:56.760> next<00:00:57.120> time<00:00:57.329> here<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.930> we<00:00:58.230> have<00:00:58.520> wanted

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
we have next time here is we have wanted

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.430 
we have next time here is we have wanted
to<00:00:59.550> cut<00:00:59.760> this<00:00:59.910> pipe<00:01:00.180> using<00:01:00.780> something<00:01:01.289> like

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
to cut this pipe using something like

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.399 
to cut this pipe using something like
this<00:01:01.680> snips<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:03.449> what<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:03.930> would<00:01:04.110> do<00:01:04.229> is

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
this snips here and what we would do is

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.250 
this snips here and what we would do is
we<00:01:04.530> could<00:01:04.619> put<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:05.010> t-junction<00:01:05.960> into<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.049> pipe

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
we could put a t-junction into the pipe

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.890 
we could put a t-junction into the pipe
and<00:01:07.560> tee<00:01:08.070> off<00:01:08.310> here<00:01:08.700> or<00:01:08.909> we<00:01:09.270> would<00:01:09.390> connect<00:01:09.720> on

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
and tee off here or we would connect on

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.870 
and tee off here or we would connect on
a<00:01:09.930> small<00:01:10.260> length<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.650> pipe<00:01:10.860> which<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:11.640> would

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
a small length of pipe which we would

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.820 
a small length of pipe which we would
run<00:01:12.510> directly<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> plant<00:01:13.380> or<00:01:13.560> something

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
run directly to a plant or something

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.850 
run directly to a plant or something
like<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.420> we<00:01:15.420> also<00:01:15.659> have<00:01:16.200> would<00:01:16.409> say<00:01:16.619> a

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
like this and we also have would say a

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.800 
like this and we also have would say a
joiner<00:01:17.490> here<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:17.939> we<00:01:18.060> caught<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> Python<00:01:18.750> we

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
joiner here so we caught a Python we

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.630 
joiner here so we caught a Python we
want<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.049> rejoin<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.590> again<00:01:19.799> afterwards<00:01:20.250> we

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
want to rejoin it again afterwards we

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.969 
want to rejoin it again afterwards we
have<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> number<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.210> these<00:01:21.710> straight<00:01:22.710> through

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
have a number of these straight through

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.120 
have a number of these straight through
and<00:01:23.310> joiners<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.540> also<00:01:24.780> then<00:01:25.140> have<00:01:25.200> plant

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
and joiners and we also then have plant

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.070 
and joiners and we also then have plant
stakes<00:01:26.490> here<00:01:26.820> which<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.360> simply<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.689> hold<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
stakes here which is simply to hold the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.440 
stakes here which is simply to hold the
pipe<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.439> position<00:01:28.890> into<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> earth<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.729> we

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
pipe in position into the earth and we

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.270 
pipe in position into the earth and we
have<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> number<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.020> cats<00:01:31.380> here<00:01:31.680> which<00:01:32.159> would

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
have a number of cats here which would

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.850 
have a number of cats here which would
use<00:01:32.610> per<00:01:33.150> tacking<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> cable<00:01:34.200> if<00:01:34.380> we<00:01:34.710> just

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
use per tacking in the cable if we just

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.580 
use per tacking in the cable if we just
actually<00:01:35.100> look<00:01:35.220> at<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.400> tag<00:01:35.640> here<00:01:36.320> it<00:01:37.320> fits

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
actually look at this tag here it fits

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.190 
actually look at this tag here it fits
perfectly<00:01:38.189> over<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.750> won't<00:01:39.869> pinch

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
perfectly over this so it won't pinch

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.319 
perfectly over this so it won't pinch
the<00:01:40.350> pipe<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.740> hold<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.220> securely<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:42.030> if<00:01:42.240> we

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
the pipe and hold it securely so if we

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.120 
the pipe and hold it securely so if we
wanted<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.720> nail<00:01:43.049> into<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.470> piece<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.740> timber<00:01:43.920> or

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
wanted a nail into a piece of timber or

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.280 
wanted a nail into a piece of timber or
something<00:01:44.490> next<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.450> party<00:01:45.840> would<00:01:45.930> be<00:01:45.990> ideal

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
something next to a party would be ideal

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.639 
something next to a party would be ideal
and<00:01:47.420> finally<00:01:48.420> then<00:01:48.600> what<00:01:48.810> we<00:01:48.930> have<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.409> we<00:01:49.590> have

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
and finally then what we have is we have

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.859 
and finally then what we have is we have
the<00:01:49.860> following<00:01:50.159> things<00:01:50.490> we<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.270> these<00:01:53.869> units

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
the following things we have these units

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.620 
the following things we have these units
here<00:01:55.079> which<00:01:55.649> are<00:01:55.979> we<00:01:56.189> have<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.880> line<00:01:57.119> Draper's

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
here which are we have in line Draper's

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.069 
here which are we have in line Draper's
and<00:01:57.840> we<00:01:58.380> also<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:59.130> an<00:01:59.549> end-of-line<00:02:00.210> trippers

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
and we also have an end-of-line trippers

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.139 
and we also have an end-of-line trippers
and<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.530> idea<00:02:01.829> with<00:02:01.979> these<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.460> and

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
and the idea with these is that and

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.209 
and the idea with these is that and
wanna<00:02:03.689> come<00:02:03.810> along<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.710> will<00:02:04.860> say<00:02:05.009> with<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
wanna come along and I will say with the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.160 
wanna come along and I will say with the
inline<00:02:05.640> drivers<00:02:06.119> what<00:02:06.329> we<00:02:06.600> do<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:06.899> we<00:02:07.020> simply

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
inline drivers what we do is we simply

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.570 
inline drivers what we do is we simply
push<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.649> pipe<00:02:07.799> in<00:02:08.009> on<00:02:08.129> one<00:02:08.310> side<00:02:08.550> like<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:10.580> so

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
push the pipe in on one side like so so

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.650 
push the pipe in on one side like so so
it's<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.000> Porsche

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
it's of the Porsche

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.260 
it's of the Porsche
and<00:02:13.380> see<00:02:13.560> that<00:02:13.590> we<00:02:14.400> got<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.550> pipe<00:02:14.790> on<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.060> far

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
and see that we got a pipe on the far

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.590 
and see that we got a pipe on the far
side<00:02:15.570> here<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:16.500> repeat<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.070> process<00:02:17.510> so<00:02:18.510> the

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
side here and repeat the process so the

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.450 
side here and repeat the process so the
water<00:02:18.810> will<00:02:18.990> flow<00:02:19.140> through<00:02:19.230> continuously<00:02:19.950> but

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
water will flow through continuously but

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.280 
water will flow through continuously but
there's<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.640> small<00:02:21.000> hole<00:02:21.360> at<00:02:21.600> this<00:02:21.720> point<00:02:22.020> here

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
there's a small hole at this point here

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.590 
there's a small hole at this point here
so<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:23.220> just<00:02:23.250> say<00:02:23.670> we<00:02:23.820> came<00:02:24.000> along<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.450> we<00:02:24.570> had

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
so and just say we came along and we had

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.860 
so and just say we came along and we had
this<00:02:24.870> pipe<00:02:25.680> secured<00:02:26.400> into<00:02:27.210> a<00:02:27.240> pot<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.780> I'm

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
this pipe secured into a pot and I'm

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.860 
this pipe secured into a pot and I'm
going<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.050> give<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.230> an<00:02:28.320> indication<00:02:28.440> here<00:02:28.980> now

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
going to give you an indication here now

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.120 
going to give you an indication here now
I've<00:02:30.870> had<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.140> put<00:02:31.260> this<00:02:31.350> on<00:02:31.530> this<00:02:31.710> is<00:02:31.770> a<00:02:31.920> little

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
I've had to put this on this is a little

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.400 
I've had to put this on this is a little
stand<00:02:32.370> here<00:02:32.670> we'd<00:02:32.790> have<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.540> secure<00:02:33.900> dupatta

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
stand here we'd have the secure dupatta

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.800 
stand here we'd have the secure dupatta
and<00:02:34.920> had<00:02:35.070> an<00:02:35.160> inline<00:02:35.520> dripper<00:02:35.940> all<00:02:36.360> we<00:02:36.540> do<00:02:36.690> is

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
and had an inline dripper all we do is

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.600 
and had an inline dripper all we do is
would<00:02:36.930> come<00:02:37.110> along<00:02:37.350> we<00:02:37.770> simply<00:02:38.010> push<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.430> down

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
would come along we simply push it down

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.670 
would come along we simply push it down
and<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.330> water<00:02:39.540> would<00:02:39.840> simply<00:02:40.110> continuously

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
and the water would simply continuously

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.740 
and the water would simply continuously
drip<00:02:41.070> out<00:02:41.190> at<00:02:41.460> this<00:02:41.550> point<00:02:41.850> here<00:02:42.090> into<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.570> pot

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
drip out at this point here into the pot

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.260 
drip out at this point here into the pot
okay<00:02:43.320> now<00:02:43.890> an<00:02:44.040> alternative<00:02:44.670> version<00:02:44.820> of<00:02:45.150> this

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
okay now an alternative version of this

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.500 
okay now an alternative version of this
is<00:02:45.600> when<00:02:46.200> we<00:02:46.320> go<00:02:46.470> for<00:02:47.030> something<00:02:48.030> like<00:02:48.300> an

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
is when we go for something like an

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.430 
is when we go for something like an
end-of-line<00:02:49.020> dripper

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
end-of-line dripper

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.910 
end-of-line dripper
so<00:02:50.370> what<00:02:50.460> we<00:02:50.550> do<00:02:50.700> here<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:51.440> you<00:02:52.440> simply<00:02:52.770> come

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
so what we do here is you simply come

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.590 
so what we do here is you simply come
along<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:56.430> we<00:02:56.490> push<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.910> in<00:02:57.000> like<00:02:57.030> this

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
along and we push it in like this

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.010 
along and we push it in like this
and<00:02:58.560> now<00:02:59.280> over<00:02:59.610> lose<00:02:59.910> will<00:03:00.270> once<00:03:00.450> again<00:03:00.570> stay

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
and now over lose will once again stay

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.440 
and now over lose will once again stay
could<00:03:01.230> maybe<00:03:01.950> go<00:03:02.160> back<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.430> little<00:03:02.640> bit<00:03:02.820> so<00:03:03.060> we

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
could maybe go back a little bit so we

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.390 
could maybe go back a little bit so we
stay<00:03:03.630> put<00:03:03.840> in<00:03:03.930> like<00:03:04.110> this<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.470> we<00:03:05.040> just<00:03:05.250> have

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
stay put in like this and we just have

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.370 
stay put in like this and we just have
the<00:03:05.490> bass<00:03:05.640> in<00:03:05.910> there<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.330> will<00:03:06.720> drip<00:03:06.960> the

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
the bass in there and will drip the

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.650 
the bass in there and will drip the
water<00:03:07.560> out<00:03:08.100> next<00:03:08.550> to<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.760> basin<00:03:09.180> time

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
water out next to the basin time

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.120 
water out next to the basin time
so<00:03:09.810> we<00:03:09.900> use<00:03:10.110> this<00:03:10.290> generally<00:03:10.680> would<00:03:10.830> add<00:03:10.950> would

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
so we use this generally would add would

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.490 
so we use this generally would add would
a<00:03:11.160> tea<00:03:11.430> type<00:03:11.700> construction<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:13.110> would<00:03:13.290> use

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
a tea type construction and would use

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.350 
a tea type construction and would use
this<00:03:13.710> for<00:03:14.190> an<00:03:14.610> inline<00:03:14.940> dripper

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
this for an inline dripper

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.660 
this for an inline dripper
which<00:03:15.630> is<00:03:15.750> just<00:03:15.930> parently<00:03:16.350> pipe<00:03:16.530> itself<00:03:16.860> okay

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
which is just parently pipe itself okay

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.580 
which is just parently pipe itself okay
so<00:03:18.210> how<00:03:18.510> would<00:03:18.570> we<00:03:18.690> set<00:03:19.050> up<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.350> overall

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
so how would we set up the overall

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.210 
so how would we set up the overall
system<00:03:20.100> and<00:03:21.230> well<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.320> first<00:03:22.500> thing<00:03:22.620> we<00:03:22.830> do<00:03:23.010> is

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
system and well the first thing we do is

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.450 
system and well the first thing we do is
and<00:03:23.640> we<00:03:24.300> would<00:03:24.450> come<00:03:24.600> along<00:03:24.810> here<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.460> we

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
and we would come along here and we

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.730 
and we would come along here and we
would<00:03:26.820> this<00:03:27.480> connection<00:03:27.990> here<00:03:28.200> just<00:03:28.410> screws

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
would this connection here just screws

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.100 
would this connection here just screws
onto<00:03:29.010> your<00:03:29.190> standard<00:03:29.640> garden<00:03:29.820> tap<00:03:30.240> okay<00:03:30.720> so

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
onto your standard garden tap okay so

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.840 
onto your standard garden tap okay so
let's<00:03:31.320> try<00:03:31.530> this<00:03:31.650> here<00:03:31.950> so<00:03:32.370> we<00:03:32.460> just<00:03:32.640> come

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
let's try this here so we just come

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.240 
let's try this here so we just come
along<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.270> will<00:03:33.510> screw<00:03:33.960> it<00:03:34.110> on<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.500> top<00:03:34.710> but

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
along I will screw it on to the top but

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.980 
along I will screw it on to the top but
before<00:03:35.580> we<00:03:35.730> do<00:03:35.850> that<00:03:35.880> we<00:03:36.270> come<00:03:36.450> along<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:36.720> we

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
before we do that we come along and we

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.810 
before we do that we come along and we
need<00:03:37.170> to<00:03:37.260> do<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.440> following<00:03:37.710> we<00:03:38.490> need<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:38.700> put

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
need to do the following we need to put

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.640 
need to do the following we need to put
this<00:03:38.940> unit<00:03:39.330> in<00:03:39.450> here<00:03:39.660> which<00:03:39.900> simply<00:03:40.200> restricts

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
this unit in here which simply restricts

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.070 
this unit in here which simply restricts
the<00:03:40.740> flow<00:03:40.770> of<00:03:40.950> water<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.640> it<00:03:42.510> down<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.930> the

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
the flow of water and it down to the

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.630 
the flow of water and it down to the
volume<00:03:43.380> that's<00:03:43.590> suitable<00:03:43.920> for<00:03:44.040> this<00:03:44.250> micro

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
volume that's suitable for this micro

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.000 
volume that's suitable for this micro
and<00:03:44.880> watering<00:03:45.810> hose<00:03:46.080> and<00:03:46.530> then<00:03:46.770> we<00:03:46.860> have<00:03:46.980> a

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
and watering hose and then we have a

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.400 
and watering hose and then we have a
filter<00:03:47.310> here<00:03:47.430> which<00:03:48.120> will<00:03:48.270> stop<00:03:48.510> any<00:03:48.810> dirt<00:03:49.020> and

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
filter here which will stop any dirt and

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.949 
filter here which will stop any dirt and
getting<00:03:49.950> into<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.640> pipe<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.540> then<00:03:51.690> we<00:03:51.810> just

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
getting into the pipe and then we just

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.430 
getting into the pipe and then we just
screwed<00:03:52.290> us<00:03:52.500> on<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:53.190> our<00:03:53.730> time<00:03:54.030> okay<00:03:54.780> so<00:03:55.320> with

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
screwed us on to our time okay so with

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.260 
screwed us on to our time okay so with
lock<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:55.770> into<00:03:55.890> position<00:03:56.010> now<00:03:56.640> you<00:03:56.700> could<00:03:57.000> can

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
lock it into position now you could can

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.520 
lock it into position now you could can
come<00:03:57.480> along<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:57.930> use<00:03:58.110> something<00:03:58.500> like

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
come along and use something like

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.500 
come along and use something like
plumber's<00:03:59.070> tape<00:03:59.250> here<00:03:59.520> and<00:03:59.850> to<00:04:00.030> prevent<00:04:00.240> any

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
plumber's tape here and to prevent any

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.510 
plumber's tape here and to prevent any
leakage<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.080> I<00:04:01.650> just<00:04:01.830> picked<00:04:02.040> a<00:04:02.130> point<00:04:02.280> and

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
leakage and I just picked a point and

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.120 
leakage and I just picked a point and
give<00:04:02.640> a<00:04:02.670> better<00:04:02.850> join<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:03.600> but<00:04:04.230> so<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:04.950> next

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
give a better join and but so the next

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.320 
give a better join and but so the next
thing<00:04:05.310> then<00:04:05.459> is<00:04:05.580> would<00:04:05.640> actually<00:04:05.940> coming<00:04:06.209> on

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
thing then is would actually coming on

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.210 
thing then is would actually coming on
and<00:04:06.570> will<00:04:06.660> actually<00:04:06.810> just<00:04:07.110> join<00:04:07.470> this<00:04:07.740> cable

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
and will actually just join this cable

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.090 
and will actually just join this cable
and<00:04:08.430> all<00:04:09.209> for<00:04:09.690> this<00:04:09.840> tap<00:04:10.050> connection<00:04:10.530> so<00:04:10.920> all

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
and all for this tap connection so all

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.500 
and all for this tap connection so all
we<00:04:11.280> do<00:04:11.400> here<00:04:11.640> is<00:04:11.700> that<00:04:11.880> you<00:04:11.940> can<00:04:12.060> see<00:04:12.209> this<00:04:12.360> is

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
we do here is that you can see this is

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.960 
we do here is that you can see this is
hollow<00:04:12.750> here<00:04:13.080> and<00:04:13.260> it's<00:04:13.650> quite<00:04:13.950> a<00:04:13.980> tight<00:04:14.700> fit

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
hollow here and it's quite a tight fit

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.099 
hollow here and it's quite a tight fit
so<00:04:15.270> we<00:04:15.480> just<00:04:15.660> get<00:04:15.810> this<00:04:15.930> pipe<00:04:16.200> here<00:04:18.020> and<00:04:19.020> we're

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
so we just get this pipe here and we're

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.159 
so we just get this pipe here and we're
just<00:04:19.140> screwing<00:04:19.890> and<00:04:20.570> we're<00:04:21.570> just<00:04:21.720> pushing<00:04:21.900> in

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
just screwing and we're just pushing in

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.900 
just screwing and we're just pushing in
over<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.590> length<00:04:22.770> of<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:23.010> thing<00:04:23.340> so<00:04:23.550> there's

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
over the length of the thing so there's

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.659 
over the length of the thing so there's
an<00:04:24.000> overlap<00:04:24.450> here<00:04:24.479> of<00:04:24.900> about<00:04:25.200> an<00:04:25.830> inch<00:04:25.979> or<00:04:26.220> so

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
an overlap here of about an inch or so

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.369 
an overlap here of about an inch or so
so<00:04:27.180> it's<00:04:27.300> enough<00:04:27.479> actually<00:04:27.900> to<00:04:28.050> give<00:04:28.169> a<00:04:28.199> good

00:04:28.369 --> 00:04:28.379 
so it's enough actually to give a good

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:30.200 
so it's enough actually to give a good
tight<00:04:28.680> connection<00:04:29.460> on<00:04:29.580> it<00:04:29.699> so<00:04:29.849> it<00:04:29.969> won't<00:04:30.090> come

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
tight connection on it so it won't come

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.270 
tight connection on it so it won't come
out<00:04:30.389> easily<00:04:30.659> and<00:04:30.930> Wortley<00:04:31.530> board<00:04:31.860> from<00:04:32.099> this

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
out easily and Wortley board from this

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.339 
out easily and Wortley board from this
point<00:04:32.520> either<00:04:32.759> so<00:04:33.300> would<00:04:33.419> roll<00:04:33.659> the<00:04:33.900> pipe<00:04:34.110> out

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
point either so would roll the pipe out

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:36.019 
point either so would roll the pipe out
and<00:04:34.800> when<00:04:35.099> we<00:04:35.189> get<00:04:35.279> to<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.490> point<00:04:35.669> where<00:04:35.939> we

00:04:36.019 --> 00:04:36.029 
and when we get to the point where we

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:37.850 
and when we get to the point where we
want<00:04:36.210> to<00:04:36.240> put<00:04:36.389> in<00:04:36.539> our<00:04:36.599> force<00:04:36.900> T<00:04:37.139> will<00:04:37.740> do

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
want to put in our force T will do

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.950 
want to put in our force T will do
exactly<00:04:38.039> as<00:04:38.370> I<00:04:38.490> said<00:04:38.759> before<00:04:38.909> we<00:04:39.569> would<00:04:39.719> pay

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
exactly as I said before we would pay

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.409 
exactly as I said before we would pay
coming<00:04:40.289> on<00:04:40.409> and<00:04:40.650> get<00:04:41.099> this<00:04:41.249> coffers<00:04:41.909> here<00:04:42.090> and

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
coming on and get this coffers here and

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:48.499 
coming on and get this coffers here and
simply<00:04:42.749> cut<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.139> cable<00:04:43.499> and<00:04:43.699> then<00:04:47.389> what<00:04:48.389> we

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
simply cut the cable and then what we

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.600 
simply cut the cable and then what we
would<00:04:48.659> do<00:04:48.810> is<00:04:49.050> we<00:04:49.830> would<00:04:49.860> simply<00:04:50.249> put<00:04:50.460> this

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
would do is we would simply put this

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.339 
would do is we would simply put this
connection<00:04:51.180> in<00:04:51.389> here<00:04:51.659> like<00:04:51.810> this<00:04:52.249> and<00:04:54.229> T<00:04:55.229> it

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
connection in here like this and T it

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.800 
connection in here like this and T it
off<00:04:55.499> like<00:04:55.889> this<00:04:55.919> and<00:04:56.310> then<00:04:57.210> we<00:04:57.360> would<00:04:57.509> put<00:04:57.569> the

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
off like this and then we would put the

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.350 
off like this and then we would put the
dripper<00:04:58.020> unit<00:04:58.409> as<00:04:58.620> a<00:04:58.650> shield<00:04:58.919> area<00:04:59.279> onto<00:05:00.120> the

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
dripper unit as a shield area onto the

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.939 
dripper unit as a shield area onto the
end<00:05:00.569> of<00:05:00.629> this<00:05:00.810> and<00:05:01.080> would<00:05:01.409> feed<00:05:01.590> our<00:05:01.740> first

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
end of this and would feed our first

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:04.879 
end of this and would feed our first
party<00:05:02.340> okay<00:05:02.819> and<00:05:03.150> so<00:05:04.110> we<00:05:04.199> just<00:05:04.349> continued<00:05:04.800> up

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
party okay and so we just continued up

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.080 
party okay and so we just continued up
through<00:05:05.099> the<00:05:05.219> entire<00:05:05.490> length<00:05:05.699> of<00:05:05.819> the<00:05:05.909> thing

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
through the entire length of the thing

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.839 
through the entire length of the thing
so<00:05:06.360> the<00:05:07.050> 23<00:05:07.529> meters<00:05:07.860> length<00:05:08.039> is<00:05:08.460> quite<00:05:08.819> a

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 
so the 23 meters length is quite a

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:11.119 
so the 23 meters length is quite a
generous<00:05:09.629> if<00:05:10.169> you<00:05:10.259> had<00:05:10.409> a<00:05:10.439> relatively<00:05:10.830> small

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:11.129 
generous if you had a relatively small

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:12.769 
generous if you had a relatively small
area<00:05:11.159> with<00:05:11.520> a<00:05:11.580> number<00:05:11.819> of<00:05:11.909> baskets<00:05:12.360> like<00:05:12.479> its

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
ideal and the great thing about it here

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.490 
ideal and the great thing about it here
is<00:05:14.669> you're<00:05:14.789> not<00:05:14.909> watering<00:05:15.240> areas<00:05:16.139> in<00:05:16.289> between

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
is you're not watering areas in between

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.990 
is you're not watering areas in between
which<00:05:17.009> you<00:05:17.099> might<00:05:17.219> be<00:05:17.370> doing<00:05:17.610> if<00:05:17.729> you're<00:05:17.849> using

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
which you might be doing if you're using

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.999 
which you might be doing if you're using
something<00:05:18.330> like<00:05:18.479> a<00:05:18.569> sprinkler<00:05:19.020> system<00:05:19.050> now

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:20.009 
something like a sprinkler system now

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:21.439 
something like a sprinkler system now
you<00:05:20.339> might<00:05:20.550> make<00:05:20.759> a<00:05:20.819> decision<00:05:21.210> that<00:05:21.330> you<00:05:21.419> have

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
you might make a decision that you have

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:23.209 
you might make a decision that you have
a<00:05:21.599> drip<00:05:21.870> or<00:05:21.990> at<00:05:22.080> a<00:05:22.110> certain<00:05:22.469> point<00:05:22.620> and<00:05:23.159> you

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:23.219 
a drip or at a certain point and you

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:24.709 
a drip or at a certain point and you
want<00:05:23.370> to<00:05:23.490> remove<00:05:23.729> it<00:05:23.909> from<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:24.120> circuit<00:05:24.479> or

00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:24.719 
want to remove it from the circuit or

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:27.230 
want to remove it from the circuit or
you<00:05:25.349> might<00:05:25.499> come<00:05:26.219> you<00:05:26.669> might<00:05:26.819> actually<00:05:26.999> have<00:05:27.210> a

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
you might come you might actually have a

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.269 
you might come you might actually have a
termination<00:05:27.779> at<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.080> end<00:05:28.199> that<00:05:28.319> 23<00:05:28.800> meters<00:05:29.129> or

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:29.279 
termination at the end that 23 meters or

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:31.309 
termination at the end that 23 meters or
maybe<00:05:29.430> after<00:05:29.550> 15<00:05:30.150> meters<00:05:30.509> where<00:05:31.050> you<00:05:31.139> don't

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.319 
maybe after 15 meters where you don't

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:32.689 
maybe after 15 meters where you don't
want<00:05:31.469> to<00:05:31.560> have<00:05:31.710> water<00:05:31.949> just<00:05:32.219> dripping<00:05:32.460> onto

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
want to have water just dripping onto

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.269 
want to have water just dripping onto
the<00:05:32.819> end<00:05:33.000> of<00:05:33.089> it<00:05:33.210> and<00:05:33.500> inside<00:05:34.500> here<00:05:34.860> we<00:05:35.069> have

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:35.279 
the end of it and inside here we have

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:37.519 
the end of it and inside here we have
these<00:05:35.400> and<00:05:35.990> units<00:05:36.990> here<00:05:37.169> for<00:05:37.409> actually

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:37.529 
these and units here for actually

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:39.920 
these and units here for actually
bending<00:05:38.339> back<00:05:38.490> the<00:05:38.669> pipe<00:05:38.849> and<00:05:39.120> to<00:05:39.599> stop<00:05:39.810> the

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
bending back the pipe and to stop the

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.050 
bending back the pipe and to stop the
circulation<00:05:40.110> of<00:05:40.560> water<00:05:40.800> so<00:05:41.370> we<00:05:41.550> just<00:05:41.699> use<00:05:41.879> one

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
circulation of water so we just use one

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.969 
circulation of water so we just use one
of<00:05:42.089> these<00:05:42.210> end<00:05:42.509> units<00:05:42.960> here<00:05:43.139> we<00:05:43.589> just<00:05:43.740> get<00:05:43.860> this

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
of these end units here we just get this

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:45.439 
of these end units here we just get this
pipe<00:05:44.189> here<00:05:44.399> and<00:05:44.580> I'll<00:05:44.729> bend<00:05:45.000> it<00:05:45.149> back<00:05:45.270> like

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
pipe here and I'll bend it back like

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.519 
pipe here and I'll bend it back like
this<00:05:45.509> what<00:05:46.500> we<00:05:46.620> do<00:05:46.770> then<00:05:46.949> is<00:05:46.979> we<00:05:47.819> simply<00:05:48.529> push

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:49.529 
this what we do then is we simply push

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:51.379 
this what we do then is we simply push
it<00:05:49.710> in<00:05:49.800> here<00:05:50.069> like<00:05:50.099> this<00:05:50.460> and<00:05:51.000> you<00:05:51.089> can<00:05:51.210> see

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
it in here like this and you can see

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:54.079 
it in here like this and you can see
here<00:05:51.659> this<00:05:52.080> actually<00:05:52.529> causes<00:05:52.860> a<00:05:53.039> total<00:05:53.550> 180

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:54.089 
here this actually causes a total 180

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:56.029 
here this actually causes a total 180
degree<00:05:54.569> bend<00:05:54.839> over<00:05:55.139> and<00:05:55.379> to<00:05:55.589> stop<00:05:55.830> water

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 
degree bend over and to stop water

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:58.730 
degree bend over and to stop water
leaking<00:05:56.580> out<00:05:56.729> from<00:05:56.759> that<00:05:57.000> point<00:05:57.529> so<00:05:58.529> as<00:05:58.649> you

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
leaking out from that point so as you

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.709 
leaking out from that point so as you
can<00:05:58.860> see<00:05:59.009> it's<00:05:59.310> a<00:05:59.399> very<00:05:59.430> very<00:05:59.639> simple<00:06:00.180> it's

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:00.719 
can see it's a very very simple it's

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:03.409 
can see it's a very very simple it's
very<00:06:00.810> very<00:06:01.259> flexible<00:06:01.500> and<00:06:02.039> if<00:06:02.879> it's<00:06:03.089> installed

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
very very flexible and if it's installed

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:04.760 
very very flexible and if it's installed
correctly<00:06:03.629> it'll<00:06:04.020> actually<00:06:04.169> work<00:06:04.469> very<00:06:04.500> well

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
correctly it'll actually work very well

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.219 
correctly it'll actually work very well
and<00:06:05.159> I<00:06:05.849> have<00:06:06.210> to<00:06:06.479> say<00:06:06.629> I<00:06:06.659> was<00:06:06.810> actually<00:06:06.930> quite

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
and I have to say I was actually quite

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:08.929 
and I have to say I was actually quite
quite<00:06:07.439> pleasantly<00:06:07.860> surprised<00:06:08.279> by<00:06:08.490> testing

00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:08.939 
quite pleasantly surprised by testing

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:10.369 
quite pleasantly surprised by testing
this<00:06:09.029> product<00:06:09.389> from<00:06:09.719> that<00:06:09.930> actually<00:06:10.199> quite

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:10.379 
this product from that actually quite

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:12.529 
this product from that actually quite
good
