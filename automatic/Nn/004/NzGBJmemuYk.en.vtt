00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.270
 hello everyone this is my first I'm telling you and I'm going to tell you about a great memory 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.349
 of the childhood of the Argentines that we were born and grew up in the 90's 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:12.349
 disappeared dick cheney's argentine cable channel whose story 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.880
 I'll tell you later about Dick Cheney was a television channel 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.940
 child who belonged to the pramer company in association with the 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.990
 disappeared toy import company cártama 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.070
 Although the channel was presented in mid-1989, the channel's great debut went to 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.429
 early 1990s 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.610
 quickly became one of the first cable channels for children of 

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:39.050
 Argentina and had a 24-hour program 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.190
 was the successor of magical cable the signal for children with which 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.700
 Cablevisión had a moment ago 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.580
 the main objective of the signal was to promote the toys that cardboard 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.470
 it mattered that they were mainly products manufactured by the company 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.400
 American business for which Cartán had a distribution contract 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.620
 exclusive in argentina 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.800
 all the publicity runs of the signal showed a commercial cardboard 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.390
 followed by others of remembered products of tico like spit facts cites kics 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.090
 typhoon chatanooga choo choo and domino rali among others 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.870
 these original tiko commercials and dubbed into Spanish are so or more 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.750
 remembered that the cartoons that the channel transmitted 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.060
 As an example of this strategy, it is enough to remember the publicity of the day of 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.990
 daughter adopted which the point of the letter i of the logo of the channel sang 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.980
 the next song tell your godfather tell your godmother that the day 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.740
 of the daughter is not yet to come 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.640
 tell your godfather tell your godmother that the gifts are decant 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.520
 in his period of glory the signal brought to the market varied merchandaising between 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.680
 those that stand out the CD titled daily avai play with the 1994 bid and the 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.249
 monthly magazine big magazine published since September 1994 until the end of 

00:01:55.249 --> 00:02:01.529
 995 at the beginning of 1996 and the second and last olympic CD entitled 'music 

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:02.580
 of the bid 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.300
 the channel closed its programming momentarily during the summer of 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.409
 1995 since cartán broke that same year 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:14.609
 In its place, the directors of the pramer producer decided to launch a 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:17.649
 sign 100% own malick and c's 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:21.309
 of said in the timidly returning to the programming of cablevisión and of 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:26.969
 different cable operators of Argentina in February 1996 in full reign of 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:30.199
 malick hits as the most watched cable channel in argentina 

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:33.759
 his return was humble as it became a signal of low 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:36.279
 May satellite budget and kits 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:40.840
 his goal in this period was to broadcast unattractive series for 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:44.179
 the public that plan was forced to buy in packages 

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:47.899
 promotional along with others that did interest him for malikí c's 

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:51.329
 so that you dedicate yourself in it became a channel that transmitted 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.129
 series of second level or series that malick hits had stopped transmitting 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.129
 but whose contracts had not yet expired 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:03.439
 well without quality programming and without the classic cardboard advertising the 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.069
 channel lost its spirit and its audience 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.319
