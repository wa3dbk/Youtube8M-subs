one<00:02:21.700> thing<00:02:21.850> to<00:02:21.880> note<00:02:22.150> is<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.390> time

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
one thing to note is the time

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
real-time is a minute in the game so

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.010 
real-time is a minute in the game so
every<00:02:26.740> 60<00:02:27.070> seconds<00:02:27.370> is<00:02:27.490> an<00:02:27.610> hour<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.030> every<00:02:28.480> 24

every 60 seconds is an hour and every 24

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.900 
every 60 seconds is an hour and every 24
minutes<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.410> day<00:02:29.620> that<00:02:29.830> means<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:30.580> every

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
minutes is a day that means that every

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.660 
minutes is a day that means that every
24<00:02:31.390> hour<00:02:31.510> period<00:02:31.810> is<00:02:32.170> equivalent<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.040> 60<00:02:33.520> days

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
24 hour period is equivalent to 60 days

since<00:03:17.380> our<00:03:17.530> last<00:03:17.650> save<00:03:18.210> we<00:03:19.210> didn't<00:03:19.420> have

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
since our last save we didn't have

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.280 
since our last save we didn't have
having<00:03:19.660> to<00:03:19.720> relaunch<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:20.140> server<00:03:22.140> when<00:03:23.140> we're

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
having to relaunch a server when we're

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.660 
having to relaunch a server when we're
in<00:03:23.410> launch<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:23.710> server<00:03:23.980> this<00:03:24.220> actually<00:03:24.550> brings

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
in launch a server this actually brings

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.470 
in launch a server this actually brings
you<00:03:24.850> back<00:03:25.000> to<00:03:25.060> day<00:03:25.510> one<00:03:25.750> at<00:03:26.020> 7am<00:03:27.360> we<00:03:28.360> were

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
you back to day one at 7am we were

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.670 
you back to day one at 7am we were
running<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.810> server<00:03:28.930> 24-7<00:03:30.240> so<00:03:31.240> we<00:03:31.690> did<00:03:32.410> know

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
running the server 24-7 so we did know

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.740 
running the server 24-7 so we did know
this<00:03:32.890> but<00:03:33.070> when<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:33.459> actually<00:03:33.610> close<00:03:34.540> the

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
this but when you actually close the

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.300 
this but when you actually close the
game<00:03:34.900> out<00:03:34.930> like<00:03:35.260> close<00:03:35.500> game<00:03:35.800> server<00:03:36.040> and

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
game out like close game server and

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.990 
game out like close game server and
relaunch<00:03:37.030> it<00:03:37.440> you<00:03:38.440> actually<00:03:39.070> start<00:03:39.730> at<00:03:39.880> day

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
relaunch it you actually start at day

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.500 
relaunch it you actually start at day
one<00:03:40.240> when<00:03:40.780> that<00:03:40.959> server<00:03:41.200> it<00:03:41.380> launches<00:03:41.800> so

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
one when that server it launches so

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.850 
one when that server it launches so
depending<00:03:43.510> on<00:03:43.600> how<00:03:43.690> you<00:03:43.750> want<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:43.990> play<00:03:44.110> if<00:03:44.500> you

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
you can just turn the server off at

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.340 
you can just turn the server off at
night<00:03:49.890> we<00:03:50.890> played<00:03:51.040> for<00:03:51.280> 55<00:03:52.150> game<00:03:52.420> days<00:03:52.660> which

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
night we played for 55 game days which

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.500 
night we played for 55 game days which
is<00:03:53.530> two<00:03:54.160> hours<00:03:54.310> of<00:03:54.550> real<00:03:54.700> time<00:03:54.880> before<00:03:55.270> making

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
is two hours of real time before making

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.030 
is two hours of real time before making
it<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:55.930> location<00:03:56.170> where<00:03:56.380> we<00:03:56.530> built<00:03:56.890> our

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
it to the location where we built our

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.660 
it to the location where we built our
main<00:03:57.190> fortress<00:03:58.140> and<00:03:59.160> like<00:04:00.160> I<00:04:00.250> said<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.489> server

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
main fortress and like I said the server

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.540 
main fortress and like I said the server
running<00:04:00.850> twenty-four<00:04:01.270> seven<00:04:02.160> your<00:04:03.160> game<00:04:03.400> will

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
running twenty-four seven your game will

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.320 
running twenty-four seven your game will
advance<00:04:03.790> 60<00:04:04.209> days<00:04:04.360> every<00:04:04.690> 24<00:04:05.110> hours<00:04:05.550> so<00:04:06.550> we<00:04:07.180> ran

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
advance 60 days every 24 hours so we ran

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.010 
advance 60 days every 24 hours so we ran

the particular server 45 total days of

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.199 
the particular server 45 total days of
real<00:04:11.020> time<00:04:11.290> which<00:04:11.739> is<00:04:11.770> equivalent<00:04:12.580> to<00:04:12.820> about<00:04:13.090> a

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
real time which is equivalent to about a

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.280 
real time which is equivalent to about a
year<00:04:13.330> of<00:04:14.290> gameplay<00:04:15.840> several<00:04:16.840> resets<00:04:17.169> in

year of gameplay several resets in

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.740 
year of gameplay several resets in
between<00:04:17.560> of<00:04:17.680> course<00:04:17.919> and<00:04:18.480> basically<00:04:19.480> after

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
between of course and basically after

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.060 
between of course and basically after
that<00:04:19.870> five<00:04:20.080> days<00:04:20.320> that's<00:04:20.709> when<00:04:20.890> everything

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
that five days that's when everything

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.040 
that five days that's when everything
totally<00:04:21.609> glitched<00:04:21.790> out<00:04:22.030> and<00:04:22.300> we<00:04:22.810> ended<00:04:22.960> up

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
totally glitched out and we ended up

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.920 
totally glitched out and we ended up
actually<00:04:23.230> making<00:04:23.590> a<00:04:24.040> video<00:04:24.790> of<00:04:25.210> us<00:04:25.450> blowing<00:04:25.810> up

of effort to maintain a game for a long
time<00:04:43.190> by<00:04:43.370> yourself<00:04:43.510> it's<00:04:44.510> very<00:04:44.600> difficult<00:04:44.840> to

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
time by yourself it's very difficult to

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.510 
time by yourself it's very difficult to

the game is kind of far from development
person<00:05:34.820> I<00:05:34.940> think<00:05:35.120> it's<00:05:35.210> a<00:05:35.270> little<00:05:35.330> bit<00:05:35.480> too

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
person I think it's a little bit too

person I think it's a little bit too
much<00:05:35.810> i<00:05:36.140> think<00:05:36.500> twenty<00:05:36.680> dollars<00:05:37.040> is<00:05:37.160> kind<00:05:37.340> of

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
much i think twenty dollars is kind of

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.940 
much i think twenty dollars is kind of
that<00:05:37.520> sweet<00:05:37.730> spot<00:05:37.850> but<00:05:38.750> you<00:05:39.080> know<00:05:39.500> consider

I think this says a lot about the

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.350 
I think this says a lot about the
interest<00:06:15.830> in<00:06:15.950> these<00:06:16.040> types<00:06:16.280> of<00:06:16.400> games<00:06:16.460> with

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
from their last estimate and I mean

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.150 
from their last estimate and I mean
there's<00:06:21.200> definitely<00:06:21.500> thousands<00:06:21.890> of<00:06:21.950> people

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 
with our opinion of the game so far it

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.520 
with our opinion of the game so far it
definitely<00:06:35.150> needs<00:06:35.360> some<00:06:35.420> work<00:06:35.690> there's<00:06:36.350> a<00:06:36.410> lot

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
there's a lot of glitches but even in

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.710 
there's a lot of glitches but even in
its<00:06:39.890> current<00:06:40.070> state<00:06:40.190> it's<00:06:40.760> extremely<00:06:41.210> fun<00:06:41.540> and
