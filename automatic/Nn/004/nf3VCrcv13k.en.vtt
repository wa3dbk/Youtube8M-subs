 Introducing 3G Communication Platform 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.369
 Figure showing the engineering sample chip 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:19.109
 1 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.999
 There is virtually no app communication 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:25.079
 I want ghz close to the actual service 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.169
 I was showing 70 megabps speed from jail 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.280
 The software is actually 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.940
 The arcade game terminal made in the last season and 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.860
 In order to connect to a PC, it is 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.620
 I got it 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.620
 At this point, I can not go up and my eyes are turning 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.990
 So far 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.990

 One device will be Maako 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.790
 Take advantage of base station simulators etc. 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.290
 There is no one who connected to Bonn 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.580
 I got the data there 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.860
 On the other hand excess reaction 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.310

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.760
 70's as per f1 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.740
 ms will not come out 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.140
 Speaking of intelligence, it is strong and hard for the existing 3g service. 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.590
 Launched Google service and was third in one 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.480
 The stage is a sag on providing terminals for everyone 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.170
 I also did a poster for the service of 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.560
 Let's go ahead 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.850
 Even without the series many times 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.500
 Seamlessly call one after another 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.610
 I think that I want to do the grandfather's hand like I saw

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.510
 web baseband processing lsi 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.800
 Next to it 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.150
 3g baseband processing lsi is installed 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.750

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.100
 We want to provide a data communication service of ltd. Within 2009 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.140
 am thinking 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.440
 After that, we will expand to hot spring's improved mobile phone terminal 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.440
 It's a schedule
