00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.370
 [Music] 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.360
 of course , jock we show gta san 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.830
 andreas can download legally 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.710
 and then you can gamble online 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.960
 and offline are three easy steps 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.940
 to play together and play 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.810
 that's even two steps like that 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.789
 So everything goes to the internet 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.560
 respectively in the first in the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.330
 description 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.099
 and then we come to gamespot.com 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.039
 you can see that by itself 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.420
 a legal website and nobody is 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.250
 The owners can also upload from 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.440
 even and you can tell already 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.480
 otherwise nothing is running 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.260
 Just make virus scanners and do it 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.340
 unterland 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.379
 so now it 's different here 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.700
 then pull it on your desktop or 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.739
 any folder higher games 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.809
 we are coming to this store 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.660
 document here from ramsdorf ii you 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.579
 needs winrar or some reason 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.190
 I grab the program for example 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.899
 recommend it then lures it on the win 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.550
 desktop or ok and save 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.829
 should first right click here 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.799
 I have a pact unpack here 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.990
 such a folder out double- click times 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.650
 so circulated only single player could play 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.540
 stop now that we have the 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.189
 billing me just 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.369
 Double click on the gta san andreas 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.630
 excel or underlined it saw this completely 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.430
 simply double click on one 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.040
 otherwise still gamble online 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.689
 they want to stay tuned now 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.970
 and yes people want tips full 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.530
 metz even say so how can I 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.030
 I say otherwise quite simply 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.439
 we go to the second next to the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.299
 description or to the people you 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.700
 do it manually 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:37.049
 So I can do it now 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.400
 with google a sng scans the first link 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.500
 might already be a lot 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.780
 san andreas say here but bigger 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.090
 from Andreas Tempo, that is little 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.630
 to which we on it and was able to this 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.869
 website 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.560
 if I can here to download 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.720
 here 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.070
 from this it could be here by 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.930
 choose one of these three downloads 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.600
 one is the same only other hoster 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.369
 so have taken to get here 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.860
 I 've already moved to the west like that 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.770
 an installation program easy with 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.840
 double-click and yes here 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.190
 you can read if you want me 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.750
 only a percent of you thought that would be 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.180
 but read that again expresses its 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.879
 got on your own and now it is whole 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.140
 important is a couple of expensive computers we 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.810
 Can not live in style 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.209
 simply because computer is that 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.010
 program not that simply said 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.830
 you have to give the new team from now on 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.690
 He will do it and would have to say 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.920
 More from the mirror stores I have 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.260
 saved here on the desktop so 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.510
 so saved this folder really 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.310
 desktop and here this folder gta san 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:45.260
 andreas the chosen one and wow 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:49.110
 It can be characterized enters the finsternis 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.670
 gives a look at finnish sony in gta san 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.580
 Andreas Oppler has files 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.980
 Once made this gentleman how important 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.180
 is most important files from all over 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.519
 that could be the online mode 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.510
 start and the gta san andreas is after 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.330
 as before , do not gamble offline so a 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:10.230
 bitter end 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:12.659
 watch also documented a mode so 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.760
 kill weapons what do i know all titles 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.590
 already looked at very carefully 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.430
 you just grow up and cars and 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.560
 that's how it always was 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.870
 more to the multiplayer we start this 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.810
 sap connection i believe i'm the endgame 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.769
 show because she knows she has the games 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.489
 do not look 55 - so we come now 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.519
 this minimum 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.650
 Here we can get a new server 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.730
 so you can enter the third in 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.440
 the description go there is one 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.019
 nice server with the nice servers 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.670
 German Russian English but I the 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.069
 Russian though not the best movies 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.450
 because the simple most clue is so 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.769
 only her writing is and was left 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.269
 and yes I have it like me maybe 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.409
 one or the other has already noticed 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.599
 yes everything hidden like in 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:59.069
 foreign advertising but twice in the summer of 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.739
 I also wanted to play an active role 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.360
 knew me to enjoy writing as a 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.580
 had to write server-only times as 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.670
 a copy from the internet and on this 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.590
 field to go 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.480
 because I copied this, I would have to 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.040
 wanted to be them within four from 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.010
 Write to the basket then gives here 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.010
 simply pia presses christoph kainz 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.419
 long stood here the server clicks her 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.480
 Once Minister was after John Watts 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.810
 and press this tick on this 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.620
 triangle square tuesdays connect has 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.380
 dripped and then the game starts 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.320
 automatically yes where the band just over 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.940
 escape and get ready for size and should 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.240
 just specify a bit of password 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.550
 he stands then select your password 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.380
 fits there is simply something will be 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.639
 so you do not log anyone account 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.650
 can is similar to minecraft 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.210
 mode charging servers with so 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.550
 cracks can play with it 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.710
 no glasses and took one 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.060
 bell tower so I hope I could you 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.070
