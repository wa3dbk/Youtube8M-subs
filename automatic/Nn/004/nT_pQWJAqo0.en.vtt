00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
string strung on the second hole so you

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.540 
string strung on the second hole so you
can<00:01:04.330> see<00:01:04.479> appears<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:05.080> first<00:01:06.070> I<00:01:06.220> will<00:01:06.400> hole

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
can see appears the first I will hole

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.760 
can see appears the first I will hole
and<00:01:06.760> I've<00:01:06.880> got<00:01:07.060> strung<00:01:07.390> through<00:01:08.170> the<00:01:08.320> second

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
and I've got strung through the second

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.290 
and I've got strung through the second
so<00:01:09.400> I'm<00:01:09.490> going<00:01:09.610> to<00:01:09.670> go<00:01:09.820> ahead<00:01:09.909> and<00:01:11.220> put<00:01:12.220> my

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
so I'm going to go ahead and put my

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.090 
so I'm going to go ahead and put my
sidewall<00:01:13.300> string<00:01:13.600> in<00:01:13.840> through<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.650> outside

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
sidewall string in through the outside

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.120 
sidewall string in through the outside
of<00:01:15.159> the<00:01:15.850> third<00:01:16.270> hole<00:01:16.570> in<00:01:16.900> the<00:01:17.170> sub<00:01:17.409> wall<00:01:17.619> just

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
of the third hole in the sub wall just

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.210 
of the third hole in the sub wall just
like<00:01:18.280> that<00:01:18.460> and<00:01:18.729> then<00:01:19.270> come<00:01:19.600> up<00:01:19.869> and<00:01:20.619> under

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
like that and then come up and under

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.999 
like that and then come up and under
that<00:01:21.430> first<00:01:21.759> ten<00:01:22.060> diamond<00:01:22.360> Romesh<00:01:22.750> and<00:01:23.050> then

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
that first ten diamond Romesh and then

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.380 
that first ten diamond Romesh and then
back<00:01:24.340> in<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:24.790> outside<00:01:25.210> of<00:01:25.509> that<00:01:25.869> third<00:01:26.170> hole

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
back in the outside of that third hole

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.700 
back in the outside of that third hole
so<00:01:28.390> to<00:01:28.479> make<00:01:28.659> a<00:01:28.690> loop<00:01:28.990> that'll<00:01:29.320> pull<00:01:29.530> that

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
so to make a loop that'll pull that

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.249 
so to make a loop that'll pull that
whole<00:01:30.280> a<00:01:30.310> mesh<00:01:30.610> really<00:01:30.729> tight<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:31.270> back<00:01:31.990> up

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
whole a mesh really tight and back up

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.499 
whole a mesh really tight and back up
through<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:32.560> bottom<00:01:32.890> of<00:01:32.979> that<00:01:33.070> mesh<00:01:33.280> hole<00:01:33.509> and

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
through the bottom of that mesh hole and

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:35.880 
through the bottom of that mesh hole and
then<00:01:34.660> since<00:01:34.899> this<00:01:35.020> top<00:01:35.259> string<00:01:35.410> was<00:01:35.679> kind<00:01:35.860> of

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
then since this top string was kind of

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.609 
then since this top string was kind of
big<00:01:36.070> I<00:01:36.220> want<00:01:36.369> to<00:01:36.550> fall<00:01:36.759> through<00:01:36.789> but<00:01:37.420> not<00:01:37.619> gonna

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
big I want to fall through but not gonna

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.840 
big I want to fall through but not gonna
go<00:01:38.679> back<00:01:38.920> in<00:01:39.190> through<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:41.140> outside<00:01:41.619> of<00:01:41.950> that

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
go back in through the outside of that

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.669 
go back in through the outside of that
hole<00:01:43.119> again<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:44.710> same<00:01:45.039> third<00:01:45.940> sidewall<00:01:46.450> hole

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
hole again that same third sidewall hole

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:48.930 
hole again that same third sidewall hole
just<00:01:47.679> one<00:01:47.860> more<00:01:48.009> time<00:01:48.220> make<00:01:48.429> a<00:01:48.460> loop<00:01:48.729> that<00:01:48.850> will

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
just one more time make a loop that will

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.940 
just one more time make a loop that will
keep<00:01:49.060> it<00:01:49.179> really<00:01:49.990> tight<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:50.440> keep<00:01:50.590> that<00:01:50.710> knot

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
keep it really tight and keep that knot

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.219 
keep it really tight and keep that knot
from<00:01:51.130> falling<00:01:51.520> through<00:01:51.550> and<00:01:52.270> back<00:01:52.600> up<00:01:52.869> through

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
from falling through and back up through

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.180 
from falling through and back up through
the<00:01:53.350> back<00:01:53.560> and<00:01:54.039> out<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.149> front<00:01:55.390> again

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
the back and out the front again

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.430 
the back and out the front again
so<00:01:58.770> then<00:01:59.770> I'm<00:02:00.070> gonna<00:02:00.250> skip<00:02:00.700> to<00:02:01.060> sab<00:02:01.390> walls<00:02:01.660> so

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
so then I'm gonna skip to sab walls so

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.020 
so then I'm gonna skip to sab walls so
one<00:02:02.860> two<00:02:03.550> come<00:02:04.539> down<00:02:04.720> to<00:02:04.840> this<00:02:04.959> next<00:02:05.229> one<00:02:05.410> in

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
one two come down to this next one in

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.419 
one two come down to this next one in
interlock<00:02:07.030> that<00:02:07.060> second<00:02:07.750> mesh<00:02:07.899> hole<00:02:08.130> down<00:02:09.130> to

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
interlock that second mesh hole down to

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.330 
interlock that second mesh hole down to
that<00:02:09.580> sidewall<00:02:10.090> so<00:02:10.420> go<00:02:10.569> into<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.020> outside<00:02:11.410> up

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
that sidewall so go into the outside up

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.339 
that sidewall so go into the outside up
through<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.880> bottom<00:02:13.330> of<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.780> second<00:02:14.170> mesh

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
through the bottom of the second mesh

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.860 
through the bottom of the second mesh
hole<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:14.770> up<00:02:15.520> under<00:02:16.030> that<00:02:16.300> string

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
hole and up under that string

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.050 
hole and up under that string
can<00:02:17.470> you<00:02:17.530> help<00:02:17.620> interlocking<00:02:18.220> look<00:02:18.790> up<00:02:18.910> my

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
can you help interlocking look up my

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.420 
can you help interlocking look up my
nicer<00:02:19.270> toriel<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:20.650> pull<00:02:20.890> that<00:02:21.010> really<00:02:21.220> tight

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
nicer toriel and pull that really tight

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.410 
nicer toriel and pull that really tight
then<00:02:22.120> we're<00:02:22.209> gonna<00:02:22.330> skip<00:02:22.660> one<00:02:23.200> more<00:02:23.380> mesh<00:02:23.560> hole

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
then we're gonna skip one more mesh hole

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.910 
then we're gonna skip one more mesh hole
interlock<00:02:25.420> or<00:02:25.660> one<00:02:25.810> more<00:02:25.930> Sabo<00:02:26.200> hole<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.830> know

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
interlock or one more Sabo hole you know

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.180 
interlock or one more Sabo hole you know
like<00:02:27.099> that<00:02:27.280> third<00:02:27.580> mesh<00:02:27.849> hole<00:02:28.770> down<00:02:29.770> after

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
like that third mesh hole down after

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.780 
like that third mesh hole down after
skipping<00:02:30.550> several<00:02:30.849> hole<00:02:31.209> and<00:02:32.190> then<00:02:33.190> finally

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
skipping several hole and then finally

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.430 
skipping several hole and then finally
we're<00:02:33.879> going<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.060> skip<00:02:34.300> one<00:02:34.720> more<00:02:34.930> sidewall

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
we're going to skip one more sidewall

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.920 
we're going to skip one more sidewall
hole<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:36.959> go<00:02:37.959> in<00:02:38.319> the<00:02:38.860> next<00:02:39.160> one<00:02:39.810> into<00:02:40.810> the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
hole and go in the next one into the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.229 
hole and go in the next one into the
outside<00:02:41.319> up<00:02:42.280> through<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.849> bottom<00:02:43.000> of<00:02:43.120> the

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
outside up through the bottom of the

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.990 
outside up through the bottom of the
mesh<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:44.010> interlock<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:45.340> fourth<00:02:45.670> hole<00:02:45.879> of

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
mesh and interlock that fourth hole of

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.930 
mesh and interlock that fourth hole of
mesh<00:02:46.120> down<00:02:46.739> so<00:02:47.739> I<00:02:48.040> make<00:02:48.280> sure<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.459> pull<00:02:48.700> all

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
mesh down so I make sure to pull all

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.059 
mesh down so I make sure to pull all
those<00:02:49.090> really<00:02:49.330> tightly<00:02:49.650> make<00:02:50.650> sure<00:02:50.830> you<00:02:50.920> get

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
those really tightly make sure you get

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.910 
those really tightly make sure you get
that<00:02:51.250> nice<00:02:51.459> defined<00:02:51.849> channel<00:02:52.270> and<00:02:52.800> run<00:02:53.800> you

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
that nice defined channel and run you

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.410 
that nice defined channel and run you
guys<00:02:54.069> through<00:02:54.129> that<00:02:54.340> one<00:02:54.550> more<00:02:54.700> time<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.269> we

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
guys through that one more time so we

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.100 
guys through that one more time so we
did<00:02:55.660> our<00:02:56.160> first<00:02:57.160> mesh<00:02:57.940> hole<00:02:58.150> on<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.540> Third's<00:02:58.870> a

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
did our first mesh hole on the Third's a

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.930 
did our first mesh hole on the Third's a
blow<00:02:59.290> hole<00:02:59.910> skip<00:03:00.910> two<00:03:01.269> holes<00:03:01.680> interlocked

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
blow hole skip two holes interlocked

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.240 
blow hole skip two holes interlocked
skipped<00:03:03.940> another<00:03:04.209> hole<00:03:04.450> interlocked<00:03:05.250> skipped

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
skipped another hole interlocked skipped

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.370 
skipped another hole interlocked skipped
another<00:03:06.490> hole<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:06.970> interlocked<00:03:07.780> now<00:03:08.260> we're

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
another hole and interlocked now we're

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.730 
another hole and interlocked now we're
gonna<00:03:08.470> do<00:03:08.680> a<00:03:08.710> triple<00:03:09.310> up<00:03:09.600> so

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
gonna do a triple up so

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.230 
gonna do a triple up so
up<00:03:11.690> under<00:03:12.690> that<00:03:13.320> next<00:03:13.620> full<00:03:13.740> mesh<00:03:14.010> back<00:03:14.910> around

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
up under that next full mesh back around

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.440 
up under that next full mesh back around
and<00:03:15.570> up<00:03:16.440> under<00:03:16.770> another<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.310> back<00:03:17.790> around<00:03:18.000> and

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
and up under another and back around and

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.580 
and up under another and back around and
up<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.710> under<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.310> third<00:03:20.760> big<00:03:21.090> mesh<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.720> pull

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
up and under a third big mesh and pull

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.980 
up and under a third big mesh and pull
that<00:03:22.770> to<00:03:22.980> bunch<00:03:23.190> it<00:03:23.280> all<00:03:23.430> up<00:03:23.670> so<00:03:23.880> then<00:03:24.840> you're

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
that to bunch it all up so then you're

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.590 
that to bunch it all up so then you're
going<00:03:25.170> to<00:03:25.730> there's<00:03:26.730> our<00:03:26.880> last<00:03:27.060> interlock

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
going to there's our last interlock

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.290 
going to there's our last interlock
you're<00:03:28.410> gonna<00:03:28.500> skip<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:28.950> hole<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:29.550> go<00:03:30.030> in

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
you're gonna skip a hole and go in

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.330 
you're gonna skip a hole and go in
through<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.690> outside<00:03:31.080> of<00:03:31.410> that<00:03:31.680> one<00:03:31.950> after

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
through the outside of that one after

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
through the outside of that one after
skipping<00:03:32.550> hole<00:03:32.880> so<00:03:33.120> just<00:03:33.390> like<00:03:33.960> that<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.850> pull

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
skipping hole so just like that and pull

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.470 
skipping hole so just like that and pull
that<00:03:36.480> nice<00:03:36.690> and<00:03:36.720> tight<00:03:38.210> then<00:03:39.210> we're<00:03:39.330> going<00:03:39.450> to

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
that nice and tight then we're going to

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.050 
that nice and tight then we're going to
do<00:03:39.630> another<00:03:39.990> one<00:03:40.380> so<00:03:41.190> up<00:03:41.460> through<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.760> bottom

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
do another one so up through the bottom

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.900 
do another one so up through the bottom
of<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:42.210> next<00:03:42.390> mesh<00:03:42.600> hole<00:03:43.220> into<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.520> outside

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
of that next mesh hole into the outside

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.480 
of that next mesh hole into the outside
of<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.120> next<00:03:45.330> side<00:03:45.480> we'll<00:03:45.660> hole<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:46.490> back

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
of the next side we'll hole and back

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.370 
of the next side we'll hole and back
around<00:03:47.700> so<00:03:48.090> just<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.450> one<00:03:48.690> right<00:03:48.960> there<00:03:49.170> and

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
around so just a one right there and

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.270 
around so just a one right there and
then<00:03:50.310> finally<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.730> one<00:03:51.030> interlock<00:03:52.010> so<00:03:53.010> up

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
then finally a one interlock so up

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.520 
then finally a one interlock so up
through<00:03:53.490> the<00:03:53.640> bottom<00:03:54.060> of<00:03:54.270> the<00:03:54.840> next<00:03:55.170> mesh<00:03:55.350> hole

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
through the bottom of the next mesh hole

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.550 
through the bottom of the next mesh hole
and<00:03:56.060> then<00:03:57.060> we're<00:03:57.180> gonna<00:03:57.270> skip<00:03:57.690> a<00:03:57.930> Szabo<00:03:58.410> hole

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
and then we're gonna skip a Szabo hole

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.750 
and then we're gonna skip a Szabo hole
right<00:03:58.680> there<00:03:58.740> and<00:03:59.580> go<00:03:59.760> down<00:03:59.910> to<00:03:59.970> this<00:04:00.150> one<00:04:01.760> into

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
right there and go down to this one into

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.410 
right there and go down to this one into
the<00:04:02.880> outside<00:04:03.300> and<00:04:04.310> up<00:04:05.310> under<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:05.820> final<00:04:06.090> and

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
the outside and up under the final and

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.370 
the outside and up under the final and
tenth<00:04:06.750> mesh<00:04:07.110> hole<00:04:07.320> and<00:04:08.870> you<00:04:09.870> know<00:04:09.990> lock<00:04:10.200> it

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
tenth mesh hole and you know lock it

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.340 
tenth mesh hole and you know lock it
down<00:04:10.530> so<00:04:10.800> it<00:04:10.860> looks<00:04:11.070> like<00:04:11.310> that<00:04:12.140> right<00:04:13.140> there

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
down so it looks like that right there

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.560 
down so it looks like that right there
so<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.620> one<00:04:13.860> and<00:04:14.550> the<00:04:14.700> interlock<00:04:15.120> I'll

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
so the one and the interlock I'll

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.550 
so the one and the interlock I'll
skipping<00:04:15.960> a<00:04:16.049> mesh<00:04:16.230> hole<00:04:16.410> and<00:04:16.650> then<00:04:17.340> just<00:04:17.609> go<00:04:17.820> in

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
skipping a mesh hole and then just go in

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.700 
skipping a mesh hole and then just go in
through<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:20.400> inside<00:04:20.940> of<00:04:21.270> the<00:04:21.630> sub<00:04:22.200> we'll<00:04:22.410> just

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
through the inside of the sub we'll just

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.170 
through the inside of the sub we'll just
a<00:04:22.770> tie<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:23.010> string<00:04:23.370> off<00:04:23.520> not<00:04:23.820> going<00:04:23.940> through

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
a tie the string off not going through

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.020 
a tie the string off not going through
any<00:04:24.330> mesh<00:04:24.540> holes<00:04:24.720> or<00:04:24.900> anything<00:04:25.050> like<00:04:25.260> that<00:04:25.320> and
