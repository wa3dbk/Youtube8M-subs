the<00:02:05.590> casting<00:02:06.100> is<00:02:06.270> okay<00:02:07.270> not<00:02:08.080> as<00:02:08.260> clean<00:02:08.500> as<00:02:08.619> I'd

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
the casting is okay not as clean as I'd

the casting is okay not as clean as I'd
hoped<00:02:08.979> for<00:02:09.270> there's<00:02:10.270> a<00:02:10.360> ding<00:02:10.630> on<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.869> roof<00:02:11.080> of

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
hoped for there's a ding on the roof of

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.170 
hoped for there's a ding on the roof of
the<00:02:11.320> passenger<00:02:11.890> side<00:02:12.100> I<00:02:12.370> checked<00:02:13.030> earlier

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
the passenger side I checked earlier

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.360 
the passenger side I checked earlier
video<00:02:13.660> footage<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.710> was<00:02:14.830> there<00:02:15.010> before<00:02:15.130> I

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
video footage and it was there before I

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.850 
video footage and it was there before I
removed<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.850> paint<00:02:16.150> so<00:02:16.870> more<00:02:17.290> than<00:02:17.410> likely<00:02:17.470> it

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
removed the paint so more than likely it

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.550 
removed the paint so more than likely it
was<00:02:17.950> done<00:02:18.190> at<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.340> factory<00:02:19.110> let's<00:02:20.110> put<00:02:20.380> it<00:02:20.440> in

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
was done at the factory let's put it in

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.440 
was done at the factory let's put it in
the<00:02:20.620> polisher<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.400> see<00:02:21.880> how<00:02:22.000> it<00:02:22.120> looks<00:02:22.330> in

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
the polisher and see how it looks in

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.000 
the polisher and see how it looks in
about<00:02:22.660> 10<00:02:22.930> hours<00:02:24.870> okay<00:02:25.870> after<00:02:26.380> some<00:02:26.800> initial

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
about 10 hours okay after some initial

about 10 hours okay after some initial
polishing<00:02:27.670> things<00:02:27.940> are<00:02:28.090> looking<00:02:28.330> pretty<00:02:28.510> good

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
polishing things are looking pretty good

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.650 
polishing things are looking pretty good
I<00:02:28.990> can<00:02:29.740> see<00:02:29.890> some<00:02:30.100> small<00:02:30.310> pitting<00:02:30.910> issues<00:02:31.270> but

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
I can see some small pitting issues but

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.020 
I can see some small pitting issues but
I'm<00:02:31.780> hoping<00:02:32.080> I<00:02:32.200> can<00:02:32.230> remove<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:32.800> buffing<00:02:33.220> it's

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
I'm hoping I can remove and buffing it's

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.330 
I'm hoping I can remove and buffing it's
best<00:02:34.330> not<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:34.600> expect<00:02:35.140> perfection<00:02:35.500> in<00:02:36.220> a

enamel<00:02:41.440> paint<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:42.850> ding<00:02:43.090> shows<00:02:43.390> up<00:02:43.630> a<00:02:43.750> bit

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
enamel paint the ding shows up a bit

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.770 
enamel paint the ding shows up a bit
better<00:02:44.200> now<00:02:44.820> really<00:02:45.820> wish<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.180> was<00:02:46.300> not<00:02:46.480> there

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
better now really wish it was not there

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.380 
better now really wish it was not there
I<00:02:47.050> checked<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.190> other<00:02:48.220> Kombi<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:48.760> bought<00:02:49.090> and

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
I checked the other Kombi I bought and

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.380 
I checked the other Kombi I bought and
it<00:02:49.840> had<00:02:50.050> no<00:02:50.260> ding<00:02:50.560> so<00:02:51.490> I'm<00:02:51.580> hoping<00:02:51.910> it<00:02:52.060> was<00:02:52.180> just

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
it had no ding so I'm hoping it was just

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.960 
it had no ding so I'm hoping it was just
one<00:02:52.600> van<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.170> not<00:02:53.260> thousands<00:02:53.920> if<00:02:54.070> this<00:02:54.610> was<00:02:54.820> an

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
one van and not thousands if this was an

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.750 
one van and not thousands if this was an
easy-to-find<00:02:55.840> van<00:02:56.260> I<00:02:56.500> would<00:02:57.010> toss<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:57.580> try

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
easy-to-find van I would toss it and try

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.270 
easy-to-find van I would toss it and try
another<00:02:58.000> but<00:02:58.989> I<00:02:59.020> only<00:02:59.230> have<00:02:59.470> two<00:02:59.680> of<00:02:59.709> them<00:03:00.010> so

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
another but I only have two of them so

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.910 
another but I only have two of them so
I'm<00:03:00.730> going<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.030> ignore<00:03:01.420> for<00:03:01.450> now<00:03:01.690> let's<00:03:02.650> get<00:03:02.860> to

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
I'm going to ignore for now let's get to

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.490 
I'm going to ignore for now let's get to
polishing<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:07.120> vibrating<00:03:07.600> polisher<00:03:08.200> really

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
polishing the vibrating polisher really

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.100 
polishing the vibrating polisher really
makes<00:03:08.770> finish<00:03:09.220> polishing<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.970> breeze<00:03:10.300> if<00:03:10.870> you

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
makes finish polishing a breeze if you

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.500 
makes finish polishing a breeze if you
ever<00:03:11.320> try<00:03:11.709> this<00:03:11.739> I<00:03:12.160> highly<00:03:12.640> recommend<00:03:13.120> it<00:03:13.300> a

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
ever try this I highly recommend it a

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.080 
ever try this I highly recommend it a
lot<00:03:14.140> of<00:03:14.290> pitting<00:03:14.500> issues<00:03:14.920> did<00:03:15.160> come<00:03:15.400> out<00:03:15.580> but

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
lot of pitting issues did come out but

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.420 
lot of pitting issues did come out but
not<00:03:16.269> all<00:03:16.480> of<00:03:16.600> them<00:03:16.810> this<00:03:17.800> is<00:03:17.980> pretty<00:03:18.160> standard

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
not all of them this is pretty standard

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.270 
not all of them this is pretty standard

surfaces like the size of this van
sometimes<00:03:26.290> I'll<00:03:26.380> do<00:03:26.530> a<00:03:26.560> video<00:03:26.830> the<00:03:27.130> polished

sometimes I'll do a video the polished
