okay so today we are going to be

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.470 
okay so today we are going to be
converting<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.899> vacuum<00:00:07.740> actuated<00:00:07.980> petcock<00:00:08.849> old

converting a vacuum actuated petcock old

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.580 
converting a vacuum actuated petcock old

now<00:00:16.640> if<00:00:17.640> you're<00:00:17.940> like<00:00:18.090> me<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.510> have<00:00:18.720> an<00:00:18.990> older

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
now if you're like me you have an older

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.090 
now if you're like me you have an older
motorcycle<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.720> has<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:22.320> fuel<00:00:22.920> pickup

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
motorcycle and it has a fuel pickup

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.640 
motorcycle and it has a fuel pickup
mount<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.699> looks<00:00:23.880> something<00:00:24.060> like<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.650> and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
mount that looks something like that and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.640 
mount that looks something like that and
it<00:00:26.010> uses<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.400> vacuum<00:00:26.820> actuated<00:00:27.320> petcock<00:00:28.320> this

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
it uses a vacuum actuated petcock this

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.550 
it uses a vacuum actuated petcock this
uh<00:00:29.090> this<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.359> original<00:00:30.539> petcock<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.380> came

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
uh this is the original petcock it came

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.920 
uh this is the original petcock it came
up<00:00:31.790> 1983<00:00:33.350> Morocco<00:00:34.350> XP<00:00:34.680> 500<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:36.300> still<00:00:36.630> kind<00:00:36.870> of

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
up 1983 Morocco XP 500 it still kind of

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.440 
up 1983 Morocco XP 500 it still kind of
works<00:00:37.140> however<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.890> leaks<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.610> hell<00:00:38.910> which

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
works however it leaks like hell which

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.560 
works however it leaks like hell which
means<00:00:40.579> it's<00:00:41.579> basically<00:00:41.910> useless<00:00:42.149> because

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
means it's basically useless because

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.750 
means it's basically useless because
they<00:00:42.989> do<00:00:43.050> not<00:00:43.230> make<00:00:43.489> gaskets<00:00:44.489> for<00:00:44.610> these

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
they do not make gaskets for these

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.549 
they do not make gaskets for these
anymore<00:00:44.969> they<00:00:45.420> are<00:00:45.510> not<00:00:45.690> rebuildable<00:00:46.170> fits

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
anymore they are not rebuildable fits

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.229 
anymore they are not rebuildable fits
well<00:00:46.980> that's<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.340> leaking<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.030> pipe

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
well that's just leaking of the pipe

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.479 
well that's just leaking of the pipe
because<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.780> looked<00:00:49.440> at<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:49.649> Prime<00:00:51.559> so<00:00:52.559> what<00:00:53.399> do

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
because I looked at on Prime so what do

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.279 
because I looked at on Prime so what do
you<00:00:53.550> need<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.210> need<00:00:54.449> an<00:00:54.870> adapter

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
you need for this you need an adapter

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.970 
you need for this you need an adapter
plate<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:57.289> specifically<00:00:58.289> needed<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.680> 50

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
plate I specifically needed a 50

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.650 
plate I specifically needed a 50
millimeter<00:00:59.160> adapter<00:00:59.399> plate<00:00:59.879> because<00:01:00.239> these

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
millimeter adapter plate because these

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.979 
millimeter adapter plate because these
mounting<00:01:01.260> bolts<00:01:01.500> are<00:01:01.590> 50<00:01:01.859> millimeters<00:01:02.550> apart

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
mounting bolts are 50 millimeters apart

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.480 
mounting bolts are 50 millimeters apart
any<00:01:03.989> new<00:01:04.260> petcock<00:01:04.820> this<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> 3/8<00:01:06.570> NPT<00:01:07.490> thread

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
any new petcock this is a 3/8 NPT thread

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.030 
any new petcock this is a 3/8 NPT thread
so<00:01:09.330> when<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.570> buy<00:01:09.720> your<00:01:09.930> adapter<00:01:10.650> plate<00:01:10.920> you

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
so when you buy your adapter plate you

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.370 
so when you buy your adapter plate you
need<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.250> make<00:01:11.430> sure<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.970> thread<00:01:12.380> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
need to make sure that the thread the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.679 
need to make sure that the thread the
insertion<00:01:14.250> thread<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.670> same<00:01:14.909> as<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
insertion thread is the same as the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.190 
insertion thread is the same as the
petcock<00:01:16.400> the<00:01:17.400> first<00:01:17.670> main<00:01:18.090> step<00:01:18.509> we<00:01:18.930> need<00:01:19.080> to

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
petcock the first main step we need to

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.820 
petcock the first main step we need to
do<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:20.729> need<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.000> make<00:01:21.180> sure<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.830> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
do is we need to make sure that the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.890 
do is we need to make sure that the
petcock<00:01:23.369> has<00:01:23.610> room<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.790> go<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.180> because<00:01:24.570> as<00:01:24.720> you

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
petcock has room to go in because as you

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.859 
petcock has room to go in because as you
can<00:01:25.020> see<00:01:26.840> that<00:01:27.840> will<00:01:27.990> not<00:01:28.140> fit<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:29.720> what<00:01:30.720> you

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
can see that will not fit so what you

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.200 
can see that will not fit so what you
should<00:01:31.110> do<00:01:31.259> first<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.979> as<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.310> instructions

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
should do first and as the instructions

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.770 
should do first and as the instructions
from<00:01:34.040> Pingel<00:01:35.630> represent<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:37.530> take<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> gasket

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
from Pingel represent you take a gasket

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.240 
from Pingel represent you take a gasket
front<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.930> your<00:01:40.200> gasket<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.619> goes<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
front of your gasket that goes to the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.429 
front of your gasket that goes to the
plate<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.540> hold<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.780> up<00:01:42.869> like<00:01:42.930> this

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
plate and you hold it up like this

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.039 
plate and you hold it up like this
put<00:01:45.439> it<00:01:45.530> over<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.799> threads<00:01:46.570> good<00:01:47.570> as<00:01:47.659> you<00:01:47.750> can

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
put it over the threads good as you can

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.999 
put it over the threads good as you can
and<00:01:48.380> take<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.369> pencil<00:01:50.229> take<00:01:51.229> a<00:01:51.259> pencil<00:01:51.500> and

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
and take a pencil take a pencil and

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.889 
and take a pencil take a pencil and
trace<00:01:52.820> out<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.180> circle<00:01:54.040> now<00:01:55.040> I<00:01:55.420> just<00:01:56.420> thought

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
trace out the circle now I just thought

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.690 
trace out the circle now I just thought
about<00:01:57.200> two<00:01:57.500> ways<00:01:57.680> you<00:01:57.830> can<00:01:57.920> go<00:01:58.070> about<00:01:58.520> doing

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
about two ways you can go about doing

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.289 
about two ways you can go about doing
this

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
this

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.779 
this
you<00:01:59.420> can<00:01:59.600> either<00:01:59.689> grill<00:02:00.200> it<00:02:00.340> with<00:02:01.340> a<00:02:01.369> huge-ass

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
you can either grill it with a huge-ass

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.760 
you can either grill it with a huge-ass
drill<00:02:02.119> or<00:02:02.299> you<00:02:02.810> can<00:02:02.960> file<00:02:03.170> it<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:03.530> I<00:02:03.649> would

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
drill or you can file it and I would

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.669 
drill or you can file it and I would
recommend<00:02:03.890> filing<00:02:04.610> because<00:02:05.590> drilling<00:02:06.590> is

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
recommend filing because drilling is

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.460 
recommend filing because drilling is
probably<00:02:06.920> gonna<00:02:07.009> leave<00:02:07.159> a<00:02:07.220> lot<00:02:07.520> more<00:02:07.549> a<00:02:08.330> lot

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
probably gonna leave a lot more a lot

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.170 
probably gonna leave a lot more a lot
more<00:02:09.470> crap<00:02:09.920> inside<00:02:10.280> your<00:02:10.399> gas<00:02:10.550> tank<00:02:10.940> and

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
more crap inside your gas tank and

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.330 
more crap inside your gas tank and
you're<00:02:11.510> probably<00:02:11.630> got<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:12.019> clean<00:02:12.230> that<00:02:12.260> out<00:02:12.410> if

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
you're probably got to clean that out if

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.550 
you're probably got to clean that out if
you<00:02:13.459> use<00:02:13.489> a<00:02:13.610> file<00:02:13.910> you<00:02:14.180> can<00:02:14.330> just<00:02:14.599> take<00:02:15.140> remove

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
you use a file you can just take remove

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.600 
you use a file you can just take remove
material<00:02:16.099> only<00:02:16.190> on<00:02:16.400> your<00:02:16.549> downstroke<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:18.610> it

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
material only on your downstroke and it

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.699 
material only on your downstroke and it
would<00:02:19.700> be<00:02:19.819> a<00:02:19.850> lot<00:02:20.060> cleaner<00:02:20.299> my<00:02:20.510> opinion<00:02:20.870> so<00:02:21.680> I

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
it can evaporate so you don't create a

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.070 
it can evaporate so you don't create a
fire<00:03:24.049> hazard

teflon tape this is pretty important

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.050 
teflon tape this is pretty important
because<00:04:13.530> it<00:04:13.950> basically<00:04:14.100> guarantees<00:04:14.790> you're

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
because it basically guarantees you're

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.479 
because it basically guarantees you're
not<00:04:15.180> gonna<00:04:15.300> get<00:04:15.450> any<00:04:15.570> leaks<00:04:15.950> and<00:04:16.950> the

not gonna get any leaks and the

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.849 
not gonna get any leaks and the
instructions<00:04:18.299> for<00:04:18.390> pingle<00:04:18.930> they<00:04:19.109> say<00:04:19.350> to<00:04:19.410> wrap

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
instructions for pingle they say to wrap

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.320 
instructions for pingle they say to wrap
it<00:04:20.040> at<00:04:20.130> least<00:04:20.250> four<00:04:20.489> times<00:04:20.640> that<00:04:21.000> might<00:04:21.150> be<00:04:21.299> a

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
it at least four times that might be a

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.020 
it at least four times that might be a
little<00:04:21.420> bit<00:04:21.630> too<00:04:21.780> much<00:04:22.010> I'll<00:04:23.010> tape<00:04:23.220> two<00:04:23.580> maybe

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
little bit too much I'll tape two maybe

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.070 
little bit too much I'll tape two maybe
three<00:04:24.300> times<00:04:24.540> is<00:04:24.720> enough<00:04:26.870> tingling<00:04:27.870> they<00:04:27.960> also

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
three times is enough tingling they also

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.740 
three times is enough tingling they also
come<00:04:28.350> with<00:04:28.380> these<00:04:28.590> brass<00:04:28.860> washers<00:04:29.750> I'll

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
come with these brass washers I'll

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.890 
come with these brass washers I'll
probably<00:04:30.990> use<00:04:31.200> those<00:04:31.350> as<00:04:31.530> well<00:04:32.180> and<00:04:33.180> yep
