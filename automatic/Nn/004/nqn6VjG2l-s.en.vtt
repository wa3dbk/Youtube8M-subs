00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.070
 about my five molds of September 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.620
 I want to thank everyone 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.140
 you who were supporting me the 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.780
 last Friday I went out in a 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.699
 report on the mega the news if you 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.890

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.629
 or anything I'm going to leave the link 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.760
 in the information box is a 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.829
 report about the Chilean youtubers 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.840
 about whether it's profitable or not and it's serial 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.309
 of things and I want to give you the 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.809
 thank you because first they told us that 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.100
 You will come out the report on Thursday and 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.329
 that we were all waiting and 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.609
 We ended up watching a story about 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.649
 fish and teleserie so many 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.390
 thanks really revolutionizes a lot and I 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.070
 never from the jamases they do not want 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.320
 so long in this but in truth 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.000
 I never thought I was going to go out in the 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.009
 news there is a central schedule for 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.960
 have a YouTube channel so that the 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.310
 I must give you that view 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.990
 they always support me and that we already have 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.350
 enough time in this and the truth is 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.090
 that has become something important in 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.010
 my life that entertains me a lot and gives me 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.140
 many gratifications 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.600
 but I really tell you everything 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.130
 heart so now yes and less 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.750
 sentimentality and we go to the products 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.270
 I want to start by talking about a 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.240
 Makeup product is the basis for 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.229
 nix knick eyelids is a brand 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.700
 American that unfortunately 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.229
 still not sold in physical stores 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.640
 here in chile but they have all the 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.640
 intention to arrive alone that they have had 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.500
 some problems I bought them on ebay 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.530
 I will leave in the information box 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.539
 the link of the selling truth that 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.460
 Joyce flame and the shipping cost comes out 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.899
 cheaper than more expensive now cheaper 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.850
 that the product which definitely 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.470
 It's not a plus but I had a lot 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.020
 curiosity to try this product 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.399
 because shadows as well as cream because 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.140
 finally that's what color is 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.069
 matte white are really hard to 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.929
 find 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.910
 nix also has another color more than 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.799
 as pearly white very similar to the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.720
 color tattoo of maybelline and other that is 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.760
 skin color but I wanted this white 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.620
 because I think it helps a lot that the 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.030
 colors become more saturated and in the 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.280
 background gives them as a base a little bit 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.769
 more sticky so it looks like more 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.019
 evenly and multi more striking the color 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.750
 but as it is an obnoxious product it tends to 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.090
 form folds in the sector as of the 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.860
 eye socket so I occupy it with a 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.810
 first ante and there I have no older 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.280
 problems 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.140
 the following things that I want them 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.030
 to mention are of body I think as I already 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.170
 have arrived a few sunny days then 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.209
 like I was worrying about a 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.370
 little bit more and he has me but super 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.410
 in love this exfoliating brand 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.020
 body ecology find him in the leader 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.390
 it's super economical and how can you see the 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.580
 mine is about to end like this 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.610
 that I really liked the aroma that 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.140
 I have I called jazz folk charm and the 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.970
 I really do not like it at all 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.640
 smacks you in any case it smells like 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.170
 detergent but he was the only one who was 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.790
 when I went to buy it because I 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.430
 like this product and it 's my favorite 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.560
 it has a lot of granules so 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.350
 truth pulls out all the dead skin with 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.209
 a lot of ease I even think I could 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.830
 be a little abrasive so do not tell 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.690
 I recommend that you take it every day 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.549
 I occupy it like two at most three 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.980
 times a week tried to moderate me 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.330
 because I really love the feeling 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.010
 but what I feel doing it as 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.170
 much more special is that apart from 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.720
 take out the dead cells I feel that 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.000
 leaves my skin as hydrated as if I 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.769
 I would have put cream and that's something like that 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.420
 like not all exfoliants do 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.750
 so that's why it became my 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.430
 Favourite 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.470
 following with body products 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.470
 I have the cream also from the body brand 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.150
 ecology in the aroma after dark 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.700
 this is also understood by the leader and was 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.340
 relatively inexpensive it has an aroma 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.990
 that fascinates me the pregnancy of this 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.940
 aroma is amazing leave as my 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.730
 body for now with that aroma even 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.600
 my clothes are super super intense is a 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.420
 aroma as sweet, very warm to me 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.490
 fascinates but my mom charges him so 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.140
 if you are more citrus scent obviously 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.290
 you will not like this one but there are several 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.570
 aromas to choose leaves my skin soft 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.239
 I think quite the hard softness 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.650
 absorption is relatively fast and 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.630
 It has a texture that I think 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.580
 nice is not a light cream but 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.980
 I think that this time of year is 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.009
 pretty good and the aroma is far away 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.719
 what kills me the most 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.449
 the next thing I want to show you is 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:37.809
 the invisible zero of trace 6 of the 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:40.599
 line and this is a sunscreen but 

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:43.479
 the texture is as light as any 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:45.339
 dermatological cream of the best 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.469
 it really feels super neither with the skin and 

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:49.749
 hyaluronic acid helps maintain the 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:51.399
 hydration in your skin is really 

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:52.779
 effective as to that you do not feel the 

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:55.539
 subject of aging but in the 

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:58.599
 hydration if it feels so wonderful 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:01.180
 It has no aromas, it 's so nice, it's not 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:04.569
 leaves the skin goop neither bright nor 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.729
 white does not take out grains is wonderful is 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:08.740
 an expensive product its full price is 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.719
 about 17 thousand pesos but you can 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.550
 find it with offer those things like 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:14.830
 takes the second product with the 50 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.569
 things like that so really trying us 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.289
 is looking for a blocker that is yes 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:20.510
 but 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:23.120
 I recommend this 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.160
 and finally I want to show you the tango 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.350
 artist this super famous brush that 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.990
 It has the peculiarity that no good 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.660
 has mango is a super comfortable way to 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.210
 grab by hand and have like 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.280
 bristles in two heights and are super 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.450
 flexible are plastic then in 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.330
 true 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.310
 remove the knots super efficiently 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.550
 no jerks of truth for me better the 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.560
 brushing theme but in 100% I 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.660
 love the payment of the original floor is 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.360
 super expensive and it's not that easy to 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.620
 find out about 12,000 pesos seems 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.270
 which is of course super 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.640
 overrated by the subject of the parties 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.110
 of innovation also that it runs 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.120
 a good idea has to earn money 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.270
 for that but there is a Chinese version the 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.860
 pirate version that comes out in 1500 pesos 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.170
 I think they sell it like some local 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.000
 in the center of santiago so of 

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:13.940
 truth is the same thing I think 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.030
 it works just as well there are 1500 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.160
 weights so it's much better 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.630
 and so we are finishing my favorites 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.220
 of September of course tell me in 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.470
 the comments what have been their 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.600
 favorites of this medium if I take ideas and 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.430
 we are going back to any 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.380
 doubt that I have about prices where 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.480
 buy it et cetera so you can 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.130
 leave in the comments and if they want 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.550
 know why I'm with this public so 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:39.010
 green is my mike wazowski polerón that 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.660
 I love very random parentheses so 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.610
 well we are not seeing very soon 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.610
 I remember in Friday and Sunday videos 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:49.020
 chau coming out a report in the 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:51.220
 mega news 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:55.480
 but before telling you which ones 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:58.930
 been my modes and that is the basis for 

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:02.760
 for for play dead is the shadow for 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.760
 bases for bases
