00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.069 
and I think it helps to with like
hydration<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.700> because<00:01:30.000> obviously<00:01:30.479> it's

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
hydration just because obviously it's

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.050 
hydration just because obviously it's
like<00:01:31.229> water<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.979> you're<00:01:32.189> putting<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.909> tea

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
like water that you're putting the tea

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.640 
like water that you're putting the tea
bags<00:01:33.240> with<00:01:33.509> since<00:01:34.049> you're<00:01:34.170> putting<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.470> water

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
bags with since you're putting in water

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.649 
bags with since you're putting in water
so<00:01:34.890> you're<00:01:35.040> drinking<00:01:35.430> more<00:01:35.549> water<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.150> like

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
so you're drinking more water and like

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.999 
so you're drinking more water and like
for<00:01:36.840> me<00:01:36.930> that's<00:01:37.049> good<00:01:37.290> because<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.619> feel<00:01:37.979> like

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
for me that's good because I feel like

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.819 
for me that's good because I feel like
it<00:01:38.570> it's<00:01:39.570> like<00:01:39.750> hydrating<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.439> but<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.680> like

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
it it's like hydrating you but you like

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:41.810 
it it's like hydrating you but you like
forget<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.220> you're<00:01:41.310> drinking<00:01:41.640> water

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
forget that you're drinking water

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.730 
forget that you're drinking water
because<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:42.360> like<00:01:42.479> tea<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:42.990> tastes<00:01:43.500> good

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
because it's like tea so it tastes good

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.069 
because it's like tea so it tastes good
um<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.790> i<00:01:44.850> think<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.090> helped<00:01:45.420> my<00:01:45.509> skin<00:01:45.840> in

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
um so i think that helped my skin in

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.810 
um so i think that helped my skin in
that<00:01:46.110> aspect<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:47.009> which<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.369> like<00:01:47.460> really<00:01:47.610> big

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
that aspect to which is like really big

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.130 
that aspect to which is like really big
for<00:01:47.970> me<00:01:48.060> because<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.270> guys<00:01:48.360> know<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.810> I
