00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.420

 xperia it has been and will be updated as is 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.200
 commented and what he does prevents him from 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.590
 you remove your google account 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.390
 in addition it prevents you from getting 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.000
 format the cell phone to reset the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.060
 factory settings, among others 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.310
 settings that make it totally 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.840
 the formatting of the equipment first 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.470
 basic test that we are going to do here

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.840

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.150
 because I'm not in the club 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.770
 Good, we're here with the bill, I'm 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.470
 As I'm testing, I have several 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.159
 accounts synced here so lets 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.200

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.579
 Let's go here on my main account that 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.220
 Google 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.030

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.860
 Look, the ready fell flat on the screen. 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.170
 Good, my car on this screen, I can not 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.479
 do nothing the back button does not work 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.750
 reporting base does not work I 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.970
 power button grip here 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.070
 wanted to ask for the serial side password to 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.980
 but it does not work 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.610
 good the two options I have here I 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.290
 I can connect wifi network connection 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.980
 internet god thank the internet now 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.150
 Who does not spell it wrong and I have here. 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.959
 I can not make a call from 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.000
 emergency 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.780
 besides the bush when I have this option 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.670
 here I only have one alternative 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.010
 that's authenticating I can not do anything 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.760
 but left here that gives us off 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.760
 The phone is right here. 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.420
 and soccer 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.209
 Let's turn the unit back on and see the 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.450
 When will he call me? 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.030
 I'll be back, look, it's just calling here. 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.590
 rotan staff both good appliance is 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.930
 Calling here let's see what's going on. 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.760
 what screen will the screen look like? 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.500
 default or he will fall headmistress 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.920
 on that security screen 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.600
 Let's see you did not win the meeting. 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:30.540
 I got back here for my account. 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:32.940
 but what a shame it was good to have had more 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.370
 would I be able to reset the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.519
 Phone settings I have to 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:42.420
 Remember what I have to set 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:45.150
 restoration and threw me out of 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.790
 back to block 11 but let's assume that 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.549
 we have that option I have 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.410
 knowledge of formatting your phone 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.660
 so I 'm going to prepare my notebook that 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.579
 I already left a software downloaded from the 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.410
 pc companion we were using to do 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:02.519
 losing your downloaded software 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.500
 in system so I come back good again 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.070
 outsiders like you are seeing there 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:12.480
 I downloaded the software, I'll 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:15.049
 usb and here in the neon bed connects the dwarf 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.350
 It has to be a 2.0 if it will not give shit. 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:22.530
 in 2.0 even though I punched in this door 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.410
 here then the next step is nee 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.970
 that standard on the galley 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.800
 the procedures that we teach to 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.640
 you get back to have 10 here to see if 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.930
 better closes, is not it good? 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:38.540
 first that has to continue and continue 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:42.230
 I'm going to put a USB cable 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.420
 click continue next 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:49.460
 Good now I'll ask him to ask and stay 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:51.860
 squeezing the place will not get good 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:56.860
 I said I will not push the button - and 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:05:04.550
 I'll connect the cell phone and 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:05.900
 He lit the green led here and he left the 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.670
 guys 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.490
 seems that unfortunately he left in 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:13.190
 Tell outsiders I came back in the day. 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.170
 next with the magic of the phone 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.100
 formatted so I wanna show 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:22.040
 You will see what happened here with the 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.470
 xperia aqua encounter with that mode of 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.820
 active safety is so let's check 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.650
 here as you have checked 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.650
 well let's go inside the bookstore from here 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.600
 can probably take a little longer 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.480
 over it first fashion boutique né 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.320
 We'll keep an eye on the neighborhood garden. 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.120
 from the sea 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.160
 Let's see if I can use the 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:48.160
 Phone forgive me I got the flu 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.160
 I agree 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:57.400
 I accept the terms but let's do 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.400
 login search for a wifi network 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:09.720
 Dad looks at the guys even after I have 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.880
 formatted my phone it does not even 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.190
 play on that lock screen 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.670
 Okay, look how incredible the face is. 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.990
 sensational that it blocks 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.950
 literally my network will not let 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.960
 login 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.090
 now for me to take this function I have 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.900
 to do this here, or log in to 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.540
 my network 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:30.240
 harry logged in let's authenticate here 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.490
 when you come to indicate if he plays for 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.440
 the google login screen is right 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:38.010
 we come here I'll do it again 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.910
 Excuse done here the blog O my 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:51.930
 password 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:56.370
 O good then did the chubby and I have not 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:59.160
 another cell phone 14 by hitting my own 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:06.390
 guru Oops I do not know why he went 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:08.880
 Off now everything is beauty 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:11.910
 Let's see what will happen now, good. 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:15.180
 apparently the bandit he 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:17.700
 will steal your phone but he 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.260
 You will unfortunately lose you. 

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.420
 all your data 

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:24.540
 but the guy will not be able to use the 

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:26.790
 device itself and formatting it does not 

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.980
 gets so it really is functional 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.500
 this game and this feature is not 

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.300
 I went and installed the galley system 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:37.470
 you see beyond the video is to install the 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.950
 system and it asks for password is still very 

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.340
 show 

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:43.110
 I found congratulations oni zica 

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:45.510

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:47.160
 They liked the video I leave her like 

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:49.860
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:53.040
 video sharing on social networks 

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:58.280
