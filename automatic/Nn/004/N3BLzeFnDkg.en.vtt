ingredients<00:00:08.639> that<00:00:09.269> you<00:00:09.420> often<00:00:09.900> come<00:00:10.080> across

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
ingredients that you often come across

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.770 
ingredients that you often come across
and<00:00:10.740> sometimes<00:00:11.700> people<00:00:11.940> confuse<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.570> two

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
and sometimes people confuse the two

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.620 
and sometimes people confuse the two
thinking<00:00:13.740> they're<00:00:13.980> baking<00:00:14.849> powder<00:00:15.210> baking

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
thinking they're baking powder baking

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.560 
thinking they're baking powder baking
soda<00:00:15.830> are<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.190> same<00:00:17.520> when<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.090> fact<00:00:18.330> they're

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
you may see either one or both required

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
you may see either one or both required
for<00:00:25.439> recipes<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.400> include<00:00:26.550> muffins<00:00:27.300> cookies

a<00:00:28.920> lot<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.519> different<00:00:29.970> different<00:00:30.720> recipes<00:00:31.199> so

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
a lot of different different recipes so

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.549 
a lot of different different recipes so
what<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.120> really<00:00:33.149> comes<00:00:33.690> down<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:34.260> when<00:00:34.440> it

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
what it really comes down to when it

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.709 
what it really comes down to when it
comes<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.100> difference<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.360> chemistry

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
comes to the difference is the chemistry

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.729 
comes to the difference is the chemistry
and<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.530> where<00:00:38.450> the<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.989> science<00:00:40.530> of

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
and this is where the the science of

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.779 
and this is where the the science of
baking<00:00:41.190> comes<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:42.079> baking<00:00:43.079> soda<00:00:43.440> has<00:00:43.950> sodium

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
baking comes in baking soda has sodium

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.970 
baking comes in baking soda has sodium
bicarbonate<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.600> obviously<00:00:48.980> whenever

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
bicarbonate in it and obviously whenever

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.310 
bicarbonate in it and obviously whenever
you<00:00:50.219> use<00:00:50.399> baking<00:00:50.820> soda<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.420> does<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.020> high

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
you use baking soda it does have a high

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.600 
you use baking soda it does have a high
sodium<00:00:52.680> content<00:00:53.690> in<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.079> itself<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:56.340> when

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
sodium content in and of itself so when

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.790 
sodium content in and of itself so when
you<00:00:56.730> use<00:00:57.030> baking<00:00:57.449> soda<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.870> usually<00:00:58.289> see

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
you use baking soda you usually see

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.010 
you use baking soda you usually see
recipes<00:00:59.370> call<00:00:59.670> for<00:00:59.699> less<00:01:00.090> salt<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.660> let's<00:01:00.809> say

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
recipes call for less salt and let's say

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.179 
recipes call for less salt and let's say
if<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.320> recipe<00:01:01.739> called<00:01:01.980> for<00:01:02.039> baking<00:01:02.550> powder<00:01:04.189> so

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
if a recipe called for baking powder so

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.929 
if a recipe called for baking powder so
baking<00:01:06.000> soda<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.930> works<00:01:07.260> well<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.760> would

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
baking soda it works well and it would

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.850 
baking soda it works well and it would
react<00:01:09.270> with<00:01:10.760> various<00:01:11.760> different<00:01:12.180> ingredients

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
react with various different ingredients

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.149 
react with various different ingredients
that<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.580> may<00:01:15.210> be<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.420> little<00:01:15.689> bit<00:01:15.930> acidic<00:01:16.500> so

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
that that may be a little bit acidic so

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.550 
that that may be a little bit acidic so
oftentimes<00:01:17.880> you'll<00:01:18.210> see<00:01:18.270> recipes<00:01:19.080> require

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
oftentimes you'll see recipes require

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.450 
oftentimes you'll see recipes require
baking<00:01:20.220> soda<00:01:20.640> for<00:01:21.000> those<00:01:21.119> purposes<00:01:22.460> baking

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
baking soda for those purposes baking

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.100 
baking soda for those purposes baking
powder<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> little<00:01:24.390> bit<00:01:24.509> different<00:01:24.930> it

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
powder is a little bit different it

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.130 
powder is a little bit different it
actually<00:01:25.770> contains<00:01:26.369> both<00:01:27.240> baking<00:01:27.810> soda

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
actually contains both baking soda

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.859 
actually contains both baking soda
elements<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.890> baking<00:01:29.220> soda<00:01:29.460> as<00:01:30.000> well<00:01:30.390> as<00:01:30.540> cream

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
elements of baking soda as well as cream

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.310 
elements of baking soda as well as cream
of<00:01:31.020> tartar<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:32.540> what<00:01:33.540> makes<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:34.020> different

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
of tartar and what makes this different

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.039 
of tartar and what makes this different
is<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:35.130> react<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.060> best<00:01:36.360> you'd<00:01:36.689> what

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
is that it react and is best you'd what

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.310 
is that it react and is best you'd what
used<00:01:37.439> with<00:01:37.560> non<00:01:37.979> acidic<00:01:39.140> ingredients<00:01:40.140> that

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
used with non acidic ingredients that

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.020 
used with non acidic ingredients that
you<00:01:40.530> would<00:01:40.680> use<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.159> oftentimes<00:01:41.790> you'll<00:01:42.000> see

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
you would use so oftentimes you'll see

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.660 
you would use so oftentimes you'll see
them<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.390> cookies<00:01:42.810> but<00:01:43.619> oftentimes<00:01:44.189> what

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
them in cookies but oftentimes what

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.340 
them in cookies but oftentimes what
you'll<00:01:44.909> really<00:01:45.180> see<00:01:45.450> them<00:01:45.600> for<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:45.960> anything

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
you'll really see them for is anything

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.800 
you'll really see them for is anything
that<00:01:46.560> requires<00:01:47.159> things<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:48.000> rise<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.689> is

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
that requires things to rise and this is

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.020 
that requires things to rise and this is
where<00:01:49.020> both<00:01:49.890> come<00:01:50.189> into<00:01:50.430> play<00:01:50.610> let's<00:01:50.850> say

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
where both come into play let's say

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.240 
where both come into play let's say
you're<00:01:51.119> making<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.659> dessert<00:01:52.170> or<00:01:52.500> something

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
you're making a dessert or something

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.340 
you're making a dessert or something
that<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.939> an<00:01:54.119> acidic<00:01:54.570> with<00:01:54.840> acidic

that is an acidic with acidic
ingredients<00:01:55.500> oven<00:01:56.340> oftentimes<00:01:57.180> you'll<00:01:57.390> see

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
ingredients oven oftentimes you'll see

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.590 
ingredients oven oftentimes you'll see
baking<00:01:58.049> soda<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.710> baking<00:01:59.399> powder<00:01:59.610> used<00:02:00.329> at

baking soda and baking powder used at

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.569 
baking soda and baking powder used at
the<00:02:00.719> same<00:02:00.930> time<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.770> reason<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.310> would<00:02:02.430> add

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
the same time the reason you would add

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.639 
the same time the reason you would add
in<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.909> baking<00:02:03.240> powder<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.259> reason<00:02:04.560> why

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
in the baking powder and the reason why

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.010 
in the baking powder and the reason why
baking<00:02:05.070> powder<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.549> used<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.939> begin<00:02:06.299> with<00:02:06.540> is

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
baking powder is used to begin with is

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.210 
baking powder is used to begin with is
because<00:02:07.409> baking<00:02:08.069> powder<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.729> a

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
because baking powder is a

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.170 
because baking powder is a
agent<00:02:10.110> baking<00:02:11.110> soda<00:02:11.410> is<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:12.010> to<00:02:12.250> an<00:02:12.370> extent<00:02:12.850> but

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
agent baking soda is to to an extent but

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.940 
agent baking soda is to to an extent but
baking<00:02:13.390> powder<00:02:13.750> does<00:02:14.170> have<00:02:14.410> more<00:02:14.740> of<00:02:14.830> an

baking powder does have more of an

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.130 
baking powder does have more of an
effect<00:02:15.310> if<00:02:15.640> you<00:02:15.940> want<00:02:16.360> something<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:16.930> have<00:02:17.110> a

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
effect if you want something to have a

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.640 
effect if you want something to have a
lot<00:02:17.440> of<00:02:17.470> rise<00:02:18.270> baking<00:02:19.270> soda<00:02:19.570> is<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:19.900> proper

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
lot of rise baking soda is the proper

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.350 
lot of rise baking soda is the proper
solution<00:02:21.250> for<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:24.400> that's<00:02:24.700> pretty<00:02:25.270> much

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
solution for you so that's pretty much

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.870 
solution for you so that's pretty much
it<00:02:25.480> so<00:02:25.840> baking<00:02:26.290> powder<00:02:26.500> really<00:02:27.040> primarily

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
it so baking powder really primarily

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.780 
it so baking powder really primarily
just<00:02:28.210> for<00:02:28.480> baking<00:02:28.870> it's<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.530> great<00:02:29.830> ingredient

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
just for baking it's a great ingredient

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.830 
just for baking it's a great ingredient
to<00:02:31.180> have<00:02:31.300> obviously<00:02:31.660> on<00:02:32.140> hand<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:34.030> it's

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
to have obviously on hand and and it's

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.020 
to have obviously on hand and and it's
mainly<00:02:35.170> used<00:02:35.320> for<00:02:35.560> that<00:02:35.770> now<00:02:36.220> baking<00:02:36.610> soda<00:02:36.910> is

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
mainly used for that now baking soda is

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.120 
mainly used for that now baking soda is
a<00:02:37.060> little<00:02:37.330> interesting<00:02:37.690> because<00:02:38.530> you<00:02:38.920> can

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
a little interesting because you can

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.760 
a little interesting because you can
actually<00:02:39.420> use<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:40.630> for<00:02:40.660> various<00:02:41.020> purposes

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
actually use it for various purposes

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.460 
actually use it for various purposes
people<00:02:42.700> often<00:02:43.300> keep<00:02:43.450> baking<00:02:43.690> soda<00:02:44.080> in<00:02:44.320> the

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
people often keep baking soda in the

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.600 
people often keep baking soda in the
fridge<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:45.520> maintain<00:02:46.120> it<00:02:46.480> keep<00:02:47.140> it<00:02:47.380> keep<00:02:48.370> any

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
fridge to maintain it keep it keep any

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.449 
fridge to maintain it keep it keep any
smell<00:02:49.209> or<00:02:49.360> odors<00:02:49.750> away<00:02:50.190> but<00:02:51.190> another

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
smell or odors away but another

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.760 
smell or odors away but another
interesting<00:02:52.060> thing<00:02:52.270> if<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:52.570> have<00:02:52.690> a<00:02:52.720> fire<00:02:53.140> if

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
interesting thing if you have a fire if

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.430 
interesting thing if you have a fire if
there's<00:02:54.130> a<00:02:54.190> fire<00:02:54.550> going<00:02:54.910> on<00:02:55.120> by<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.390> stove<00:02:55.990> or

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
there's a fire going on by the stove or

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.330 
there's a fire going on by the stove or
if<00:02:56.700> anything<00:02:57.700> goes<00:02:57.850> out<00:02:58.000> of<00:02:58.030> control<00:02:59.010> pour<00:03:00.010> a

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
if anything goes out of control pour a

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.370 
if anything goes out of control pour a
little<00:03:00.580> bit<00:03:00.730> of<00:03:00.820> baking<00:03:01.120> soda<00:03:01.330> and<00:03:01.600> that<00:03:02.050> fire

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
little bit of baking soda and that fire

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.910 
little bit of baking soda and that fire
will<00:03:02.830> usually<00:03:03.010> go<00:03:03.340> right<00:03:03.760> out<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:05.080> it's<00:03:05.680> very

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
will usually go right out and it's very

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.010 
will usually go right out and it's very
interesting<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.700> science<00:03:07.150> behind<00:03:07.360> all<00:03:07.750> of<00:03:07.870> it

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
interesting the science behind all of it

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.590 
interesting the science behind all of it
and<00:03:08.400> obviously<00:03:09.400> baking<00:03:09.760> soda<00:03:10.000> is<00:03:10.120> also<00:03:10.420> good

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
and obviously baking soda is also good

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.330 
and obviously baking soda is also good
for<00:03:10.750> getting<00:03:11.020> stains<00:03:11.350> out<00:03:11.590> of<00:03:11.709> clothes<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:12.220> as

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
for getting stains out of clothes and as

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.910 
for getting stains out of clothes and as
you<00:03:12.459> can<00:03:12.610> see<00:03:12.670> I<00:03:12.880> got<00:03:13.150> one<00:03:13.360> right<00:03:13.540> here<00:03:13.959> so<00:03:14.590> I'll

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
you can see I got one right here so I'll

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.560 
you can see I got one right here so I'll
probably<00:03:15.130> be<00:03:15.400> using<00:03:15.430> this<00:03:15.850> later<00:03:16.060> on<00:03:16.209> with

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
probably be using this later on with

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.800 
probably be using this later on with
some<00:03:16.900> fizzy<00:03:17.680> water<00:03:17.709> and<00:03:18.340> few<00:03:19.330> other<00:03:19.510> things

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
some fizzy water and few other things

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.070 
some fizzy water and few other things
but<00:03:20.650> yeah<00:03:20.800> it<00:03:20.980> just<00:03:21.010> goes<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.580> show<00:03:21.610> that<00:03:22.080> many

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
but yeah it just goes to show that many

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.479 
but yeah it just goes to show that many
of<00:03:23.200> these<00:03:23.320> ingredients<00:03:23.920> can<00:03:23.950> be<00:03:24.100> used<00:03:24.340> in

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
of these ingredients can be used in

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.040 
of these ingredients can be used in
various<00:03:24.820> different<00:03:25.000> ways<00:03:25.209> and<00:03:25.630> that<00:03:25.810> they're

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
various different ways and that they're

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.199 
various different ways and that they're
not<00:03:26.200> just<00:03:26.260> ingredients<00:03:27.160> there's<00:03:27.610> science

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
not just ingredients there's science

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.449 
not just ingredients there's science
behind<00:03:28.540> them<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:29.380> so<00:03:29.920> I<00:03:29.950> just<00:03:30.250> thought<00:03:30.400> I

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
behind them and so I just thought I

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.850 
behind them and so I just thought I
would<00:03:30.580> show<00:03:30.850> you<00:03:30.880> one<00:03:31.660> other<00:03:31.810> very<00:03:32.350> important

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
would show you one other very important

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.140 
would show you one other very important
thing<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.070> keep<00:03:33.220> in<00:03:33.519> mind<00:03:33.580> when<00:03:34.000> you're<00:03:34.120> using

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
thing to keep in mind when you're using

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.240 
thing to keep in mind when you're using
these<00:03:34.630> ingredients<00:03:35.260> for<00:03:35.440> anything<00:03:35.739> that<00:03:36.130> you

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
these ingredients for anything that you

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.470 
these ingredients for anything that you
use<00:03:36.489> them<00:03:36.670> for<00:03:36.970> is<00:03:37.300> that<00:03:38.200> you<00:03:38.950> need<00:03:39.190> to<00:03:39.430> look<00:03:40.330> at

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
use them for is that you need to look at

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.539 
use them for is that you need to look at
the<00:03:40.600> expiration<00:03:41.049> date<00:03:41.350> or<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:41.920> best<00:03:42.130> before

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
the expiration date or the best before

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.900 
the expiration date or the best before
date<00:03:42.810> often<00:03:43.810> times<00:03:44.320> people<00:03:44.650> leave<00:03:45.430> these<00:03:45.730> in

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
date often times people leave these in

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.360 
date often times people leave these in
the<00:03:46.000> cupboard<00:03:46.360> for<00:03:46.390> years<00:03:47.080> sometimes<00:03:47.830> years

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
the cupboard for years sometimes years

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.850 
the cupboard for years sometimes years
they<00:03:48.580> just<00:03:48.610> pile<00:03:49.239> up<00:03:49.269> there<00:03:49.750> you<00:03:50.290> want<00:03:50.590> to<00:03:50.709> make

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
they just pile up there you want to make

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.740 
they just pile up there you want to make
sure<00:03:50.890> you<00:03:51.280> have<00:03:51.549> one<00:03:51.850> that<00:03:52.060> is<00:03:52.180> up<00:03:52.360> to<00:03:52.540> date

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
sure you have one that is up to date

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.990 
sure you have one that is up to date
otherwise<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.980> will<00:03:54.190> not<00:03:54.250> have<00:03:54.670> the<00:03:54.880> effect

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
otherwise it will not have the effect

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.850 
otherwise it will not have the effect
it's<00:03:55.480> supposed<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:55.930> have<00:03:56.110> in<00:03:56.260> your<00:03:56.410> recipe

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
it's supposed to have in your recipe

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.220 
it's supposed to have in your recipe
anyway<00:03:57.580> I<00:03:58.120> hope<00:03:58.330> you<00:03:58.390> enjoyed<00:03:58.840> this<00:03:58.989> video
