00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.390
 that I received from a sub guy back there 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.970
 you can see that the hashtag reveals is 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.949
 which is the channel plan and was a sub face 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.130

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.170
 description thanks for having made map 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.359
 genetic well show you and old man succeeded 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.680
 do everything I wanted on a map and 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.450
 It looks pretty good so I go 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.270
 showing textures on this map here 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.540
 and I also have another map that is 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.340
 who then made me maybe next in the 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.960
 next video would already be 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.820
 using it there, but people here 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.220
 It's been a long time too and we're going 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.650
 to start here is to show him the 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.290
 texture teaches the crowd today's mix 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.689
 is hot is I think so if 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.640
 pronounces heather watson who is that of ifas 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.100
 Such a pvp I think he sent me there in the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.110
 kind of a mess if I did not really forget 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.790
 he sent a year and a half and his channel 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.500
 will also be in the description if 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.240
 You want to take confirmed 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.880
 here for the map guys he made is the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.729
 fair game he did here telebingo thomas 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.799
 Clean items in force mode in a deserted 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.689
 Take a rain, then we'll come here. 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.130
 to leave the cellphone but I'm going 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.000
 begin to present to you the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.829
 biomes né 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.630
 good people have the themes here all 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.380
 normal neighbors here as you can. 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.119
 see this time as speech this right leaf 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.700
 and a sheet that I used in the texture of 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.770
 pec farm and the gvt rerun which was 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.170
 a very old texture of the channel and is a 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.509
 a long time frame a leaf in the 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.520
 It's true, I had a really good time, right? 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.080
 here is the grass too that I used in the 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.490
 gt which was the last 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.250
 Everything that I did, guy that looked good. 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.770
 Showzinho well showzinho and it was a grass 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.130
 that he also put this texture is and is 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.350
 here is the land here the hypothesis I 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.240
 I think that's how it talks, it's actually 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.140
 I think they can conquer the 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.180
 mushrooms 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.310
 here is a beautiful snow too 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.990
 for anyone to play on servers that 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.780
 there is nothing here is the cacti as well 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.090
 It's cute , baby, and here it is. 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.070
 also in the huge cohabs in the galera he 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.380
 also plays the game has zica 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.050
 Look, this is a great show. 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.550
 A lot of gigs apart here, then let's go. 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.680
 start here from the armor part 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.500
 as they are already seeing here all the 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.880
 armor is mostly is well tim 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.040
 different I had never seen an end 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.180
 so cute but we do not 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.740
 use it then 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.709
 Good gg that you are seeing here and 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.750
 I matured a default are think david 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.520
 It was really cute, but she was 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.830
 Only thing I noticed differently. 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.090
 is mature diamond face like you 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.920
 You can see here 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.380
 She is much prettier than the others. 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.270
 comparison to postpone the 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.700
 you can see that they postponed a 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.519
 It's half pixelated so you can see the 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.930
 you can see the 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.209
 behind the scenes 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.940
 already in the other texture not because he 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.310
 that differentiated the armor of dilma I 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.200
 I think it was totally intentional here. 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.030
 I think he wanted to differentiate 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.860
 I think it went pretty well right not ok 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.810
 so we already have the items well 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.540
 More inFunny 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.340
 and especially the soup to bear very 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.489
 Fuck everybody she'll invent. 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.680
 Here is the sweet pot here. 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.660
 Naughty thing is that the items already generated 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.519
 You can see here soon Brazilian human is 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.230
 very beautiful but not very cute 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.730
 It sounds like those cowboy noises of 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.860
 Formerly it is connected pretty cute. 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.390
 even here the noise of the big tournament 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.440
 big credit line is pretty cute 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.209
 and for the moment is that really 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.110
 only this here I thought it was over 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.160
 epic né 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.480
 Good here then we have the 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.269
 tools I had never shown 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.430
 in other episodes but this map that 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.440
 let's show you let's go 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.239
 show here are all the tools 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.040
 here is very pretty wood because 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.989
 I'm going to show a pick that reminds me that 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.390
 The stuff most people use magic is not 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.240
 So here's a pick and I had it here. 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.710
 wood is well detailed here it is 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.350
 very dark stone well yes 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.600
 well, my good friend here was good already 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.270

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.979
 I need very epic is here is golden is 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.080
 face that looks kind of green but I do not know 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.599
 It looks pretty good up there we have 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.150
 the swords the wooden line with that 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:43.650
 Lightning bolts a fire going on already I 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.990
 I take it in your hand to see how 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.229
 the time is in the hand here is the sword 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.110
 of stone here is of iron and here the last 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.610
 of dilma in the latter not because there is still 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.319
 gold people look a lot like the 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.880
 Wood is this guy seems very 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:58.740
 even in a way that we have 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.419
 then the one from dilma that down there 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.060
 You can see it's a waste of money. 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.789
 Minecraft itself hides noting 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.710
 here and there but not in this stuff 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.690
 he hand that one year 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.860
 How do I know what's the name of this hand? 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.900
 if as mano did not seem to have 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.229
 Identified it looked beautiful here mother should 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.330
 be done for rain so far here it is 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.610
 How does she stay on her hand to be okay? 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.650
 pretty on the hand here is wooden 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.870
 But it looks nice if I'm not mistaken. 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.849
 this sword that she is dustin fish if I 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.919
 I'm not mistaken, I'm not as 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:31.770
 export so in textures but I have one 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.909
 A little bit then I think I 'm me 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.800

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.500
 very beautiful girl with a blue eye and she 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.820
 all iron akita gray here is from 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.710

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.690
 Show me but it was not a show guys went 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.150
 huge pretty manrico, right? 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.580
 here is very simple gold too much 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.469
 similar to wood and very pretty 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.240
 also good passing here to part of the 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:56.219
 particles and promotions 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.870
 we have every portion here he 

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:59.610
 remembered to do that, right? 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.580
 The fifth position of 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:06.120
 damage is the type plus a né the particle 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.889
 here the poison position 1 and if there is 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.599
 risk here is a dream that means 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:11.430
 for a same year 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:13.289
 there your heart as you can see was 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.599
 green with effect after was not well 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:17.250
 beautiful heart and the discharge of 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:19.050
 resistance to fire with these snakes I 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.270
 I'll talk to poor because it does not mean 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.960
 this will date the fifth position of 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.449
 force 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.159
 the same thing is not very cute too 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:29.009
 that we enter into the part of the 

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:30.659
 Particles then have here frederico 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:32.880

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.229
 You face our homesickness when otto is

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:40.060
 pink galley 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.160
 You may notice that it also comes out 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.560
 very much particle and here it is 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.110
