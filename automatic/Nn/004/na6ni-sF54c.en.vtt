hello everyone and welcome to the second
episode<00:00:05.660> of<00:00:05.960> the<00:00:06.170> racing<00:00:06.560> school<00:00:06.890> and<00:00:07.190> today

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:07.520 
episode of the racing school and today

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.510 
episode of the racing school and today
we're<00:00:07.730> going<00:00:07.850> to<00:00:07.970> be<00:00:08.059> focusing<00:00:08.570> on<00:00:08.780> braking<00:00:09.520> so

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:10.520 
we're going to be focusing on braking so

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.730 
we're going to be focusing on braking so
first<00:00:11.269> an<00:00:11.450> example<00:00:11.870> at<00:00:11.960> lost<00:00:12.140> speed<00:00:12.440> and<00:00:12.680> this

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
first an example at lost speed and this

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.140 
first an example at lost speed and this
is<00:00:12.889> the<00:00:13.010> same<00:00:13.220> example<00:00:13.610> that<00:00:13.820> you<00:00:13.910> saw<00:00:14.090> in

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
is the same example that you saw in

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.420 
is the same example that you saw in
episode<00:00:14.540> 1<00:00:14.870> but<00:00:15.080> what<00:00:15.769> I<00:00:15.800> want<00:00:16.010> you<00:00:16.130> to<00:00:16.250> do

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
episode 1 but what I want you to do

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.950 
episode 1 but what I want you to do
throughout<00:00:16.820> the<00:00:16.910> course<00:00:17.150> of<00:00:17.240> this<00:00:17.360> video<00:00:17.540> is

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
throughout the course of this video is

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.840 
throughout the course of this video is
not<00:00:18.140> to<00:00:18.200> focus<00:00:18.710> on<00:00:18.830> the<00:00:18.920> racing<00:00:19.310> line<00:00:19.340> because

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
not to focus on the racing line because

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.029 
not to focus on the racing line because
that's<00:00:20.090> what<00:00:20.240> episode<00:00:20.360> 1<00:00:20.750> goes<00:00:20.960> over<00:00:21.350> but<00:00:21.890> to

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
that's what episode 1 goes over but to

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.099 
that's what episode 1 goes over but to
focus<00:00:22.490> on<00:00:22.640> the<00:00:22.730> braking<00:00:23.240> and<00:00:23.420> when<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:23.869> brake

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
focus on the braking and when the brake

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.320 
focus on the braking and when the brake
lights<00:00:24.350> come<00:00:24.619> on<00:00:24.740> on<00:00:24.859> a<00:00:24.890> car<00:00:25.190> when<00:00:25.850> we<00:00:26.029> break

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
lights come on on a car when we break

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.500 
lights come on on a car when we break
only<00:00:27.320> focus<00:00:27.740> your<00:00:27.890> mind<00:00:28.039> on<00:00:28.310> the<00:00:28.400> braking<00:00:28.910> so

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
only focus your mind on the braking so

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.040 
only focus your mind on the braking so
aptly<00:00:29.990> put<00:00:30.080> we'll<00:00:30.470> break<00:00:30.740> it<00:00:30.920> down<00:00:31.100> and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
aptly put we'll break it down and

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.630 
aptly put we'll break it down and
basically<00:00:33.050> this<00:00:33.170> is<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:33.500> the<00:00:33.920> same<00:00:34.100> corner

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
basically this is the the same corner

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.189 
basically this is the the same corner
that<00:00:34.850> we<00:00:34.970> saw<00:00:35.150> in<00:00:35.239> episode<00:00:35.300> 1<00:00:35.809> there's<00:00:36.080> the

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
that we saw in episode 1 there's the

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:38.350 
that we saw in episode 1 there's the
racing<00:00:36.589> line<00:00:36.800> and<00:00:37.040> there's<00:00:37.729> your<00:00:37.940> braking

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
racing line and there's your braking

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.390 
racing line and there's your braking
point<00:00:38.659> where<00:00:39.199> the<00:00:39.320> orange<00:00:39.680> line<00:00:39.949> is<00:00:40.190> now

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
point where the orange line is now

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.189 
point where the orange line is now
that's<00:00:40.550> not<00:00:40.760> exact<00:00:41.150> but<00:00:41.360> it's<00:00:41.540> just<00:00:41.750> a<00:00:41.960> sure

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
that's not exact but it's just a sure

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:44.469 
that's not exact but it's just a sure
what<00:00:42.470> what<00:00:43.010> the<00:00:43.100> braking<00:00:43.460> point<00:00:43.670> is<00:00:43.850> now

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:44.479 
what what the braking point is now

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:46.090 
what what the braking point is now
that's<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:44.839> point<00:00:45.110> that<00:00:45.320> when<00:00:45.559> you<00:00:45.710> put<00:00:46.040> your

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
that's the point that when you put your

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.280 
that's the point that when you put your
foot<00:00:46.280> on<00:00:46.339> the<00:00:46.519> brick<00:00:46.790> you<00:00:47.479> will<00:00:47.750> be<00:00:47.930> able<00:00:48.019> to

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
foot on the brick you will be able to

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.410 
foot on the brick you will be able to
traverse<00:00:48.500> that<00:00:48.890> racing<00:00:49.370> line<00:00:49.580> as<00:00:49.850> quickly<00:00:50.120> as

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
traverse that racing line as quickly as

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.969 
traverse that racing line as quickly as
possible<00:00:50.449> now<00:00:51.379> there<00:00:51.530> are<00:00:51.650> some<00:00:51.799> other

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:51.979 
possible now there are some other

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:54.250 
possible now there are some other
braking<00:00:52.970> points<00:00:53.239> that<00:00:53.330> you<00:00:53.420> can<00:00:53.570> use<00:00:53.809> I<00:00:54.019> shown

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
braking points that you can use I shown

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.070 
braking points that you can use I shown
by<00:00:54.470> the<00:00:54.530> yellow<00:00:54.650> and<00:00:55.040> green<00:00:55.280> lines<00:00:55.909> there<00:00:56.269> and

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
by the yellow and green lines there and

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.660 
by the yellow and green lines there and
if<00:00:57.199> you<00:00:57.320> brake<00:00:57.619> on<00:00:57.769> any<00:00:57.920> of<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:58.190> yellow<00:00:58.430> lines

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
if you brake on any of the yellow lines

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.430 
if you brake on any of the yellow lines
you're<00:00:58.879> gonna<00:00:59.000> be<00:00:59.119> braking<00:00:59.570> too<00:00:59.780> late<00:01:00.229> and

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
you're gonna be braking too late and

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.930 
you're gonna be braking too late and
you're<00:01:00.830> not<00:01:00.979> going<00:01:01.129> to<00:01:01.190> be<00:01:01.309> able<00:01:01.400> to<00:01:01.519> make<00:01:01.790> the

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
you're not going to be able to make the

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.820 
you're not going to be able to make the
racing<00:01:02.299> line<00:01:02.330> if<00:01:02.720> you<00:01:03.019> brake<00:01:03.260> on<00:01:03.379> any<00:01:03.530> of<00:01:03.710> the

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
racing line if you brake on any of the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.200 
racing line if you brake on any of the
green<00:01:04.070> lines<00:01:04.339> you're<00:01:04.580> going<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.760> be<00:01:04.820> braking

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
green lines you're going to be braking

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.760 
green lines you're going to be braking
too<00:01:05.360> early<00:01:05.690> and<00:01:05.840> you're<00:01:05.930> going<00:01:06.110> to<00:01:06.170> lose<00:01:06.409> speed

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
too early and you're going to lose speed

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.580 
too early and you're going to lose speed
through<00:01:06.979> the<00:01:07.130> corner<00:01:07.159> now<00:01:08.149> the<00:01:08.600> effect<00:01:09.200> gets<00:01:09.289> a

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
through the corner now the effect gets a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.109 
through the corner now the effect gets a
lot<00:01:09.770> worse<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.280> further<00:01:10.490> you<00:01:10.729> get<00:01:10.850> away<00:01:10.909> from

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
lot worse the further you get away from

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.539 
lot worse the further you get away from
the<00:01:11.450> optimal<00:01:11.990> braking<00:01:12.560> point<00:01:12.979> which<00:01:13.219> is<00:01:13.369> why

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
the optimal braking point which is why

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.080 
the optimal braking point which is why
the<00:01:13.609> the<00:01:14.299> lines<00:01:14.810> get<00:01:15.079> larger<00:01:15.560> but<00:01:16.340> yeah<00:01:16.939> it

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
the the lines get larger but yeah it

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.139 
the the lines get larger but yeah it
always<00:01:17.600> come<00:01:18.140> combines<00:01:18.950> to<00:01:19.219> one<00:01:19.460> point<00:01:19.850> where

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
always come combines to one point where

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:22.240 
always come combines to one point where
it<00:01:20.420> is<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.750> optimal<00:01:21.229> point<00:01:21.590> to<00:01:21.740> brick<00:01:22.039> and

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
it is the optimal point to brick and

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.639 
it is the optimal point to brick and
that's<00:01:22.850> what<00:01:23.030> you<00:01:23.119> need<00:01:23.240> to<00:01:23.390> be<00:01:23.479> aiming<00:01:23.810> for<00:01:23.840> so

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
that's what you need to be aiming for so

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:26.440 
that's what you need to be aiming for so
how<00:01:24.950> do<00:01:25.009> you<00:01:25.159> go<00:01:25.280> about<00:01:25.369> finding<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:26.030> optimal

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
how do you go about finding the optimal

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.450 
how do you go about finding the optimal
braking<00:01:26.659> point<00:01:27.200> well<00:01:27.649> it's<00:01:27.859> certainly<00:01:28.009> kids

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
braking point well it's certainly kids

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.830 
braking point well it's certainly kids
of<00:01:28.579> practice<00:01:29.000> but<00:01:29.179> there<00:01:29.270> are<00:01:29.390> a<00:01:29.420> few<00:01:29.600> things

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
of practice but there are a few things

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.050 
of practice but there are a few things
that<00:01:30.020> can<00:01:30.259> help<00:01:30.829> you<00:01:30.950> out<00:01:30.979> so<00:01:31.759> if<00:01:31.820> we<00:01:31.909> come

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
that can help you out so if we come

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.489 
that can help you out so if we come
along<00:01:32.270> here<00:01:32.509> and<00:01:32.719> we're<00:01:32.929> gonna<00:01:33.020> pause<00:01:33.350> the

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:33.499 
along here and we're gonna pause the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:34.929 
along here and we're gonna pause the
video<00:01:33.740> and<00:01:33.920> I<00:01:33.979> just<00:01:34.159> want<00:01:34.340> you<00:01:34.399> to<00:01:34.490> take<00:01:34.700> a<00:01:34.729> look

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
video and I just want you to take a look

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:36.459 
video and I just want you to take a look
on<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.179> left<00:01:35.390> to<00:01:35.539> see<00:01:35.689> the<00:01:35.810> braking<00:01:36.289> marker

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469 
on the left to see the braking marker

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:38.289 
on the left to see the braking marker
well<00:01:37.070> it's<00:01:37.310> a<00:01:37.369> marker<00:01:37.729> to<00:01:37.759> say<00:01:37.969> there's<00:01:38.240> a

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
well it's a marker to say there's a

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.300 
well it's a marker to say there's a
right<00:01:38.479> hand<00:01:38.509> turn<00:01:38.840> coming<00:01:39.259> up<00:01:39.380> but<00:01:40.070> you<00:01:40.159> can

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
right hand turn coming up but you can

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.859 
right hand turn coming up but you can
use<00:01:40.490> these<00:01:40.670> boards<00:01:40.939> and<00:01:41.270> they're<00:01:41.630> on<00:01:41.749> every

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
use these boards and they're on every

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.690 
use these boards and they're on every
track<00:01:42.200> in<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:42.409> world<00:01:42.590> is<00:01:42.859> normally<00:01:43.219> 100<00:01:43.549> meter

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
track in the world is normally 100 meter

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.550 
track in the world is normally 100 meter
boards<00:01:44.060> 50<00:01:44.390> meter<00:01:44.570> boards<00:01:44.960> things<00:01:45.200> like<00:01:45.350> that

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
boards 50 meter boards things like that

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.639 
boards 50 meter boards things like that
as<00:01:45.710> braking<00:01:46.700> references<00:01:47.299> so<00:01:47.929> you<00:01:47.990> know<00:01:48.439> when

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
as braking references so you know when

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.440 
as braking references so you know when
you<00:01:48.770> pass<00:01:49.039> that<00:01:49.219> board<00:01:49.520> that<00:01:49.670> that's<00:01:50.030> when<00:01:50.240> you

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
you pass that board that that's when you

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.239 
you pass that board that that's when you
need<00:01:50.659> to<00:01:50.719> brake<00:01:51.079> and<00:01:51.380> that's<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.710> whole<00:01:51.890> idea

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:52.249 
need to brake and that's the whole idea

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:53.980 
need to brake and that's the whole idea
of<00:01:52.340> being<00:01:52.759> able<00:01:52.850> to<00:01:53.119> remember<00:01:53.390> where<00:01:53.840> your

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
of being able to remember where your

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.349 
of being able to remember where your
braking<00:01:54.439> point<00:01:54.710> is<00:01:54.920> as<00:01:55.310> an<00:01:55.549> example<00:01:56.030> in<00:01:56.210> this

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
braking point is as an example in this

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:58.630 
braking point is as an example in this
video<00:01:56.689> and<00:01:56.990> this<00:01:57.350> corner<00:01:57.829> my<00:01:58.100> breaking<00:01:58.609> point

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
video and this corner my breaking point

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.090 
video and this corner my breaking point
is<00:01:59.090> where<00:01:59.389> the<00:01:59.539> truck<00:01:59.810> changes<00:02:00.409> composition

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
is where the truck changes composition

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.249 
is where the truck changes composition
so<00:02:01.369> where<00:02:01.609> it<00:02:01.729> goes<00:02:01.850> from<00:02:01.909> dark<00:02:02.179> grid<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:03.079> light

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
so where it goes from dark grid to light

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.709 
so where it goes from dark grid to light
gray<00:02:03.590> that's<00:02:04.249> where<00:02:04.520> my<00:02:04.759> breaking<00:02:05.270> point<00:02:05.539> is

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
gray that's where my breaking point is

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.899 
gray that's where my breaking point is
going<00:02:05.929> to<00:02:06.020> be<00:02:06.139> and<00:02:06.499> you<00:02:06.920> see<00:02:07.189> as<00:02:07.399> we<00:02:07.609> slow<00:02:07.880> it

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
going to be and you see as we slow it

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.719 
going to be and you see as we slow it
down<00:02:08.030> as<00:02:08.780> soon<00:02:09.080> as<00:02:09.259> we<00:02:09.380> get<00:02:09.530> to<00:02:09.649> that<00:02:09.679> point<00:02:10.039> the

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
down as soon as we get to that point the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.759 
down as soon as we get to that point the
red<00:02:11.390> lights<00:02:11.629> will<00:02:11.840> come<00:02:11.870> on<00:02:12.049> the<00:02:12.290> brake<00:02:12.530> light

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
red lights will come on the brake light

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.440 
red lights will come on the brake light
to<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.040> back<00:02:13.190> of<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.430> car<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:13.879> that's<00:02:14.330> when

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
to the back of the car and that's when

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.449 
to the back of the car and that's when
I'm<00:02:14.720> braking<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.379> I<00:02:15.470> know<00:02:15.530> that<00:02:15.890> every<00:02:16.159> single

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
I'm braking and I know that every single

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:16.960 
I'm braking and I know that every single
time<00:02:16.670> I

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
time I

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.970 
time I
come<00:02:17.090> up<00:02:17.240> to<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:17.390> corner<00:02:17.750> that's<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.800> point

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
come up to that corner that's the point

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.160 
come up to that corner that's the point
that<00:02:19.220> I<00:02:19.280> need<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.730> break<00:02:19.970> now<00:02:20.540> most<00:02:20.960> of<00:02:21.050> you

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
that I need to break now most of you

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.630 
that I need to break now most of you
breaking<00:02:21.410> needs<00:02:21.740> to<00:02:21.830> be<00:02:21.920> done<00:02:22.100> in<00:02:22.250> a<00:02:22.340> straight

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
breaking needs to be done in a straight

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.220 
breaking needs to be done in a straight
line<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:23.300> last<00:02:23.510> thing<00:02:23.630> you<00:02:23.720> want<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:23.960> do<00:02:24.080> is

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
line the last thing you want to do is

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.590 
line the last thing you want to do is
ten<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:24.740> break<00:02:24.950> at<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.220> same<00:02:25.400> time<00:02:25.790> so<00:02:26.390> just

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
ten and break at the same time so just

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.600 
ten and break at the same time so just
have<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.780> look<00:02:26.840> there<00:02:27.260> where<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.830> it<00:02:28.130> shows<00:02:28.370> how

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
have a look there where the it shows how

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.940 
have a look there where the it shows how
much<00:02:28.760> braking<00:02:29.240> force<00:02:29.480> I<00:02:29.660> have<00:02:29.870> on<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:30.290> as<00:02:30.800> we

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
much braking force I have on and as we

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.320 
much braking force I have on and as we
start<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.310> turn<00:02:31.490> the<00:02:31.550> steering<00:02:31.820> wheel<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:32.240> the

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
start to turn the steering wheel and the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.330 
start to turn the steering wheel and the
car<00:02:32.510> starts<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:32.930> turn<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.470> right<00:02:33.650> my

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
braking lets off a little bit my foot

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.290 
braking lets off a little bit my foot
comes<00:02:36.830> off<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.100> pedal<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.850> more<00:02:38.060> that<00:02:38.210> I

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
comes off the pedal and the more that I

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.540 
comes off the pedal and the more that I
turn<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.690> steering<00:02:38.750> wheel<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.800> less<00:02:40.040> braking

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
turn the steering wheel the less braking

turn the steering wheel the less braking

we'll<00:02:49.490> cover<00:02:49.670> acceleration<00:02:50.480> in<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:50.690> next

to<00:02:58.340> them<00:02:58.490> the<00:02:58.940> more<00:02:59.150> you<00:02:59.300> turn<00:02:59.600> the<00:03:00.050> less<00:03:00.230> grip

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
to them the more you turn the less grip

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.170 
to them the more you turn the less grip
you<00:03:00.650> actually<00:03:00.950> have<00:03:01.100> available<00:03:01.610> to<00:03:01.790> slow<00:03:02.030> you

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
you actually have available to slow you

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.510 
you actually have available to slow you
down<00:03:02.510> so<00:03:03.110> you<00:03:03.140> do<00:03:03.500> all<00:03:03.650> your<00:03:03.800> braking<00:03:04.310> in<00:03:04.430> a

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
down so you do all your braking in a

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.460 
down so you do all your braking in a
straight<00:03:04.820> line<00:03:04.850> and<00:03:05.360> get<00:03:05.480> slowed<00:03:05.870> down<00:03:05.900> to<00:03:06.350> the

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
straight line and get slowed down to the

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.410 
straight line and get slowed down to the
speed<00:03:06.740> that<00:03:06.770> you<00:03:07.010> need<00:03:07.040> for<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.790> corner<00:03:08.240> and

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
speed that you need for the corner and

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.440 
speed that you need for the corner and
then<00:03:09.050> start<00:03:09.410> turning<00:03:09.680> so<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.640> tires<00:03:11.060> can<00:03:11.150> use

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
then start turning so the tires can use

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.750 
then start turning so the tires can use
all<00:03:11.720> of<00:03:11.750> their<00:03:12.080> available<00:03:12.530> grip<00:03:12.830> to<00:03:13.340> actually

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
all of their available grip to actually

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.550 
all of their available grip to actually
get<00:03:13.970> you<00:03:14.090> around<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.540> corner<00:03:14.840> as<00:03:15.110> quickly<00:03:15.350> as

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
get you around the corner as quickly as

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.010 
get you around the corner as quickly as
possible<00:03:15.620> so<00:03:16.160> here's<00:03:16.940> an<00:03:17.030> example<00:03:17.120> just<00:03:17.540> on<00:03:17.930> a

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
possible so here's an example just on a

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.050 
possible so here's an example just on a
normal<00:03:18.260> camera<00:03:18.620> and<00:03:19.010> in<00:03:19.130> normal<00:03:19.370> speed<00:03:19.820> and

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
normal camera and in normal speed and

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.820 
normal camera and in normal speed and
you<00:03:20.420> see<00:03:20.690> that<00:03:20.840> as<00:03:20.959> soon<00:03:21.140> as<00:03:21.290> we<00:03:21.410> get<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:21.590> my

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
you see that as soon as we get to my

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.580 
you see that as soon as we get to my
breaking<00:03:22.130> point<00:03:22.340> I<00:03:22.820> some<00:03:23.720> on<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:23.989> brakes<00:03:24.260> get

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
breaking point I some on the brakes get

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.990 
breaking point I some on the brakes get
to<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:24.830> speed<00:03:25.040> that<00:03:25.190> I<00:03:25.250> need<00:03:25.519> to<00:03:25.610> be<00:03:25.730> for<00:03:25.910> the

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
to the speed that I need to be for the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.180 
to the speed that I need to be for the
corner<00:03:26.360> and<00:03:26.540> then<00:03:27.050> manage<00:03:27.380> to<00:03:27.500> use<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.800> racing

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
corner and then manage to use the racing

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.009 
corner and then manage to use the racing
line<00:03:28.220> nicely<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:29.030> get<00:03:29.180> around<00:03:29.420> it<00:03:29.630> as<00:03:29.750> quickly

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
line nicely to get around it as quickly

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.320 
line nicely to get around it as quickly
as<00:03:30.230> possible<00:03:30.459> that's<00:03:31.459> basically<00:03:31.970> it<00:03:32.150> that's

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
as possible that's basically it that's

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.350 
as possible that's basically it that's
how<00:03:32.600> you<00:03:32.660> break<00:03:33.230> for<00:03:33.650> a<00:03:33.680> corner<00:03:34.220> so<00:03:35.060> here's<00:03:35.239> an

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
how you break for a corner so here's an

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.090 
how you break for a corner so here's an
example<00:03:35.450> few<00:03:35.840> examples<00:03:36.290> of<00:03:36.410> what<00:03:36.590> not<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:36.950> do

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
example few examples of what not to do

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.530 
example few examples of what not to do
and<00:03:37.220> we're<00:03:37.340> going<00:03:37.459> to<00:03:37.640> focus<00:03:37.850> on<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.300> few

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
and we're going to focus on the few

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.860 
and we're going to focus on the few
lines<00:03:38.780> that<00:03:38.959> I<00:03:39.050> put<00:03:39.350> up<00:03:39.470> before<00:03:39.920> so<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:41.630> first

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
lines that I put up before so the first

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.360 
lines that I put up before so the first
up<00:03:42.019> we<00:03:42.170> have<00:03:42.320> the<00:03:42.440> green<00:03:42.650> lines<00:03:42.920> which<00:03:43.220> is

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
up we have the green lines which is

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.500 
up we have the green lines which is
braking<00:03:43.790> too<00:03:44.000> early

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
braking too early

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.300 
braking too early
here<00:03:45.050> you<00:03:45.230> see<00:03:45.440> you<00:03:45.590> brake<00:03:45.830> far<00:03:46.100> too<00:03:46.280> early

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
here you see you brake far too early

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.430 
here you see you brake far too early
you're<00:03:47.120> losing<00:03:47.660> speed<00:03:47.959> because<00:03:48.230> you're<00:03:48.350> not

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
you're losing speed because you're not

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.199 
you're losing speed because you're not
able<00:03:48.620> to<00:03:48.799> go<00:03:48.980> around<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.280> racing<00:03:49.880> line<00:03:49.910> as

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
able to go around the racing line as

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.600 
able to go around the racing line as
quickly<00:03:50.480> as<00:03:50.690> you<00:03:50.810> normally<00:03:50.989> would<00:03:51.380> and<00:03:51.610> yeah

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
quickly as you normally would and yeah

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.100 
quickly as you normally would and yeah
that's<00:03:52.910> it<00:03:53.060> they<00:03:53.209> know<00:03:53.360> if<00:03:53.630> you<00:03:53.720> brake<00:03:53.959> too

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
that's it they know if you brake too

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.080 
that's it they know if you brake too
early<00:03:54.440> you<00:03:54.590> kind<00:03:55.070> of<00:03:55.130> in<00:03:55.250> no-man's-land<00:03:55.610> then

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
early you kind of in no-man's-land then

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.430 
early you kind of in no-man's-land then
you<00:03:56.150> don't<00:03:56.330> know<00:03:56.450> what<00:03:56.480> to<00:03:56.780> do<00:03:56.900> until<00:03:57.080> you<00:03:57.290> get

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
you don't know what to do until you get

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.530 
you don't know what to do until you get
to<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:57.620> corner<00:03:58.010> here's<00:03:58.760> an<00:03:58.910> example<00:03:59.390> of<00:03:59.450> the

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
to the corner here's an example of the

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.330 
to the corner here's an example of the
yellow<00:03:59.720> lines<00:04:00.019> which<00:04:00.320> is<00:04:00.470> braking<00:04:00.860> too<00:04:01.070> late

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
yellow lines which is braking too late

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.550 
yellow lines which is braking too late
if<00:04:01.910> you<00:04:02.060> brake<00:04:02.269> too<00:04:02.450> late<00:04:02.720> you<00:04:03.049> don't<00:04:03.230> you

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
if you brake too late you don't you

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.080 
if you brake too late you don't you
you're<00:04:03.799> going<00:04:03.980> too<00:04:04.160> fast<00:04:04.459> to<00:04:04.640> manage<00:04:04.880> to<00:04:04.970> get

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
you're going too fast to manage to get

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.180 
you're going too fast to manage to get
on<00:04:05.239> the<00:04:05.330> racing<00:04:05.690> line<00:04:05.720> you<00:04:06.410> end<00:04:06.500> up<00:04:06.650> going<00:04:06.830> wide

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
on the racing line you end up going wide

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.009 
on the racing line you end up going wide
and<00:04:07.519> you're<00:04:07.850> not<00:04:08.030> going<00:04:08.390> around<00:04:08.600> that<00:04:08.750> corner

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
and you're not going around that corner

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.690 
and you're not going around that corner
as<00:04:09.230> quickly<00:04:09.500> as<00:04:09.709> possible<00:04:09.739> and<00:04:10.220> using<00:04:10.519> a

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
as quickly as possible and using a

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.550 
as quickly as possible and using a
different<00:04:11.120> line<00:04:11.299> around<00:04:11.570> the<00:04:11.690> corner<00:04:11.720> which

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
different line around the corner which

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.289 
different line around the corner which
isn't<00:04:12.860> optimal<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.459> it's<00:04:13.670> not<00:04:13.850> as<00:04:13.970> quickly

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
isn't optimal and it's not as quickly

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.300 
isn't optimal and it's not as quickly
quick<00:04:14.690> as<00:04:14.810> you<00:04:14.900> could<00:04:15.080> go<00:04:15.290> so<00:04:16.100> here's<00:04:16.220> an

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
quick as you could go so here's an

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.610 
quick as you could go so here's an
example<00:04:16.370> at<00:04:16.760> high<00:04:16.880> speed<00:04:17.209> as<00:04:17.450> per<00:04:17.630> usual<00:04:17.870> now

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
example at high speed as per usual now

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.020 
example at high speed as per usual now
again<00:04:18.919> it's<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.190> same<00:04:19.220> as<00:04:19.519> what<00:04:19.669> you<00:04:19.760> saw<00:04:19.940> in

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
again it's the same as what you saw in

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.030 
again it's the same as what you saw in
episode<00:04:20.390> one<00:04:20.690> but<00:04:20.900> this<00:04:21.019> time<00:04:21.080> focus<00:04:21.799> on<00:04:21.950> the

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
episode one but this time focus on the

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.100 
episode one but this time focus on the
braking<00:04:22.550> obviously<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:23.479> racing<00:04:23.810> line<00:04:23.990> is

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
braking obviously the racing line is

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.020 
braking obviously the racing line is
going<00:04:24.260> to<00:04:24.320> be<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:24.560> same<00:04:24.800> but<00:04:25.190> focus<00:04:25.669> on<00:04:25.820> when

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
going to be the same but focus on when

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.300 
going to be the same but focus on when
the<00:04:26.210> brake<00:04:26.479> lights<00:04:26.750> come<00:04:27.050> on<00:04:27.169> on<00:04:27.349> the<00:04:27.470> car<00:04:27.710> you

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
the brake lights come on on the car you

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.010 
the brake lights come on on the car you
see<00:04:28.610> that<00:04:28.849> really<00:04:29.060> it's<00:04:29.270> in<00:04:29.419> the<00:04:29.450> exact

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
see that really it's in the exact

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.869 
see that really it's in the exact
same<00:04:30.139> place<00:04:30.500> now<00:04:30.800> it<00:04:31.129> did<00:04:31.370> not<00:04:31.610> necessarily

00:04:31.869 --> 00:04:31.879 
same place now it did not necessarily

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:33.969 
same place now it did not necessarily
always<00:04:32.539> the<00:04:32.660> same<00:04:32.870> place<00:04:33.169> it<00:04:33.410> always<00:04:33.560> depends

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
always the same place it always depends

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.279 
always the same place it always depends
on<00:04:34.190> what<00:04:34.819> kind<00:04:35.060> of<00:04:35.180> Chi<00:04:35.389> you<00:04:35.449> have<00:04:35.750> and<00:04:36.050> things

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
on what kind of Chi you have and things

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:38.409 
on what kind of Chi you have and things
like<00:04:36.440> that<00:04:36.530> but<00:04:37.340> the<00:04:37.729> faster<00:04:38.120> you<00:04:38.210> go<00:04:38.389> the

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
like that but the faster you go the

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.689 
like that but the faster you go the
better<00:04:38.720> breaks<00:04:39.680> you<00:04:39.889> theoretically<00:04:40.580> should

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
better breaks you theoretically should

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:42.550 
better breaks you theoretically should
have<00:04:41.030> so<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.389> breaking<00:04:41.750> pipe<00:04:41.960> doesn't<00:04:42.229> change

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
have so the breaking pipe doesn't change

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.890 
have so the breaking pipe doesn't change
all<00:04:42.800> that<00:04:43.129> much<00:04:43.400> as<00:04:44.030> you<00:04:44.210> can<00:04:44.330> see<00:04:44.509> we<00:04:44.659> come<00:04:44.810> up

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
all that much as you can see we come up

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.600 
all that much as you can see we come up
to<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:45.080> breaking<00:04:45.470> point<00:04:45.500> on<00:04:45.889> the<00:04:46.039> breaks<00:04:46.310> get

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
to the breaking point on the breaks get

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.760 
to the breaking point on the breaks get
to<00:04:46.759> the<00:04:46.849> speed<00:04:47.090> we<00:04:47.240> want<00:04:47.389> and<00:04:47.659> then<00:04:48.229> off<00:04:48.530> the

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
to the speed we want and then off the

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.730 
to the speed we want and then off the
breaks<00:04:49.009> as<00:04:49.220> soon<00:04:49.400> as<00:04:49.550> we<00:04:49.669> stab<00:04:49.879> to<00:04:50.060> 10<00:04:50.379> now<00:04:51.379> just

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
breaks as soon as we stab to 10 now just

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.140 
breaks as soon as we stab to 10 now just
to<00:04:51.830> finish<00:04:51.949> the<00:04:52.159> video<00:04:52.370> have<00:04:52.669> some<00:04:52.849> final

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
to finish the video have some final

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.779 
to finish the video have some final
thoughts<00:04:53.569> and<00:04:54.020> the<00:04:54.620> first<00:04:54.889> one<00:04:55.099> is<00:04:55.250> that<00:04:55.280> there

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
thoughts and the first one is that there

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:58.420 
thoughts and the first one is that there
is<00:04:55.940> always<00:04:56.240> an<00:04:56.569> optimal<00:04:57.020> breaking<00:04:57.500> point<00:04:57.830> now

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
is always an optimal breaking point now

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.980 
is always an optimal breaking point now
you<00:04:58.490> should<00:04:58.909> know<00:04:59.030> what<00:04:59.060> the<00:04:59.270> racing<00:04:59.629> line<00:04:59.659> is

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
you should know what the racing line is

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.749 
you should know what the racing line is
for<00:05:00.139> any<00:05:00.259> specific<00:05:00.650> corner<00:05:00.889> from<00:05:01.159> episode<00:05:01.520> one

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 
for any specific corner from episode one

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.370 
for any specific corner from episode one
and<00:05:01.970> it's<00:05:02.090> your<00:05:02.300> job<00:05:02.330> to<00:05:02.569> really<00:05:02.840> find<00:05:03.199> out

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
and it's your job to really find out

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.960 
and it's your job to really find out
what<00:05:03.590> that<00:05:03.800> racing<00:05:04.250> line<00:05:04.400> is<00:05:04.610> around<00:05:04.849> the

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
what that racing line is around the

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.550 
what that racing line is around the
corner<00:05:05.150> but<00:05:05.479> as<00:05:05.990> soon<00:05:06.169> as<00:05:06.259> you've<00:05:06.409> got<00:05:06.440> that

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
corner but as soon as you've got that

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.559 
corner but as soon as you've got that
racing<00:05:07.069> line<00:05:07.220> down<00:05:07.520> then<00:05:07.970> you<00:05:08.090> have<00:05:08.240> to<00:05:08.389> figure

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:08.569 
racing line down then you have to figure

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:10.749 
racing line down then you have to figure
out<00:05:08.780> what<00:05:09.020> the<00:05:09.169> breaking<00:05:09.560> point<00:05:09.800> is<00:05:10.009> to<00:05:10.520> allow

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 
out what the breaking point is to allow

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.370 
out what the breaking point is to allow
you<00:05:10.819> to<00:05:11.090> go<00:05:11.240> around<00:05:11.509> that<00:05:11.599> racing<00:05:12.050> line<00:05:12.199> as

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
you to go around that racing line as

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.499 
you to go around that racing line as
quickly<00:05:12.620> as<00:05:12.800> possible<00:05:12.860> now<00:05:13.789> that<00:05:13.819> comes<00:05:14.330> up

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:14.509 
quickly as possible now that comes up

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:16.659 
quickly as possible now that comes up
with<00:05:14.720> practice<00:05:15.169> so<00:05:15.409> the<00:05:15.860> best<00:05:16.039> thing<00:05:16.250> to<00:05:16.280> do<00:05:16.490> is

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
with practice so the best thing to do is

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.520 
with practice so the best thing to do is
break<00:05:16.880> a<00:05:16.940> little<00:05:17.150> bit<00:05:17.360> too<00:05:17.539> early<00:05:17.569> and<00:05:18.080> then

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
break a little bit too early and then

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.529 
break a little bit too early and then
gradually<00:05:19.009> break<00:05:19.280> later<00:05:19.580> and<00:05:19.880> later<00:05:20.060> every

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
gradually break later and later every

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.390 
gradually break later and later every
subsequent<00:05:20.840> lap<00:05:21.229> until<00:05:21.620> you<00:05:21.710> find<00:05:22.009> the<00:05:22.130> point

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
subsequent lap until you find the point

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.760 
subsequent lap until you find the point
where<00:05:22.520> you<00:05:23.240> can't<00:05:23.630> hit<00:05:23.960> that<00:05:24.169> racing<00:05:24.560> line

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
where you can't hit that racing line

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.680 
where you can't hit that racing line
anymore<00:05:25.009> as<00:05:25.699> soon<00:05:25.909> as<00:05:26.000> you<00:05:26.060> get<00:05:26.180> to<00:05:26.300> that<00:05:26.389> point

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
anymore as soon as you get to that point

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.839 
anymore as soon as you get to that point
just<00:05:26.930> go<00:05:27.319> back<00:05:27.590> one<00:05:27.830> step<00:05:28.039> to<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:28.460> breaking

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:28.849 
just go back one step to the breaking

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:30.610 
just go back one step to the breaking
point<00:05:28.879> that<00:05:29.150> you<00:05:29.210> had<00:05:29.330> before<00:05:29.690> then<00:05:29.900> and<00:05:30.080> that

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
point that you had before then and that

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.110 
point that you had before then and that
will<00:05:30.740> be<00:05:30.860> your<00:05:31.039> fastest<00:05:31.430> breaking<00:05:31.849> point

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
will be your fastest breaking point

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.020 
will be your fastest breaking point
obviously<00:05:32.360> practice<00:05:33.080> makes<00:05:33.680> perfect<00:05:33.949> and<00:05:34.370> the

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
obviously practice makes perfect and the

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.089 
obviously practice makes perfect and the
more<00:05:35.389> that<00:05:35.509> you<00:05:35.569> do<00:05:35.780> the<00:05:36.020> better<00:05:36.409> used<00:05:36.680> to<00:05:36.830> the

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.099 
more that you do the better used to the

more that you do the better used to the
breaking<00:05:37.759> point<00:05:37.789> that<00:05:38.150> you'll<00:05:38.300> get<00:05:38.479> but

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
breaking point that you'll get but

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.360 
breaking point that you'll get but
always<00:05:39.289> remember<00:05:39.620> to<00:05:39.710> use<00:05:39.860> braking

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
always remember to use braking

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.370 
always remember to use braking
references<00:05:40.909> on<00:05:41.030> the<00:05:41.150> side<00:05:41.360> of<00:05:41.569> the<00:05:41.690> road<00:05:41.900> to

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
remember your breaking point as well

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.570 
remember your breaking point as well
also<00:05:45.050> you<00:05:45.380> only<00:05:45.409> ever<00:05:45.800> want<00:05:46.039> to<00:05:46.099> be<00:05:46.219> pressing

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
also you only ever want to be pressing

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.459 
also you only ever want to be pressing
the<00:05:46.669> brake<00:05:46.880> pedal<00:05:47.240> once<00:05:47.539> on<00:05:47.900> every<00:05:48.199> corner

the brake pedal once on every corner

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:50.290 
the brake pedal once on every corner
because<00:05:49.069> if<00:05:49.340> you<00:05:49.400> do<00:05:49.550> it<00:05:49.669> anymore

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
because if you do it anymore

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.850 
because if you do it anymore
it<00:05:50.360> means<00:05:50.630> you<00:05:50.750> haven't<00:05:50.960> found<00:05:51.229> the<00:05:51.440> optimal

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
it means you haven't found the optimal

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.469 
it means you haven't found the optimal
point<00:05:52.250> for<00:05:52.370> the<00:05:52.550> corner<00:05:52.940> and<00:05:53.120> you're<00:05:53.330> not

going<00:05:53.779> as<00:05:53.900> quickly<00:05:54.169> as<00:05:54.409> you<00:05:54.469> can<00:05:54.770> if<00:05:55.400> you<00:05:55.580> on

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
going as quickly as you can if you on

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.670 
going as quickly as you can if you on
the<00:05:56.150> brakes<00:05:56.419> off<00:05:56.659> the<00:05:56.810> bricks<00:05:57.080> on<00:05:57.349> the<00:05:57.440> brakes

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
the brakes off the bricks on the brakes

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.769 
the brakes off the bricks on the brakes
off<00:05:57.919> the<00:05:58.039> brakes<00:05:58.250> all<00:05:58.520> on<00:05:58.699> one<00:05:58.880> corner<00:05:59.330> you're

00:05:59.769 --> 00:05:59.779 
off the brakes all on one corner you're

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:01.480 
off the brakes all on one corner you're
not<00:05:59.990> going<00:06:00.319> as<00:06:00.440> quickly<00:06:00.650> as<00:06:00.860> you<00:06:00.889> can<00:06:01.190> you<00:06:01.370> need

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
not going as quickly as you can you need

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.070 
not going as quickly as you can you need
to<00:06:01.639> just<00:06:01.849> find<00:06:02.090> the<00:06:02.300> braking<00:06:02.659> point<00:06:02.840> that

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
to just find the braking point that

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.529 
to just find the braking point that
allows<00:06:03.349> you<00:06:03.529> to<00:06:03.740> brick<00:06:04.039> nicely<00:06:04.789> for<00:06:05.389> the

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:05.539 
allows you to brick nicely for the

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:07.839 
allows you to brick nicely for the
corner<00:06:05.930> but<00:06:06.380> only<00:06:06.830> pressing<00:06:07.190> the<00:06:07.279> brake<00:06:07.490> pedal

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:07.849 
corner but only pressing the brake pedal

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:09.459 
corner but only pressing the brake pedal
once<00:06:08.090> and<00:06:08.389> as<00:06:08.479> soon<00:06:08.719> as<00:06:08.870> you're<00:06:08.990> off<00:06:09.110> the<00:06:09.259> brake

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:09.469 
once and as soon as you're off the brake

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.620 
once and as soon as you're off the brake
pedal<00:06:09.800> you're<00:06:10.310> not<00:06:10.520> meant<00:06:10.789> to<00:06:10.880> go<00:06:11.090> back<00:06:11.120> on<00:06:11.509> it

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
pedal you're not meant to go back on it

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.180 
pedal you're not meant to go back on it
again<00:06:11.930> that's<00:06:12.259> how<00:06:12.440> that's<00:06:12.680> how<00:06:12.860> you<00:06:12.949> go

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
again that's how that's how you go

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.459 
again that's how that's how you go
around<00:06:13.310> a<00:06:13.490> corner<00:06:13.729> properly<00:06:14.210> and<00:06:14.630> finally

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:15.469 
around a corner properly and finally

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:17.529 
around a corner properly and finally
obviously<00:06:16.130> when<00:06:16.340> you're<00:06:16.490> on<00:06:16.580> a<00:06:16.610> wheel<00:06:16.880> using<00:06:17.479> a

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:17.539 
obviously when you're on a wheel using a

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:19.120 
obviously when you're on a wheel using a
steering<00:06:17.900> wheel<00:06:17.930> with<00:06:18.289> pedals<00:06:18.620> it's<00:06:18.919> a<00:06:18.979> lot

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
steering wheel with pedals it's a lot

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.010 
steering wheel with pedals it's a lot
easier<00:06:19.490> to<00:06:19.639> modulate<00:06:20.120> your<00:06:20.150> braking<00:06:20.779> so<00:06:20.960> you

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
easier to modulate your braking so you

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.689 
easier to modulate your braking so you
can<00:06:21.199> come<00:06:21.409> off<00:06:21.560> it<00:06:21.710> as<00:06:21.860> you<00:06:21.979> go<00:06:22.099> into<00:06:22.219> a<00:06:22.340> corner

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:22.699 
can come off it as you go into a corner

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:24.610 
can come off it as you go into a corner
if<00:06:22.969> you're<00:06:23.509> on<00:06:23.630> a<00:06:23.659> controller<00:06:24.199> where<00:06:24.500> you<00:06:24.529> can

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
if you're on a controller where you can

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.290 
if you're on a controller where you can
only<00:06:24.919> press<00:06:25.279> the<00:06:25.430> brake<00:06:25.639> pedal<00:06:25.669> either<00:06:26.060> on<00:06:26.270> or

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
only press the brake pedal either on or

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.749 
only press the brake pedal either on or
off<00:06:26.479> sort<00:06:26.870> of<00:06:26.960> thing<00:06:27.169> and<00:06:27.380> just<00:06:28.099> focus<00:06:28.639> on

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 
off sort of thing and just focus on

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:30.309 
off sort of thing and just focus on
doing<00:06:29.029> all<00:06:29.210> of<00:06:29.270> your<00:06:29.509> braking<00:06:29.750> in<00:06:29.990> a<00:06:30.050> straight

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
line don't try to break into a corner or
