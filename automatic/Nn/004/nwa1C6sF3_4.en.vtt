00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.949
 This is a very great mod because for me 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.840

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.800
 cool weapons can say so well 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.620
 Well let's start I'll start with the fact that 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.989
 I will show you all that all this he adds 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.680
 mask spiderman without which you are not 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:02.820
 can do anything bib on 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.100
 legs and boots so that it 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.909
 we need a fabric spider 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.689
 found silk spiderman silk and he 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.889
 falls out 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:17.090
 it can be crafted using one 

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:20.069
 Vovochka dye is a radioactive spider 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.520
 if anyone knows ink and ink 

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:23.579
 bag 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.590
 cobweb and red dye it 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:35.340
 crafted 1st 3 and silk 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:37.679
 so in order to craft the helmet we need both 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.259
 usual we red helmet just lay out 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.060
 from silk spiderman to craft those 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.489
 bib is the same on the leg the same 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.439
 same and this same thing let me tell you 

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:50.489
 I will show how where where falls 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.560
 radioactive spider let's take 

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:56.219
 diamond sword to kill faster 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.460
 this spider span span span span 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:03.150
 span of town 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.280
 here now he urge a creature let's 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.409
 designed more to see if that 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.890
 textures are as far as I know because of 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.270
 version 1 62 was bad mod ported but 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.040
 the texture is therefore no different let's 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.110
 try to beat see everything one 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.810
 radioactive spider ie these shelves 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:23.520
 themselves spun in principle but their just 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.520
 find it will be more difficult to clean than to find than 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.140
 usually a cave spider in general like this 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.000
 Here we get these cavemen and 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.130
 radioactive spiders sorry made a reservation 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.050
 and then we make ourselves a cloth after which we 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.610
 just make yourself a costume as you see 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.390
 That's such a cool February scales 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.120
 drawn very even nothing and we 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.100
 open ability look i 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.250
 just can crawl on the walls for any 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.250
 the walls that is i can damn but here 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:55.080
 creepers I don't know let me show the data 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:59.730
 you say it is creative and so on 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:02.160
 let's disconnect everything i have disabled 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.040
 creative q i just press hear i 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.040
 punched do not pinch do nothing here he 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.470
 just just just crawling that is 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.820
 i can streaks on any trees also 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.670
 have a super jump 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.470
 if we jump once like this 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.840
 normal jump if we jump and 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.980
 we clamp something we already ask somewhere on 5 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.070
 6 blocks 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.540
 here's how you see how it looks with 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:29.730
 hand if we pinch twice 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.070
 by about 10 already that is the longer we 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.930
 we clamp the more there is a jump then 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.170
 there is if we just hold he will see 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.140
 just do a double jump and also have 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.730
 us speed super speed also we 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.090
 we can get on ceilings too 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:49.910
 not least let me turn on like mine 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.910
 included yes no 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:58.700
 beer here let me take just 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:04.430
 having built blocks and put here such 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:06.560
 house like this like this way now I'm 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.540
 I'll turn off the creative q is a plus 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.260
 ordinary world how to see my heart 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.000
 everything shows up and crawl upward like you 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.840
 I canâ€™t see back because if I 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.570
 crawl back hour Kerzhakov camp 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.320
 then I just fall, but if I clamp the space 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.360
 and I will do this as you see it, I just 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.340
 stuck like a real spiderman when 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.350
 that enemy did not enter his room 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.780
 I remember I think all the boys in childhood 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.340
 wanted to be human shelves so what 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.400
 it was a pretty cool movie 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.470
 fiction and all that 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.830
 What else adds this mod has not forgotten 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:45.220
 tell you this in a shooter in general 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.270
 crafting it in such a simple way 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.720
 quite expensive because three 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:56.710
 iron ingots three diamonds two gold and 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:05:01.790
 one radioactive spider both in the floor and in 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:06.740
 Thong in general let me turn on the creative 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:08.419
 q to get it all creative here it is 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.800
 different if not mistaken 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:16.100
 yes here we get take 64 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:20.300
 gobbol and 64 these 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:23.630
 his horns still take this little thing in 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:26.450
 So here it is, they throw that is, 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.800
 idea earlier when we clamped the letter z he 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:32.330
 rushed just ordinary 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.760
 common and these quality forgot to say 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.430
 cobwebs and that is, cobweb blocks are ordinary 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.889
 blocks of the web that is as you know in 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.660
 caves when you get into the cobweb you 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.690
 get confused in the same way to you an example 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:47.000
 the cat is running a mob or someone else you pressed z 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.130
 and quickly put immediately burdina but now 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.680
 we can only do so of course 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.900
 adds nothing to what these blocks are 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.760
 due to the fact that the mode was poorly ported but 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.600
 can still say thank you 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:04.360
 developers and of course it is a gun 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:06.740
 which does this what i said this what 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.910
 it's hard enough to manage it but now 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.680
 we can really be ourselves 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.770
 feel the human spider because 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.419
 what do you see as i'm without creative ki-ya 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.090
 You can say I fly because I 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:18.710
 move very very fast it 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.600
 wonderful dear friends can also 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.570

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.169
 it weighed see the procedure to the top 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.010

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:40.210
 yupi and as you see me without criticism 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:43.039
 dear friends without creative key 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:45.680
 Well, since I'm a spider man, I can crawl 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:49.760
 as you see i can crawl crawl and 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:52.190

 all very well traced closely and 

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:27.260
 disappointment is something that you can not throw 

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:28.940
 blocks from the web and so we look 

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.570
 we can still run and just double 

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.630
 leap 

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.980
 to fly huge distances just 

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.530
 giant distances 

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.660
 and this is without criticism dear friends 

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:40.580

 some distant cave or in the desert 

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:46.190
 to extract sand and then you need again 

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:48.470
