like<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> little<00:01:23.549> house<00:01:23.700> 5e<00:01:24.240> see<00:01:24.479> we're<00:01:24.750> moving

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
like a little house 5e see we're moving

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.719 
like a little house 5e see we're moving
that<00:01:25.500> out<00:01:25.619> soon<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.100> can<00:01:26.250> automatically

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
that out soon so you can automatically

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.440 
that out soon so you can automatically
just<00:01:27.000> buy<00:01:27.540> off<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.840> sign<00:01:28.729> there<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.060> second

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
just buy off a sign there is the second

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.240 
just buy off a sign there is the second
region<00:01:30.689> which<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.960> hopefully<00:01:31.560> going<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.100> roll

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
region which is hopefully going to roll

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.100 
region which is hopefully going to roll
out<00:01:32.430> soon<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.150> mean<00:01:33.390> that's<00:01:33.630> still<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.869> while

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.840 
out soon I mean that's still a while
away<00:01:34.259> it's<00:01:34.650> still<00:01:34.829> being<00:01:34.979> terraformed<00:01:35.670> and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
away it's still being terraformed and

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.300 
away it's still being terraformed and
stuff<00:01:36.360> like<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.750> but<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.170> should<00:01:37.409> be<00:01:37.439> soon
