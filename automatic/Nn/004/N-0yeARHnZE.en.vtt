00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.710
 four wheel drive 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:13.200
 this kind proves enjoyment can again 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.619
 and around the clock almost as old as 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.390
 car week hello and nice that you look again 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.640
 to the car week journal 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.950
 yes with regard to cars , 2015 is real 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.810
 fantastic started as what for the 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.149
 swallowing purist are a top man 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.919
 of bmw m gmbh said that the 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.899
 new m5 a new m6 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.880
 get four-wheel drive yes how 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.440
 bad is that yes the christ and the murder 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.790
 fire shout all those 2 series first 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.740
 with front-wheel drive and then also 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.990
 de and models that 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.580
 and 8 your rescue fleece although press the xs 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.320
 and I already give him four-wheel drive 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.690
 yes yes i don't think that is very bad 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.950
 because I have become important anyway 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.540
 It's only for your company to be one 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.400
 option and mercedes soon option on 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.690
 on the the stall spirit and those abilities 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.070
 the rear wheel is increasing so much 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.390
 drive it is becoming increasingly difficult to 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.190
 control all those forces with behind 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.079
 kidneys what recently an m5 with 600 euros 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.060
 when a little raining is no longer too 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.970
 do and watch drifting that is fun with 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.960
 an m &amp; m dreamer of m5 m6 can of the m6 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.360
 gran coupe 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.590
 yes that there are parents trips log for 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.760
 and it just drives a lot more relaxed with you 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.530
 all of the torque obtained from 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.880
 so you think if it's a french option 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.810
 then they just ca n't do them 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.820
 keep satisfied can go to the 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.440
 take the rear wheels and then as an option for 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.700
 for a test think american markets 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.020
 4 wheel drive I also very good 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.670
 yes and you won't bother anyone 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.990
 its m5 and america is often also over then 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.979
 so the most expensive is those people only want 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.990
 but not drifts that just want 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.360
 nice cruising and showing that is money 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.100
 have shown me that religion is also important 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.370
 burning content because when you m56 dog pk 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.500
 a few days after the die css amg with 585 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.150
 pk and before with I prepared a lot of relax 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.080
 yes and you see that tempos are always good 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.070
 manageable 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.750
 Mercedes is still going up 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.490
 bets they have said to come too 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.740
 This year also all additional models 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.970
 no models for me to come there 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.530
 I also by model as the cla cla 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.549
 shooting break because you have a fight 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.170
 a45 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.110
 give the dike only four-wheel drive 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.060
 yellow indicates your four-wheel drive and 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.500
 yes then they are somewhere okay say the old 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.880
 bit before the troops were out of them 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.110
 again going to want both the name you 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.820
 more powerful now that we are 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.409
 ever started and with yes yes 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.640
 because indeed the quattro gmbh 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.320
 say of course yes you see sometimes 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.180
 what god said yes but I think so 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.369
 a little different per segment because 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.720
 something like a m3 m4 s rear wheel floating 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.000
 I already much more important and whether you're up 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.409
 want an RS4 person all-wheel drive 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.749
 I think it's different and if you have an RSS 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.360
 I have 600hp tiled then it gets 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:17.680
 different and 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.630
 do you need the taxi much more? 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.150
 conclusion from 500 hp 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.060
 anyway nice video yeah okay thank you 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.190
 hear yes that it is at all about such 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.050
 have cars in 2015 is actually 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.400
 nice again and you could tell by this you become 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.470
 been on that american will 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.850
 let's see the real horsepower and that 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.740
 I drove past you that way 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.570
 experienced a fair in a fight that then 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.850
 the Chinese last comes back a bit 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.170
 had some more horsepower for years 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.580
 five years ago was really just 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.290
 were green news in our sports cars 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.000
 sometimes tucked away a bit 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.620
 det anyway there was a lot in general 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.850
 news and start puff falls like it 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.959
 a quarter of miser everything is actually 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.240
 above three 400 hp 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.920
 yes, that is already a MOT violence 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.920
 this not for traiter to in a socially 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.810
 350 there is still old-fashioned v8 roaring 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.820
 you also at the other brands that quite 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.870
 cat here with 700 plus hp new and therefore x 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.980
 with 550 hp 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.030
 g 63 amg also 500 like hp version 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.440
 the unusually new 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.330
 what a service is also what name is 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.830
 Impress JJ van GT and the you play 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.910
 the edge is watching me too and there 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.220
 have waited so long 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.780
 yes that yes so many concepts see it 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.100
 exciting is the finish and she is secret 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.180
 hold on the plane of feeding of hey 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.610
 maybe seed in her to how that 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.140
 no one looked and knew that 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.459
 thing there so great as long as i like it 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.290
 with distance and most beautiful super car of this 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.700
 moment there is no question and for opinion or 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.590
 something close to cable ox van 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.540
 so that in fort no doubt whatsoever 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.519
 well you hear it sounds like before 2050 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.170
 yes really really good started first 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.790
 you in between we already go to the 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.160
 next birth to we live because that is 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.540
 Geneva At the beginning of March it is party time again 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.720
 yes we will always be in the coming weeks 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.580
 more released car two exists 25 years 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.560
 will not have escaped you and soak old 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.470
 actually has three pillars of news 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.510
 occasions and tests and I edit our 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.320
 used specialist 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.060
 around the clock that is really a whole 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.900
 popular section is how long has existed 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.090
 that actually already 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.310
 well I 've looked it up before 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.299
 the number 1 1992 then stood the first 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.430
 so the set with 23 years 1992 in 20 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.959
 year over two years for 25 years bellflower 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.430
 of course that goes extra large 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.709
 but actually every week is one 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.060
 party but a bell around that name 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.739
 which of course comes from the fact that you 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.600
 not alice I used to have only 100,000 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.280
 started again is you good usually 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.739
 Nowadays it is no longer 100,000 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.150
 spectacular no then you have suffered 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.500
 have or qualify now 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.020
 well I kind of set the lower limit 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.660
 gasoline 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.860
 so at 3 tons and for the diesels at 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.389
 500,000 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.009
 and after the come out pretty nice 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.389
 usually reasonable but good if 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.669
 there is now a very special car 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.560
 minority walked through a good story 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.250
 then we want another exception 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.409
 make of course 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.780
 yes who went that first cup around that 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:43.220
 about toyota yes that's right yes i will 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.930
 just read it to him because the new one 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.789
 heading being opened 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.960
 high mileage scares off demand 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.250
 but agree with your dealer a car with 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.270
 more than a ton on the counter 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.550
 hard to sell 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.960
 so we thought dream yes yes I do have it 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.789
 idea that the older generation is just 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.949
 that idea of ​​how maud has and then me 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:59.930
 needs him from nationwide 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:01.159
 no everything stands or falls with it 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.930
 maintenance is such a car has achieved 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:04.639
 of course and how broad is a car 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.009
 counting with aluminum is also possible as 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.330
 I am good, as we regularly prove 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.190
 couple now have a look there is watching 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.830
 and he thinks my car has it 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.659
 four tongue gasoline I 'm going we are going 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.610

 technocenter yes that chicken that car 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.650
 inside out that goes a bit 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.960
 you ride along and that money is your judgment 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.460

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.590

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.729
 yes also yes that has also changed 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.130
 by we once started with one 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:37.880
 so have fun with two more pages 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.620
 was not it 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.180
 and so that now heading is quite big 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.680
 grown you this week 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.569
 what do we have around the clock yes this one 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.460
 weeks so nice really accidentally we are 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:48.590
 once started with an anonymous Japanese 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.419
 on diesel these columns with two 110,000 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.740
 kilometers and now we actually have it too 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:54.110
 a little anonymous Japanese again 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.310
 diesel and and nissan almera sedan one 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.750
 gray with hubcaps 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.400
 but half a million km on the clock 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.680
 and that they most spectacular car that 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.969
 ever been in block 2 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.590
 yes that is hard to say of course 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:05.240
 I find the high mileage myself 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.550
 of natural interesting I find 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.740
 Ron Hendrix with Honda Civic now your 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.389
 over the million has gone on lpg 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.190
