 summary 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.499
 let's see the summary of a match 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.829
 the first where we are 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.309
 insistently but it opens the way to 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.989
 triumph 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.009
 the name that we would see on the screen 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.009
 chosen has been a marcelo 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:20.759
 allows you not only to take advantage of 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.399
 mark and put when the 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.590
 first time the reassuring 12-0 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.270
 starts the second time and richard evil 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.569
 We said start of the transformation 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.409
 looking for the arch in front but here not 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:33.409
 to make mistakes 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.480
 took advantage of a long appointment 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.210
 and there was the clear image of the 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.820
 workers 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.390
 two meters behind the sky that 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.180
 responsible for putting the 3 to 0 effectiveness 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.720
 It was tremendous tremendous 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.720
 as well 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.100
 only behind his back 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.100
 for 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:07.119
 Marcelo corresponds the final 4-0 in 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.119
 favor of 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.180
 it made everything easy it seemed like it was 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.890
 a complicated later ends up being the 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.890
 easy scoring four goals
