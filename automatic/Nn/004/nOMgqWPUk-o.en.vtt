00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.500
 interview with revolt where andré da ntv 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.359
 champion of xm arena that in são paulo to 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.210
 third edition of the event first 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.359
 congratulations on the victory and against the penalty 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.830
 It 's rebellion, you've had days there. 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.930
 very run in a real 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.539
 marathon cd title lol 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.820
 then the trip to the Oscar dispute 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.550
 meat air now returned upon 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.090
 also to dispute the cna is like 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.300
 stay focused and more than anything is 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.690
 do not let yourself be overwhelmed by fatigue 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.550
 The guy was very difficult even because the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.770
 We got a championship everyone 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.870
 saw that we could not 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.670
 there and after finishing the championship 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.320
 We have two more days there. 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.539
 so we got used to the side of there 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.789
 We came here and the next day. 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.070
 I see mine then it was six in the morning already 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.729
 I was awake from society was a 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.260
 sleep but we took some time 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.270
 this time from my experience 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.180
 there to fix this to sleep one more 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.060
 little on your side 14 hours a day only 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.560
 to set the time and we beat the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.950
 stress mainly stress 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.290
 because losing there had everything has a weight and 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.540
 I came here thinking this study convinced 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.380
 more that you have brought learning 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.820
 from there to learn what the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.100
 people have to prepare against the whole 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.310
 team does not have a stronger team than 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.380
 the other one can come to any series 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.759
 we can see different styles with 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.650
 one thing that basically learned there 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.700
 not that we played of several things 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.619
 many different 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.750
 we met better as a team 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.450
 and we principally principle 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.820
 learned to deal with new ones by playing with 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.829
 teams there then I 'll say it 's a great 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.659
 trip for us to train with which 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.390
 Teams in Europe 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.380
 so we got to train with the ro 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.390
 qat 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:06.180
 if I am not mistaken the act before and 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.489
 the team is here and here at 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.039
 it is from the four participants three teams 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.829
 are changes in the line you are 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.750
 the only ones who have not changed are and I think 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:18.420
 that this made some difference 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.840
 Dude, difference always makes that was 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.189
 a change but I think the pen it 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.349
 It is much stronger than it was 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.730
 before so they will be a change was 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.720
 play in the championship by beating the front 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.310
 with us 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.650
 we also want to diminish have had a lot 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.989
 time to prepare but I will say that 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.359
 I have is prudent the strongest team 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.069
 now of local knowledge with us and 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.480
 still maintains the same there and neither pro 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.829
 according to critics and block 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.209
 so we want to keep people 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.599
 do not intend to make changes to any 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.739
 change the correct is the full has decided to leave 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.599
 will have the download window now 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.959
 everything will be studied the possibility of 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.700
 stay out all this will be thought but 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.409
 Do not mean to send anyone 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.090
 the team question is not a 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.290
 possibility of change would be the 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.269
 biggest individual lesson of the players 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.540
 even that would be it is this is basically 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.260
 This is what I envisioned for the future of 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.269
 team 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.799
 in 20 days nor start to receive or 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.569
 more or less decide not to have much 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.280
 time to rest and what to do and 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.349
 going to train in that time will take a 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.069
 Fixed slack weeks are 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.459
 planning 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.720
 so we're going to take around 123 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.659
 days off 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.150
 practical and home she thought she knew how to use 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.489
 head championship website relax 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.199
 so I think it's important but 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.909
 when they returned to advantage in a total 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:35.159
 spirit has to be more focused than 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.889
 the other is the first politician I did not enter 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:39.389
 team was already in the process of 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:41.909
 learning to see how it works 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.650
 of a slower evolution now people 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.750
 can go for one thing more seek 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.879
 if our world is lacking 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.319
 I think according to the requests and back more 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.699
 difficult than the first by the teams 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.819
 they rated 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:56.189
 I'll say yes, I 'll say ready 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.109
 only looking now has no way of knowing 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:00.780
 exactly what they are very strong but 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:02.970
 today I have before and to pension the 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.250
 two teams that plan to give more 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.169
 work at least in the beginning and how 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.439
 keep on top is that now you have been 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:12.569
 cb champions lol win the question xm 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:15.030
 there at the top being the best team in the 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.949
 Brazil is difficult to keep on top nor 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.959
 players often repeat themselves 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.599
 it is harder to stay on top of what 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.370
 get there right because so when you 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:25.710
 is on top 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.180
 world wants to get out of there no matter what 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.669
 rest and rest 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.400
 But what do we do to get 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:35.160
 keep on top is to stay focused know the 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.690
 You do not know where to have no slack 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.310
 people went to the semis in their blog 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.900
 has a final play, did not take time off because 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.190
 There is no play, but no play. 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.650
 none during split 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.720
 he was always focused on the game, people 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.000
 lunch of game conversion and doing 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.229
 together get the game that our focus 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.639
 it was the same 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.190
 It's still the same is to reach the world cup 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:55.740
 world war and who knows? 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.900
 and will continue to be so because this 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.800
 was the interview with the revolt of the year reads 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.220
 from mtv xm champion to mega arena in são 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.220
