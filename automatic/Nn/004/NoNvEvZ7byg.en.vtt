all<00:02:09.240> eight<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.510> them<00:02:09.920> so<00:02:10.920> here's<00:02:11.340> what<00:02:11.520> they

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
all eight of them so here's what they

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.010 
all eight of them so here's what they
look<00:02:11.820> like<00:02:11.850> once<00:02:12.270> you've<00:02:12.420> been<00:02:12.540> crumpled<00:02:12.960> up

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020

into a wall so I think of just crumpling
it<00:02:17.520> all<00:02:17.640> up<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.030> then<00:02:18.360> your<00:02:18.750> next<00:02:18.900> step<00:02:19.260> is

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.119 

this<00:04:07.739> one<00:04:08.010> fluffed<00:04:08.430> back<00:04:08.780> next<00:04:09.780> fun<00:04:10.260> and<00:04:11.040> I

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
this one fluffed back next fun and I

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:12.710 
this one fluffed back next fun and I
really<00:04:11.159> like<00:04:11.640> this<00:04:11.849> because<00:04:12.090> this<00:04:12.299> is<00:04:12.360> white

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
really like this because this is white

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.960 
really like this because this is white
paper<00:04:12.989> and<00:04:13.260> all<00:04:13.349> we<00:04:13.379> did<00:04:13.650> was<00:04:13.709> really<00:04:14.159> spray<00:04:14.790> on

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
paper and all we did was really spray on

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.650 
paper and all we did was really spray on
the<00:04:15.060> one<00:04:15.239> side<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:16.130> so<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.190> can<00:04:18.120> make<00:04:18.359> it<00:04:18.600> as

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
the one side and so you can make it as

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.960 
the one side and so you can make it as
small<00:04:18.989> as<00:04:19.289> you<00:04:19.440> want<00:04:19.470> and<00:04:19.949> still<00:04:20.280> damp<00:04:20.579> so<00:04:20.880> the

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
small as you want and still damp so the

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.090 
small as you want and still damp so the
waters<00:04:21.299> pretty<00:04:21.539> close<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.350> paper<00:04:22.830> is

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
waters pretty close the the paper is

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.969 
waters pretty close the the paper is
fairly<00:04:23.460> pliable<00:04:24.110> so<00:04:25.110> there's<00:04:25.289> one<00:04:25.530> example

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
fairly pliable so there's one example

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:28.310 
fairly pliable so there's one example
here's<00:04:26.460> another<00:04:26.729> one<00:04:27.000> that<00:04:27.150> I<00:04:27.180> did<00:04:27.479> for<00:04:27.870> few

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
here's another one that I did for few

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.640 
here's another one that I did for few
minutes<00:04:28.470> before<00:04:29.070> we<00:04:29.220> started<00:04:29.550> the<00:04:29.669> video<00:04:30.060> and

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
minutes before we started the video and

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.890 
minutes before we started the video and
look<00:04:31.650> how<00:04:31.770> pretty<00:04:31.949> that<00:04:32.130> one<00:04:32.460> is<00:04:32.639> and<00:04:32.910> as<00:04:33.780> you

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
look how pretty that one is and as you

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.450 
look how pretty that one is and as you
can<00:04:34.050> see<00:04:34.080> you<00:04:34.590> can<00:04:34.680> make<00:04:35.009> them<00:04:35.250> in<00:04:35.340> different

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
can see you can make them in different

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.090 
can see you can make them in different
colors<00:04:35.850> this<00:04:36.030> I<00:04:36.210> actually<00:04:36.389> made<00:04:36.780> out<00:04:37.050> of<00:04:37.380> paper

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100
