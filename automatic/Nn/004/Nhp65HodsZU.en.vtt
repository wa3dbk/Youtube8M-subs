00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.390 

presumably<00:01:33.450> how<00:01:34.229> complex<00:01:34.799> with<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.100> stack

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
presumably how complex with the stack

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.550 
presumably how complex with the stack
sketch<00:01:35.729> I'm<00:01:35.939> into<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.330> um<00:01:36.540> there's<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.320> one
