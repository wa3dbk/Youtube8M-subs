00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.820
Ciao everyone, here it's Marchettino.

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.052
Today I'm visiting my friends at Italian Luxury Car Hire,

00:00:05.052 --> 00:00:09.737
if you check out their website you may see that they have lots of nice cars available to rent

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.400
and considering that their company is based in Maranello which is Ferrari's home town,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.240
today I'm going for a test drive in a...

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.480
McLaren.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.060
So this is it, their 2014 McLaren 650S!

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.640
Looks so sweet in orange!

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.895
I think this will be a very interesting test for me because this will be actually my very first experience in a McLaren model!

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.200
I'm pretty excited!

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.600
Here's the key!

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.720
The opening mechanism of the McLaren is so cool!

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.780
Let's get inside and fire up the car!

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.820
Engine start

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.120
It's a lovely summer day so let's open the roof as well!

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.040
I think now we're ready to go!

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.760
Ok so, the first thing I wanna do is to drive out the city as soon as possible

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.588
because I want to remember you guys that I'm driving in Maranello, which is Ferrari's territory

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.460
and I'm driving a McLaren!

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.720
Ferrari's everywhere!

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.000
Ok so, let's try the first acceleration with this McLaren!

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.920
That's FAAAST!

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.040
Then we turn right, so please

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.580
That's fast! My goodness!

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.880
Wow!

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.120
What you think about it?

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.080
Wow!

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.820
Yes you can really feel the power with this car!

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.040
There are two (speed) bumps!

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.900
So pay attention

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.480
First and the second

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.960
And another Ferrari!

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.760
Too much Ferrari!

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.980
We're in Italy and most people go for Ferrari or Lamborghini so if you really wanna stand out, you have to buy a McLaren

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.160
because you don't really see them very often here.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.720
The acceleration is unbelievable!

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.520
Above 3000rpms hell breaks loose, wow!

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.150
Unbelievable!

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.580
Whenever I smash my right foot on the brake pedal,

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.040
I can see in the back the big air wing that goes up, this is so cool!

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.140
There's a slight turbo lag and also with the throttle but

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.660
when the turbos kick in, my goodness!

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:07.560
Now I can realize why Ferrari has gone turbo with the 488 GTB because

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:20.880
this car features a 3.8L twin turbo V8 that produces 650hp and 678nm of torque and

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.480
there's no way that you can compete with a V8 naturally aspirated engine, this is so impressive!

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:34.420
Exact! In my opinion, this is the best turbo engine right now that people can.. much better than a Ferrari!

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.260
We're trolling around Ferrari in a McLaren!

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.160
We're in serious trouble!

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.140
A orange spot in a red sea!

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.420
I can feel the traction control that kicks in!

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.940
This is so wild!

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.140
But the balance and stability is good I think, this is really well built,

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.220
everything is well done. - It is!

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.860
While driving slowly I can talk about the interior which is

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.540
it's not very exciting to me I mean, it's very simple

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.700
but at the same time it's not distracting I think because it doesn't have many buttons,

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.240
you just have the steering wheel, the paddles behind,

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.520
the central console which is very cool with this digital screen,

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.720
you have the manettino where you can change the setup and that's all!

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.630
It's enough! - Yeah that's enough!

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:36.720
I like the fact that it has so much alcantara and carbon fibre and the orange stitching does a really nice contrast I think.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.880
And what about the comfort?

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.220
It is quite comfortable, actually!

00:05:41.382 --> 00:05:43.222
Yeah, I think, pretty good!

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.260
The seats are comfortable and they offer a very nice lateral support!

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.340
Let's do it!

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.460
Wow!

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.120
I shouldn't have eaten a pizza right before going for this test drive because

00:06:13.214 --> 00:06:18.974
whenever you smash the foot on the throttle, the boost just keep you pushed on the seat!

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.060
It has so much torque and boost, wow!

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.440
Hello Ferrari!

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:45.660
My first experience in a McLaren, wow! I'm impressed, actually! What a car, so much power!

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:51.480
Thanks Italian Luxury Car Hire for the test drive, if you come to Maranello you can test drive their cars as well,

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.560
make sure to check out their website for more, link in the video description.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.620
Perhaps the next time, a test drive with the Huracan?

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.600
Anyway, I hope you guys did enjoy the video

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.821
and make sure to subscribe to my YouTube channel for more

00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:04.141
and as always thanks for watching, ciao!

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.440
I would take a Ferrari though.. oops!
