00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.280
 hello dear friends with you pavel 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.799
 Bagryantsev and in this video I would like 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.410
 talk about what to do for 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.750
 order to stop being afraid of people that i 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.210
 I mean, stop being afraid of it 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.970
 doesn't mean you go walk and people 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.519
 afraid it means that we are so 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.699
 closed in everyday communication 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.800
 we are so afraid here we have 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.960
 a certain veil before us some 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.210
 barrier and we just can not break through 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.579
 as if it is unreal that is, we 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.170
 we live our shell in our little world 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.989
 alone with your thoughts and 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.360
 representations and in this shell we 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.879
 with our thoughts we give birth to a certain 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.460
 model a certain picture of the world and with 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.829
 time with your thoughts when we give birth 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.020
 this picture of the world it becomes for us 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.370
 real meaning we are starting to think that 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.120
 the world is really such 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.370
 but it's no secret that there is 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.010
 various techniques of the program and so on 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.530
 who are just a picture of the world can you 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.180
 destroy literally in seconds 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.920
 that is, you change the view 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:18.119
 about it but in general I don't even know me 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.850
 even words are not chosen that is all that 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.729
 you thought up yourself how the world looks like 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.310
 everything collapses absolutely so 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.810
 let's imagine what you have 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.369
 any fears do you have any 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.869
 constraints you are afraid to approach a person 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.579
 to meet him you think that you 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.610
 will refuse because you once 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.220
 refused you think that you have with this 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.079
 girl with this type of girl relationship 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.960
 will not work because you have already communicated 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.090
 such girls and you refused and 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.720
 you formed some fears man 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.670
 based on my fears I will 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.430
 set yourself some definite framework 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.590
 or barriers i mean i don't go there with 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.650
 I don’t communicate with these with me 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.160
 relationships don't add up and here we are everywhere 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.240
 we protect ourselves with certain barriers and 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.160
 for us it becomes so 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.740
 real that we start to think that 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.770
 such a life we begin to argue about 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.320
 that such a category of people she behaves 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.980
 so and here are the girls here they are 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:21.350
 ourselves and we are not what we accepted 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.150
 before we took the truth we still have this people 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.610
 truth impose and it's true 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.680
 called my personal opinion that is my 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.750
 personal opinion that this is so so 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.500
 although actually spend simple 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.240
 experiment start going out of this 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.530
 shells start changing your life 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.330
 how are you standing at the bus stop and 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.209
 before you is a serious man with 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.230
 serious face big business man 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.070
 and so on, you approach him 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.490
 Hello, I'm sorry to bother you. 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:56.030
 You can ask but how to be the same 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.860
 don't know successful serious how are you 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.260
 it's just a trivial question you can 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.780
 ask any question if you have 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.450
 chewing gum or not and you will see that person 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.610
 People will smile to you, he will 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.980
 will begin to answer you of course 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.630
 category of people who will say well guy 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.690
 something to ask sorry I do not have 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:18.080
 time but the person will answer how many times 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.940
 such in life was when here you are not 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.970
 never communicated with a person you him 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.170
 seen in school at the institute at work 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.239
 know there are people with whom we are not 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.830
 communicate we see them every day and here in 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.290
 one moment you met and started 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:34.100
 communicate and it turned out that this person 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:37.730
 so cool cheerful interesting kind 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:40.010
 and so on about what does it say that we 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.440
 we form our own idea of 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.410
 that world which is around us 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.230
 and form 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.600
 and based on some of their experiences and 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.570
 if this experience of failures is natural we 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.790
 we start to put barriers around us 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.560
 this is how our thinking is shaped 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.840
 regarding the family regarding the girls 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.630
 regarding work or business to us 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.230
 Immediately it seems that this type of business I do not 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.600
 will pull 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.970
 I can’t communicate with such girls 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.980
 I can't go to such a gym 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.900
 so I can not become that is, we 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.540
 we become so enslaved 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.900
 the lives that we all hung ourselves 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.610
 shortcuts that you can not do anything though 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.460
 in fact, this is just a projection 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:25.500
 our brain, understand what man has 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.810
 boundless power 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.750
 just boundless power he can 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.970
 do absolutely everything but you need to 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.520
 start shooting these barriers shooting this 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.450
 change the shroud and start by changing your 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.520
 environment 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.040
 approach people who are near you 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.840
 talk to them and you will understand that these 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.810
 people are kind sympathetic they will be happy with 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.000
 you communicate to ask someone 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.730
 share your experience start living 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.790
 differently not how they all live start 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:56.280
 do other extraordinary unlike 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.290
 you steps and you will begin to get life 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.440
 get a completely new effect 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.300
