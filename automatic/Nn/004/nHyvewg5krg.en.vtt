cast on you need to make sure that you

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.269 
cast on you need to make sure that you
have<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.480> tail<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.529> cord<00:00:28.740> coming<00:00:28.980> out<00:00:29.130> of

have a tail of the cord coming out of
the<00:00:29.340> bottom<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.789> tool<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.720> take<00:00:31.529> hold<00:00:31.769> of

right-handed and vice versa if you're
not<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.570> then<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.719> need<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.960> wrap<00:00:37.200> your<00:00:38.090> cord

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
not and then you need to wrap your cord

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.569 
not and then you need to wrap your cord
around<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:40.379> fur<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.860> pin<00:00:41.040> furthest<00:00:41.430> away

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
around the fur the pin furthest away

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.959 
around the fur the pin furthest away
from<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.329> clockwise<00:00:42.750> direction<00:00:42.809> and

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
from you in a clockwise direction and

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.729 
from you in a clockwise direction and
then<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.270> need<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.539> move<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.899> pin<00:00:46.379> on<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
then you need to move to the pin on the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.520 
then you need to move to the pin on the
left<00:00:46.890> or<00:00:47.370> anti-clockwise<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.320> same

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
left or anti-clockwise and do the same

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.779 
left or anti-clockwise and do the same
thing<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:51.199> you<00:00:52.199> continue<00:00:52.680> round<00:00:52.949> until<00:00:53.640> you

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
thing and you continue round until you

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.369 
thing and you continue round until you
have<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.420> loop<00:00:54.930> around<00:00:55.379> each<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.670> pins<00:00:57.379> you

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
have a loop around each of the pins you

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.170 
have a loop around each of the pins you
then<00:00:58.620> continue<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.250> make<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> second<00:01:00.000> loop

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
then continue and make a second loop

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.240 
then continue and make a second loop
around<00:01:00.629> each<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.379> pins<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:04.040> then<00:01:05.040> you

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
around each of the pins and then you

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.580 
around each of the pins and then you
stop<00:01:05.519> at<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.760> point<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.420> tend<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.049> trap

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
stop at that point and I tend to trap

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.210 
stop at that point and I tend to trap
the<00:01:07.799> end<00:01:07.950> with<00:01:08.310> my<00:01:08.460> finger<00:01:08.790> there<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.240> then

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
the end with my finger there and then

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.060 
the end with my finger there and then
you<00:01:11.220> take<00:01:11.490> your<00:01:11.520> pick<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.260> the<00:01:13.260> pin<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
you take your pick and the pin to the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.929 
you take your pick and the pin to the
left<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.580> where<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.850> started<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:16.100> where<00:01:17.100> you

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
left of where you started is where you

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.830 
left of where you started is where you
put<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> pick<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> bottom<00:01:20.130> stitch<00:01:20.460> and

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
put the pick in to the bottom stitch and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.490 
put the pick in to the bottom stitch and
you<00:01:21.840> gently<00:01:22.170> lift<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.710> over<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.310> top<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:24.500> then

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
you gently lift it over the top and then

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.780 
you gently lift it over the top and then
pull<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.890> tail<00:01:26.130> at<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.580> bottom<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.180> dahle

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
pull the tail at the bottom of the dahle

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.310 
pull the tail at the bottom of the dahle
you<00:01:29.790> then<00:01:29.970> continue<00:01:30.509> around<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:31.049> an

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
you then continue around in an

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.410 
you then continue around in an
anti-clockwise<00:01:31.829> direction<00:01:32.030> doing<00:01:33.030> exactly

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
anti-clockwise direction doing exactly

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.420 
anti-clockwise direction doing exactly
the<00:01:33.600> same<00:01:33.810> thing<00:01:34.110> lifting<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.740> bottom<00:01:35.100> stitch

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
the same thing lifting the bottom stitch

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.840 
the same thing lifting the bottom stitch
over<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.180> top<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.829> pull<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.189> tail<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
over the top and pull the tail of the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.140 
over the top and pull the tail of the
cord

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
cord

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.280 
cord
when<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.270> get<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.510> the<00:01:42.600> point<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.930> only<00:01:43.049> have

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
when you get to the point you only have

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.679 
when you get to the point you only have
one<00:01:43.619> stitch<00:01:44.040> on<00:01:44.220> each<00:01:44.430> pin<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:45.150> just<00:01:45.390> repeat

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
one stitch on each pin you just repeat

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.160 
one stitch on each pin you just repeat
the<00:01:45.810> process<00:01:47.119> so<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.180> just<00:01:48.450> go<00:01:48.630> around<00:01:48.750> and

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
the process so you just go around and

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.690 
the process so you just go around and
you're<00:01:49.470> effectively<00:01:49.920> creating<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.490> top

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
you're effectively creating the top

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.510 
you're effectively creating the top
stitch<00:01:51.060> again<00:01:51.930> trap<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.860> with<00:01:52.979> your<00:01:53.100> finger

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
stitch again trap it with your finger

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.749 
stitch again trap it with your finger
and<00:01:54.149> work<00:01:54.540> from<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.409> pin<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:55.860> your<00:01:56.159> left<00:01:58.759> when

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
and work from the pin on your left when

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.010 
and work from the pin on your left when
you're<00:01:59.909> making<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.270> piece<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.630> jewelry<00:02:00.990> you

you're making a piece of jewelry you
want<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.470> continue<00:02:02.009> until<00:02:02.430> this<00:02:02.610> comes<00:02:02.850> out<00:02:03.119> at

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
want to continue until this comes out at
