hey guys this is Big E from native
vision<00:00:03.750> here<00:00:04.020> I<00:00:04.640> was<00:00:05.640> just<00:00:05.670> playing<00:00:06.000> Minecraft

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
vision here I was just playing Minecraft

vision here I was just playing Minecraft
today<00:00:06.960> and<00:00:07.200> I<00:00:07.529> had<00:00:07.740> this<00:00:07.890> little<00:00:08.099> idea<00:00:08.750> just

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
today and I had this little idea just

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.540 
today and I had this little idea just
hit<00:00:09.929> me<00:00:10.050> all<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.349> sudden<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.830> thought<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.340> can

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
hit me all of a sudden I thought I can

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.829 
hit me all of a sudden I thought I can
make<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:11.820> hidden<00:00:12.300> staircase<00:00:14.089> using<00:00:15.089> absolutely

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
make a hidden staircase using absolutely

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.490 
make a hidden staircase using absolutely
no<00:00:16.470> sticky<00:00:17.130> pistons<00:00:17.900> now<00:00:18.900> it's<00:00:19.170> not<00:00:19.380> as

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
no sticky pistons now it's not as

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.529 
no sticky pistons now it's not as
sophisticated<00:00:19.710> as<00:00:20.609> similar<00:00:20.970> sticky<00:00:21.180> piston

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
sophisticated as similar sticky piston

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.710 
sophisticated as similar sticky piston
designs<00:00:21.869> out<00:00:22.109> there<00:00:22.140> for<00:00:22.769> obvious<00:00:23.160> reasons

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
designs out there for obvious reasons

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.390 
designs out there for obvious reasons
but<00:00:24.720> if<00:00:24.990> you're<00:00:25.109> playing<00:00:25.289> survival<00:00:25.920> mode<00:00:26.130> and

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
but if you're playing survival mode and

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.880 
but if you're playing survival mode and
you<00:00:26.580> can<00:00:26.730> only<00:00:26.880> make<00:00:27.060> irregular<00:00:27.570> pistons<00:00:27.960> this

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
you can only make irregular pistons this

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.620 
you can only make irregular pistons this
might<00:00:29.070> be<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.220> very<00:00:29.490> thing<00:00:29.789> for<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.119> if<00:00:30.330> you

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
might be a very thing for you if you

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.920 
might be a very thing for you if you
want<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.869> create<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.859> hidden<00:00:32.130> staircase

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
want to create this hidden staircase

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.350 
want to create this hidden staircase
the<00:00:33.930> only<00:00:34.140> problem<00:00:34.500> about<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:35.000> I've<00:00:36.000> had<00:00:36.239> to

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
the only problem about it I've had to

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.490 
the only problem about it I've had to
run<00:00:36.480> or<00:00:36.600> two<00:00:36.840> separate<00:00:37.380> buttons<00:00:38.510> but<00:00:39.510> one<00:00:40.110> you

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
run or two separate buttons but one you

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.170 
run or two separate buttons but one you
hit<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:41.809> staircase<00:00:42.840> opens<00:00:43.440> up<00:00:43.700> you<00:00:44.700> can<00:00:44.879> access

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
hit it staircase opens up you can access

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.090 
hit it staircase opens up you can access
your<00:00:45.329> basement<00:00:45.870> it's<00:00:46.379> very<00:00:46.559> boring<00:00:46.770> down

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
your basement it's very boring down

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.350 
your basement it's very boring down
there<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:48.170> then<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.260> hit<00:00:49.379> another<00:00:49.649> button

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
there and then you hit another button

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.340 
there and then you hit another button
closes<00:00:51.360> back<00:00:51.539> up<00:00:51.660> again<00:00:52.640> now<00:00:53.640> it's<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.480> bit<00:00:55.320> of

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
closes back up again now it's a bit of

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.560 
closes back up again now it's a bit of
an<00:00:55.559> unorthodox<00:00:55.920> method<00:00:56.670> really<00:00:57.030> for<00:00:57.180> hiding<00:00:57.510> a

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
an unorthodox method really for hiding a

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.849 
an unorthodox method really for hiding a
staircase<00:00:57.840> but<00:00:58.559> and<00:01:00.050> as<00:01:01.050> long<00:01:01.379> as<00:01:01.410> your<00:01:01.649> room

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
staircase but and as long as your room

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.609 
staircase but and as long as your room
isn't<00:01:02.489> more<00:01:02.640> than<00:01:02.670> 12<00:01:03.090> blocks<00:01:03.359> across<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:04.589> can

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
isn't more than 12 blocks across you can

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.760 
isn't more than 12 blocks across you can
make<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.129> work<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:06.570> that's<00:01:06.900> because<00:01:07.290> if<00:01:07.650> I

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
make this work and that's because if I

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.580 
make this work and that's because if I
show<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:07.950> on<00:01:08.189> these<00:01:08.369> buttons<00:01:08.850> here

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
show you on these buttons here

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.250 
show you on these buttons here
the<00:01:10.590> entire<00:01:11.010> floor<00:01:11.369> just<00:01:11.970> get<00:01:12.180> slid<00:01:12.479> along<00:01:12.630> by

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
the entire floor just get slid along by

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.570 
the entire floor just get slid along by
one<00:01:13.500> block<00:01:15.290> and<00:01:16.290> then<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.500> just<00:01:16.680> slide<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
one block and then you just slide the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.320 
one block and then you just slide the
entire<00:01:17.670> four<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.020> play<00:01:20.180> bit<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.240> an

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
entire four to play bit of an

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.969 
entire four to play bit of an
odd<00:01:21.450> concept<00:01:21.930> but<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.439> works<00:01:24.560> so<00:01:25.560> if<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.830> look

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
odd concept but it works so if you look

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.770 
odd concept but it works so if you look
out<00:01:26.130> here<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.150> cut<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> cut<00:01:27.750> out

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
out here this is cut like a cut out

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.890 
out here this is cut like a cut out
section<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.650> it's<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.400> very<00:01:29.670> simple<00:01:29.900> whistle

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
section of it it's a very simple whistle

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:41.359 
section of it it's a very simple whistle
thing<00:01:32.450> hit<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.689> real<00:01:34.500> staircase<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:40.369> don't

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
thing hit that real staircase you don't

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.370 
thing hit that real staircase you don't
want<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.880> stack<00:01:42.210> yes<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.659> want<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.899> use<00:01:43.079> less

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
want a stack yes you want to use less

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.830 
want a stack yes you want to use less
Pistons<00:01:43.860> that's<00:01:44.100> fine<00:01:44.340> can<00:01:45.240> use<00:01:45.420> just<00:01:45.570> two

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
Pistons that's fine can use just two

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:57.980 
Pistons that's fine can use just two
Pistons<00:01:55.700> now<00:01:56.700> if<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.270> can't<00:01:57.509> figure<00:01:57.719> out<00:01:57.869> how

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
Pistons now if you can't figure out how

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.260 
Pistons now if you can't figure out how
this<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.350> made<00:01:58.710> just<00:01:58.950> by<00:01:59.340> looking<00:01:59.700> at<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.000> then

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
this is made just by looking at it then

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.120 
this is made just by looking at it then
what<00:02:00.840> I'm<00:02:00.930> gonna<00:02:01.049> do<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.590> I'm<00:02:01.740> gonna<00:02:01.890> walk<00:02:02.100> you

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna walk you

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.969 
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna walk you
through<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.520> right<00:02:02.700> now<00:02:03.170> it's<00:02:04.170> really<00:02:04.560> really

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
through it right now it's really really

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.180 
through it right now it's really really
simple<00:02:05.549> design<00:02:06.090> but<00:02:06.920> basically<00:02:07.920> what<00:02:08.069> you're

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
simple design but basically what you're

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.120 
simple design but basically what you're
going<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.580> do<00:02:08.879> is

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
going to do is

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.450 
going to do is
three<00:02:10.880> pistons<00:02:11.300> right<00:02:11.600> there<00:02:12.610> dig<00:02:13.610> this<00:02:14.090> hole

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
three pistons right there dig this hole

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.180 
three pistons right there dig this hole
this<00:02:16.460> is<00:02:16.790> what<00:02:16.940> your<00:02:17.060> stairs<00:02:17.270> are<00:02:17.450> gonna<00:02:17.510> go<00:02:18.190> to

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
this is what your stairs are gonna go to

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.290 
this is what your stairs are gonna go to
three<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:20.230> then<00:02:21.230> two<00:02:21.680> blocks<00:02:22.070> back<00:02:22.400> you'll

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
three and then two blocks back you'll

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.380 
three and then two blocks back you'll
put<00:02:23.540> that<00:02:23.570> piston<00:02:24.140> in<00:02:24.460> and<00:02:25.460> then<00:02:26.210> whatever

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
put that piston in and then whatever

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.390 
put that piston in and then whatever
material<00:02:27.110> you<00:02:27.260> want<00:02:27.440> your<00:02:27.620> floor<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:28.070> be<00:02:28.220> made

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
material you want your floor to be made

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.780 
material you want your floor to be made
out<00:02:28.610> of<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:30.140> goes<00:02:30.410> there<00:02:30.710> in<00:02:31.010> front<00:02:31.280> of<00:02:31.520> every

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
out of that goes there in front of every

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.650 
out of that goes there in front of every
