you can copy-and-paste weight maps from

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.800 
you can copy-and-paste weight maps from
any<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.870> these<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.799> any<00:01:26.010> of<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.370> other<00:01:26.549> ones<00:01:26.880> so

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
any of these to any of the other ones so

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.020 
any of these to any of the other ones so
first<00:01:28.290> let's<00:01:28.799> take<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.040> look<00:01:29.159> at<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.790> up-down

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
first let's take a look at this up-down

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.870 
first let's take a look at this up-down
rotation<00:01:30.930> on<00:01:31.080> on<00:01:31.290> Andy's<00:01:32.280> color<00:01:32.580> and<00:01:32.760> you'll

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
rotation on on Andy's color and you'll

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.880 
rotation on on Andy's color and you'll
notice<00:01:33.119> when<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.450> rotate<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:33.960> up<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.380> get<00:01:34.860> a

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
notice when I rotate it up I get a

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.320 
notice when I rotate it up I get a
little<00:01:35.040> crinkle<00:01:35.369> right<00:01:35.729> there<00:01:35.940> so<00:01:36.090> what<00:01:36.240> I'm

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
little crinkle right there so what I'm

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.969 
little crinkle right there so what I'm
gonna<00:01:36.510> go<00:01:36.659> ahead<00:01:36.810> I'm<00:01:36.990> gonna<00:01:37.320> fix<00:01:37.740> that

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
gonna go ahead I'm gonna fix that

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.310 
gonna go ahead I'm gonna fix that
quickly<00:01:38.369> I'm<00:01:39.180> going<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.420> use<00:01:39.540> my<00:01:39.690> smooth<00:01:40.020> brush

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
quickly I'm going to use my smooth brush

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.140 
quickly I'm going to use my smooth brush
and<00:01:40.530> I'm<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:40.770> gonna<00:01:40.860> smooth<00:01:41.640> out<00:01:41.880> that

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
and I'm just gonna smooth out that

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.460 
and I'm just gonna smooth out that
little<00:01:42.330> wrinkle<00:01:42.630> right<00:01:42.930> there<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
little wrinkle right there so the

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.789 
little wrinkle right there so the
shoulder<00:01:43.799> looks<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.100> little<00:01:44.220> bit<00:01:44.460> better<00:01:45.799> okay

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
shoulder looks a little bit better okay

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.010 
shoulder looks a little bit better okay
so<00:01:46.860> now<00:01:47.250> I've<00:01:47.430> got<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.640> new<00:01:47.850> weight<00:01:48.060> map<00:01:48.360> now<00:01:48.689> I

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
so now I've got a new weight map now I

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.160 
so now I've got a new weight map now I
could<00:01:49.830> just<00:01:49.860> use<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.030> figure<00:01:51.330> symmetry<00:01:52.049> to

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
could just use the figure symmetry to

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.170 
could just use the figure symmetry to
copy<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.650> whole<00:01:52.830> figure<00:01:53.159> from<00:01:53.520> left<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.909> right

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
copy the whole figure from left to right

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.359 
copy the whole figure from left to right
and<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.479> would<00:01:54.750> copy<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.260> weight<00:01:55.500> map<00:01:55.740> but

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
and it would copy the weight map but

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.130 
and it would copy the weight map but
what<00:01:56.520> if<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.760> just<00:01:57.210> want<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.570> copy<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:58.080> one

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
what if I just want to copy this one

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.950 
what if I just want to copy this one
weight<00:01:58.680> map<00:01:58.950> what<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.580> can<00:01:59.850> do<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.270> go<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.630> the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
weight map what I can do is go to the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.649 
weight map what I can do is go to the
copy<00:02:01.259> command<00:02:01.560> on<00:02:02.040> my<00:02:02.250> vertex<00:02:02.909> weights<00:02:03.210> pallet

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
copy command on my vertex weights pallet

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.609 
copy command on my vertex weights pallet
copy<00:02:04.590> there<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.280> now<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.150> can<00:02:06.630> paste<00:02:07.049> this

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
copy there and now I can paste this

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.520 
copy there and now I can paste this
weight<00:02:08.009> map<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.700> I've<00:02:08.819> copied<00:02:09.530> anyplace

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
weight map that I've copied anyplace

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.240 
weight map that I've copied anyplace
else<00:02:11.689> for<00:02:12.689> example<00:02:12.840> if<00:02:13.409> I<00:02:13.560> have<00:02:13.739> a<00:02:13.769> physics

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
else for example if I have a physics

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.030 
else for example if I have a physics
simulation<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.180> can<00:02:15.659> paste<00:02:15.959> that<00:02:16.140> exact<00:02:16.799> weight

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
simulation I can paste that exact weight

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.130 
simulation I can paste that exact weight
map<00:02:17.280> into<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.730> physics<00:02:18.180> simulation<00:02:18.689> I<00:02:18.870> don't

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
map into a physics simulation I don't

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.039 
map into a physics simulation I don't
know<00:02:19.200> why<00:02:19.349> I'd<00:02:19.470> want<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.799> but<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:20.069> could<00:02:21.049> the

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
know why I'd want to but I could the

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.780 
know why I'd want to but I could the
other<00:02:22.200> thing<00:02:22.379> I<00:02:22.470> can<00:02:22.500> do<00:02:22.800> is<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.099> can<00:02:23.160> paste<00:02:23.580> it

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
other thing I can do is I can paste it

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.910 
other thing I can do is I can paste it
with<00:02:23.910> symmetry<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.750> other<00:02:25.050> side<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.830> the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.900 
with symmetry to the other side of the
figure<00:02:26.160> so

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
figure so

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.400 
figure so
if<00:02:27.970> I<00:02:28.240> pick<00:02:28.540> out<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:29.200> other<00:02:29.440> collar<00:02:31.410> choose

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
if I pick out the other collar choose

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.190 
if I pick out the other collar choose
the<00:02:32.590> up-down<00:02:33.360> go<00:02:34.360> back<00:02:34.540> into<00:02:34.780> my<00:02:34.870> weight

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
the up-down go back into my weight

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.850 
the up-down go back into my weight
painting<00:02:35.560> tools<00:02:36.060> let<00:02:37.060> me<00:02:37.180> rotate<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.530> up<00:02:38.650> so

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
painting tools let me rotate it up so

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.470 
painting tools let me rotate it up so
you<00:02:38.920> can<00:02:39.010> see<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:39.430> actually<00:02:39.610> happened<00:02:40.240> here

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
you can see it actually happened here

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.130 
you can see it actually happened here

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
and I go pasted and instead of just

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.230

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
of those like flood-fill tools now we

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.970 
of those like flood-fill tools now we

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
have the mirror tools here at the top of

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.160 
have the mirror tools here at the top of
the<00:03:15.070> palette<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.580> that<00:03:16.060> is<00:03:16.210> for<00:03:16.480> mirroring<00:03:16.990> a

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
the palette and that is for mirroring a

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.340 
the palette and that is for mirroring a
weight<00:03:17.650> map<00:03:17.860> within<00:03:18.190> itself<00:03:18.820> which<00:03:19.600> won't<00:03:20.110> do

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
weight map within itself which won't do

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.650 
weight map within itself which won't do
us<00:03:20.380> much<00:03:20.530> good<00:03:20.980> on<00:03:21.040> a<00:03:21.220> collar<00:03:21.970> because<00:03:22.330> it's

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
us much good on a collar because it's

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.860 
us much good on a collar because it's
just<00:03:23.020> not<00:03:23.640> it's<00:03:24.640> not<00:03:24.760> along<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.120> centerline

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
just not it's not along the centerline

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.930 
just not it's not along the centerline
what<00:03:26.200> we<00:03:26.350> can<00:03:26.620> do<00:03:26.830> is<00:03:27.070> if<00:03:27.280> we<00:03:27.430> have<00:03:27.610> a<00:03:27.640> weight

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
what we can do is if we have a weight

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.970 
what we can do is if we have a weight
map<00:03:28.180> on<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.930> center<00:03:29.260> of<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.380> figure<00:03:29.560> let's

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
map on the center of the figure let's

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.820 
map on the center of the figure let's
say<00:03:30.310> for<00:03:30.550> example<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:31.660> side<00:03:32.080> to<00:03:32.290> side<00:03:32.530> of<00:03:32.740> the

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
say for example the side to side of the

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.760 
say for example the side to side of the
neck<00:03:33.040> here<00:03:33.340> okay<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:34.200> what<00:03:35.200> I'm<00:03:35.290> gonna<00:03:35.410> do<00:03:35.650> to

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
neck here okay and what I'm gonna do to

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.680 
neck here okay and what I'm gonna do to
demonstrate<00:03:35.980> this<00:03:36.490> is<00:03:36.700> I'm<00:03:37.000> just<00:03:37.030> gonna<00:03:37.450> go

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
demonstrate this is I'm just gonna go

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.780 
demonstrate this is I'm just gonna go
ahead<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:37.959> I'm<00:03:38.230> gonna<00:03:38.350> mess<00:03:38.830> up<00:03:39.070> one<00:03:39.310> side<00:03:39.610> of

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
ahead and I'm gonna mess up one side of

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.810 
ahead and I'm gonna mess up one side of
it<00:03:39.940> because<00:03:40.240> it's<00:03:40.480> already<00:03:40.840> kind<00:03:41.620> of<00:03:41.680> okay<00:03:42.070> so

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
it because it's already kind of okay so

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.120 
it because it's already kind of okay so
I'm<00:03:42.940> just<00:03:43.030> gonna<00:03:43.410> subtract<00:03:44.410> this<00:03:44.620> over<00:03:44.920> here

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
I'm just gonna subtract this over here

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.470 
I'm just gonna subtract this over here
and<00:03:45.310> it's<00:03:45.430> gonna<00:03:45.550> make<00:03:45.790> a<00:03:45.820> mess<00:03:46.090> out<00:03:46.240> of<00:03:46.360> this

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
and it's gonna make a mess out of this

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.800 
and it's gonna make a mess out of this
weight<00:03:46.720> map<00:03:46.959> but<00:03:47.920> what<00:03:48.160> I<00:03:48.190> can<00:03:48.459> do<00:03:48.780> let<00:03:49.780> me

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
weight map but what I can do let me

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.360 
weight map but what I can do let me
actually<00:03:50.020> fix<00:03:50.620> this<00:03:50.800> a<00:03:50.920> little<00:03:51.010> bit<00:03:51.250> here

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
actually fix this a little bit here

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.890 
actually fix this a little bit here
we'll<00:03:51.550> smooth<00:03:52.060> it<00:03:52.209> out<00:03:52.330> a<00:03:52.390> little<00:03:52.570> bit

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
we'll smooth it out a little bit

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.460 
we'll smooth it out a little bit
okay<00:03:53.680> so<00:03:54.040> what<00:03:54.250> I<00:03:54.280> can<00:03:54.580> do<00:03:54.820> is<00:03:55.090> mirror<00:03:55.780> from<00:03:56.260> one

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
okay so what I can do is mirror from one

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.880 
okay so what I can do is mirror from one
side<00:03:56.770> X<00:03:57.250> -<00:03:58.150> that's<00:03:58.360> his<00:03:58.570> right<00:03:58.870> 2<00:03:59.140> X<00:03:59.320> +<00:03:59.620> that's

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
side X - that's his right 2 X + that's

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.310 
side X - that's his right 2 X + that's
his<00:04:00.040> left<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:00.580> now<00:04:01.090> you<00:04:01.150> can<00:04:01.360> see<00:04:01.540> it's<00:04:01.690> fixed

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
his left and now you can see it's fixed

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.170 
his left and now you can see it's fixed
the<00:04:02.410> weight<00:04:02.590> map<00:04:02.830> by<00:04:03.010> mirroring<00:04:03.550> it<00:04:03.760> from<00:04:03.970> one

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
the weight map by mirroring it from one

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.060 
the weight map by mirroring it from one
side<00:04:04.420> of<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.570> figure<00:04:04.900> to<00:04:05.020> the<00:04:05.080> other<00:04:05.320> this

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
side of the figure to the other this

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.410 
side of the figure to the other this
should<00:04:06.280> make<00:04:06.489> all<00:04:06.700> of<00:04:06.730> your<00:04:06.940> weight<00:04:07.150> maps

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
should make all of your weight maps

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.240 
should make all of your weight maps
along<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:08.020> trunk<00:04:08.320> or<00:04:08.560> center<00:04:08.860> line<00:04:09.070> of<00:04:09.100> the

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
along the trunk or center line of the

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.370 
along the trunk or center line of the
figure<00:04:09.550> much<00:04:10.000> easier<00:04:10.330> to<00:04:10.450> set<00:04:10.660> up<00:04:10.690> because<00:04:11.170> you

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
figure much easier to set up because you

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.170 
figure much easier to set up because you
only<00:04:11.560> have<00:04:11.739> to<00:04:11.860> paint<00:04:12.040> half<00:04:12.280> of<00:04:12.430> them<00:04:12.580> and<00:04:12.760> then

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
only have to paint half of them and then

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.640 
only have to paint half of them and then
you<00:04:13.270> can<00:04:13.300> use<00:04:13.630> the<00:04:13.810> symmetry<00:04:14.140> to<00:04:14.380> get<00:04:14.530> them

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
you can use the symmetry to get them

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.810 
you can use the symmetry to get them
exactly<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.220> same<00:04:15.489> on<00:04:15.760> both<00:04:16.150> sides

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
exactly the same on both sides

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.490 
exactly the same on both sides
okay<00:04:18.820> there's<00:04:19.270> even<00:04:19.720> more<00:04:19.750> to<00:04:19.989> this<00:04:20.260> that's

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
okay there's even more to this that's

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.770 
okay there's even more to this that's
really<00:04:20.859> cool<00:04:21.100> not<00:04:21.760> only<00:04:21.940> can<00:04:22.210> I<00:04:22.270> copy<00:04:22.570> and

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
really cool not only can I copy and

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.350 
really cool not only can I copy and
paste<00:04:23.110> weight<00:04:23.410> maps<00:04:23.680> for<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.250> same<00:04:24.520> figure<00:04:24.910> I

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
paste weight maps for the same figure I

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.930 
paste weight maps for the same figure I
can<00:04:25.750> copy<00:04:26.230> and<00:04:26.470> paste<00:04:26.500> weight<00:04:26.950> maps<00:04:27.220> between

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
can copy and paste weight maps between

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.480 
can copy and paste weight maps between
figures<00:04:28.690> thinkers<00:04:29.290> with<00:04:29.470> different<00:04:29.890> geometry

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
figures thinkers with different geometry

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.700 
figures thinkers with different geometry
like<00:04:30.790> clothing<00:04:31.240> or<00:04:31.630> some<00:04:32.230> completely

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
like clothing or some completely

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.120 
like clothing or some completely
different<00:04:32.830> figure<00:04:33.430> so<00:04:34.060> I've<00:04:34.360> fixed<00:04:35.130> Andy's

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
different figure so I've fixed Andy's

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.240 
different figure so I've fixed Andy's
neck<00:04:36.490> here<00:04:36.850> so<00:04:37.330> I'm<00:04:37.390> going<00:04:37.510> to<00:04:37.570> go<00:04:37.720> copy<00:04:38.440> and

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
neck here so I'm going to go copy and

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.040 
neck here so I'm going to go copy and
I'm<00:04:39.610> gonna<00:04:39.760> go<00:04:39.910> over<00:04:40.060> to<00:04:40.470> Andrea

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
I'm gonna go over to Andrea

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.409 
I'm gonna go over to Andrea
she<00:04:42.590> has<00:04:42.770> different<00:04:43.160> geometry<00:04:43.729> from<00:04:43.910> Andy<00:04:44.210> in

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
she has different geometry from Andy in

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.559 
she has different geometry from Andy in
fact<00:04:45.639> she<00:04:46.639> doesn't<00:04:46.849> even<00:04:46.910> set<00:04:47.150> up<00:04:47.210> for<00:04:47.330> weight

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:47.569 
fact she doesn't even set up for weight

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.589 
fact she doesn't even set up for weight
mapping<00:04:48.080> yet<00:04:48.319> so<00:04:48.860> let's<00:04:49.250> just<00:04:49.520> add<00:04:49.759> a<00:04:50.240> weight

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:50.599 
mapping yet so let's just add a weight

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:54.240 
mapping yet so let's just add a weight
map<00:04:50.919> go<00:04:51.919> to<00:04:51.979> the<00:04:52.099> weight<00:04:52.250> map<00:04:52.490> palette<00:04:52.940> and

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
map go to the weight map palette and

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.659 
map go to the weight map palette and
paste<00:04:55.449> now<00:04:56.449> she<00:04:56.509> has<00:04:56.840> a<00:04:56.870> weight<00:04:57.110> map<00:04:57.490> you<00:04:58.490> can

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
paste now she has a weight map you can

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.700 
paste now she has a weight map you can
copy<00:04:58.940> weight<00:04:59.270> maps<00:04:59.539> pretty<00:05:00.050> much<00:05:00.289> from

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
copy weight maps pretty much from

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.610 
copy weight maps pretty much from
anything<00:05:01.129> into<00:05:01.909> anything<00:05:02.240> else<00:05:02.569> from<00:05:03.500> a

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
anything into anything else from a

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.710 
anything into anything else from a
figure<00:05:03.979> into<00:05:04.159> a<00:05:04.250> prop<00:05:04.550> or<00:05:04.759> whatever<00:05:05.060> it's

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
figure into a prop or whatever it's

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.869 
figure into a prop or whatever it's
mostly<00:05:06.259> gonna<00:05:06.500> be<00:05:06.620> used<00:05:06.949> for<00:05:07.159> clothing<00:05:07.400> you

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:07.879 
mostly gonna be used for clothing you

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:10.180 
mostly gonna be used for clothing you
can<00:05:08.060> copy<00:05:08.330> weight<00:05:08.659> maps<00:05:08.960> from<00:05:09.199> say<00:05:09.440> a<00:05:09.470> shoulder

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
can copy weight maps from say a shoulder

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.399 
can copy weight maps from say a shoulder
or<00:05:10.340> collar<00:05:10.580> joint<00:05:10.970> in<00:05:11.150> the<00:05:11.240> figure<00:05:11.629> into<00:05:11.900> the

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:12.409 
or collar joint in the figure into the

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:14.050 
or collar joint in the figure into the
clothing<00:05:12.860> now<00:05:13.340> of<00:05:13.400> course<00:05:13.550> you<00:05:13.729> can<00:05:13.879> project

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
clothing now of course you can project

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.420 
clothing now of course you can project
the<00:05:14.479> whole<00:05:14.720> figure<00:05:15.349> into<00:05:15.770> the<00:05:15.949> clothing<00:05:16.159> but

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
the whole figure into the clothing but

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.339 
the whole figure into the clothing but
say<00:05:16.639> you<00:05:16.699> want<00:05:16.819> to<00:05:17.060> edit<00:05:17.330> just<00:05:17.539> one<00:05:17.840> you<00:05:18.169> can

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
say you want to edit just one you can

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.490 
say you want to edit just one you can
copy<00:05:18.650> just<00:05:19.400> one<00:05:19.699> and<00:05:19.970> there's<00:05:20.780> even<00:05:21.169> more<00:05:21.199> to

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
copy just one and there's even more to

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.730 
copy just one and there's even more to
this<00:05:21.830> the<00:05:22.729> polygon<00:05:23.360> tools<00:05:23.659> have<00:05:23.960> symmetry<00:05:24.349> too

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
this the polygon tools have symmetry too

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.550 
this the polygon tools have symmetry too
so<00:05:25.699> let<00:05:25.880> me<00:05:26.000> open<00:05:26.180> the<00:05:26.449> grouping<00:05:26.930> tool<00:05:27.139> here

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
so let me open the grouping tool here

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.710 
so let me open the grouping tool here
and<00:05:27.680> you'll<00:05:28.340> find<00:05:28.669> this<00:05:28.819> in<00:05:28.880> all<00:05:29.180> versions<00:05:29.419> of

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.360 
gonna do is I'm just gonna kind of
randomly<00:05:40.699> select<00:05:41.210> some<00:05:41.389> polygons<00:05:41.870> here<00:05:42.370> so

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
randomly select some polygons here so

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.890 
randomly select some polygons here so
let's<00:05:43.610> say<00:05:43.819> this<00:05:44.000> is<00:05:44.060> a<00:05:44.210> pocket<00:05:44.750> or<00:05:44.840> something

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
let's say this is a pocket or something

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.100 
let's say this is a pocket or something
that<00:05:45.500> I<00:05:45.530> want<00:05:45.860> to<00:05:45.949> copy<00:05:46.190> so<00:05:47.090> I<00:05:47.389> want<00:05:47.630> to<00:05:47.719> add

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
that I want to copy so I want to add

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.379 
that I want to copy so I want to add
those<00:05:48.560> polygons<00:05:49.219> to<00:05:49.490> the<00:05:49.580> other<00:05:49.819> side<00:05:50.180> of<00:05:50.300> the

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
those polygons to the other side of the

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:54.939 
those polygons to the other side of the
figure<00:05:50.690> so<00:05:51.020> let<00:05:51.169> go<00:05:51.380> add<00:05:52.300> Mirror<00:05:53.300> X<00:05:53.960> minus<00:05:54.770> 2<00:05:54.919> X

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949 
figure so let go add Mirror X minus 2 X

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:57.790 
figure so let go add Mirror X minus 2 X
plus<00:05:55.250> it's<00:05:56.150> going<00:05:56.270> to<00:05:56.389> add<00:05:56.599> these<00:05:56.960> polygons<00:05:57.650> to

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
plus it's going to add these polygons to

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.730 
plus it's going to add these polygons to
the<00:05:57.860> other<00:05:58.009> side<00:05:58.340> now<00:05:59.120> let<00:05:59.930> me<00:05:59.960> undo<00:06:00.440> that<00:06:00.469> I

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
the other side now let me undo that I

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.010 
the other side now let me undo that I
want<00:06:01.159> to<00:06:01.219> show<00:06:01.370> you<00:06:01.460> it's<00:06:01.639> not<00:06:01.759> just<00:06:02.150> mirroring

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
want to show you it's not just mirroring

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.999 
want to show you it's not just mirroring
it<00:06:03.289> it's<00:06:03.590> just<00:06:03.889> it's<00:06:04.219> adding<00:06:04.759> it<00:06:04.909> I'm<00:06:05.750> gonna

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:06.009 
it it's just it's adding it I'm gonna

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:08.589 
it it's just it's adding it I'm gonna
set<00:06:07.009> a<00:06:07.039> group<00:06:07.310> like<00:06:07.550> this<00:06:07.849> and<00:06:08.090> I'm<00:06:08.419> going<00:06:08.479> to

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599 
set a group like this and I'm going to

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:12.760 
set a group like this and I'm going to
go<00:06:08.750> mirror<00:06:09.969> add<00:06:10.969> and<00:06:11.569> you<00:06:12.050> can<00:06:12.080> see<00:06:12.380> it<00:06:12.560> adds

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
go mirror add and you can see it adds

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.059 
go mirror add and you can see it adds
this<00:06:13.340> to<00:06:13.550> what's<00:06:13.759> already<00:06:14.060> there<00:06:14.680> now<00:06:15.680> we<00:06:15.740> can

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:16.069 
this to what's already there now we can

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:18.909 
this to what's already there now we can
do<00:06:16.219> it<00:06:16.370> the<00:06:16.520> other<00:06:16.550> way<00:06:16.849> around<00:06:17.110> we<00:06:18.110> can<00:06:18.319> remove

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
do it the other way around we can remove

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:21.610 
do it the other way around we can remove
polygons<00:06:19.789> so<00:06:20.210> I'm<00:06:20.300> gonna<00:06:20.419> select<00:06:20.719> all<00:06:21.169> of<00:06:21.199> this

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
polygons so I'm gonna select all of this

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:27.820 
polygons so I'm gonna select all of this
and<00:06:21.889> then<00:06:22.699> I'm<00:06:22.819> going<00:06:23.090> to<00:06:23.150> go<00:06:24.039> remove<00:06:25.330> Mirror<00:06:26.830> X

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
and then I'm going to go remove Mirror X

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.540 
and then I'm going to go remove Mirror X
minus<00:06:28.370> 2<00:06:28.520> X<00:06:28.550> plus<00:06:28.789> and<00:06:29.389> you<00:06:30.289> can<00:06:30.469> see<00:06:30.680> it<00:06:30.889> has<00:06:31.099> be

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
minus 2 X plus and you can see it has be

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.730 
minus 2 X plus and you can see it has be
selected<00:06:32.389> the<00:06:32.509> polygons<00:06:33.050> that<00:06:33.349> were<00:06:33.529> not

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.740 
selected the polygons that were not

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.070 
selected the polygons that were not
selected<00:06:34.069> on<00:06:34.550> the<00:06:34.610> other<00:06:34.880> side<00:06:35.180> so<00:06:35.750> it<00:06:35.840> works

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
selected on the other side so it works

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.640 
selected on the other side so it works
both<00:06:36.380> ways<00:06:36.849> and<00:06:37.849> we<00:06:38.000> also<00:06:38.210> have<00:06:38.599> the<00:06:38.960> modified

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
both ways and we also have the modified

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.159 
both ways and we also have the modified
mode<00:06:40.009> which<00:06:40.639> is<00:06:40.819> a<00:06:40.849> simple<00:06:41.419> copy<00:06:41.690> mirror

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:42.169 
mode which is a simple copy mirror

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:45.999 
mode which is a simple copy mirror
whatever<00:06:42.860> is<00:06:43.279> on<00:06:44.199> whatever<00:06:45.199> is<00:06:45.529> on<00:06:45.680> one<00:06:45.979> side

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:46.009 
whatever is on whatever is on one side

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:47.769 
whatever is on whatever is on one side
is<00:06:46.400> going<00:06:46.520> to<00:06:46.580> get<00:06:46.699> copied<00:06:47.150> to<00:06:47.240> the<00:06:47.300> other<00:06:47.479> side

00:06:47.769 --> 00:06:47.779 
is going to get copied to the other side

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:51.939 
is going to get copied to the other side
so<00:06:48.080> modify<00:06:48.680> mirror<00:06:49.490> -<00:06:50.300> the<00:06:50.570> plus<00:06:50.839> whatever<00:06:51.740> is

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:51.949 
so modify mirror - the plus whatever is

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:54.579 
so modify mirror - the plus whatever is
on<00:06:52.279> the<00:06:52.669> right<00:06:52.699> gets<00:06:53.180> copied<00:06:53.570> to<00:06:53.599> the<00:06:53.810> left<00:06:54.020> so

00:06:54.579 --> 00:06:54.589 
on the right gets copied to the left so

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:55.970 
on the right gets copied to the left so
you<00:06:54.649> have<00:06:54.830> three<00:06:55.159> ways<00:06:55.370> of<00:06:55.610> doing

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:55.980 
you have three ways of doing

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.280 
you have three ways of doing
you<00:06:56.190> can<00:06:56.370> add<00:06:56.610> remove<00:06:57.060> or<00:06:57.480> just<00:06:57.870> plain<00:06:58.110> old

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:58.290 
you can add remove or just plain old

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.090 
you can add remove or just plain old
mirror<00:06:59.180> so<00:07:00.180> we<00:07:00.300> have<00:07:00.480> all<00:07:00.720> those<00:07:01.100> symmetry

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 
mirror so we have all those symmetry

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.490 
mirror so we have all those symmetry
tools<00:07:02.370> built<00:07:03.150> into<00:07:03.480> both<00:07:03.660> the<00:07:03.720> weight<00:07:04.110> mapping

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.500 
tools built into both the weight mapping

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.450 
tools built into both the weight mapping
tools<00:07:04.770> and<00:07:05.130> the<00:07:05.970> grouping<00:07:06.420> tools<00:07:07.310> thanks<00:07:08.310> for
