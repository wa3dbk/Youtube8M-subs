00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.230
 the lg g3 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.630
 a very special phone it is 5.5 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.679
 inch screen has a very high qhd 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.389
 resolution 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.680
 in addition, the back has 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.730
 a metal coating 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.460
 in addition , there is a room on it 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.750
 device with a laser is controlled 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.820
 we imposed device last week 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.640
 the rack has been lg last year 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.740
 major steps have been taken regarding design 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.510
 the givry has a plastic housing 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.009
 but with metal coating that is it 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.170
 appearance real and good 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.550
 looks a bit like htc one though 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.620
 remains plastic afterwards and that 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.040
 hear hunting object but in the hand 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.170
 yummy 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.149
 the phone is very nicely finished though 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.340
 despite the thin edges is still good 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.510
 very large, the screen is 5.5 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.670
 inch 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.649
 the buttons are on the lg g3 on the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.480
 backside instead of a side 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.860
 does not have my preferred screens 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.690
 telephone is very special 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.739
 the givry has a pure hd 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.359
 resolution 2560 by 1440 pixels than 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.670
 almost twice as many pixels as in the 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.899
 full hd screens from other phones 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.850
 Unfortunately, the difference is almost invisible 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.080
 if you really sit close to it then 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.030
 can you see the text i like something 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.430
 be sharper incorporating photos and videos 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.750
 it would generally not stand out 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.340
 the brightness of the screen turned in 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.290
 our measurements are excellent 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.850
 the contrast unfortunately less so the weak 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.409
 were therefore somewhat low and the 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.490
 colors are not as bright as had 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.540
 can be 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.420
 however , the colors are family 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.250
 true to nature the lg givry just has it 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.680
 like many others and there phones over one 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.210
 snapdragon 800 a processor 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.280
 you ensure sufficient strength and 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.780
 therefore the system is very fast 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.549
 Remarkably, the occasional 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.979
 software faltering that probably comes 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.479
 the same due to the high number of pixels 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.460
 chip with the same power book more 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.570
 control pixels and that occasionally causes 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.070
 for delay 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.409
 does not mean that the phone is over it 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.200
 Generally I am fast because the cameras do that 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.630
 without this 13 megapixel camera 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.860
 namely about an infrared laser 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.930
 with that the that distance to one 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.130
 estimate the object even in the dark 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.050
 That means you can screen faster 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.729
 set a better screen 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.500
 practice it turns out to be so 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.750
 in dark situations it sets faster 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.770
 and better sharp than competitors or it 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.940
 Generally the photos are those that preserve 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.100
 good quality 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.090
 quietly see details and the colors top 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.890
 good 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.260
 a disadvantage of that high resolution that 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.790
 the thing that was mentioned earlier is the battery life 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.650
 the battery lasts less with all of those 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.150
 pixels should be noticed 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.670
 if it is in standby and so it 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.200
 screen is off the battery life is fine if 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.390
 we enter the council screen and you things 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.070
 is going to do browse ' watch videos 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.390
 Shoot that battery life and that 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.220
 means he compared to the 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.810
 competitors such as the s5 and the htc one 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.390
 m8 is really disappointing 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.010
 lg puts a nice and eye-catching device 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.510
 more a colleague called it the big one 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.250
 golden whopper 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.170
 the screen is perfectly fine the camera is 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.150
 well only that high resolution that adds 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.980
 does n't really matter and it really matters 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.870
 before the battery goes backwards 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.730
 and the software occasionally fails 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.410
 device where we are happy with the question 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.640
 or you better not count for one 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.640
 full hd there is who could have gone
