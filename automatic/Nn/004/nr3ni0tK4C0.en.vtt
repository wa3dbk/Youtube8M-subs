it's<00:03:17.870> really<00:03:18.019> great<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:18.380> it<00:03:19.280> has<00:03:19.310> SPF<00:03:20.030> 15<00:03:20.780> in

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
it's really great that it has SPF 15 in

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.530 
it's really great that it has SPF 15 in
it<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:21.650> it<00:03:21.799> doesn't<00:03:22.010> put<00:03:22.910> a<00:03:22.940> cast<00:03:23.209> on<00:03:23.480> your

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
it and it doesn't put a cast on your

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.380 
it and it doesn't put a cast on your
skin<00:03:23.989> tone<00:03:24.230> or<00:03:24.500> make<00:03:24.829> the<00:03:25.160> color<00:03:25.670> look<00:03:25.760> ashy<00:03:26.150> at

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.270 
skin tone or make the color look ashy at
all<00:03:26.540> so<00:03:26.810> I<00:03:27.079> think<00:03:27.410> it<00:03:27.620> looks<00:03:27.769> pretty<00:03:27.980> natural
