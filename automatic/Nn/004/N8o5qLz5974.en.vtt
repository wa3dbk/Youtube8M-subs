00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
that are are very very tiny just because

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.530 
that are are very very tiny just because
of<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.430> breed<00:03:21.820> not<00:03:22.510> because<00:03:22.900> of<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.230> age<00:03:23.440> and

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
of the breed not because of the age and

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.580 
of the breed not because of the age and
we're<00:03:25.540> having<00:03:25.900> some<00:03:26.170> problems<00:03:26.560> with

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
hypoglycemia and so we have to watch

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.569 
hypoglycemia and so we have to watch
them<00:03:30.880> really<00:03:31.090> quite<00:03:31.690> closely<00:03:31.959> but<00:03:32.590> this<00:03:33.250> truly

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
them really quite closely but this truly

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.050 
them really quite closely but this truly
is<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:34.450> most<00:03:34.989> ideal<00:03:35.380> situation<00:03:35.850> when<00:03:36.850> they

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
is the most ideal situation when they

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.720
