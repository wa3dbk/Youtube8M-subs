here I think is when I was down side

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.340 
here I think is when I was down side
then<00:02:42.010> I'm<00:02:42.100> not<00:02:42.250> quite<00:02:42.310> sure<00:02:42.580> if<00:02:43.120> I<00:02:43.959> still<00:02:44.019> with

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
then I'm not quite sure if I still with

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.729 
then I'm not quite sure if I still with
pair<00:02:44.590> in<00:02:45.160> my<00:02:45.220> collection<00:02:45.850> but<00:02:46.260> these<00:02:47.260> go<00:02:47.500> for

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
pair in my collection but these go for

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.250 
pair in my collection but these go for
me<00:02:48.010> last<00:02:48.160> time<00:02:48.310> I<00:02:48.519> checked<00:02:48.790> they<00:02:48.910> go<00:02:49.060> for<00:02:49.330> round

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.630 

three<00:02:54.000> 300<00:02:55.000> 350<00:02:55.950> somewhere<00:02:56.950> in<00:02:57.070> that<00:02:57.100> range<00:02:57.400> I

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
even red and black I think they're fire

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.009 
even red and black I think they're fire
but<00:03:13.239> people<00:03:13.690> don't<00:03:13.840> like<00:03:13.989> umm<00:03:14.940> yeah<00:03:15.940> 12<00:03:16.720> fours

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.849 
but people don't like umm yeah 12 fours
I<00:03:17.459> believe<00:03:18.459> they're<00:03:18.610> in<00:03:18.730> it<00:03:18.820> to<00:03:19.480> 50<00:03:19.780> range

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.060 

maybe<00:03:23.859> 300<00:03:24.549> that<00:03:24.730> stuff<00:03:24.970> I'm<00:03:25.150> not<00:03:25.180> sure<00:03:25.480> word

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
maybe 300 that stuff I'm not sure word

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.470 
maybe 300 that stuff I'm not sure word
but<00:03:27.070> I'll<00:03:27.250> call<00:03:27.519> my<00:03:27.700> sixes<00:03:28.060> you<00:03:28.150> know<00:03:28.269> those

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
but I'll call my sixes you know those

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.670 
but I'll call my sixes you know those
just<00:03:28.780> came<00:03:28.959> out<00:03:29.230> so<00:03:31.200> probably<00:03:32.200> come<00:03:32.350> up<00:03:32.470> with

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
just came out so probably come up with

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.330 
just came out so probably come up with
the<00:03:32.769> old<00:03:32.920> retail<00:03:33.340> right<00:03:33.579> now<00:03:33.760> those<00:03:34.799> maybe<00:03:35.799> 60

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
the old retail right now those maybe 60

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.870 
the old retail right now those maybe 60
maybe<00:03:36.519> 80<00:03:36.790> somewhere<00:03:37.630> in<00:03:37.690> that<00:03:37.750> range<00:03:38.019> so<00:03:38.440> I

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
maybe 80 somewhere in that range so I

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.420 
maybe 80 somewhere in that range so I
think<00:03:39.880> it's<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:41.400> pretty<00:03:42.400> even<00:03:42.700> tree<00:03:43.180> just<00:03:43.720> I

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
think it's a pretty even tree just I

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.810 
think it's a pretty even tree just I
talk<00:03:45.430> about<00:03:45.579> the<00:03:45.760> value<00:03:46.090> just<00:03:46.299> a<00:03:46.450> personal

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
talk about the value just a personal

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.440 
talk about the value just a personal
preference<00:03:48.820> of<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.150> shoe<00:03:49.540> I<00:03:51.239> think<00:03:52.239> it's<00:03:52.359> a

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
preference of the shoe I think it's a

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.150 
preference of the shoe I think it's a
pretty<00:03:52.690> even<00:03:52.959> trade

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
pretty even trade

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.120 
pretty even trade
