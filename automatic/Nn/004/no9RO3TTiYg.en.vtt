you<00:02:58.470> may<00:02:58.950> be<00:02:59.010> like<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.340> feel<00:02:59.580> like<00:02:59.640> it's<00:03:00.120> always

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
you may be like I feel like it's always

too food or I like thanks too much I

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.400 
too food or I like thanks too much I
think<00:03:02.610> this<00:03:03.060> was<00:03:03.239> a<00:03:03.269> really<00:03:03.540> good<00:03:03.630> balance<00:03:03.900> and

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
think this was a really good balance and

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.170 
think this was a really good balance and
it's<00:03:04.620> sort<00:03:04.890> of<00:03:04.950> like<00:03:05.100> touches<00:03:05.550> on<00:03:05.670> that<00:03:05.850> but<00:03:06.090> it

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
it's sort of like touches on that but it

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.509 
it's sort of like touches on that but it
doesn't<00:03:06.360> go<00:03:06.570> too<00:03:06.630> far<00:03:07.010> so<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.160> was<00:03:08.310> really

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
doesn't go too far so that was really

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.170 
doesn't go too far so that was really
great<00:03:08.930> sexuality<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.530> like<00:03:11.430> those<00:03:11.730> kinds<00:03:12.120> of

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
great sexuality and like those kinds of

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.990 
great sexuality and like those kinds of
things<00:03:12.420> were<00:03:12.810> touched<00:03:13.110> on<00:03:13.350> in<00:03:13.680> this<00:03:13.890> book<00:03:14.160> and
