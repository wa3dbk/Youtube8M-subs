 we are in landing 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.690
 where many trees grow can lidke 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.290
 prayer this wild cherry I still her 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.300

 colors almost black this is wild cherry 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.420
 grows remarkably on loams 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:47.820
 look what's the ground here even 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:51.390
 you can see clay and a lot 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.289
 trees grows very well behaved here 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:00.500
 feels good root trees 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:03.059
 the system is drought resistant i maga molding 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:08.100
 therefore a wonderful stock is obtained 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:11.010
 for growing cherry and cherry seedlings 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.790
 get strong good root 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.950
 drought tolerant system is also good 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:25.340
 seedlings grow 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:25.340
 on this two by two the cherries harvested 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:34.979
 washed to the bone here and sow on 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:39.409
 winter to winter sow well germinates 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:43.310
 this bone spring shoots appear 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:48.600
 growing rapidly and then in the month of August 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:50.570
 Already shark rueta turns out great 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.630
 already strong stock 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.490
 look so much berry here 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:02.369
 pretty easy now in this 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:05.090
 time already and cut off pretty much 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.090
 on the tree 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:21.920
 sprouts wonderfully during the winter passes 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:22.520
 certification seedlings grown on magician 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.540
 sculptures 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:30.680
 do not tolerate humus therefore should not 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:34.850
 fertilize dislikes stagnant water and frequent 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:38.380
 watering is therefore better and 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:43.550
 grows on normal soil without fertilizer 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:47.870
 houses wicket here and when they will 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:51.080
 seedlings grafted over tinted on the magician 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.090
 sculptures do not need them very much 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.730
 pour water that is not to be 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.510
 water stagnation needs to be watered 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.510
