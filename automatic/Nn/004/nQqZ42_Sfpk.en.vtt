00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
little straighter so I do is I pull it

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.170 
little straighter so I do is I pull it
straight<00:02:09.970> like<00:02:10.000> that<00:02:10.509> and<00:02:11.400> then<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.670> pretend

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
straight like that and then I to pretend

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.070 
straight like that and then I to pretend
this<00:02:13.299> is<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.480> straightening<00:02:14.410> iron<00:02:14.920> you<00:02:16.080> could

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
this is a straightening iron you could

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.080 
this is a straightening iron you could
just<00:02:17.379> use<00:02:17.590> a<00:02:17.620> straightening<00:02:18.069> iron<00:02:18.220> but<00:02:18.610> this

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
just use a straightening iron but this

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.400 
just use a straightening iron but this
is<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.270> only<00:02:19.420> section<00:02:19.930> where<00:02:20.110> I

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
is the only section where I

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.940 
is the only section where I
work<00:02:21.340> on<00:02:21.490> the<00:02:21.610> roots<00:02:21.820> at<00:02:22.060> all<00:02:22.210> so<00:02:22.690> I<00:02:23.020> think<00:02:23.680> it's

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
work on the roots at all so I think it's

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.110 
work on the roots at all so I think it's
like<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.100> waste<00:02:24.280> of<00:02:24.520> time

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
like a waste of time

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.510 
like a waste of time
and<00:02:26.050> then<00:02:26.290> I'm<00:02:26.380> gonna<00:02:26.500> twist<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.220> hair

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
and then I'm gonna twist the hair

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.630 
and then I'm gonna twist the hair
together<00:02:28.000> like<00:02:28.270> this<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:30.160> reason<00:02:30.340> I<00:02:30.400> do<00:02:30.520> this

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
together like this the reason I do this

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.220 
together like this the reason I do this
is<00:02:30.700> because<00:02:30.880> there's<00:02:31.150> so<00:02:31.300> many<00:02:31.390> short<00:02:31.810> strands

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
is because there's so many short strands

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.430 
is because there's so many short strands
in<00:02:32.620> this<00:02:32.890> layer<00:02:33.130> that<00:02:33.160> I<00:02:34.090> have<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.930> curl<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:35.350> to

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
in this layer that I have to curl it to

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.080 
in this layer that I have to curl it to
get<00:02:35.560> everything<00:02:35.880> together<00:02:36.880> around<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.630> wand

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
get everything together around the wand

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.480 
get everything together around the wand
and<00:02:40.260> just<00:02:41.260> hold<00:02:41.440> it<00:02:41.530> for<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.710> second<00:02:44.430> there<00:02:45.430> you

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
and just hold it for a second there you

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.930 
and just hold it for a second there you
go

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
go

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.210 
go
and<00:02:46.420> that's<00:02:46.720> a<00:02:46.840> little<00:02:47.020> poofy<00:02:47.530> but<00:02:47.740> it'll<00:02:48.070> die

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
and that's a little poofy but it'll die

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.160 
and that's a little poofy but it'll die
down<00:02:48.460> I<00:02:48.610> don't<00:02:48.790> spray<00:02:49.060> my<00:02:49.240> hair<00:02:49.480> until<00:02:49.960> the

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
down I don't spray my hair until the

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.710 
down I don't spray my hair until the
very<00:02:50.350> end<00:02:50.620> of<00:02:50.770> this<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.490> then<00:02:52.150> we<00:02:52.240> do<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.510> same

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
very end of this and then we do the same

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.060 
very end of this and then we do the same
thing<00:02:52.990> with<00:02:53.170> here<00:02:53.440> except<00:02:53.710> I'm<00:02:53.800> not<00:02:53.920> gonna

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
thing with here except I'm not gonna

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.650 
thing with here except I'm not gonna
worry<00:02:54.280> about<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.490> roots<00:02:54.820> on<00:02:55.060> this<00:02:55.240> second

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
worry about the roots on this second

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:05.550 
worry about the roots on this second
half<00:02:59.670> and<00:03:00.670> just<00:03:00.820> hold<00:03:00.970> it<00:03:01.030> for<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.210> second<00:03:04.560> so

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
half and just hold it for a second so

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.290 
half and just hold it for a second so
now<00:03:05.590> what<00:03:05.830> I<00:03:05.920> do<00:03:05.980> is<00:03:06.100> I<00:03:06.340> look<00:03:06.490> at<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.670> top<00:03:07.000> layer

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
now what I do is I look at the top layer

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.330 
now what I do is I look at the top layer
to<00:03:07.570> see<00:03:07.720> if<00:03:07.840> there<00:03:08.020> are<00:03:08.050> any<00:03:08.170> like<00:03:08.770> obvious

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
to see if there are any like obvious

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.170 
to see if there are any like obvious
strands<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.890> aren't<00:03:11.890> very<00:03:12.340> curly<00:03:12.670> that<00:03:13.060> are

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
strands that aren't very curly that are

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.380 
strands that aren't very curly that are
just<00:03:13.330> kind<00:03:13.510> of<00:03:13.690> limp<00:03:14.520> so<00:03:15.520> and<00:03:15.940> then<00:03:16.120> I<00:03:16.210> just

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
just kind of limp so and then I just

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.490 
just kind of limp so and then I just
take<00:03:16.750> them

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
take them

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.340 
take them
I<00:03:17.640> don't<00:03:18.640> really<00:03:18.850> measure<00:03:19.480> them<00:03:19.840> out<00:03:19.990> I<00:03:20.020> don't

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
I don't really measure them out I don't

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.440 
I don't really measure them out I don't
care<00:03:20.710> if<00:03:21.010> it's<00:03:21.130> like<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.280> perfect<00:03:21.640> inch<00:03:22.030> because

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
care if it's like a perfect inch because

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.080 
care if it's like a perfect inch because
I<00:03:22.750> want<00:03:23.320> in<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.950> end<00:03:24.130> I<00:03:24.310> want<00:03:24.520> this<00:03:24.670> to<00:03:24.910> look

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
I want in the end I want this to look

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.520 
I want in the end I want this to look
kind<00:03:25.870> of<00:03:25.959> as<00:03:26.080> natural<00:03:26.230> as<00:03:26.620> possible<00:03:28.500> so<00:03:29.500> I

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
kind of as natural as possible so I

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.949 
kind of as natural as possible so I
don't<00:03:29.800> want<00:03:29.920> all<00:03:30.010> my<00:03:30.100> curls<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.520> be<00:03:30.550> like

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
don't want all my curls to be like

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:59.670 
don't want all my curls to be like
uniform<00:03:31.959> perfect<00:03:32.470> curls

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.949 

and<00:04:00.189> I'm<00:04:00.310> really<00:04:00.640> not<00:04:00.849> holding<00:04:01.269> these<00:04:01.390> long<00:04:01.659> oh

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
and I'm really not holding these long oh

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.509 
and I'm really not holding these long oh
I<00:04:04.110> guess<00:04:05.110> it<00:04:05.260> just<00:04:05.290> depends<00:04:05.829> on<00:04:06.010> what<00:04:06.220> kind<00:04:06.459> of

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
I guess it just depends on what kind of

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.380 
I guess it just depends on what kind of
curling<00:04:07.000> wands<00:04:07.239> you<00:04:07.450> have<00:04:07.629> if<00:04:07.870> you<00:04:08.019> have<00:04:09.390> kind

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
curling wands you have if you have kind

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.940 
curling wands you have if you have kind
of<00:04:10.480> a<00:04:10.569> cheaper<00:04:10.930> curling<00:04:11.319> wand<00:04:11.500> that<00:04:11.650> doesn't

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
of a cheaper curling wand that doesn't

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:40.820 
of a cheaper curling wand that doesn't
get<00:04:12.250> as<00:04:12.400> hot<00:04:14.400> then<00:04:15.400> you<00:04:16.389> might<00:04:16.989> longer

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.020 

all<00:04:41.830> right<00:04:41.949> so<00:04:42.129> now<00:04:42.220> that<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:42.490> top<00:04:42.729> layer<00:04:43.000> is

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
all right so now that the top layer is

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.029 
all right so now that the top layer is
done<00:04:43.270> I<00:04:43.539> take<00:04:43.780> my<00:04:43.900> hair<00:04:44.080> as<00:04:44.229> if<00:04:44.379> I'm<00:04:44.530> putting<00:04:44.860> it

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
done I take my hair as if I'm putting it

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:51.390 
done I take my hair as if I'm putting it
half<00:04:45.310> up<00:04:48.479> and<00:04:49.560> then<00:04:50.560> I<00:04:50.590> pull<00:04:50.919> half<00:04:51.159> at<00:04:51.340> the

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
half up and then I pull half at the

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.990 
half up and then I pull half at the
bottom<00:04:51.990> over<00:04:52.990> this<00:04:53.349> shoulder<00:04:53.620> and<00:04:54.099> then<00:04:54.819> the

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
bottom over this shoulder and then the

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.129 
bottom over this shoulder and then the
other<00:04:55.180> half<00:04:55.389> over<00:04:55.690> this<00:04:55.840> shoulder

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
other half over this shoulder

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:02.760 
other half over this shoulder
super-technical<00:04:57.009> I<00:04:57.400> know<00:05:01.259> for<00:05:02.259> most<00:05:02.440> people<00:05:02.710> I

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
super-technical I know for most people I

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.260 
super-technical I know for most people I
feel<00:05:02.919> like<00:05:02.979> people<00:05:03.580> always<00:05:03.729> say<00:05:03.940> that<00:05:04.150> their

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
feel like people always say that their

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.719 
feel like people always say that their
bottom<00:05:04.599> layer<00:05:04.780> is<00:05:04.810> the<00:05:05.259> curliest<00:05:05.830> but<00:05:06.400> for<00:05:06.580> me

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
bottom layer is the curliest but for me

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.520 
bottom layer is the curliest but for me
my<00:05:07.030> bottom<00:05:07.389> layer<00:05:07.569> is<00:05:07.930> always<00:05:08.229> the

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
my bottom layer is always the

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.499 
my bottom layer is always the
straightest<00:05:08.979> because<00:05:09.250> it's<00:05:09.759> my<00:05:10.030> thickest

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:10.509 
straightest because it's my thickest

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:12.059 
straightest because it's my thickest
hair<00:05:10.569> my<00:05:10.780> hair<00:05:10.960> up<00:05:11.050> top<00:05:11.289> can<00:05:11.500> be<00:05:11.590> really<00:05:11.830> fine

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:12.069 
hair my hair up top can be really fine

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:14.129 
hair my hair up top can be really fine
but<00:05:12.460> my<00:05:12.550> my<00:05:13.030> hair<00:05:13.180> down<00:05:13.270> here<00:05:13.449> is<00:05:13.509> really<00:05:13.539> thick

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
but my my hair down here is really thick

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.399 
but my my hair down here is really thick
and<00:05:14.409> so<00:05:14.800> it<00:05:14.860> doesn't<00:05:15.099> always<00:05:15.250> curl<00:05:15.669> so<00:05:16.150> I<00:05:16.659> curl

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:17.409 
and so it doesn't always curl so I curl

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:20.279 
and so it doesn't always curl so I curl
up<00:05:17.440> some<00:05:17.770> of<00:05:17.860> this<00:05:18.009> just<00:05:18.580> to<00:05:18.990> give<00:05:19.990> my<00:05:20.080> hair<00:05:20.259> a

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289 
up some of this just to give my hair a

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.879 
up some of this just to give my hair a
little<00:05:20.469> bit<00:05:20.680> more<00:05:20.740> bounce<00:05:21.870> this<00:05:22.870> like<00:05:23.500> the<00:05:23.710> top

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
little bit more bounce this like the top

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.680 
little bit more bounce this like the top
I<00:05:24.069> don't<00:05:24.250> really<00:05:24.430> care<00:05:24.729> what<00:05:24.909> size<00:05:25.150> sections

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
I don't really care what size sections

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.950 
I don't really care what size sections
these<00:05:25.960> are<00:05:27.569> because<00:05:28.569> you're<00:05:28.690> not<00:05:28.810> really

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
these are because you're not really

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:46.080 
these are because you're not really
going<00:05:29.169> to<00:05:29.229> see<00:05:29.469> the<00:05:29.800> bottom<00:05:29.949> layer

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.810

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.249 
them up now it's time for some hairspray
right<00:06:29.830> now<00:06:30.039> I'm<00:06:30.610> using<00:06:31.030> the<00:06:31.330> Pantene<00:06:31.810> curly

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:32.259 
right now I'm using the Pantene curly

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:34.170 
right now I'm using the Pantene curly
hair<00:06:32.469> hairspray<00:06:32.979> and<00:06:33.189> it's<00:06:33.370> a<00:06:33.460> flexible<00:06:33.819> hold

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
hair hairspray and it's a flexible hold

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.510 
hair hairspray and it's a flexible hold
it<00:06:34.719> doesn't<00:06:35.050> really<00:06:35.139> have<00:06:35.439> to<00:06:35.620> be<00:06:35.650> for<00:06:36.099> curly

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
it doesn't really have to be for curly

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:54.149 
it doesn't really have to be for curly
hair<00:06:36.759> I<00:06:37.030> just<00:06:37.240> prefer<00:06:37.539> the<00:06:37.689> flexible<00:06:38.199> hold<00:06:53.159> so

00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:54.159 
hair I just prefer the flexible hold so

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:56.399 
hair I just prefer the flexible hold so
that's<00:06:54.639> it<00:06:54.909> that's<00:06:55.120> how<00:06:55.389> I<00:06:55.419> do<00:06:55.690> my<00:06:55.719> hair<00:06:56.080> every

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:56.409 
that's it that's how I do my hair every

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:59.369 
that's it that's how I do my hair every
single<00:06:56.440> day<00:06:57.000> at<00:06:58.000> this<00:06:58.240> point<00:06:58.599> it<00:06:58.930> really<00:06:59.229> only

00:06:59.369 --> 00:06:59.379 
single day at this point it really only

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:01.499 
single day at this point it really only
takes<00:06:59.680> me<00:07:00.009> 10<00:07:00.310> minutes<00:07:00.550> or<00:07:00.819> less<00:07:00.849> to<00:07:01.240> do<00:07:01.360> it

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:01.509 
takes me 10 minutes or less to do it

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:03.420 
takes me 10 minutes or less to do it
especially<00:07:01.599> now<00:07:02.080> that<00:07:02.110> my<00:07:02.710> hair<00:07:02.919> is<00:07:02.949> shorter

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430 
especially now that my hair is shorter

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.480 
especially now that my hair is shorter
it's<00:07:03.819> a<00:07:04.030> lot<00:07:04.180> easier<00:07:04.419> to<00:07:04.810> do<00:07:05.129> some<00:07:06.129> days<00:07:06.310> when

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.760 
it's a lot easier to do some days when
my<00:07:06.610> curls<00:07:06.940> are<00:07:07.090> really<00:07:07.479> behaving<00:07:07.870> I<00:07:08.229> just<00:07:08.500> do
