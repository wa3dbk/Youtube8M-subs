it's<00:00:56.760> just<00:00:57.090> 11<00:00:57.480> seconds<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.020> fold<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.469> down

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
it's just 11 seconds to fold it down

it's just 11 seconds to fold it down
that's<00:00:58.859> sort<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.309> advantage<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.910> having<00:00:59.969> a

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
fabric roof as well as being lighter it

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:03.500 
fabric roof as well as being lighter it
tucks<00:01:03.149> away

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510
