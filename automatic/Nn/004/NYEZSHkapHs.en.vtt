00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.569
 the kia proceeds is the three version 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.820
 doors of the task that has five the 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.250
 body length is the same 4 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:16.059
 with 31 meters as well as the volume of 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.310
 luggage compartment 380 liters so together with 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.529
 the seat lion sc and the volkswagen golf 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.210
 three doors the proceeds is the vehicle 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.740
 of its category with the boot more 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.960
 big 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.180
 by beating the backs the 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.760
 load volume amounts to one thousand 225 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.430
 liters with respect to the set of five 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.989
 doors the pro obviously loses the 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.850
 easy access to places 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.129
 backs and some space for the 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.290
 occupants of these in particular there are some 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.930
 four centimeters less in width and 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.330
 ceiling height the space for 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.070
 legs does not suffer shrinkage and two adults of 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.170
 one meter eighty tall fit with 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.059
 slack again together with the 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.100
 sierraleonÃ©s efe and the volkswagen golf 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.839
 Three doors is one of the best 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.650
 alternatives and what it is about is 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:58.650
 bring people from behind 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.080
 here in front we have a lot of space in 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.689
 all directions and some seats 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.130
 comfortable that pick up the body very well 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.930
 on the dashboard we have a mixture of 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.000
 soft touch plastic on the part 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.009
 upper and the hard touch in the lower 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.960
 reality of these materials good I 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.570
 I would say normal would have to see how 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.670
 hold the passage of time for now 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.770
 apparently everyone fits well between 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.330
 yes and it shows that the car is fine 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.120
 Built by the feeling of solidity 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.220
 that transmits when passing over the potholes 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.530
 The range of engines is composed of 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.900
 three gasoline and two diesel I've 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.910
 tried all but 204 gas 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.460
 horses and among them I'm left with 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.870
 the diesel of 110 because it is the one that keeps 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.930
 the best option between likes of 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.370
 driving benefits and consumption 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.560
 However, it is important to take into account 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.320
 following the options policy of 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.570
 guide prevents that with this 110 engine 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.640
 horses can enjoy part of the 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.070
 equipment that has the 128 diesel 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.560
 horses for example you can not have the 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.360
 control rear camera 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.150
 tire pressure xenon headlights 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.980
 for access and keyless start all 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.679
 this is standard with the 128 engine 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.020
 horses the advantage of this strategy 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.610
 is that the sale price varies little in 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.470
 Equipment function 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.930
 for example the less equipped version 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.450
 the procedure of 110 horses costs 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.580
 13,000 euros and the most equipped 14 thousand 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.470
 five hundred euros these figures will 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.840
 they also become the model of their 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.030
 cheapest segment of today a 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.250
 hyunday y30 three doors a renault 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.950
 megane coupe and a seat leon sc are 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.840
 clearly more expensive 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.959
 if we go crazy with the options 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.879
 we can expect to pay more than 17,500 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.160
 euros including 17 tires 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.230
 inches that by the way I do not recommend it 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.940
 they make the car more uncomfortable something 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.950
 special mention to the tires because the 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.959
 process is a vehicle that stands out for 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.489
 have a comfortable suspension and that 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.410
 comfortable vehicle character no 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.050
 It is convenient to ruin it with some tires 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.910
 wider and of low profile who gives 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.220
 greater value to have an agile car in 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.500
 curves and with a sporty touch is better 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.080
 that look towards the opel astra gtc or 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.700
 because not to volkswagen scirocco with the 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.709
 process can go very fast in curve 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.630
 very confident because their 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.239
 reactions to the limit are very easy to 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.370
 understand and control but does not transmit 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.260
 nothing special is not a car with a 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.060
 back playful or with an address 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.060
 especially precise or sensitive 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.490
 the dogs have good touch and power 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.980
 but they can not stand the continued use well 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.570
 and then there is the engine the answer of 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.030
 This engine is typical of diesel 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.190
 turbo powered low displacement 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.800
 from idle to 1800 rounds 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.840
 pushed to little and from that increase 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.240
 it does it with the energy that a wait of 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.970
 110 horses and this is true until the 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.440
 Needle counter reaches 4 mm 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.030
 then you should change gear if 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.400
 what is intended is to continue accelerating 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.230
 with as much force as possible what is not 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.180
 I like it and this is provoked in part 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.190
 for the aforementioned lack of strength at low 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.110
 regime is that you have to be careful with 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.720
 the clutch to come from stationary and not 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.910
 cove in the engine due to noise and vibrations 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.220
 there is no complaint is silent and 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.190
 soft also responds quickly to the 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.530
 Accelerator pedal average consumption 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.020
 approved for this version is 4 liters 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.880
 at 100 if I had a start system 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.340
 and stop that does not even have it in 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.380
 option would be closer to its rivals 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.410
 in terms of consumption actually the 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.990
 128 horsepower diesel that if it has this 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.880
 system records an average of 38 liters 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.350
 at 100 anyway one thing are 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.260
 the homologation figures 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.240
 reality and reality shows that 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.000
 this engine consumes little fuel 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.980
 both inside and outside the city and 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.690
 that in a mixed cycle certainly spends 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.690
 less than that of 128 horses 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.530
 to finish here goes a small 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.840
 summary the process has one more aspect 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.849
 sporty than the set but it's just about 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.400
 of appearance because your driving is 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.650
 identical is to say that of a comfortable car 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.930
 and nice 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.729
 It also has a cabin and a trunk 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.460
 very broad of the largest in their 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:12.080
 segment the price and the guarantee of 7 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.740
 years put the icing on this appetizing 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.740
 product 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.340
 I would like to know more about this car 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.470
 write us in the comments section 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.970
 and do not forget to hit the like and 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.970
 subscribe thank you very much
