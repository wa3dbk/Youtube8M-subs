eight<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:08.040> size<00:01:09.170> you<00:01:10.170> know<00:01:10.320> it's<00:01:10.770> gonna<00:01:10.890> be

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
eight in size you know it's gonna be

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.820 
eight in size you know it's gonna be
having<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.640> little<00:01:11.880> bit<00:01:11.970> lower<00:01:12.780> screen<00:01:13.229> size<00:01:13.590> as

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
having a little bit lower screen size as

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.280 
having a little bit lower screen size as
compared<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.310> original<00:01:14.869> galaxy<00:01:15.869> note<00:01:16.020> 5

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
compared to the original galaxy note 5

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.910 
compared to the original galaxy note 5
and<00:01:16.619> if<00:01:17.460> we<00:01:17.549> talk<00:01:17.700> about<00:01:17.729> its<00:01:18.150> it's<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.080> its<00:01:19.500> PPI

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
and if we talk about its it's a its PPI

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.999 
and if we talk about its it's a its PPI
it's<00:01:20.369> gonna<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.700> around<00:01:21.390> 700<00:01:22.350> PPI<00:01:22.680> which<00:01:22.890> is

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
it's gonna be around 700 PPI which is

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.340 
it's gonna be around 700 PPI which is
really<00:01:23.460> insane<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.750> gonna<00:01:24.900> be<00:01:25.049> really

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
really insane it's gonna be really

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.920 
really insane it's gonna be really
awesome<00:01:25.590> really<00:01:26.220> perfect<00:01:26.850> for<00:01:26.939> watching<00:01:27.540> 4k

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930
