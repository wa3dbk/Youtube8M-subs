okay<00:00:01.500> I<00:00:01.560> got<00:00:02.310> this<00:00:02.460> battery<00:00:03.620> set<00:00:04.620> up<00:00:04.799> kind<00:00:05.130> of

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
okay I got this battery set up kind of

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.909 
okay I got this battery set up kind of
the<00:00:05.250> way<00:00:05.400> I<00:00:05.430> think<00:00:05.819> I<00:00:05.940> need<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.150> do<00:00:06.330> it<00:00:06.509> I<00:00:06.919> did

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
the way I think I need to do it I did

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.270 
the way I think I need to do it I did
some<00:00:08.099> extensive<00:00:08.400> research<00:00:09.360> today<00:00:09.750> online<00:00:10.280> and

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
some extensive research today online and

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.490 
some extensive research today online and
of<00:00:12.210> course<00:00:12.570> internet<00:00:13.290> research<00:00:13.710> is<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.120> very

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
of course internet research is a very

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.019 
of course internet research is a very
helpful<00:00:16.500> tool<00:00:16.740> but<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.340> have<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.670> know<00:00:17.789> how<00:00:17.940> to

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
helpful tool but you have to know how to

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.349 
helpful tool but you have to know how to
use<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:19.189> I've<00:00:20.189> learned<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.640> forums<00:00:21.180> are

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
use it and I've learned that forums are

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.109 
use it and I've learned that forums are
very<00:00:21.630> very<00:00:21.900> poor<00:00:22.340> sources<00:00:23.340> for<00:00:23.490> information

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
very very poor sources for information

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.179 
very very poor sources for information
because<00:00:25.939> by<00:00:26.939> nature<00:00:27.000> people<00:00:27.590> like<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.769> pretend

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
because by nature people like to pretend

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.650 
because by nature people like to pretend
to<00:00:29.250> know<00:00:29.429> these<00:00:29.640> things<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.390> they<00:00:30.539> don't

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
to know these things that they don't

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.080 
to know these things that they don't
really<00:00:30.929> know<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.980> get<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.880> lot<00:00:33.059> of

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
really know and so you get a lot of

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.479 
really know and so you get a lot of
stuff<00:00:33.960> presented<00:00:34.200> as<00:00:34.530> fact<00:00:34.800> that's<00:00:35.340> just

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
stuff presented as fact that's just

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.440 
stuff presented as fact that's just
speculation<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:37.610> one<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.700> those<00:00:38.790> things<00:00:39.090> was

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
speculation and one of those things was

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.010 
speculation and one of those things was
I<00:00:39.989> had<00:00:40.379> mentioned<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.489> previous<00:00:41.960> video<00:00:42.960> on

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
I had mentioned in the previous video on

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.869 
I had mentioned in the previous video on
this<00:00:43.440> about<00:00:43.620> trying<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.190> figure<00:00:44.430> out<00:00:44.550> what<00:00:44.760> to

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
this about trying to figure out what to

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.330 
this about trying to figure out what to
use<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.210> coat<00:00:45.360> these<00:00:45.890> terminals<00:00:46.890> for<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> good

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
use to coat these terminals for a good

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.850 
use to coat these terminals for a good
corrosion<00:00:48.180> protection<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:50.809> I<00:00:51.809> did<00:00:52.440> decide<00:00:52.800> to

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
corrosion protection and I did decide to

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.350 
corrosion protection and I did decide to
try<00:00:53.219> no<00:00:53.730> locks<00:00:54.090> well<00:00:54.920> I<00:00:56.210> did<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> little

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
try no locks well I did a little

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.410 
try no locks well I did a little
research<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.140> printed<00:00:58.980> out<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.420> MSDS

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
research and I printed out the MSDS

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.549 
research and I printed out the MSDS
sheet<00:01:00.690> for<00:01:00.960> NOAA<00:01:01.140> locks<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:02.600> NOAA<00:01:03.600> locks<00:01:03.899> if

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
sheet for NOAA locks and NOAA locks if

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.500 
sheet for NOAA locks and NOAA locks if
you<00:01:05.070> don't<00:01:05.250> know<00:01:05.369> what<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:06.000> actually<00:01:06.590> I

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
you don't know what it is is actually I

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
you don't know what it is is actually I
think<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.600> stands<00:01:09.840> for<00:01:09.990> no<00:01:10.619> illumine<00:01:11.520> aluminum

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
think it stands for no illumine aluminum

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.249 
think it stands for no illumine aluminum
oxidization<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:14.479> let<00:01:15.479> me<00:01:15.600> see<00:01:15.780> if<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.140> grab

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
oxidization and let me see if I can grab

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.880 
oxidization and let me see if I can grab

to coat aluminum conductors to prevent

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.910 
to coat aluminum conductors to prevent

them from corroding from oxidization in
other<00:01:41.009> words<00:01:41.659> from<00:01:42.659> actual<00:01:43.530> error<00:01:44.000> causes

other words from actual error causes

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.990 
other words from actual error causes
corrosion<00:01:46.259> on<00:01:46.710> aluminum<00:01:47.189> we<00:01:47.340> all<00:01:47.490> know<00:01:47.729> that

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
corrosion on aluminum we all know that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.420 
corrosion on aluminum we all know that
we've<00:01:48.180> seen<00:01:48.619> aluminum<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.710> sits<00:01:49.979> around<00:01:50.070> for

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
we've seen aluminum that sits around for

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.490 
we've seen aluminum that sits around for
a<00:01:50.460> long<00:01:50.549> time<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.180> just<00:01:51.360> from<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.869> actual<00:01:52.259> air

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
a long time and just from the actual air

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.880 
a long time and just from the actual air
hitting<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.979> actually<00:01:53.430> crazy<00:01:54.770> corrosion<00:01:55.770> on

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
hitting it actually crazy corrosion on

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.370 
hitting it actually crazy corrosion on
it<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.509> one<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.689> things<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.079> kind<00:01:58.229> of

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
it so one of the things that kind of

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.459 
it so one of the things that kind of
caught<00:01:58.560> my<00:01:58.710> attention<00:01:59.219> on<00:01:59.369> this<00:01:59.549> here<00:02:00.140> was<00:02:01.140> the

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
caught my attention on this here was the

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.090 
caught my attention on this here was the
oh<00:02:03.020> where<00:02:04.020> did<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.290> find<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.740> here

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.980 

it<00:02:08.100> was<00:02:08.250> easier<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.610> find<00:02:08.940> on<00:02:09.210> the<00:02:09.360> computer

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
it was easier to find on the computer

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.330 
it was easier to find on the computer
because<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.410> was<00:02:10.500> bigger<00:02:10.970> but<00:02:11.970> okay

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
because it was bigger but okay

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.980 
because it was bigger but okay

so<00:02:24.810> in<00:02:24.900> other<00:02:24.990> words<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:26.040> very<00:02:26.220> things<00:02:26.520> that

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
so in other words the very things that

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.390 
so in other words the very things that
your<00:02:27.240> battery<00:02:27.740> is<00:02:28.740> going<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.160> have<00:02:31.190> acid<00:02:32.190> and

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
your battery is going to have acid and

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.680 
your battery is going to have acid and
water<00:02:33.090> is<00:02:34.040> going<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.190> cause<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.850> breakdown<00:02:36.630> of

water is going to cause a breakdown of
that<00:02:36.870> no<00:02:37.230> lock<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:37.890> no<00:02:38.670> locks<00:02:39.000> therefore<00:02:39.450> is

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
that no lock so no locks therefore is

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.480 
that no lock so no locks therefore is
not<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.840> good<00:02:41.360> chemical<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.450> use<00:02:42.600> on<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:43.490> now

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
not a good chemical to use on that now

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.699 
not a good chemical to use on that now
some<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.390> guys<00:02:45.570> that<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.930> come<00:02:46.410> across

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
some of the guys that I come across

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.640 
some of the guys that I come across
there<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.250> one<00:02:47.430> one<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:47.940> guys<00:02:48.090> is<00:02:48.300> very<00:02:48.650> it

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
there and one one of the guys is very it

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.920 
there and one one of the guys is very it
sounded<00:02:49.920> very<00:02:50.130> strong<00:02:50.520> or<00:02:50.760> vehement<00:02:51.180> about

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
sounded very strong or vehement about

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.490 
sounded very strong or vehement about
not<00:02:52.430> using<00:02:53.720> dielectric<00:02:54.720> grease<00:02:54.750> well<00:02:55.320> that's

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
not using dielectric grease well that's

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.140 
not using dielectric grease well that's
something<00:02:55.740> that<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.040> had<00:02:56.310> used<00:02:56.550> in<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.760> past

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
something that I had used in the past

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.620 
something that I had used in the past
and<00:02:57.739> I<00:02:58.739> hadn't<00:02:59.070> had<00:02:59.220> no<00:02:59.370> problems<00:02:59.820> with<00:02:59.850> it<00:03:00.000> but

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
and I hadn't had no problems with it but

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.070 
and I hadn't had no problems with it but
I<00:03:01.500> kind<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.340> mixed<00:03:02.640> on<00:03:02.760> whether<00:03:02.989> prevented<00:03:03.989> the

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
I kind of mixed on whether prevented the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.630 
I kind of mixed on whether prevented the
corrosion<00:03:04.380> or<00:03:04.650> not<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:06.260> dielectric<00:03:07.260> grease

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
corrosion or not and dielectric grease

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.640 
corrosion or not and dielectric grease
compound<00:03:08.640> actually<00:03:09.020> he<00:03:10.020> was<00:03:10.200> saying<00:03:10.440> that

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
compound actually he was saying that

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.820 
compound actually he was saying that
says<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.640> dielectric<00:03:12.269> grease<00:03:12.570> is<00:03:13.170> a<00:03:13.200> non

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
says the dielectric grease is a non

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.370 
says the dielectric grease is a non
conductor<00:03:14.700> that<00:03:15.630> would<00:03:15.810> cause<00:03:15.959> you<00:03:16.140> problems

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
conductor that would cause you problems

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.890 
conductor that would cause you problems
with<00:03:16.620> conductivity<00:03:17.310> well<00:03:17.670> I<00:03:17.940> know<00:03:18.480> for<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.840> fact

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
with conductivity well I know for a fact

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.690 
with conductivity well I know for a fact
that<00:03:19.320> it<00:03:19.410> does<00:03:19.620> not<00:03:19.800> cause<00:03:20.130> problems<00:03:20.400> with

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
that it does not cause problems with

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.580 
that it does not cause problems with
conductivity<00:03:21.420> because<00:03:21.720> I've<00:03:21.870> used<00:03:22.080> it<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.440> my

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
conductivity because I've used it and my

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.860 
conductivity because I've used it and my
conductivity<00:03:23.280> was<00:03:23.430> just<00:03:23.790> fine<00:03:24.030> so<00:03:26.840> anyways<00:03:27.840> I

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
conductivity was just fine so anyways I

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.990 
conductivity was just fine so anyways I
went<00:03:28.350> back<00:03:28.739> and<00:03:28.950> did<00:03:29.010> some<00:03:29.130> more<00:03:29.280> research<00:03:29.430> on

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
went back and did some more research on

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.270 
went back and did some more research on
that<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:30.930> found<00:03:31.200> several<00:03:31.410> good<00:03:31.799> sources

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
that and I found several good sources

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.870 
that and I found several good sources
the<00:03:32.400> pointer<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:32.880> that<00:03:33.060> is<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.209> good<00:03:33.480> use<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:34.880> good

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
the pointer to that is a good use a good

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.080 
the pointer to that is a good use a good
thing<00:03:36.090> to<00:03:36.209> use<00:03:36.360> for<00:03:36.799> preventing<00:03:38.090> battery

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
thing to use for preventing battery

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.830 
thing to use for preventing battery
terminal<00:03:39.480> corrosion<00:03:40.049> and<00:03:41.360> what<00:03:42.360> it<00:03:42.480> does<00:03:42.660> is

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
terminal corrosion and what it does is

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.660 
terminal corrosion and what it does is
it<00:03:42.989> blocks<00:03:44.630> moisture<00:03:45.630> and<00:03:45.930> and<00:03:46.620> acids<00:03:47.549> and

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
it blocks moisture and and acids and

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.900 
it blocks moisture and and acids and
everything<00:03:48.060> from<00:03:49.459> penetrating<00:03:50.459> or<00:03:50.700> getting

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
everything from penetrating or getting

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.590 
everything from penetrating or getting
to<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.209> metals<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:53.090> what<00:03:54.090> causes<00:03:54.330> the

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
to the metals and what causes the

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.300 
to the metals and what causes the
corrosion<00:03:55.019> on<00:03:55.110> batteries<00:03:55.530> actually<00:03:55.769> is<00:03:56.100> the

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
corrosion on batteries actually is the

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.800 
corrosion on batteries actually is the
hydrogen<00:03:57.060> gas<00:03:57.450> that<00:03:58.350> these<00:03:58.830> batteries<00:03:59.810> expel

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
hydrogen gas that these batteries expel

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.590 
hydrogen gas that these batteries expel
through<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:01.470> ventilation<00:04:01.860> system<00:04:02.430> and

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
through the ventilation system and

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.600 
through the ventilation system and
sometimes<00:04:03.600> just<00:04:03.900> through<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:05.250> I<00:04:05.370> think

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
sometimes just through the and I think

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.979 
sometimes just through the and I think
this<00:04:05.790> battery<00:04:06.180> this<00:04:06.269> is<00:04:06.450> a<00:04:06.480> I<00:04:08.600> won't<00:04:09.600> name<00:04:09.780> no

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
this battery this is a I won't name no

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.990 
this battery this is a I won't name no
names<00:04:10.140> but<00:04:10.410> it's<00:04:10.530> a<00:04:10.620> cheap<00:04:10.830> battery<00:04:11.280> I<00:04:11.519> think

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
names but it's a cheap battery I think

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.640 
names but it's a cheap battery I think
if<00:04:12.120> you<00:04:12.239> look<00:04:12.420> closely<00:04:12.720> at<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.049> video<00:04:13.290> you<00:04:13.350> see

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
if you look closely at the video you see

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.590 
if you look closely at the video you see
where<00:04:13.799> I<00:04:13.830> got<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.190> battery<00:04:14.519> but<00:04:15.030> anyways<00:04:15.389> it's

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
where I got the battery but anyways it's

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.110 
where I got the battery but anyways it's
a<00:04:15.660> cheap<00:04:15.870> battery<00:04:16.320> and

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
a cheap battery and

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.449 
a cheap battery and
I<00:04:17.620> suspect<00:04:18.620> that<00:04:18.680> there's<00:04:18.919> a<00:04:18.979> possibility

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
I suspect that there's a possibility

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.420 
I suspect that there's a possibility
that<00:04:19.699> they<00:04:20.000> didn't<00:04:20.269> use<00:04:20.449> the<00:04:20.479> best<00:04:21.280> methods<00:04:22.280> of

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
that they didn't use the best methods of

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.150 
that they didn't use the best methods of
sealing<00:04:22.840> where<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:24.020> terminals<00:04:24.530> come<00:04:24.740> up<00:04:24.919> or

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
sealing where the terminals come up or

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.980 
sealing where the terminals come up or
the<00:04:25.340> post<00:04:25.550> come<00:04:25.790> up<00:04:25.910> through<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:26.270> plastic<00:04:26.479> top

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
the post come up through the plastic top

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.040 
the post come up through the plastic top
so<00:04:27.380> I<00:04:27.410> think<00:04:27.590> you<00:04:27.919> can<00:04:28.070> actually<00:04:28.220> get<00:04:28.520> some

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
so I think you can actually get some

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.810 
so I think you can actually get some
small<00:04:30.050> amounts<00:04:30.470> of<00:04:30.530> hydrogen<00:04:31.010> gas<00:04:31.040> coming<00:04:31.580> up

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
small amounts of hydrogen gas coming up

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.850 
small amounts of hydrogen gas coming up
through<00:04:32.060> there<00:04:32.270> and<00:04:32.540> I<00:04:33.169> think<00:04:33.500> that's<00:04:33.680> what

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
through there and I think that's what

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.020 
through there and I think that's what
causes<00:04:34.070> this<00:04:34.310> to<00:04:34.370> corrode<00:04:34.960> so<00:04:36.760> anyways<00:04:37.760> this

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
causes this to corrode so anyways this

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.900 
causes this to corrode so anyways this
this<00:04:38.540> dielectric<00:04:39.410> compound<00:04:39.979> will<00:04:40.520> protect

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
this dielectric compound will protect

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.180 
this dielectric compound will protect
your<00:04:41.810> metals<00:04:42.199> if<00:04:42.320> you<00:04:42.440> coat<00:04:42.680> it<00:04:42.710> with<00:04:43.010> that

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
your metals if you coat it with that

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.180 
your metals if you coat it with that
from<00:04:44.000> these<00:04:44.150> hydrogen<00:04:44.690> gases<00:04:44.960> as<00:04:45.889> well<00:04:45.949> as

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
from these hydrogen gases as well as

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.390 
from these hydrogen gases as well as
water<00:04:47.260> oxygen<00:04:48.260> anything<00:04:48.800> else<00:04:48.979> that<00:04:49.160> wants<00:04:49.370> to

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
water oxygen anything else that wants to

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.659 
water oxygen anything else that wants to
get<00:04:49.639> to<00:04:49.820> it<00:04:49.940> and<00:04:50.150> so<00:04:51.050> I<00:04:51.080> think<00:04:51.320> it's<00:04:51.680> a<00:04:51.800> very

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
get to it and so I think it's a very

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.710 
get to it and so I think it's a very
good<00:04:52.970> material<00:04:53.870> to<00:04:54.260> use<00:04:54.440> for<00:04:54.680> that<00:04:54.770> and<00:04:55.720> so

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
good material to use for that and so

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.950 
good material to use for that and so
anyways<00:04:57.110> I<00:04:57.740> redid<00:04:58.520> this<00:04:58.669> battery<00:04:59.120> one<00:04:59.810> of<00:04:59.900> the

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
anyways I redid this battery one of the

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.020 
anyways I redid this battery one of the
things<00:05:00.199> that<00:05:00.380> Chrysler<00:05:00.620> tells<00:05:01.370> it<00:05:01.520> uses<00:05:01.880> those

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
things that Chrysler tells it uses those

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.610 
things that Chrysler tells it uses those
felt<00:05:02.300> washers<00:05:02.780> and<00:05:02.930> they<00:05:02.990> tell<00:05:03.169> you<00:05:03.260> to<00:05:03.410> soak

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
felt washers and they tell you to soak

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.629 
felt washers and they tell you to soak
them<00:05:03.770> in<00:05:03.889> oil<00:05:04.100> and<00:05:05.050> I<00:05:06.070> don't<00:05:07.070> I<00:05:07.160> couldn't<00:05:07.460> find

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
them in oil and I don't I couldn't find

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.520 
them in oil and I don't I couldn't find
anything<00:05:07.910> on<00:05:08.240> that<00:05:08.539> but<00:05:08.750> I<00:05:08.780> believe<00:05:09.139> that<00:05:09.169> what

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
anything on that but I believe that what

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.260 
anything on that but I believe that what
that<00:05:09.710> probably<00:05:10.100> does<00:05:10.310> is<00:05:10.550> the<00:05:10.669> same<00:05:10.880> thing<00:05:11.150> I

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
that probably does is the same thing I

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.779 
that probably does is the same thing I
think<00:05:11.300> it<00:05:11.600> helps<00:05:11.840> prevent<00:05:12.199> those<00:05:12.789> hydrogen

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
think it helps prevent those hydrogen

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:17.529 
think it helps prevent those hydrogen
gases<00:05:14.000> from<00:05:14.810> getting<00:05:15.199> up<00:05:15.350> through<00:05:15.620> that<00:05:16.539> seal

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
gases from getting up through that seal

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:19.570 
gases from getting up through that seal
between<00:05:17.840> the<00:05:18.169> posts<00:05:18.560> and<00:05:18.680> the<00:05:18.770> battery<00:05:19.310> top

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
between the posts and the battery top

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.600 
between the posts and the battery top
and<00:05:20.200> getting<00:05:21.200> up<00:05:21.349> to<00:05:21.590> the<00:05:21.830> terminal<00:05:22.280> I<00:05:22.370> think

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
and getting up to the terminal I think

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.040 
and getting up to the terminal I think
it's<00:05:22.729> just<00:05:22.849> kind<00:05:23.030> of<00:05:23.120> like<00:05:23.210> a<00:05:23.360> little<00:05:23.690> barrier

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
it's just kind of like a little barrier

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.339 
it's just kind of like a little barrier
and<00:05:24.940> as<00:05:25.940> far<00:05:26.120> as<00:05:26.180> the<00:05:26.419> red<00:05:26.599> and<00:05:26.750> green<00:05:26.990> the

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:27.349 
and as far as the red and green the

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:29.430 
and as far as the red and green the
color<00:05:27.560> it<00:05:27.950> doesn't<00:05:28.190> matter<00:05:28.520> it's<00:05:28.880> just<00:05:29.000> a

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
color it doesn't matter it's just a

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.659 
color it doesn't matter it's just a
visual<00:05:30.440> thing<00:05:31.389> allows<00:05:32.389> you<00:05:32.599> to<00:05:33.190> you<00:05:34.190> put<00:05:34.400> green

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
visual thing allows you to you put green

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.879 
visual thing allows you to you put green
under<00:05:34.940> your<00:05:35.060> your<00:05:35.660> negative<00:05:36.349> and<00:05:36.530> red<00:05:36.680> under

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 
under your your negative and red under

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:38.710 
under your your negative and red under
your<00:05:37.010> positive<00:05:37.490> and<00:05:37.669> it's<00:05:37.789> just<00:05:38.000> just<00:05:38.570> a

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
your positive and it's just just a

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.930 
your positive and it's just just a
visible<00:05:39.139> thing<00:05:39.349> so<00:05:39.590> that<00:05:39.680> you<00:05:39.710> can<00:05:39.979> know<00:05:40.760> which

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
visible thing so that you can know which

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.570 
visible thing so that you can know which
is<00:05:41.120> which<00:05:41.300> and<00:05:41.599> very<00:05:42.500> unnecessary<00:05:42.800> as<00:05:43.280> far<00:05:43.460> as

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
is which and very unnecessary as far as

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.350 
is which and very unnecessary as far as
I'm<00:05:43.669> concerned<00:05:44.229> so<00:05:45.610> anyways<00:05:46.610> this<00:05:46.820> is<00:05:47.060> this<00:05:47.210> is

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
I'm concerned so anyways this is this is

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.490 
I'm concerned so anyways this is this is
a<00:05:47.389> bit<00:05:47.660> I<00:05:48.460> know<00:05:49.460> it's<00:05:49.669> a<00:05:49.729> lot<00:05:49.880> of<00:05:50.110> stuff<00:05:51.110> to<00:05:51.320> sit

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
a bit I know it's a lot of stuff to sit

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.180 
a bit I know it's a lot of stuff to sit
here<00:05:51.650> and<00:05:51.770> listen<00:05:51.919> to<00:05:52.160> and<00:05:53.830> but<00:05:54.830> I<00:05:54.860> kind<00:05:55.130> of

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
here and listen to and but I kind of

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.320 
here and listen to and but I kind of
think<00:05:55.370> it's<00:05:55.490> important<00:05:55.940> if<00:05:56.030> you<00:05:56.120> want<00:05:56.150> to

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
think it's important if you want to

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.760 
think it's important if you want to
understand<00:05:56.720> batteries<00:05:57.169> and<00:05:57.380> how<00:05:57.500> to<00:05:57.560> keep

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
understand batteries and how to keep

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.490 
understand batteries and how to keep
them<00:05:57.830> from<00:05:58.130> corroding<00:05:58.610> so<00:05:59.050> one<00:06:00.050> thing<00:06:00.229> I<00:06:00.320> want

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
them from corroding so one thing I want

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.150 
them from corroding so one thing I want
to<00:06:00.590> add<00:06:00.740> to<00:06:00.889> this<00:06:01.039> video<00:06:01.430> is<00:06:01.729> I<00:06:02.060> wanted<00:06:02.300> to<00:06:02.389> show

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
to add to this video is I wanted to show

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.100 
to add to this video is I wanted to show
you<00:06:04.160> my<00:06:04.280> Jeep<00:06:04.729> and<00:06:04.910> I<00:06:05.060> cleaned<00:06:05.449> that<00:06:05.539> up<00:06:05.690> and<00:06:05.990> I

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
you my Jeep and I cleaned that up and I

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.680 
you my Jeep and I cleaned that up and I
had<00:06:06.320> used<00:06:06.560> this<00:06:06.970> dielectric<00:06:07.970> compound<00:06:08.510> but

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
had used this dielectric compound but

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.680 
had used this dielectric compound but
not<00:06:08.840> near<00:06:09.080> as<00:06:09.229> sick<00:06:09.410> as<00:06:09.470> I<00:06:09.710> did<00:06:09.919> here<00:06:10.280> and<00:06:10.460> I<00:06:11.389> did

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
not near as sick as I did here and I did

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.830 
not near as sick as I did here and I did
that<00:06:11.870> probably<00:06:12.199> two<00:06:12.800> months<00:06:12.979> ago<00:06:13.190> and<00:06:13.690> I<00:06:14.690> want

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
that probably two months ago and I want

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.480 
that probably two months ago and I want
to<00:06:14.900> show<00:06:15.050> you<00:06:15.110> how<00:06:15.289> those<00:06:15.470> terminals<00:06:15.889> look<00:06:16.160> so

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
to show you how those terminals look so

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.250 
to show you how those terminals look so
I'm<00:06:17.060> going<00:06:17.210> to<00:06:17.270> go<00:06:17.360> out<00:06:17.479> to<00:06:17.750> the<00:06:17.870> Jeep<00:06:18.050> and

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
I'm going to go out to the Jeep and

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.510 
I'm going to go out to the Jeep and
we'll<00:06:18.410> show<00:06:18.590> you<00:06:18.620> that<00:06:18.770> and<00:06:19.160> then<00:06:19.250> I'm<00:06:19.370> going

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
we'll show you that and then I'm going

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.730 
we'll show you that and then I'm going
to<00:06:19.550> quit<00:06:19.820> on<00:06:19.940> this<00:06:20.180> particular<00:06:20.810> video<00:06:20.960> okay

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
to quit on this particular video okay

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.390 
to quit on this particular video okay
this<00:06:21.979> is<00:06:22.190> the<00:06:22.280> battery<00:06:22.460> in<00:06:22.669> the<00:06:22.760> Jeep<00:06:22.970> and<00:06:24.400> as

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
this is the battery in the Jeep and as

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.190 
this is the battery in the Jeep and as
you<00:06:25.580> can<00:06:25.729> see<00:06:25.940> there's<00:06:26.210> one<00:06:26.270> LED<00:06:26.659> terminal<00:06:27.050> on

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.200 
you can see there's one LED terminal on

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.770 
you can see there's one LED terminal on
here

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
here

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.750 
here
one-ten<00:06:28.650> terminal<00:06:29.100> on<00:06:29.220> there<00:06:29.460> the<00:06:29.580> tin

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:29.760 
one-ten terminal on there the tin

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.030 
one-ten terminal on there the tin
terminal<00:06:30.150> is<00:06:30.210> original<00:06:30.690> and<00:06:30.900> has<00:06:31.770> got<00:06:32.010> a

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.040 
terminal is original and has got a

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.910 
terminal is original and has got a
little<00:06:32.370> bit<00:06:32.490> of<00:06:32.580> corrosion<00:06:32.760> underneath<00:06:33.330> that

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:33.920 
little bit of corrosion underneath that

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.220 
little bit of corrosion underneath that
and<00:06:34.920> here<00:06:35.639> is<00:06:35.790> the<00:06:36.000> lead<00:06:36.510> terminal<00:06:36.990> and<00:06:37.080> that's

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.230 
and here is the lead terminal and that's

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.620 
and here is the lead terminal and that's
the<00:06:37.320> one<00:06:37.470> that<00:06:37.590> I<00:06:37.650> replaced<00:06:38.040> and<00:06:38.250> I<00:06:38.280> use<00:06:38.490> that

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
the one that I replaced and I use that

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.000 
the one that I replaced and I use that
dielectric<00:06:39.630> grease<00:06:39.660> on<00:06:40.050> that<00:06:40.260> when<00:06:40.530> I<00:06:40.560> worked

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.010 
dielectric grease on that when I worked

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.450 
dielectric grease on that when I worked
on<00:06:41.220> it<00:06:41.400> especially<00:06:41.850> around<00:06:41.940> the<00:06:43.220> lead<00:06:44.220> in<00:06:44.370> the

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.520 
on it especially around the lead in the
post<00:06:44.700> and<00:06:44.940> everything<00:06:45.180> like<00:06:45.300> it<00:06:45.510> there<00:06:45.750> you

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:46.530 
post and everything like it there you

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.050 
post and everything like it there you
can<00:06:46.680> see<00:06:46.860> kind<00:06:47.040> of<00:06:47.160> wet<00:06:47.400> spot<00:06:47.669> where<00:06:47.880> I'd<00:06:48.030> put

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
can see kind of wet spot where I'd put

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.080 
can see kind of wet spot where I'd put
it<00:06:48.330> on<00:06:48.450> there<00:06:48.780> and<00:06:49.370> but<00:06:50.370> anyways<00:06:50.669> as<00:06:50.820> you<00:06:50.970> can

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
it on there and but anyways as you can

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.150 
it on there and but anyways as you can
see<00:06:51.210> there<00:06:51.419> is<00:06:51.570> no<00:06:51.780> corrosion<00:06:52.290> on<00:06:52.620> it<00:06:52.650> like<00:06:53.010> I

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 
see there is no corrosion on it like I

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.980 
see there is no corrosion on it like I
said<00:06:53.340> that's<00:06:53.430> been<00:06:53.639> a<00:06:53.700> couple<00:06:54.030> of<00:06:54.120> months<00:06:54.389> and

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
said that's been a couple of months and

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.629 
said that's been a couple of months and
this<00:06:55.169> thing<00:06:55.410> was<00:06:55.560> corroding<00:06:56.070> bad<00:06:56.310> before

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 
this thing was corroding bad before

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:59.300 
this thing was corroding bad before
that's<00:06:57.090> the<00:06:57.210> positive<00:06:57.389> side<00:06:57.960> and<00:06:58.800> I<00:06:59.070> think

00:06:59.300 --> 00:06:59.310 
that's the positive side and I think

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.130 
that's the positive side and I think
there's<00:06:59.490> probably<00:06:59.820> been<00:07:00.090> a<00:07:00.120> hydrogen<00:07:00.930> leak

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:01.140 
there's probably been a hydrogen leak

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.680 
there's probably been a hydrogen leak
right<00:07:01.530> there<00:07:01.590> around<00:07:01.950> that<00:07:02.160> terminal<00:07:02.730> and<00:07:03.330> I

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:05.690 
right there around that terminal and I

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.180 
right there around that terminal and I
think<00:07:06.690> if<00:07:06.930> I<00:07:07.080> was<00:07:07.230> to<00:07:07.320> do<00:07:07.470> that<00:07:07.500> do<00:07:07.890> anything

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:08.190 
think if I was to do that do anything

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.800 
think if I was to do that do anything
more<00:07:08.370> to<00:07:08.460> this<00:07:08.580> I<00:07:08.730> think<00:07:08.760> I'd<00:07:09.060> really<00:07:09.330> slighted

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:09.810 
more to this I think I'd really slighted

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.330 
more to this I think I'd really slighted
that<00:07:09.930> stuff<00:07:10.169> on<00:07:10.350> there<00:07:10.590> to<00:07:10.680> help<00:07:10.770> protect<00:07:10.950> it<00:07:11.310> a

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 
that stuff on there to help protect it a

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.190 
that stuff on there to help protect it a
little<00:07:11.490> bit<00:07:11.640> better<00:07:11.790> but<00:07:12.030> since<00:07:12.690> it's<00:07:12.930> doing

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:13.200 
little bit better but since it's doing

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.510 
little bit better but since it's doing
good<00:07:13.410> right<00:07:13.590> now<00:07:13.770> I'm<00:07:13.919> not<00:07:14.130> going<00:07:14.310> to<00:07:14.370> mess

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 
good right now I'm not going to mess

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:14.980 
good right now I'm not going to mess
with<00:07:14.550> it

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:14.990 
with it

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.330 
with it
this<00:07:15.990> side<00:07:16.230> here<00:07:16.500> I<00:07:16.530> wouldn't<00:07:16.950> mind<00:07:17.130> changing

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:17.340 
this side here I wouldn't mind changing

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.030 
this side here I wouldn't mind changing
that<00:07:17.669> over<00:07:17.910> to<00:07:18.030> a<00:07:18.060> LED<00:07:18.300> one<00:07:18.510> if<00:07:19.229> I<00:07:19.470> do<00:07:19.530> start<00:07:19.710> to

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:20.040 
that over to a LED one if I do start to

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.950 
that over to a LED one if I do start to
have<00:07:20.160> any<00:07:20.340> problems<00:07:20.760> with<00:07:20.910> it<00:07:20.940> right<00:07:21.210> now<00:07:21.390> like

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 
have any problems with it right now like

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.890 
have any problems with it right now like
I<00:07:22.080> say<00:07:22.290> there's<00:07:22.530> nothing<00:07:23.090> no<00:07:24.090> pressing<00:07:24.570> reason

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 
I say there's nothing no pressing reason

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.030 
I say there's nothing no pressing reason
to<00:07:24.990> do<00:07:25.140> anything<00:07:25.169> with<00:07:25.560> it<00:07:25.710> I<00:07:25.800> don't<00:07:25.979> like

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:26.040 
to do anything with it I don't like

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.690 
to do anything with it I don't like
those<00:07:26.370> 10<00:07:27.680> terminals<00:07:28.680> I've<00:07:28.830> much<00:07:29.070> much<00:07:29.340> prefer

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:29.700 
those 10 terminals I've much much prefer

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.930 
those 10 terminals I've much much prefer
the<00:07:29.880> lead<00:07:30.060> terminals<00:07:30.540> and<00:07:31.790> one<00:07:32.790> of<00:07:32.880> the

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 
the lead terminals and one of the

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.370 
the lead terminals and one of the
reasons<00:07:33.270> I<00:07:33.390> used<00:07:33.600> to<00:07:33.720> think<00:07:33.840> I<00:07:33.990> didn't<00:07:34.200> like

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:34.380 
reasons I used to think I didn't like

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.800 
reasons I used to think I didn't like
them<00:07:34.530> is<00:07:34.620> because<00:07:34.650> of<00:07:35.040> the<00:07:35.540> potential<00:07:36.540> for

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:36.810 
them is because of the potential for

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.250 
them is because of the potential for
galvanic<00:07:37.200> corrosion<00:07:37.950> but<00:07:38.280> I<00:07:39.110> printed<00:07:40.110> out<00:07:40.200> a

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:40.260 
galvanic corrosion but I printed out a

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.020 
galvanic corrosion but I printed out a
chart<00:07:40.590> for<00:07:40.770> that<00:07:40.800> too<00:07:41.130> and<00:07:41.160> I'm<00:07:41.490> showing<00:07:41.669> tin

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:42.030 
chart for that too and I'm showing tin

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.040 
chart for that too and I'm showing tin
and<00:07:42.210> lead<00:07:42.240> as<00:07:42.510> being<00:07:42.720> very<00:07:42.870> close<00:07:43.169> in<00:07:43.470> the

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.050 
and lead as being very close in the

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.870 
and lead as being very close in the
chart<00:07:46.050> so<00:07:46.380> that<00:07:47.100> should<00:07:47.310> not<00:07:47.340> even<00:07:47.460> be<00:07:47.760> a

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:47.880 
chart so that should not even be a

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.760 
chart so that should not even be a
problem<00:07:48.229> and<00:07:50.150> anyways<00:07:51.150> that's<00:07:51.630> plenty<00:07:52.530> for

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:52.770 
problem and anyways that's plenty for

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.590 
problem and anyways that's plenty for
this<00:07:52.919> video<00:07:53.250> and<00:07:53.310> just<00:07:54.030> go<00:07:54.479> on

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:56.600 
this video and just go on

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.940 
this video and just go on
well<00:07:57.600> signing<00:07:58.260> off<00:07:58.410> thanks<00:07:59.400> for<00:07:59.550> watching
