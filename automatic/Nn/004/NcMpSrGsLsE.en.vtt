00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.000 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
stick<00:00:14.820> an<00:00:14.910> S<00:00:15.059> hoop<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.389> top<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.929> we're<00:00:16.920> going

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
stick an S hoop on top and we're going

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.130 
stick an S hoop on top and we're going
to<00:00:17.070> see<00:00:17.310> if<00:00:17.520> an<00:00:17.760> S<00:00:17.910> Coupe<00:00:18.060> on<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.300> bottom<00:00:18.720> makes

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
to see if an S Coupe on the bottom makes

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.380 
to see if an S Coupe on the bottom makes
a<00:00:19.230> difference<00:00:19.619> see<00:00:20.369> visually<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.270> would

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
a difference see visually it would

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.050 
a difference see visually it would
bother<00:00:21.600> me<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:22.289> have<00:00:22.470> diecast<00:00:23.160> on<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.670> bottom

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
bother me to have diecast on the bottom

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.140 
bother me to have diecast on the bottom
with<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.480> circle<00:00:24.810> flange<00:00:25.019> on<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.289> top<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:26.150> let's

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
with a circle flange on the top so let's

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.099 
with a circle flange on the top so let's
make<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.330> both/and<00:00:27.720> while<00:00:27.810> we're<00:00:27.930> doing<00:00:28.019> it

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
make a both/and while we're doing it

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.089 
make a both/and while we're doing it
let's<00:00:28.289> see<00:00:28.380> if<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.529> makes<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.740> difference<00:00:29.010> in

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
let's see if it makes a difference in

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.439 
let's see if it makes a difference in
the<00:00:29.160> sound<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.670> here's<00:00:29.970> what<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.150> sounds<00:00:30.420> like

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
the sound so here's what it sounds like

00:00:30.449 --> 00:01:39.639 
the sound so here's what it sounds like
normally

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.370 

get<00:01:40.649> a<00:01:40.680> bunch<00:01:40.890> more<00:01:40.950> bite<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.090> as<00:01:42.420> we<00:01:43.110> notice

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
get a bunch more bite to it as we notice

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.590 
get a bunch more bite to it as we notice
what<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.590> other<00:01:43.710> drum<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.130> did<00:01:44.509> in<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
what the other drum that I did in the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.419 
what the other drum that I did in the
lower<00:01:45.810> tuning<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.350> was<00:01:46.470> actually<00:01:46.950> more<00:01:47.070> open

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
lower tuning it was actually more open

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.090 
lower tuning it was actually more open
than<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.970> diecast<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.600> noticed<00:01:48.929> and<00:01:49.800> up<00:01:49.890> here

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
than the diecast I noticed and up here

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.480 
than the diecast I noticed and up here
it's<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.250> got<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.759> much<00:01:50.940> Bank<00:01:52.100> I'm<00:01:53.100> liking<00:01:53.399> it

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
it's just got so much Bank I'm liking it

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.359 
it's just got so much Bank I'm liking it
so<00:01:53.780> let's<00:01:54.780> see<00:01:54.899> if<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.050> bottom<00:01:55.380> actually<00:01:56.039> does

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
so let's see if the bottom actually does

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:11.360 
so let's see if the bottom actually does
anything<00:01:56.670> for<00:01:57.000> this<00:02:09.829> to<00:02:10.829> me<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.040> sounds<00:02:11.310> like

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
anything for this to me it sounds like

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.520 
anything for this to me it sounds like
the<00:02:11.549> bottom<00:02:11.850> hoop<00:02:12.030> kind<00:02:12.329> of<00:02:12.450> almost<00:02:13.019> tightened

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
the bottom hoop kind of almost tightened

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.690 
the bottom hoop kind of almost tightened
up<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.709> tone<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.920> little<00:02:14.010> bit<00:02:14.220> dried<00:02:14.519> it

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
up the tone a little bit dried it

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.280 
up the tone a little bit dried it
slightly<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:15.690> if<00:02:15.750> that's<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:15.959> kind<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.140> thing

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
slightly so if that's the kind of thing

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.509 
slightly so if that's the kind of thing
that<00:02:16.320> you're<00:02:16.470> into<00:02:16.739> that's<00:02:16.950> obviously<00:02:17.459> a

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
that you're into that's obviously a

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.550 
that you're into that's obviously a
really<00:02:17.670> good<00:02:17.880> thing<00:02:18.060> as<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.870> mentioned<00:02:18.930> in<00:02:19.410> the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
really good thing as I mentioned in the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.259 
really good thing as I mentioned in the
previous<00:02:19.769> video<00:02:20.010> about<00:02:20.280> s<00:02:20.459> hoops<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.970> flange

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
previous video about s hoops the flange

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.000 
previous video about s hoops the flange

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
over the bearing edge protecting it they

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.319 
over the bearing edge protecting it they
tighten<00:02:23.489> up<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.640> tone<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.820> little<00:02:23.910> bit<00:02:24.090> give

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329
