00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.210
 Before us are three multicookers, two of them are called Yummy, 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.420
 and one liberty. 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.500
 Manufacturers are different, but how much is common in the external 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.820
 form, is not it? 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.080
 Today we will try to reveal the difference between them! 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.750
 These two differ only in color. 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.400
 Power - 1000 watts. 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.450
 The package includes: spoon for stirring, 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.000
 spoon, measuring cup, container for cooking 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.130
 steamed, detachable power cord, yogurt cups 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.050
 and a five liter non-stick coated bowl. 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.890
 Manufacturer Yummi says that here is ceramic 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.890
 coating. 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.680
 It seems that, and yet, I did not conduct an examination. 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.570
 A book of instructions, in which there is also a lot of interesting 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.570
 recipes. 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.730
 Liberty grade is the same, only here is not 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.870
 cups for making yogurt, and a bowl here with 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.300
 Teflon (non-stick coating). 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.760
 But in addition to the instructions, there is an illustrated 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.760
 a recipe book (appetite has already been played out by some pictures). 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.899
 Convenient that during the cooking time counts down 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.640
 (in Yummy this oh how lacked). 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.729
 Multicooker power is slightly lower, namely - 860 watts. 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.140
 There are 12 automatic programs in our multicookers 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.850
 for all cases of cooking and not only! 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.880
 In Yummi control panel in Russian. 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.260
 Use the "menu" button to select 1 of 12 automatic programs. 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.170
 (all of them are displayed here). 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.760
 An important side of the multicooker can be called the possibility 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.710
 “Delayed start” (up to 24 hours). 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.640
 Put the products in the slow cooker in the evening, put the necessary 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.030
 ready time, for example, to be ready in the morning 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.960
 at 8 o'clock (and you do not have to spend sutra time for this, 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.780
 when and so late for work). 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.150
 Moreover, after cooking, the multicooker automatically 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.549
 goes into "heating" mode. 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.689
 In Yummy, you can adjust the cooking temperature, 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.700
 this is in case the automatic temperature does not fit 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.010
 for your recipe. 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.450
 The display has 3 types of backlighting: blue (standby), 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.610
 red (cooking), green (heating). 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.950
 Conveniently, the seal cover is easy to remove! 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.870
 After cooking, it can be removed, washed and installed. 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.970
 back (they are not removable in all multicookers). 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.479
 Liberty is very similar to Yummy, and yet there are differences. 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.409
 The control panel in Ukrainian, there is no adjustment 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.549
 temperatures (I think it's more convenient to cook like that). 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.739
 There is a program "yogurt", but cups for his 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.219
 Cooking is not included. 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:21.219
 With a "keep warm" button, you can warm the already cooled 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:22.219
 food (very convenient function). 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:23.219
 With the "off / cancel" button you can stop cooking 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:24.219
 or reset settings you suddenly do not true 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:25.219
 have chosen. 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:26.219
 Today I will cook in two multicookers at once! 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:27.689
 In Yummy, I'll cook - baked ribs, and in Liberty - fried 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.129
 potatoes with onions. 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.799
 I read a few reviews that at the end of preparation 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.200
 they do not sound the signal, as it happens in others 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.980
 devices (let's see in practice, is it so). 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.469
 Let's start with grilling the ribs! 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:41.870
 This will require 1 kilogram of ribs (I took 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.739
 pork), olive oil, salt, spices (here already 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.379
 look at your taste). 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.919
 I pre-cut the ribs in portions ... then sprinkle 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.510
 spices and salt. 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.870
 I spread the crock-pot in the bowl ... I pour oil on the silent one. 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.319
 We will cook in the "baking" mode, cooking time 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.029
 70 minutes 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:00.150
 "Start"! 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.889
 For fried potatoes, I cleaned about 1 kilogram 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:05.290
 potatoes, sliced ​​(how to chop, not at all 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.959
 important), cut the onion. 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.029
 Salted the whole thing, added spices, everything was added 

00:03:10.029 --> 00:03:11.730
 same olive oil and stirred. 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.660
 Fried potatoes, surprisingly, cook 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.370
 in the "frying" mode, cooking time 40 minutes. 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.829
 Click "start". 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.282
 While the dishes are being prepared, the smell is incredible, and 

00:03:22.282 --> 00:03:24.889
 the valve is light steam and condensate appears. 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.719
 Cover it or bring your hand to it categorically 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:30.120
 it is impossible (steam is very hot)! 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.219
 Well, our dishes were prepared, but the signal never sounded. 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:37.359
 For me personally, it does not cause any inconvenience, prepares 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.450
 silently and let him cook. 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.939
 Let's start with baked ribs, now potatoes. 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:48.989
 This smell starts to drive you crazy, sure, the taste of such 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.470
 same ... Hugging! 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.610
 Potato at times tastier than cooking in a skillet 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.519
 (does not burn at all). 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.969
 The meat itself is moving away from the bones ... In one portion today I 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:03:59.180
 just do not get along!
