 the leader of nexus gaming and today I'm in 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.759
 here accompanied by very good militants 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.070
 to bones and he is the co leader of the clan of 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.259
 channel that we come here to promote if 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.120
 we have been lucky that radio has 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:36.210
 uploaded this video you can give 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.580
 thanks as always because currently 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.620
 it is quite complicated to climb in 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.970
 youtube and go catching subscribers and 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.920
 good a promotion is a great 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.989
 opportunity to get to know us more 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.460
 people so well then if you are 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.399
 seeing this is because it will have gone up 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.609
 your channel so you can give them the 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.250
 thank you to tell you that we are a clan of 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:58.980
 ping stick as they say now but 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.539
 good more than competing against others 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.969
 we have the purpose of having fun 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.759
 make them fun to have a good time and 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.830
 I do not know here there's a good enough roll and 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.050
 this is bone is not like all those 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.899
 shits that are out there that are 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.240
 always be moved and nothing with us 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.700
 It can be contacted in a very 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.909
 easy that good and we will spend a little more 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:27.280
 to explain 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:30.770
 and then it is more or less all general not 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.299
 it's the same is not a we have a plane already 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.819
 I know there are some of you up to 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.829
 balls of so many clans that before 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.140
 fashionable but I think that the 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.140
 our has a different meaning not 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.849
 we look down we do not seek to carry 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.030
 money with the partner none of that what 

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:46.030
 we call 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.140
 I think with kids we laugh 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.789
 always me that I at least when 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.670
 I'm with is that with this because it 's there 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:01.310
 where he always supports her and the truth is 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.670
 a plan to have fun is already what 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.020
 theme of men players you animais 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.259
 delighted of life you know you 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.280
 we will leave good I guess we want 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:15.079
 contact us on skype 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.430
 with us you already know if you want to enter 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.989
 as players well forward 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.359
 commentator of I think it's good 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.010
 a little the template already more or less 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:24.910
 closed to what you have a warehouse 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.910
 ostia and have 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.459
 but good 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.020
 yes good to tell you also that the departure 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.450
 what are you seeing is a cannes trick 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.390
 of 81 nothing more and nothing less than 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.040
 our player jesus who are those of 80 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.530
 ground which is one of the most active 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.569
 channel always contributing its games and 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.739
 tell you that also that you are not like that 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.530
 good players or you are good 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.050
 commentators with us do not know us 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.550
 we're doing pretty well with most of 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.410
 the subscribers of the channel so I do not 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.239
 you can add to skype and always 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.160
 we will talk with you 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.650
 add them to the play we will play with 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.989
 we already know, that is, although 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.290
 you are inside the clan then to do 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:14.480
 friends and that I think will state 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:16.630
 then it 's like a job you win if 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.730
 here simply because we had a good time and 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.100
 we try to make you laugh and 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.840
 have fun with our videos and 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.910
 I think we have commentators 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.430
 pretty good that is in all 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.010
 videos always gets into something in plan 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.540
 good vibes and good and that maybe 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.400
 also occasionally when you play 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.350
 make serious videos because we do them and 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.850
 when we bring a game we bring it 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.580
 because neither is think here that we are 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.640
 a plan that we went up w and you're seeing 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.080
 here that this is a gastritis 80 that does not 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.510
 it's no nonsense we do not upload anything 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.970
 less than double nuclear or a 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.760
 nuclear very fast or very fast or less 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.780
 double more we do not upload anything so either 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.950
 apart from good comment and such also 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.950
 we have very good games 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.360
 without anything that good that we are going to finish 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.670
 the game at the end and we always 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.080
 we are with things to comment say 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.780
 if you want to contact us 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.730
 then go through the channel and there already 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.819
 I guess in more information of the channel 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.260
 you will have our skype and how to contact 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.260
 with us or just put us 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.180
 some comment but yes please no no 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.639
 you put you I want to enter as a player and 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.169
 then have no love because to me 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.620
 the truth is that I do not know I do not like anything 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:30.470
 tell people that they do not and I do not know if it is 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.150
 uncomfortable but if you want to enter 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.310
 you can enter and if you see that you are not 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.070
 good players or whatever you can 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.130
 be with us playing and talking 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.979
 without problems as if you were one more and 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.710
 nothing to say is that it is already running out 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:47.720

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.450
