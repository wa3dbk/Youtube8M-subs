freestyle<00:02:16.470> but<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:17.000> looks<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.180> me<00:02:18.330> like<00:02:18.360> we're

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
freestyle but it looks to me like we're

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.990 
freestyle but it looks to me like we're
right<00:02:19.020> there<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.470> we've<00:02:19.650> got<00:02:19.830> guys<00:02:20.069> that<00:02:20.430> you

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319
