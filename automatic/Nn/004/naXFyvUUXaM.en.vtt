00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.010 
get wrapped around them and then they're
not<00:01:50.939> going<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.329> you'll<00:01:51.450> have<00:01:51.479> little<00:01:51.720> white

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
paper and just pour it in like a choux

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.190 
paper and just pour it in like a choux
and<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:02.970> about<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.240> time<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.110> I'm

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
batter starts getting very thick and

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.350 
batter starts getting very thick and

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.050 
first at about 350 degrees for about 10
minutes<00:02:31.800> because<00:02:32.130> what<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:32.400> does<00:02:32.580> is<00:02:33.030> help

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
minutes because what that does is help

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.150

draw out the flavor of the walnuts and
it<00:02:35.580> also<00:02:35.819> helps<00:02:36.360> dry<00:02:36.630> them<00:02:36.870> out<00:02:36.989> so<00:02:37.230> they<00:02:37.350> won't

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
it also helps dry them out so they won't

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.490 
it also helps dry them out so they won't
be<00:02:37.680> soggy<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.370> then<00:02:39.239> I've<00:02:39.420> also<00:02:39.660> diced<00:02:40.200> up

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.220 
you can see that this is quite a thick
batter<00:02:54.180> but<00:02:54.599> that's<00:02:54.750> going<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.019> make<00:02:55.200> a

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
batter but that's going to make a

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.059 
batter but that's going to make a
delicious<00:02:55.560> kind<00:02:56.069> of<00:02:56.250> fudgy<00:02:56.819> chewy<00:02:57.720> cake<00:02:58.230> so
