00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:08.790
 this video is for you playing in django 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:12.269
 and this is in my opinion the one of rolled anonas 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.630
 most shocking in the game today. 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.730
 I think in these last months andrÃ© 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.770
 noting that people who play 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.980
 hangu in the Brazilian service are the 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.760
 people who tend to play enough without 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.500
 willingness is quite unmotivated because 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.449
 when you play hangu 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.579
 if you are an enamel people already tico 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.480
 bread if you give a gain that the project 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.840
 Guilt I was thinking why? 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:43.860
 said the holding company that has fewer people 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:47.370
 good in comparison to other holding companies 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.440
 I'm on the ground here, how competitive you are 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.070
 can you understand that the lord of the Brazilian 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.600
 it lacks a lot of good players and 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.789
 did not help 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:05.220
 This is what, in my opinion, 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.210
 django is ok from hangu good is the way 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.010
 he thinks 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.340
 I think what 's missing for a lot of people 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.220
 playing in django is not mechanical, it's not 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.580
 the way you sing is simply 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.580
 think 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.619
 people today seemingly 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.860
 they do not dislike an old custom 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.500
 I remember that my mother taught me 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.350
 which is the usual know how to listen 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.000
 talk is the custom of knowing if 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.890
 to communicate right then in django that is 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.590
 important and can lead to the thing of life 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.869
 To the inside of the game that same you already 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.250
 stopped to think that when you play 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.939
 from hangu 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.310
 if you listen to your team you can have 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.140
 better results such as 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.840
 when your media said you could 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.280
 win that champion who do not have a 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.930
 way to escape and it is without flash and 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.729
 of your team has to be to kill him 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.149
 You just went on the boat trying. 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.940
 to kill that she is no longer that Israel for 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.470
 God only knows what you did and 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.560
 know if you already make 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.200
 sometimes you heard your team cause 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.540
 you 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.250
 view a point of view 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.560
 better opportunity 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.380
 when you 're playing django do 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.510
 with which you make a better decision 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.920
 so it's a thing that a lot of people 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.650
 should start doing what is the 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.090
 main antidote is doing this 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.550
 video is trying to put in your little head 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.410
 Whatever that is you are. 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.770
 if you want to start playing forward 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.020
 that when very important things are 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.020
 that you listen to your team 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.760
 if the guy is talking anka here because the 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.800
 car does not have flash because it has 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.680
 idea is to listen to the ideas of 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.540
 others can open up new opportunities 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.510
 Just like you want me to have on 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.810
 dragon when you call you have to go 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.750
 besides the guy who can kill you can 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.490
 It's just Senna who's forced to follow 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.630
 everything the team says I do not think 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.300
 works like this 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:18.620
 but if you do not stop to think you 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:22.400
 can you just tighten tab see that only 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:28.130
 I hope she has to learn to analyze 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:30.260
 better the potential of the champion he has in 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.530
 your team the opponents champion you can 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.830
 for example seeing that neither you go 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.560
 start at the beginning of the game only 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.540
 attention than you can than your team 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.610
 has to offer when you go beyond it 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.280
 This is important for you to know if the guy 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.950
 can give a be can give a slow 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:53.750
 says the difference between django is that 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:59.080
 win to take the flash is to kill be 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:01.940
 The guy who wins to kill is I think 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:06.560
 What do you have to do by playing 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.519
 hangu is basically three points 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.910
 main 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:13.130
 you have to listen to your team you have 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.410
 to pass on information to him that 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.040
 where that guy the actor if you have 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.590
 It's seen you speak for yourself, the guy is going 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.410
 catch blues if the guy can get out of the law n 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.780
 this has to ask what level the 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.920
 guys can kill 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:33.940
 when you go beyond 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:37.610
 one of them I think the last point is 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.960
 you always stay calm independently 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.790
 the game was wrong 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.680
 sometimes you have to stay calm in the 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.840
 situations where the team begins to lose in the 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.720
 There you go, one day at night. 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.100
 light or 6 for example despite you 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.110
 most of the time there is a team 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.400
 Understanding I understand how 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:02.210
 you feel it once was water 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:05.180
 sometimes you have to stay focused 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.490
 so that even if your team loses the 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.400
 focus you can save his ass 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.620
 That's basically what you're up to. 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.850
 in the game, not only do people find 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:22.520
 that django and have to play for them 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:26.860
 So you're dedicating this video to analyzing the 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:29.390
 that the active champions can do 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.610
 accept opinions from your team for you 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.070
 have a point of view and who knows how to take 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:39.650
 a decision different from the one you would 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:41.360
 take and try to be a calmer guy 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.470
 guys in front usually give a lot 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.710
 hard 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:48.800
 them if you like the video leaves
