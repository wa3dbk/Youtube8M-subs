00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.839
 Hello today in the review of the Japanese thermos 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.730
 for and destroys the classic blue coloring 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.769
 by which they appeared in the Russian 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.799
 the market has become recognizable 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.220
 today this large corporation is releasing 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.400
 thermoses and thermal containers 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.520
 thermopots now we'll look at a thermos 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.539
 model 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.340
 principle interesting one and a half and liter 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.150
 different from their fellows the same 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.480
 volume value width of the neck is 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.930
 is as a definite plus possible 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.059
 some flaws will appear 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:43.079
 in terms of keeping them temperature 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.090
 but immediately it is the neck 7 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.930
 centimeters makes it possible to carry 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.520
 there is not only liquids stored and ice 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.620
 ice cream can principle soup 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:59.149
 use it to carry the soup in 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.289
 Generally it is said it will probably be 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.780
 optimal size ie soup 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.189
 wide-mouth thermos and they are even more 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.820
 comfortable but they keep little enough 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:13.200
 the temperature here is basically according to 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.540
 assurances the firm for the gun remains on 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.310
 level of standard classic thermos 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.110
 there with a 5-centimeter neck 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.479
 but also makes it possible to use it 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.350
 as for carrying ice cream soups yes 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:30.829
 so what are the nuances of the university and the gun 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.049
 always a teflon coating on the walls 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:36.090
 accordingly internal technologies 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:38.610
 relief is the thickness of the metal 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.570
 bulbs reduced thickness between walls 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.450
 body and bulb is also reduced in contrast 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.820
 from all the other manufacturers to this 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.040
 gives an increase in volume 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.829
 weight loss in principle, such 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.159
 set of one and a half kilograms and without 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:59.700
 content weighs a kilogram for 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.159
 like yourself standard locking system 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.149
 handles comfortable enough for toys 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:10.110
 and there is a carrying strap 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:14.069
 here is an extra cup wide 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.220
 cover and well, you can still offend the valve 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.950
 valve here like all models for 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.400
 the gun understands ie there is a lock 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.550
 which releases the insides of the valve 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.590
 they can be pulled out rinsed and cleaned 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.239
 so here I would say undoubtedly 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.950
 The advantage is the presence of such 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.140
 large buttons because in the cold 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.390
 I am the owner of several thermos 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.910
 animals all other models like 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.580
 rule they are the ones that I used not 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.470
 using such a sufficient falling in love 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.319
 a small button in the cold sometimes 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.450
 there fails pressing that fingers 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:52.590
 froze up looking in one here i look 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:56.549
 exactly need the thickness of a finger powerfully 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.440
 the valve opens that is working 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.230
 without failure, respectively 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.269
 thanks to this powerful valve 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.120
 rubber gasket its design 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.950
 teflon coating and technology in general 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.959
 which are overgrown sports for making 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.989
 Thermos this is probably today 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.620
 some of the best products among 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.019
 thermoses 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.239
 Well, according to the characteristics that you can 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.340
 answer is standard 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:25.590
 if within six hours 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.420
 temperature rise up to 3 4 degrees 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.989
 will be well, that is, we fill it with an example 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.380
 there water temperature of 4 degrees through 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:37.260
 six hours according to the manufacturer 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.910
 the temperature will increase to + 7 + 8 it's on 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.970
 in fact the numbers are fairly honest and 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.730
 just like cooling 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.609
 cooling down for six hours there until 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.120
 77 degrees 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:53.870
 composition of boiling water for a longer time 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.490
 lowers the temperature there to the standard 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.580
 55-60 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.500
 for eight ten hours but 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.140
 honestly this is the manufacturer's data 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.310
 ideal conditions room temperature 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.830
 but as a practitioner like using these thermos 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.950
 long enough and I can say that they 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:17.459
 do not lie sometimes even surpass thermos 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.050
 our expectations because at very 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.150
 low ambient temperature without 

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:25.380
 use of the cover in principle sometimes 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:28.070
 even as I leave it on the street saying 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.050
 ambient temperature is very low 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:34.410
 fluid within 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.430
 there one fishing 1 hunting persist 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.860
 hot very long well and accordingly 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.570
 of course as soon as we reduce the volume 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:47.340
 liquid in a thermos 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:49.230
 all these characteristics will fall then 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.690
 there is correspondingly everything 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.700
 given values both complete and 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.770
 other manufacturers worth noting 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.750
 they are for ideal room conditions 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.660
 temperature and fully filled 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.060
 thermos but I want to say that you have completed 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.650
 different from all the others that not when 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.040
 ideal which practical conditions 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:11.190
 they probably still show the most 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:14.310
 the best indicators that is nobody probably 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.860
 from producers on take off on 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.930
 today there are a lot of them 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.190
 results of practical application 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.190
 cannot reach
