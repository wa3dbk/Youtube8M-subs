00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
it's the same kind of thing because

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.480 
it's the same kind of thing because
after<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.660> while<00:00:16.070> obviously<00:00:17.070> way<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.250> pet<00:00:17.460> a

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490

what's<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.700> point

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
what's the point

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.300 
what's the point
understand<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.200> wreck<00:01:37.770> see<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:37.950> that's

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
understand you wreck see that that's

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.650 
understand you wreck see that that's
something<00:01:38.580> that's<00:01:38.640> very<00:01:38.760> crucial<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.480> I

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
something that's very crucial and I

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.900 
something that's very crucial and I
don't<00:01:39.830> agree<00:01:40.830> that<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.160> pre-production<00:01:41.520> goes

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
don't agree that the pre-production goes

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.730 
don't agree that the pre-production goes
into<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.270> set<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.570> want<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.900> come<00:01:43.080> off<00:01:43.260> you

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
into the set you want to come off you

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.140 
into the set you want to come off you
know<00:01:43.860> it's<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.100> watching<00:01:44.370> a<00:01:44.610> car<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.970> want

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
know it's like watching a car you want

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.310 
know it's like watching a car you want
to<00:01:45.210> make<00:01:45.330> sure<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.570> did<00:01:45.750> every<00:01:45.990> every

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
to make sure you did every every

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.560 
to make sure you did every every
pointment<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.130> present<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.640> as<00:01:47.820> such<00:01:48.330> I'm

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
pointment and present it as such I'm

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.810 
pointment and present it as such I'm
saying<00:01:49.080> that<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.620> can<00:01:49.770> still<00:01:50.040> do<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.250> and

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
saying that you can still do that and

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.520 
saying that you can still do that and
still<00:01:50.850> factor<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.480> little<00:01:51.720> bit<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.900> time<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.320> go

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
still factor a little bit of time to go

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.260 
still factor a little bit of time to go
off<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.950> track<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.310> little<00:01:53.460> bit<00:01:53.790> as<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.420> just

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270
