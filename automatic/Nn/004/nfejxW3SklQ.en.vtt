00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.909 

and<00:04:54.250> this<00:04:55.250> is<00:04:55.460> particularly<00:04:56.560> important<00:04:57.560> if

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
and this is particularly important if

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.939 
and this is particularly important if
you<00:04:58.280> have<00:04:58.600> more<00:04:59.600> than<00:04:59.780> one<00:05:00.020> dog<00:05:00.229> because<00:05:00.830> if

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
you have multiple dogs this is when it

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.230 
you have multiple dogs this is when it
becomes<00:05:03.470> really<00:05:03.710> easy<00:05:03.860> to<00:05:04.370> accidentally<00:05:04.970> save

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
becomes really easy to accidentally save

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.450 
becomes really easy to accidentally save
the<00:05:05.360> dog's<00:05:05.569> name<00:05:05.870> when<00:05:06.560> you<00:05:06.770> really<00:05:07.069> mean<00:05:07.250> oh
