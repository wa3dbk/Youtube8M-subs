real voices all kinds of stupid shit
that<00:03:44.880> they're<00:03:45.150> doing<00:03:45.330> and<00:03:45.660> they're<00:03:46.019> just

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
that they're doing and they're just

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.440 
that they're doing and they're just
doing<00:03:46.620> this<00:03:46.860> for<00:03:46.920> attention<00:03:47.190> they're<00:03:48.090> just

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
doing this for attention they're just

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.140 
doing this for attention they're just
trying<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.989> become<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.680> next<00:03:49.980> anonymous<00:03:50.910> and

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
trying to become the next anonymous and

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.600 
trying to become the next anonymous and
I've<00:03:51.630> seen<00:03:51.840> them<00:03:52.050> deny<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.739> they<00:03:53.100> don't<00:03:53.340> want

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
I've seen them deny that they don't want

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.490 
I've seen them deny that they don't want
recognition<00:03:54.000> or<00:03:54.570> anything<00:03:54.989> like<00:03:55.019> that<00:03:55.170> but

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
recognition or anything like that but

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.080 
recognition or anything like that but
that's<00:03:55.680> exactly<00:03:55.860> what<00:03:56.519> they're<00:03:56.670> doing<00:03:56.970> this

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
that's exactly what they're doing this

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.110 
that's exactly what they're doing this
for<00:03:57.360> there's<00:03:57.810> no<00:03:58.110> other<00:03:58.380> logical<00:03:59.120> explanation

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
for there's no other logical explanation

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.020 
for there's no other logical explanation
but<00:04:00.989> I<00:04:01.050> think<00:04:01.350> Sony<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:01.920> Microsoft<00:04:01.980> are<00:04:02.790> to

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
but I think Sony and Microsoft are to

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.390 
but I think Sony and Microsoft are to
blame<00:04:03.269> a<00:04:03.330> little<00:04:03.840> bit<00:04:03.989> here<00:04:04.350> I<00:04:04.500> think<00:04:05.190> they<00:04:05.340> do

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
blame a little bit here I think they do

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.550 
blame a little bit here I think they do
need<00:04:05.760> to<00:04:05.940> step<00:04:06.209> up<00:04:06.239> their<00:04:06.510> servers<00:04:07.019> but<00:04:07.530> I

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
need to step up their servers but I

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.590 
need to step up their servers but I
don't<00:04:07.830> know<00:04:07.950> how<00:04:08.100> they<00:04:08.250> do<00:04:08.310> that<00:04:08.640> without<00:04:09.090> just

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
don't know how they do that without just

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.509 
don't know how they do that without just
from<00:04:10.049> what<00:04:10.200> I<00:04:10.230> understand<00:04:10.830> all<00:04:11.100> they<00:04:11.310> need<00:04:11.489> to

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
from what I understand all they need to

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.030 
from what I understand all they need to
do<00:04:11.790> is<00:04:12.090> pour<00:04:12.390> a<00:04:12.420> ton<00:04:12.900> of<00:04:12.930> money<00:04:13.380> into<00:04:13.560> their

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
do is pour a ton of money into their

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.759 
do is pour a ton of money into their
servers<00:04:14.519> and<00:04:14.730> buy<00:04:15.239> a<00:04:15.269> ton<00:04:15.600> I<00:04:15.870> mean<00:04:16.049> a<00:04:16.080> lot<00:04:16.229> I

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
servers and buy a ton I mean a lot I

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.030 
servers and buy a ton I mean a lot I
don't<00:04:17.250> just<00:04:17.549> mean<00:04:17.790> a<00:04:18.030> few<00:04:18.660> million<00:04:18.959> so<00:04:19.739> I<00:04:19.769> don't

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
don't just mean a few million so I don't

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.590 
don't just mean a few million so I don't
know<00:04:20.160> what<00:04:20.370> this<00:04:20.489> means<00:04:20.729> for<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.180> future<00:04:21.209> of

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
know what this means for the future of

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.779 
know what this means for the future of
consoles<00:04:22.200> does<00:04:22.560> this<00:04:22.800> mean<00:04:23.070> that<00:04:23.100> all<00:04:23.610> these

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
consoles does this mean that all these

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.820 
consoles does this mean that all these
consoles<00:04:24.360> these<00:04:24.930> companies<00:04:25.440> that<00:04:25.650> are

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
consoles these companies that are

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.290 
consoles these companies that are
leaning<00:04:26.430> more<00:04:26.789> towards

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
leaning more towards

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.680 
leaning more towards
always<00:04:27.659> online<00:04:27.930> consoles<00:04:28.830> which<00:04:29.400> I<00:04:29.669> thought<00:04:30.419> a

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
always online consoles which I thought a

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.710 
always online consoles which I thought a
months<00:04:31.680> ago<00:04:31.919> I<00:04:31.949> thought<00:04:32.430> were<00:04:33.060> the<00:04:33.090> next

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
months ago I thought were the next

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.119 
months ago I thought were the next
consoles<00:04:34.229> I<00:04:34.409> thought<00:04:34.620> they<00:04:34.740> were<00:04:34.830> going<00:04:34.949> to<00:04:35.009> be

00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:35.129 
consoles I thought they were going to be

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:36.770 
consoles I thought they were going to be
always<00:04:35.340> online<00:04:35.699> and<00:04:36.120> I<00:04:36.150> thought<00:04:36.330> maybe<00:04:36.479> even

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
always online and I thought maybe even

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.770 
always online and I thought maybe even
streaming<00:04:37.319> only<00:04:37.710> in<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.550> future<00:04:38.909> but<00:04:39.629> now

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
streaming only in the future but now

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.960 
streaming only in the future but now
with<00:04:39.960> these<00:04:40.080> attacks<00:04:40.470> on<00:04:40.680> PSN<00:04:41.129> and<00:04:41.159> xbox<00:04:41.669> live

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
with these attacks on PSN and xbox live

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.879 
with these attacks on PSN and xbox live
it<00:04:42.210> makes<00:04:42.389> me<00:04:42.569> wonder<00:04:42.900> if<00:04:43.199> we're<00:04:43.680> going<00:04:43.800> to

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
it makes me wonder if we're going to

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.649 
it makes me wonder if we're going to
head<00:04:44.069> in<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.340> other<00:04:44.490> direction<00:04:44.789> offline

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:45.659 
head in the other direction offline

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:48.920 
head in the other direction offline
consoles<00:04:46.259> less<00:04:46.979> online<00:04:47.750> integration<00:04:48.750> with

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930
