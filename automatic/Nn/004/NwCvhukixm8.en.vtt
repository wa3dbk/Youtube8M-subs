00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.570
 hey people i am pascal i am the one 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.060
 hunter and we have new ones 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.630
 shirt for you and a nice one 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.400
 black with one behind and there 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.750
 I cut this normal shirts 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.060
 always a bit boring 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.380
 I like to do it tanktop ostrich and 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.390
 how he does that I show you 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.250
 now the basic one 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.530
 Of course, tank stop is very clear 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.290
 Sleeves must be very important 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.199
 that you have a sharp pair of scissors at hand 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.900
 I have a pair of scissors here now 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.220
 the hairdressing needs are really 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.260
 really sharp but you can of course 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.860
 also any other scissors 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.440
 use 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.170
 the main thing is that she's hot now 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.549
 really ans ans cut 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.670
 I once put the shirt in my direction 

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:58.949
 because I like to drive up here 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.330
 to cut and that from the simple 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.680
 Because I'm up here first 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.510
 we determine 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.880
 how wide should the sleeve ultimately be 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.220
 and I personally always 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.030
 I also leave the collar off with the collar 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.480
 first the distance is not too wide 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.620
 so be seen from the sky and 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.080
 I am still able to enter 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.210
 but I'll start that way 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.730
 about two inches from the sleeves 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.000
 I start to cut and then stop 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.409
 I always nice along the seam 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.090
 down here 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.800
 and of course you can vary how 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.970
 far you want to come down below me 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.680
 always do switzerland a bit 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.570
 more airy and then comes quite far here 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.490
 It is important that it is important 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.780
 a straight cut and that's why 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.420
 Of course he also needs the sharp ones 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.990
 scissors so I'll just start now 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.990
 up here 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.770
 Of course, then I can say that too 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.020
 that it is always of benefit if you 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.240
 Somebody helps because if the material 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.560
 it is curious then 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.690
 that means better cut if now 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.790
 someone on the opposite side of the fabric 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.460
 pulling something tight would be that 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.080
 whole even a bit easier though 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.090
 that works thanks to the sharp 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.090
 Shear here quite well 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:16.260
 just always hard at night 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.659
 along the distance soldier also has to 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.420
 do not stay the same all the time 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.330
 down there 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.140
 he'll definitely get bigger that way 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.130
 I'll probably also later 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.840
 have to adjust 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.090
 if you have the distance down 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.590
 namely not getting wet then 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.440
 Afterwards she leaves as if she had hers 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.000
 balloon tanktop because that is then 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.700
 here at the side out and that 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.380
 then not so nice except we here 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.030
 we see we have a nice straight 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.830
 line here my little little one 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.110
 carver in it 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.430
 but that one no longer sees has 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.860
 ever worked quite well with the 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.930
 a sleeve and we could do that 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.450
 Of course, everything from now to measure 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.310
 to look that we are parallel 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.230
 hinbekommen but there is also the 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.519
 trick we just fold the shirt here 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:05.000
 pretty central to reprimand and lay 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:07.700
 up here the collar and then see 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.500
 we where we on the other side along 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.650
 then we do not have to cut 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.739
 Great what to measure but have there 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:20.290
 our orientation and yes there is cutting 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.290
 we just go along 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.730
 we see that sees itself very 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.190
 evenly 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.080
 in the straight I always do it that way 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.790
 I'll pick a spot first 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.659
 usually in the middle of the can wear 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.430
 but you also choose any right 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:44.390
 close to the suture because there you have to 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.519
 do not cut away too much 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.330
 when I'm at your art I have 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.890
 already 2 cm away and then 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.720
 I stick with the sharon tip there 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:58.519
 of course if you have one 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:00.319
 a pair of sharp scissors has a hole in it 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.909
 Empire I am starting to cut now 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.010
 if you do not have sharp punches 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:07.069
 just use some knife 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.379
 so that you still have main thing you come 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.720
 then pure 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:15.489
 I do not do anything else now 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.489
 as cutting along the seam 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:24.360
 this place i turn the shirt on 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:30.620
 so that nato is already visible and 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.620
 I can keep the same distance 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.160
 turn later 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:46.780
 no witchcraft, we do that 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.640
 tanktop freed from the collar 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.730
 I just have the shirt now 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.910
 attracted to you the result on 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.190
 display 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.990
 I personally like it one more time 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.430
 a little breezy I would then the 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.800
 still a little further to here 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.850
 cut down and up here 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.830
 cutout a little bit 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.350
 make it bigger simply because it likes 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.430
 likes airy 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.350
 and yes that could be self 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.730
 decide how he does it and me 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.220
 I wish you a lot of fun in any case 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.690
 try it and if he has this 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.970
 shirt if you like this city 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.970
 could order it here in the shop
