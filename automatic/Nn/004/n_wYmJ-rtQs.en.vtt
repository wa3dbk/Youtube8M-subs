00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:06.100
 ah 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.100
 good 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.080
 once we have finished our work 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.309
 we have closed all the points we 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.099
 remain 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.689
 strands the strand with which we have mounted 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:23.550
 the points the final strand and strands that 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.279
 we have used for example to join 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.890
 two balls all these strands have 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.560
 that disappear and can not be cut 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.130
 directly since we would be weighed 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.370
 the work 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.170
 then we are going to finish them always 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.170
 they finish by the reverse of the labor 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:48.070
 to top off we use the sewing needle 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.070
 We woo the wool 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:55.600
 we have to find a path for the 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.600
 what to put the thread 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.289
 we raise 4 or 5 points 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.570
 and we went down the path next door 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.490
 this work is already considered to be 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.060
 finished the rest that we have what 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.360
 we can cut 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:29.350
 we repeat 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:32.520
 we have to finish the thread the bramos 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.520
 with the sewing needle 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.640
 we choose 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.510
 a little road 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:45.180
 of the points and upload the thread 45 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.180
 points 2 3 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.350
 Four. Five 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:59.770
 and we go down the path next to it 1 2 3 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.770
 Four. Five 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.290
 We consider that the thread is already 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.979
 topped and so we can cut the 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.979
 remainder of strand
