00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.140 
low E string here your low sixth string
that<00:01:47.470> means<00:01:47.650> do<00:01:47.770> not<00:01:47.920> play<00:01:48.190> that<00:01:48.490> note<00:01:48.790> here's

what<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.480> a7<00:01:50.140> chord<00:01:50.380> will<00:01:50.590> sound<00:01:50.800> like<00:01:51.660> and<00:01:52.660> if

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
what the a7 chord will sound like and if

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.310 
what the a7 chord will sound like and if
I<00:01:52.900> articulate<00:01:53.500> one<00:01:53.770> note<00:01:54.010> at<00:01:54.160> a<00:01:54.250> time

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.670 

so<00:01:57.040> one<00:01:57.190> more<00:01:57.370> time<00:01:57.550> I<00:01:57.760> have<00:01:57.880> a<00:01:58.180> minor<00:01:58.420> and<00:01:59.410> a

on<00:03:09.890> a<00:03:09.920> seventh<00:03:10.640> this<00:03:10.910> one<00:03:11.090> will<00:03:11.209> be<00:03:11.300> a<00:03:11.330> little

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
on a seventh this one will be a little

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.500 
on a seventh this one will be a little
bit<00:03:11.810> trickier<00:03:12.349> and<00:03:12.530> again<00:03:12.950> if<00:03:13.190> 72<00:03:13.880> is<00:03:14.030> too<00:03:14.209> fast

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
bit trickier and again if 72 is too fast

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.870 
bit trickier and again if 72 is too fast
for<00:03:14.900> you<00:03:15.019> slow<00:03:15.709> that<00:03:15.920> tempo<00:03:16.310> down<00:03:16.489> you're

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
for you slow that tempo down you're

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.870 
for you slow that tempo down you're
working<00:03:17.420> up<00:03:17.660> to<00:03:17.989> 72<00:03:18.650> beats<00:03:18.890> per<00:03:19.130> minute<00:03:19.430> here's

working up to 72 beats per minute here's

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.390 
working up to 72 beats per minute here's
what<00:03:20.090> letter<00:03:20.269> B<00:03:20.480> will<00:03:20.720> sound<00:03:20.959> like<00:03:21.140> one<00:03:21.769> two

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
what letter B will sound like one two

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:37.640 
this is an a minor pentatonic scale it's

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.340 
this is an a minor pentatonic scale it's
played<00:06:37.940> on<00:06:37.970> the<00:06:38.240> fifth<00:06:38.480> fret<00:06:38.690> or<00:06:39.050> fifth

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:39.350 
played on the fifth fret or fifth

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.170 
played on the fifth fret or fifth
position<00:06:39.980> and<00:06:40.250> I'm<00:06:40.640> going<00:06:40.670> to<00:06:40.820> run<00:06:40.970> through

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.180 
position and I'm going to run through

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.550 
position and I'm going to run through
that<00:06:41.330> scale<00:06:41.690> for<00:06:42.020> you<00:06:42.110> right<00:06:42.320> now

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 
that scale for you right now

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:53.570 
that scale for you right now
it'll<00:06:43.130> look<00:06:43.220> and<00:06:43.400> sound<00:06:43.580> like<00:06:43.730> this

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.279 

so<00:06:54.580> reads<00:06:54.849> pretty<00:06:55.119> much<00:06:55.240> the<00:06:55.419> same<00:06:55.629> as<00:06:55.930> a<00:06:55.960> chord

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:56.289 
so reads pretty much the same as a chord

00:06:56.289 --> 00:06:58.589 
so reads pretty much the same as a chord
diagram<00:06:56.740> except<00:06:57.129> in<00:06:57.219> a<00:06:57.279> scale<00:06:57.639> diagram<00:06:58.210> you're

00:06:58.589 --> 00:06:58.599 
diagram except in a scale diagram you're

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:00.089 
diagram except in a scale diagram you're
going<00:06:58.719> to<00:06:58.779> be<00:06:58.869> playing<00:06:59.080> just<00:06:59.199> one<00:06:59.409> note<00:06:59.800> at<00:07:00.009> a

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:00.099 
going to be playing just one note at a

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:02.129 
going to be playing just one note at a
time<00:07:00.309> so<00:07:00.849> you've<00:07:00.969> got<00:07:01.119> a<00:07:01.149> CD<00:07:01.449> track<00:07:01.809> for<00:07:02.110> that

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:02.139 
time so you've got a CD track for that

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:04.200 
time so you've got a CD track for that
too<00:07:02.559> so<00:07:03.249> I<00:07:03.279> think<00:07:03.430> you<00:07:03.759> have<00:07:03.939> enough
