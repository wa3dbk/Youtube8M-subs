00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 welcome to this tutorial because 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.820
 they were nintendods on at home 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.290
 simply using the wifi is a 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.780
 mac computer in this case if not if 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.830
 you are a Windows or Linux user 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.240
 uncontrolled 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.810
 the other two videos I made 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.359
 respectively for linux and windows su 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.910
 sx ie they have created this script that 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.480
 It named riley mycomm there that 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:37.260
 automatically between twenty or thirty 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:41.059
 mac address for allowing you to 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.590
 been passes then you download from kitab 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.480
 I'll put the link to download it in 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.420
 comments 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.520
 and you can download it in two ways 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.989
 desktop cloning or downloads is well 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.699
 different 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.100
 once you have downloaded it already 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:01.460
 downloaded here on the desktop unzip 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:05.489
 the archive and unpacking the archive 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.760
 you have the license and rhythms and rhythms ce 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.460
 he explained how it works as you can 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.400
 easily read online also 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.150
 New Thing Needful 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.110
 the installation for o sx 10 8 and 10 9 in 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:27.150
 In this case I will install 10 9 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:31.619
 mavericks and you can move and script 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.049
 wherever you want in the computer and 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.579
 simplicity I will move it to the folder 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:41.340
 with once done that we say 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:45.450
 that is, it configures only one step to do 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.920
 so before starting I put it 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.759
 in the folder with why the terminal 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.780
 automatically as a default sign 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.740
 he takes the home folder so he had 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.740
 made a ch mod 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.460
 d 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.569
 once made the Czech way she my mom 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:27.750
 It is ready to be used as missing 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:31.430
 configure the wifi connection for 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.290
 do it you need another 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.510
 connection that is or via ethernet cable 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:41.519
 or via USB via a stylus 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.970
 or tips or tethering with 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:47.849
 phone because the network card ie 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.099
 the wireless card will be used as 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.430
 router to practically connect the 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:56.430
 nintendo ds so let's go to preferences 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.440
 system sharing on his 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.950
 internet sharing will appear this 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.170
 screen and you will have to share it 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.730
 connection from here you can choose from 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.739
 where to share it 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.380
 if from a telephone if from an ethernet cable 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:14.610
 if you know better about bluetooth than a 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.819
 you and then computers that use wifi 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.230
 then it will share the connection 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.660
 ethernet 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.690
 in my case to the network card 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.950
 wireless so I can connect 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.780
 with nintendo 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.060
 once you have configured this 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.799
 go on wifi options 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.980
 make sure you put it as the name 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:37.319
 a tt wifi channel number 11 safely 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.500
 no channel you can actually do 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.930
 put what it's worth once it's done ok 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.230
 click on the check check box here 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:50.340
 notice that we are safe to leave e 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.470
 will change the wifi icon in this and with 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.329
 china with a little arrow up 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.569
 how do you make internet sharing 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.730
 activates the name of the network the channel e 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:03.540
 we're OK 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:06.840
 ok so we are for effects with the network 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:11.959
 now back to our terminal e 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.959
 we can start you but to do it 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:22.049
 enough that in summer lele but with dot 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.270
 force flash her but and later 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.060
 you can either leave it like this and do one 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.380
 fast version then choose 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.430
 only five mac addresses 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:38.160
 defaults 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:40.680
 if instead you want to make a random choice 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.040
 among all the three available addresses 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:47.040
 you must enter full once entered 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.960
 full and what or if you don't want 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.330
 to do it was simply lehmann press 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.020
 enter enter the password of 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.020
 administrator 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:00.780
 once the password is entered 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.510
 the script will go on and do five 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.760
 steps from ninety seconds with 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.850
 Mac addresses chosen at random from me 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.160
 forgotten before starting the 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.270
 process but not exactly necessary 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:18.419
 water lete teleintendo 3ds or two of them 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:21.150
 al to your at your tt wifi network 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:25.110
 so you will immediately put all the streets 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:27.330
 usually pass with a simple with a 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.479
 full you can fill all ten 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:33.900
 streetpass slots at once depending 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:38.849
 since there are so many pisons, many apologize 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:40.530
 mac dancers are around 30 to 20 if you do 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:44.690
 in one day you will be able to 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:48.870
 collect about 40 40 street pass 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:50.820
 more or less then once you have 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.190
 we say them out streetpass 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.080
 since they are newspapers and daily 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:59.210
 you have to wait for the next day 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.210
 to be able to repeat the process 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:09.030
 and if you want to abort the process against 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:12.090
 c and the terminal will return to another 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:15.650
 so if you want to put it from another 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:19.710
 part the script or you are not practical 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:26.280
 of the terminal or scares me you can 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:31.230
 just go where you have it 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:33.690
 script and drag it to the desktop down 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:36.750
 in the desktop in the terminal and make it go 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:40.050
 then if you want to add it was less not 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:43.230
 import standard mode activated e 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:46.740
 start cycling ta ta ta ta until 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:49.290
 you have not finished here in this way you can 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.820
 avoid writing everything by hand or the 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:55.220
 most human things too 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.220
 looking for bikes works great if you do it 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:05.300
 so then this is everything for this video 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:08.610
 I hope we can help 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:12.000
 receive streetpass and in case you live 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:14.640
 inhabited in a non-metropolitan area in 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:20.490
 which is difficult to meet other people 

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:24.570
 with the street pass and in the comments 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:26.700
 you will find the link to download it and to 

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.170
 end of video links to others 

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:32.160
 two videos to do the same 

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:34.640
 process on linux and on windows thanks e 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.640
 have fun
