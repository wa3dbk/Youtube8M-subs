New York but not mandatory do you think

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.040 
New York but not mandatory do you think
that<00:00:56.489> helmet<00:00:56.820> should<00:00:57.030> be<00:00:57.149> mandatory<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.840> New

that helmet should be mandatory in New

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.439 
that helmet should be mandatory in New
York<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.559> think<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.399> should<00:00:59.760> because

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
York I think that this should because

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.419 
York I think that this should because
with<00:01:01.079> all<00:01:01.260> these<00:01:01.410> all<00:01:01.620> these<00:01:01.829> cars<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 
with all these all these cars and the

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:03.950 
with all these all these cars and the
traffic<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.059> cab<00:01:03.269> is<00:01:03.510> weaving<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.870> and

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.690 
traffic and the cab is weaving in and
out<00:01:04.050> I<00:01:04.110> think<00:01:04.230> it's<00:01:04.470> much<00:01:04.650> safer<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.400> would

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
out I think it's much safer I would

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.429 
out I think it's much safer I would
definitely<00:01:06.150> say<00:01:06.390> yes<00:01:06.509> it's<00:01:07.049> really<00:01:07.170> up<00:01:07.409> to

what you do what you want do you think

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.560 
what you do what you want do you think

bike helmets should be mandatory I no I
do<00:01:15.689> not<00:01:16.220> why<00:01:17.220> not<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.700> think<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:18.570> question<00:01:18.900> a

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
do not why not I think it's question a

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.200 
do not why not I think it's question a
personal<00:01:19.350> responsibility<00:01:20.130> people<00:01:20.729> do<00:01:21.060> not

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
personal responsibility people do not

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.600 
personal responsibility people do not
want<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.689> take<00:01:22.049> precaution<00:01:22.650> they<00:01:22.860> should<00:01:23.070> not

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
want to take precaution they should not

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.880 
want to take precaution they should not
be<00:01:24.540> obliged<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.380> then<00:01:25.500> take<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
be obliged to and then take the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.350 
be obliged to and then take the
consequences<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.579> think<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.119> should<00:01:27.270> be

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
consequences I think that it should be

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.420 
consequences I think that it should be
mandatory<00:01:27.479> for<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> select<00:01:28.650> age<00:01:28.829> group<00:01:29.159> and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
mandatory for a select age group and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.069 
mandatory for a select age group and
then<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:29.939> be<00:01:30.060> optional<00:01:30.540> do<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.810> think<00:01:31.020> it

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
then it can be optional do you think it

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.480 
then it can be optional do you think it
should<00:01:31.200> be<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.380> riders<00:01:31.619> choice<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.280> think

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
should be the riders choice so you think

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.389 
should be the riders choice so you think
it<00:01:32.579> should<00:01:32.790> should<00:01:33.149> be<00:01:33.240> up<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.630> city<00:01:33.810> I

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
it should should be up to the city I

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.850 
it should should be up to the city I
mean<00:01:35.399> Amy<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.180> hard<00:01:36.420> right<00:01:36.630> like<00:01:36.899> my<00:01:37.049> ex<00:01:37.259> got<00:01:37.619> in

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
mean Amy is hard right like my ex got in

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.649 
mean Amy is hard right like my ex got in
a<00:01:37.950> bike<00:01:38.159> accident<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.850> he<00:01:39.210> didn't<00:01:39.479> have<00:01:39.570> to

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
a bike accident and he didn't have to

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.539 
a bike accident and he didn't have to
pay<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> dime<00:01:40.020> but<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.560> guy<00:01:40.680> who<00:01:40.740> hit<00:01:41.130> him<00:01:41.369> did

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
pay a dime but the guy who hit him did

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.459 
pay a dime but the guy who hit him did
even<00:01:41.790> though<00:01:41.820> he<00:01:42.060> was<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.240> one<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.750> was

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
even though he was the one that was

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.469 
even though he was the one that was
inappropriately<00:01:44.369> biking<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.119> all<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.329> that

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
inappropriately biking and all of that

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.420 
inappropriately biking and all of that
so<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.689> think<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:46.140> it's<00:01:46.740> kind<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.040> chicken<00:01:47.310> and

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
so I think that it's kind of chicken and

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.219 
so I think that it's kind of chicken and
egg<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:47.820> an<00:01:47.939> insurance<00:01:48.329> thing<00:01:48.630> it's<00:01:48.930> as

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
egg it's like an insurance thing it's as

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.660 
egg it's like an insurance thing it's as
well<00:01:49.380> as<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.710> like<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> governmental<00:01:50.490> thing

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
well as it is like a governmental thing

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.100 
well as it is like a governmental thing
it's<00:01:50.820> not<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.090> simple<00:01:51.270> would<00:01:51.689> having<00:01:51.899> to

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
it's not that simple would having to

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.639 
it's not that simple would having to
wear<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.320> helmet<00:01:52.729> discourage<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.880> from<00:01:53.909> riding

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
wear a helmet discourage you from riding

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.020 
wear a helmet discourage you from riding
absolutely<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:56.040> would<00:01:56.219> depending<00:01:56.670> on<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.850> day

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
absolutely it would depending on the day

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.580 
absolutely it would depending on the day
and<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.390> weather<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.840> definitely<00:01:58.229> would<00:01:58.380> I

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
and the weather it definitely would I

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.840 
and the weather it definitely would I
don't<00:01:58.890> think<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.070> would<00:01:59.189> discourage<00:01:59.430> me<00:01:59.820> I

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
don't think it would discourage me I

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.789 
don't think it would discourage me I
would<00:02:00.030> be<00:02:00.180> happy<00:02:00.210> it's<00:02:00.899> kind<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.140> looks<00:02:01.469> weird

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
would be happy it's kind of looks weird

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.010 
would be happy it's kind of looks weird
but<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.640> wouldn't<00:02:02.850> like<00:02:02.969> not<00:02:03.180> ride<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> bike<00:02:03.719> just

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
but I wouldn't like not ride a bike just

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.679 
but I wouldn't like not ride a bike just
because<00:02:04.289> of<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.530> maybe<00:02:04.979> just<00:02:05.850> because<00:02:06.600> I

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
because of it maybe just because I

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.710 
because of it maybe just because I
didn't<00:02:06.899> like<00:02:06.990> them

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
choice or do you think it should be up

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.050 
choice or do you think it should be up
to<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:17.980> government<00:03:18.100> to<00:03:18.489> be<00:03:18.580> able<00:03:18.670> to<00:03:18.790> impose
