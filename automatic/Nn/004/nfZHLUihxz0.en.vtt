 500 meters to run for that a baby 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.160
 all happy to make the difference and 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.630
 who broke off now very 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.610
 clearly the canary match that could not 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.770
 react Chaldean August, which comes 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.600
 withdrawal with always no baby that a 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.940
 very clear advantage to exit the tournament

 qatari match that wrestles with a material 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.240

 to finish the rope struggling with 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.860
 that she arrives with a last round is 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.640
 long and kate 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.860
 d 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.670
 but the latter no baby who wins the 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.709
 Criterium of young people 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.360
 what crisis may be second in front 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.890

 fault the claws that is just a little 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.800
 at the passage of the post but first 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.990
 victory in this critérium already riton 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.760
 jean michel bazire who had never 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.620
 one of the few ordeals that was missing from 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.940
 his winners 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.410
 it took a long time but he 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.400
 will have done it he did it in the manner of 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.770
 strong we thought he was going to run 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.400
 hidden and they carry it with great 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.200
 authority 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.700
 he made the difference is sitting on 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.150
 tracks he had taken the lead and 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.620
 no one could have pure joy one must 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.030
 leaving is a bit of a shame we have to 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.590
 to leave very quickly at the tension does not show 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.739
 2.8 second when we must and that small 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.290
 precision to return if what remains 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.500
 so finally be careful because but 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.260
 May 7 to disqualify again think 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.450
 that risk is not enough to 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.410
 Nothing 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.600
 that is to say in this sense it will be necessary to see 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.450
 it's on the pole arrived until 1 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.760
 3 7 8 5 6 1 and probably an investigation 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.140
 on qualifying errors we review in 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.120
 fate of the finals and jean michel 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.500
 bazire did not hesitate to accelerate to 500 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.060
 goal meters he took the powder 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.070
 escampette and well took him 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.360
 since an offbeat look rio that hears 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.950
 that he narrates course in the back of 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.040
 image firecrackers and for all he has 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.040
 said 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.390
 he told us you want 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.090
 to party 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:48.580
 it's not necessarily his cup of tea 

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:49.729
 senart who can not finish and his 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.870
 qualities 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:52.720
 cliff who are starting to get tired at 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.550
 tic horses so that 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.470
 as the favorite grandissimo who made 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.120
 the fault a lot of horses seemed 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.530
 a little tired in this criterium of 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.030
 young people but it will not take the 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.830
 winner is that no baby this son of 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.750
 enter gd led by jean michel blazy 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.340
 so that will be his first cry the finish 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.600
 all provisional and I believe at the moment 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.600
 same as it does about
