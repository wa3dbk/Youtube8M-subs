00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
these I think it's an amazing name but

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.440 
these I think it's an amazing name but
it's<00:04:33.080> this<00:04:33.200> amazing<00:04:33.740> teal<00:04:34.430> color<00:04:34.760> but<00:04:35.210> when<00:04:35.420> i

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
it's this amazing teal color but when i

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.230 
it's this amazing teal color but when i
swatched<00:04:35.930> it<00:04:36.290> i<00:04:36.610> really<00:04:37.610> cannot<00:04:37.910> tell<00:04:38.090> if
