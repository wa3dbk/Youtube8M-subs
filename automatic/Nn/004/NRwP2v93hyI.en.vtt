00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.330
 before I am vania and today 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.950
 a tremendous heat so today I'm going to 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.200
 teach how to make a cold cake 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.810
 I hope you like cookies and we are going to 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:29.519
 start the only thing we're going to need 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.180
 it's a can of condensed milk 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.000
 can of evaporated milk 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.660
 peaches in syrup 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.140
 the juice of four to lemons 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:46.290
 cookies of this type and a container 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.170
 to place our cake of what kind 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.270
 are the cookies 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.030
 as well 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:01:01.030
 they are sweet salty cookies like they are 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:01.030
 sweet cookies well as well as what 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.830
 The first thing you're going to do is going to do 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.830
 with the calculated consulted 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:19.200
 in the equator is going to be done 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.200
 place the evaporated milk also 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.070
 and ready 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.490
 and will liquefy it 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.570
 will continue to add the juice of 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.360
 four lemons little by little 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:44.870
 and you will keep stirring until the 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.870
 mixture becomes a little wait 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.490
 something like that 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:00.050
 and the next thing you're going to do is 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.050
 take your cookies of this type 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:06.500
 those and you're going to place them at the bottom of 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.500
 your frets 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.420
 eating half affirmation 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:30.990
 discovered in the diet is not going to be 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.380
 pour your mixture at the base of your 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.380
 cookies 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.240
 and we are going to replace other layers 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.240
 of cookies 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.540
 not for 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.709
 between layer and layer of cookies you can go 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.290
 placing the peach squared in 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:02.209
 slices to the next you check 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.209
 shut up ingredients 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:09.980
 and keep putting in front 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.980

 once I 'm ready our 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.880

 we can cut it with a knife or with 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.180
 something 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.480
