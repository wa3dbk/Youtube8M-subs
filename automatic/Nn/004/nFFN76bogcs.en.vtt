00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
know if that's going to be the whole the

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.600 
know if that's going to be the whole the
whole<00:04:30.050> like<00:04:30.470> conflict<00:04:31.010> is<00:04:31.280> probably<00:04:31.520> not

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
whole like conflict is probably not

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.270 
whole like conflict is probably not
gonna<00:04:31.730> be<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:31.940> whole<00:04:32.060> conflict<00:04:32.570> because<00:04:32.870> i

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.620 
be like the main bad guys have seen him
a<00:04:51.919> season<00:04:51.950> 5<00:04:52.400> and<00:04:52.430> they<00:04:52.730> got<00:04:52.880> killed<00:04:53.150> often

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
a season 5 and they got killed often

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.170 
a season 5 and they got killed often
like<00:04:53.780> the<00:04:53.870> first<00:04:54.110> few<00:04:54.260> episodes<00:04:54.490> so<00:04:55.490> i

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
like the first few episodes so i

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.810 
like the first few episodes so i
wouldn't<00:04:57.110> take<00:04:57.320> this<00:04:57.710> like<00:04:58.100> the<00:04:58.250> trailer<00:04:58.640> as<00:04:58.790> a

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
wouldn't take this like the trailer as a

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.670 
wouldn't take this like the trailer as a
huge<00:04:59.300> indicator<00:04:59.660> of<00:04:59.930> what's<00:05:00.260> actually<00:05:00.380> going

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
huge indicator of what's actually going

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.159 
huge indicator of what's actually going
to<00:05:00.740> happen<00:05:00.800> throughout<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:01.640> whole<00:05:02.030> season<00:05:02.360> 6

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
to happen throughout the whole season 6

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.260 
to happen throughout the whole season 6
but<00:05:04.419> it<00:05:05.419> does<00:05:05.750> look<00:05:05.780> pretty<00:05:06.260> hyped<00:05:06.560> and

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
but it does look pretty hyped and

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.310 
but it does look pretty hyped and
general<00:05:08.270> doesn't<00:05:08.510> seem<00:05:08.810> to<00:05:08.930> be<00:05:09.020> in<00:05:09.110> a<00:05:09.169> very

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
general doesn't seem to be in a very

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.750 
general doesn't seem to be in a very
good<00:05:09.410> situation<00:05:09.710> there<00:05:10.160> at<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.340> end<00:05:10.490> but<00:05:10.820> i

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
good situation there at the end but i

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.650 
good situation there at the end but i
think<00:05:13.760> it<00:05:13.820> was<00:05:13.910> as<00:05:14.030> though<00:05:14.060> yeah<00:05:14.390> the<00:05:14.510> last

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
think it was as though yeah the last

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.480 
think it was as though yeah the last
episode<00:05:15.080> of<00:05:15.110> season<00:05:15.260> 5<00:05:15.590> like<00:05:15.860> he<00:05:16.160> didn't<00:05:16.400> look

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
episode of season 5 like he didn't look

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
episode of season 5 like he didn't look
like<00:05:16.550> he<00:05:16.669> was<00:05:16.760> gonna<00:05:16.940> make<00:05:17.150> it<00:05:17.270> out<00:05:17.390> of<00:05:17.419> that

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
like he was gonna make it out of that

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.820 
like he was gonna make it out of that
one<00:05:17.690> either<00:05:17.840> but<00:05:18.050> he<00:05:18.140> made<00:05:18.260> it<00:05:18.290> out<00:05:18.410> just<00:05:18.590> fine

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
one either but he made it out just fine

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.250 
one either but he made it out just fine
so<00:05:19.400> I<00:05:19.820> mean<00:05:20.240> people<00:05:20.480> need<00:05:20.660> to<00:05:20.690> stop<00:05:20.930> under

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
so I mean people need to stop under

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.900 
so I mean people need to stop under
estimating<00:05:21.800> Daryl<00:05:22.100> he's<00:05:22.280> a<00:05:22.310> fucking<00:05:22.730> badass

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
estimating Daryl he's a fucking badass

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.550 
estimating Daryl he's a fucking badass
so<00:05:23.660> I<00:05:23.690> don't<00:05:23.900> think<00:05:24.050> he's<00:05:24.169> gonna<00:05:24.229> die<00:05:24.500> or

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
so I don't think he's gonna die or

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.340 
so I don't think he's gonna die or
