00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.730
 from leaving all the glow of the 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.730
 new white 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.600
 says that its bleaching molecules 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:14.340
 they radiate whiteness and radiate color 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:18.300
 radiate the new whiteness of 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.720
 detergent and detergent and the new one 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.720
 whiteness 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:33.010
 when you remove remove 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.350
 with cheese with jam serranas el 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:39.420
 name of the name cookies is so 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.420
 curious for some salt cookies 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.159
 double sheet 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.659
 ah 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.719
 is move 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.789
 leo is a variety of color 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:28.329
 I read designs that give freedom of 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:28.329
 movement 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.970
 for men 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.970
 the former president misael pastrana borrero 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.280
 who endured with courage and courage without 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.980
 even this dramatic episode spoke to 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.770
 term I always kept hope 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:59.359
 I knew there are Persians 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.979
 and the last term justice triumphs 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:05.390
 and especially when justice is in 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:08.630
 lathe of a cause of a just man 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.920
 but logically the emotion that 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.920
 he experienced is immense 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.090
 forms difficult to express and to make 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:20.950
 reach people who know that in the 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.819
 hidden feelings have the 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:29.139
 very complex expressions to be able 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:32.019
 express yourself in such a way that the family 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:35.480
 all the only thing you can in these 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:37.959
 moments is what is always invoked 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.360
 who we have in a series of 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.690
 values ​​and also 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.140
 in a series of beliefs and that is in 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.460
 reality everything is the work of providence 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.020
 my president you imagine 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.060
 before he had so much charisma that 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.890
 plebiscite was going to be so immense even 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.920
 international with messages from the pope and 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.510
 things of that style is not that in 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.950
 reality has been such a thing 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.780
 surprising that I think that 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.850
 hardly 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.010
 in recent times at least 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.250
 the country's life the country has 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.490
 banded with so much emotion so much 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:16.920
 affection and at the same time so much hope 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:19.540
 around a fact and a person 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.810
 and that is precisely what it is 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.970
 constitutes in turn a lesson of 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.530
 that there is that vital sap of the country that the 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.720
 solidarity 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.390
 Colombia against what is often 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.510
 says that it is a country scattered in its 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.760
 feeling and found 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.939
 in sos 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.860
 in their beliefs and their principles in 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:44.800
 the moment of truth gathers 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.890
 and it is the lesson that we all trust that 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.110
 let's take this out and that is that the country 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.910
 congregate looking for a unit 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:57.520
 purpose of expectations ambitions 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:00.310
 of goals but of course as I said 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.210
 we are today also in about 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.210
 feelings 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.630
 you really think that a few 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.270
 kilometer 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.760
 this fact that has brought so much relief 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.710
 not only to my home but to the home of 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.530
 all Colombians 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:21.049
 if he had presented him 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:23.520
 the cruel murder of Carlos Mauro holes 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:27.240
 he was a man of deep convictions 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.910
 a straight conscience a representative 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.940
 authentic society 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.960
 so as I ask the country to 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.680
 be joyfully about the return of 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.660
 andrés to your home 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.870
 I ask the country to meet with 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:47.060
 pain around this fact 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.370
 cruel that really to me personally and 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.980
 I know that all Colombians who have 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.750
 shattered Mr. President you 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.720
 I think that in the face of the situation 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.030
 raises the government there will be a change of 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.190
 Opposition position of the party 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.990
 conservative social that there will be another 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.040
 dialogue search more offers of 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.230
 dialogue like the ones that you had 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.900
 proposed in the past 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.880
 is that this goes beyond dialogue 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.639
 I believe that what is invited is not a 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.030
 dialogue but to look for a great 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:18.220
 collective coincidence 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.830
 the country's ills are very great for 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:25.210
 let him handle a game at two 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:27.010
 matches but it is required to convene 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.750
 at this time to society at all 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:34.450
 its estates in all its aspects 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.490
 in all its manifestations because I 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.980
 I think what we need for 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.830
 rebuild the country because in reality 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:44.620
 it is a work of reconstruction is 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.570
 precisely that sum of wills and or 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.270
 I think the country is in a moment 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:51.650
 conducive to hearing that language for 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.810
 listen to that message 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.430
 As the former president Pastrana said in 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.919
 the emotion that overwhelms us is 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.750
 overshadowed by the grief caused by 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.600
 the death of the attorney Carlos Mauro 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.850
 holes in the name of the newsletter tb today is 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.639
 I express to our relatives our more 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:09.880
 heartfelt condolences thank you and good 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:09.880
 nights 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.340
 data and messages I present 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:27.690
 the tb newscast today with the sponsorship of 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.690
 the House 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.610
 ah 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.430
 the truth 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.090
 but no
