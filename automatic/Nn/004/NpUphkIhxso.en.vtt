not<00:01:33.479> washed<00:01:33.720> um<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.070> braided<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.970> put<00:01:36.420> it

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
not washed um so I braided it and put it

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.149 
not washed um so I braided it and put it
back<00:01:36.630> it's<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:36.930> one<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.200> those<00:01:37.290> inside-out

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
back it's like one of those inside-out

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.010 
back it's like one of those inside-out
braids<00:01:38.549> instead<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> regular<00:01:39.329> braid<00:01:39.720> if

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
braids instead of a regular braid if

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.149 
braids instead of a regular braid if
that<00:01:40.170> makes<00:01:40.350> sense<00:01:40.409> where<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.799> braid<00:01:41.009> it

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
that makes sense where you braid it

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.639 
that makes sense where you braid it
under<00:01:41.460> instead<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.909> over<00:01:42.350> anyway<00:01:43.350> that's<00:01:43.500> not

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
under instead of over anyway that's not

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.109 
under instead of over anyway that's not
the<00:01:43.710> interesting<00:01:43.950> part<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:44.880> I'm<00:01:45.000> back
