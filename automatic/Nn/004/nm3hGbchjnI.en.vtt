00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
and America wasn't in it and so FDR

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.420 
and America wasn't in it and so FDR
Franklin<00:00:31.279> and<00:00:32.279> Eleanor<00:00:32.430> Roosevelt<00:00:34.399> did<00:00:35.399> a

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt did a

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.569 
Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt did a
lend-lease<00:00:35.850> program<00:00:36.860> so<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.100> he<00:00:38.280> could

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
lend-lease program so that he could

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.450 
lend-lease program so that he could
basically<00:00:38.790> make<00:00:39.600> vehicles<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.649> stuff<00:00:41.070> and

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
basically make vehicles and stuff and

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.990 
basically make vehicles and stuff and
then<00:00:42.210> send<00:00:42.420> them<00:00:42.480> over<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.079> Allies<00:00:43.440> or<00:00:44.000> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
then send them over to the Allies or the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.360 
then send them over to the Allies or the
ally<00:00:45.149> sending<00:00:45.660> them<00:00:45.840> stuff<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.469> then<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:47.160> make

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
ally sending them stuff and then we make

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.880 
ally sending them stuff and then we make
it<00:00:47.550> better<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.030> now<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.230> we<00:00:49.350> can<00:00:49.620> like

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
it better and now so that we can like

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.060 
it better and now so that we can like
help<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.390> Allies<00:00:51.510> but<00:00:52.050> not<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.469> get<00:00:52.649> into<00:00:52.920> the

help the Allies but not and get into the
war<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.520> then<00:00:54.090> we'll<00:00:54.420> eventually<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:55.379> got

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
war and then we'll eventually we got

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.740 
war and then we'll eventually we got
into<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> war<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.910> like<00:00:57.120> Russia<00:00:57.420> had

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750

treads or um tank tracks stuff like that
they<00:01:36.360> actually<00:01:36.509> look<00:01:36.780> really<00:01:37.020> nice<00:01:37.170> and

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.429 
they actually look really nice and
really<00:01:38.369> realistic<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.270> but<00:01:39.810> anyway<00:01:40.020> let's<00:01:40.259> get

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
really realistic so but anyway let's get

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.450 
really realistic so but anyway let's get
started<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:40.799> um<00:01:41.250> clearly<00:01:42.770> you<00:01:43.770> can<00:01:43.950> fit<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> guy

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
started so um clearly you can fit a guy

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.700 
started so um clearly you can fit a guy
in<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.270> gun<00:01:46.430> spot<00:01:47.689> and<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:49.020> really<00:01:49.320> like<00:01:49.500> this

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
in the gun spot and I really like this

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.690 
in the gun spot and I really like this
figure<00:01:50.009> because<00:01:50.780> you<00:01:51.780> can't<00:01:52.020> um<00:01:52.430> get<00:01:53.430> these

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
figure because you can't um get these

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.660 
figure because you can't um get these
separately<00:01:54.920> I've<00:01:55.920> always<00:01:56.159> wanted<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.490> have

kind<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.710> small<00:02:20.920> I<00:02:21.190> mean<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:22.150> good<00:02:22.360> way<00:02:22.510> it's

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
kind of small I mean and a good way it's

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.330 
kind of small I mean and a good way it's
a<00:02:22.780> really<00:02:23.050> it's<00:02:23.440> just<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.740> perfect<00:02:23.980> size<00:02:24.310> for

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
a really it's just a perfect size for

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.690 
a really it's just a perfect size for
mocks<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:25.090> I<00:02:25.860> think<00:02:26.860> Dan<00:02:27.130> did<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.340> really<00:02:27.550> good

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
mocks so I think Dan did a really good

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.450 
mocks so I think Dan did a really good
job<00:02:27.760> on<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.180> so<00:02:28.630> yeah<00:02:28.960> uh<00:02:29.280> yeah

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460

the<00:07:01.460> door<00:07:03.550> there<00:07:04.550> we<00:07:04.669> go<00:07:05.020> anyway<00:07:06.639> that's<00:07:07.639> what

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:07.849 
the door there we go anyway that's what

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:11.140 
the door there we go anyway that's what
that<00:07:08.030> side<00:07:08.270> looks<00:07:08.539> like<00:07:08.750> wait<00:07:09.620> pretty<00:07:09.949> well

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.150 
that side looks like wait pretty well

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.420 
that side looks like wait pretty well
comes<00:07:11.509> from<00:07:11.599> the<00:07:11.690> brick<00:07:11.930> arms<00:07:12.169> 50<00:07:12.590> Cal<00:07:12.830> which<00:07:13.250> I

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:13.430 
comes from the brick arms 50 Cal which I

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.589 
comes from the brick arms 50 Cal which I
think<00:07:13.759> it<00:07:13.879> looks<00:07:14.060> pretty<00:07:14.210> cool

00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:14.599 
think it looks pretty cool

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:19.869 
think it looks pretty cool
so<00:07:15.440> that's<00:07:15.650> that<00:07:15.949> I<00:07:18.520> don't<00:07:19.520> even<00:07:19.580> know<00:07:19.699> what<00:07:19.789> to

00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:19.879 
so that's that I don't even know what to

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:21.999 
so that's that I don't even know what to
say<00:07:19.909> for<00:07:20.270> this<00:07:20.389> part<00:07:20.690> I'm<00:07:21.050> G<00:07:21.440> nest<00:07:21.680> I<00:07:21.830> thought
