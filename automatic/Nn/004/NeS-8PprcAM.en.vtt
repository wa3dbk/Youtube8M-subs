00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.509
 hello everyone with you sapper and today I will give you 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.400
 I will try to explain what the problem is 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.580
 ks16 sounds 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.150
 but basically all people are fine 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.160
 there is tuned but some people may 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.699
 have the same problem as for example in 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.330
 I used to be what I said when 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.480
 microphone here in the chat then nobody me 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.710
 heard really no one heard me so 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.430
 if anyone knows 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:37.079
 press clamp the letter to English 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.950
 and say how much you need so now 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:47.789
 what with the sound go to the start panel 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:51.420
 control equipment sound sound so 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:55.800
 see here then we go post it here 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.260
 Mouse sorry this is my main microphone 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.890
 by which I can hear and I'm 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:06.150
 I say him so we go into him and 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.260
 push the level and here's what 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.869
 I had a problem I had a strong 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.090
 microphone gain like this 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.970
 here is me in fact 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.130
 but very loud and not so good a number 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.220
 take away if you have these 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.320
 decibel they have no use for you and one more thing 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.290
 my only microphone was 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.310
 somewhere here and so on 16 I just 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.180
 took took 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.630
 and put on 100 then either apply 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.180
 either ok and everything is basically nothing more 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.079
 no need but my advice to you when you 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.060
 come in with be sure to check 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.439
 microphone volume well and how is it all there 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.509
 it says but fine in this way I 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:57.789
 solved my problem vx now me 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:02:00.280
 heard very well even too well 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.140
 Generally if someone helped put the likes 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.899
 subscribe to the channel I don't you 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:10.830
 forcing well, in principle, everything for everyone with 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.830
 you were stolen
