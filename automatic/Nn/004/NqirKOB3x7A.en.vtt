fuel<00:00:24.180> line<00:00:25.939> nothing<00:00:26.939> too<00:00:27.660> big<00:00:27.810> about<00:00:27.930> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
fuel line nothing too big about the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.919 
fuel line nothing too big about the
engine<00:00:29.029> looks<00:00:30.029> like<00:00:30.150> you've<00:00:30.300> done<00:00:30.449> some<00:00:30.660> stuff

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929

over<00:00:31.109> here<00:00:31.579> I'm<00:00:32.579> coming<00:00:32.850> here<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.120> took<00:00:33.270> off

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
over here I'm coming here we took off

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.130 
over here I'm coming here we took off
the<00:00:33.600> resonator<00:00:34.530> here<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:35.070> guess<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.210> can<00:00:36.360> suck

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
the resonator here I guess it can suck

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.200 
the resonator here I guess it can suck
better<00:00:37.320> air<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.649> there<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:38.059> little<00:00:39.059> better

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
better air in there a little better

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.389 
better air in there a little better
induction<00:00:39.840> sounds<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> little<00:00:40.890> bit<00:00:41.040> beefier

brand<00:00:59.160> new<00:00:59.309> cap<00:01:00.270> rotor<00:01:00.510> plugs<00:01:00.930> wires

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
brand new cap rotor plugs wires

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.830 
brand new cap rotor plugs wires
high-performance<00:01:02.010> plugs<00:01:02.219> actually<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.539> you

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
high-performance plugs actually so you

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.420 
high-performance plugs actually so you
can't<00:01:04.049> can<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.290> tell<00:01:04.439> us<00:01:04.530> about<00:01:04.619> those<00:01:04.920> it's

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
can't can you tell us about those it's

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.890 
can't can you tell us about those it's
actually<00:01:05.700> has<00:01:05.790> multiple<00:01:05.970> ground<00:01:06.450> electrode

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
actually has multiple ground electrode

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.600 
actually has multiple ground electrode
so<00:01:07.110> more<00:01:07.380> than<00:01:07.500> one<00:01:07.650> spark<00:01:07.950> at<00:01:08.130> once<00:01:08.310> better

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
so more than one spark at once better

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.920 
so more than one spark at once better
fuel<00:01:08.939> economy<00:01:09.030> better<00:01:09.510> power<00:01:09.750> better

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
fuel economy better power better

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.550 
fuel economy better power better
ignition<00:01:10.700> it'll<00:01:11.700> be<00:01:11.790> pretty<00:01:11.970> cool<00:01:12.409> how<00:01:13.409> much

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
did you pay for those spark plugs by any

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.140 
did you pay for those spark plugs by any
chance<00:01:15.110> 15<00:01:16.110> bucks<00:01:16.259> apiece<00:01:16.759> in<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.820> Hyundai

bumper<00:01:30.119> work<00:01:30.270> over<00:01:30.540> here<00:01:30.570> as<00:01:30.930> we<00:01:31.110> can<00:01:31.350> see

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
bumper work over here as we can see

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.560

there's<00:01:31.740> some<00:01:31.890> paint<00:01:32.100> peeling<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:33.270> was<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
there's some paint peeling this was the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.850 
there's some paint peeling this was the
same<00:01:33.750> color<00:01:33.900> as<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.259> but<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.500> was<00:01:34.619> peeling

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
same color as this but it was peeling

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.469 
same color as this but it was peeling
already<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:35.520> figured<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.119> know<00:01:36.210> might<00:01:36.390> as

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
already so we figured you know might as

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.359 
already so we figured you know might as
well<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.750> give<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.079> all-black<00:01:37.439> look<00:01:37.500> so

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
well just give it that all-black look so

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.130 
well just give it that all-black look so
we<00:01:38.460> peeled<00:01:38.670> some<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.119> off<00:01:39.329> over<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:39.900> I

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
we peeled some of that off over here I

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.539 
we peeled some of that off over here I
think<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:40.799> if<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:40.920> give<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.250> little<00:01:41.369> more

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
think we if you give it a little more

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.679 
think we if you give it a little more
time<00:01:41.759> we<00:01:41.909> can<00:01:42.030> get<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.210> rest<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.570> off

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
time we can get the rest of it off

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.210 
time we can get the rest of it off
though<00:01:42.869> but<00:01:43.140> we<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:43.619> some<00:01:43.740> little<00:01:43.890> design

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
though but we have some little design

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.950 
though but we have some little design
where<00:01:44.399> we<00:01:44.490> try<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:45.119> not<00:01:45.270> coming<00:01:45.509> off<00:01:45.720> but

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
where we try to it's not coming off but

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.840 
where we try to it's not coming off but
a<00:01:46.200> little<00:01:46.920> more<00:01:47.040> time<00:01:47.220> we<00:01:47.430> should<00:01:47.579> be<00:01:47.700> good

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
a little more time we should be good

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.389 
a little more time we should be good
