00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.810 

now<00:01:06.080> let's<00:01:06.440> take<00:01:06.590> a<00:01:06.650> look<00:01:06.740> at<00:01:06.980> the<00:01:07.070> sto<00:01:07.370> AIA

now let's take a look at the sto AIA

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.700 
now let's take a look at the sto AIA
data<00:01:08.210> and<00:01:08.510> look<00:01:08.660> at<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:08.870> filament<00:01:09.290> eruption

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710

note<00:02:44.370> in<00:02:44.640> some<00:02:44.820> of<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.000> images<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:46.080> the

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
note in some of the images that the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.350 
note in some of the images that the
filament<00:02:46.530> is<00:02:46.620> so<00:02:46.830> dense<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:48.030> light<00:02:48.240> from

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.240 
filament is so dense that the light from
behind<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.900> could<00:02:49.080> not<00:02:49.260> get<00:02:49.470> through<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:50.100> it

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
behind it could not get through and it

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.390 
behind it could not get through and it
appeared<00:02:50.640> dark<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:51.920> most<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.070> challenge

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
appeared dark in most of the challenge

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.190 
appeared dark in most of the challenge
you<00:02:53.490> saw<00:02:53.640> two<00:02:53.910> bright<00:02:54.120> ribbons<00:02:54.480> are<00:02:54.660> separated

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
you saw two bright ribbons are separated

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.230 
you saw two bright ribbons are separated
slowly<00:02:55.530> these<00:02:56.250> are<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.460> foot<00:02:56.640> points<00:02:56.970> of<00:02:57.090> an

arcade of large coronal loops that are

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.500 
arcade of large coronal loops that are
formed<00:02:59.460> after<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.820> coronal<00:03:00.360> mass<00:03:00.480> ejection

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.230 
formed after the coronal mass ejection
has<00:03:01.020> left<00:03:01.400> but<00:03:02.400> what<00:03:02.610> is<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.790> temperature<00:03:03.060> of

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
has left but what is the temperature of

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.380 
has left but what is the temperature of
those<00:03:03.360> loops<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:04.890> was<00:03:05.010> only<00:03:05.160> in<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.430> iron<00:03:05.670> 14<00:03:06.120> 2

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390

million degree image that the arcade was
filled<00:03:09.990> in<00:03:10.200> so<00:03:11.010> that's<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.550> approximate

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
filled in so that's the approximate

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.020 
filled in so that's the approximate
temperature<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.540> those<00:03:12.720> loops<00:03:13.730> if<00:03:14.730> you<00:03:14.910> look

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
temperature of those loops if you look

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.170 
temperature of those loops if you look
at<00:03:15.150> a<00:03:15.180> recent<00:03:15.420> image<00:03:15.900> of<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.730> area<00:03:17.730> you'll<00:03:18.150> see

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
at a recent image of the area you'll see

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.090 
at a recent image of the area you'll see
that<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.600> filament<00:03:18.990> has<00:03:19.320> reformed<00:03:19.770> so

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
that the filament has reformed so

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.140 
that the filament has reformed so
there's<00:03:20.250> a<00:03:20.310> chance<00:03:20.550> that<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:20.790> will<00:03:20.880> erupt

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
there's a chance that it will erupt

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.370 
there's a chance that it will erupt
again<00:03:21.800> this<00:03:22.800> is<00:03:22.980> quite<00:03:23.190> common<00:03:23.580> I<00:03:24.290> wonder<00:03:25.290> how

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
again this is quite common I wonder how

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.780 
again this is quite common I wonder how
many<00:03:25.410> of<00:03:25.710> you<00:03:25.770> noticed<00:03:26.160> that<00:03:26.340> there<00:03:26.460> were<00:03:26.550> dark

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
many of you noticed that there were dark

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.640 
many of you noticed that there were dark
areas<00:03:27.180> both<00:03:27.390> at<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.690> North<00:03:27.960> and<00:03:28.140> South<00:03:28.320> Pole

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.160 
areas both at the North and South Pole
of<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.860> Sun<00:03:29.130> at<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.340> moment<00:03:29.840> this<00:03:30.840> means<00:03:31.080> that

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
of the Sun at the moment this means that

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.990 
of the Sun at the moment this means that
the<00:03:31.290> polar<00:03:31.770> coronal<00:03:32.610> holes<00:03:32.790> have

the polar coronal holes have

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
a few years in advance the only thing we

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.640 
a few years in advance the only thing we
can<00:04:51.240> do<00:04:51.360> now<00:04:51.389> is<00:04:51.599> wait<00:04:51.930> and<00:04:52.080> see<00:04:52.259> what<00:04:52.470> will

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
can do now is wait and see what will

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.249 
can do now is wait and see what will
happen<00:04:52.680> in<00:04:53.389> the<00:04:54.389> meantime<00:04:54.569> we<00:04:54.870> can<00:04:54.990> enjoy

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
happen in the meantime we can enjoy

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.279 
happen in the meantime we can enjoy
beautiful<00:04:55.500> events<00:04:56.009> like<00:04:56.159> this<00:04:56.340> one<00:04:56.639> and<00:04:57.289> I'm

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
beautiful events like this one and I'm

00:04:58.289 --> 00:04:59.629 
beautiful events like this one and I'm
sure<00:04:58.470> in<00:04:58.620> the<00:04:58.680> near<00:04:58.830> future<00:04:58.889> the<00:04:59.340> Sun<00:04:59.490> will

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
sure in the near future the Sun will

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.450 
sure in the near future the Sun will
start<00:04:59.909> producing<00:05:00.240> more<00:05:00.539> flares<00:05:00.870> again<00:05:01.460> so

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
start producing more flares again so

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.990 
start producing more flares again so
stay<00:05:02.759> tuned<00:05:03.150> until<00:05:03.360> next<00:05:03.720> time
