00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
the holes case and I kind of I'm a bit

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.600 
the holes case and I kind of I'm a bit
of<00:01:22.570> a<00:01:22.659> fan<00:01:22.960> of<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.290> holes<00:01:23.530> case<00:01:23.890> because<00:01:24.430> I

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
makes it so easy to take the bracelet

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.770 
makes it so easy to take the bracelet
off<00:01:30.790> and<00:01:31.090> to<00:01:31.270> fit<00:01:31.600> a<00:01:31.810> leather<00:01:32.259> strap<00:01:32.590> or<00:01:33.009> a<00:01:33.040> NATO

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.749 
off and to fit a leather strap or a NATO
it<00:01:34.780> just<00:01:35.049> makes<00:01:35.290> it<00:01:35.439> that<00:01:35.619> much<00:01:35.829> more<00:01:35.890> flexible

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
it just makes it that much more flexible

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.899 
it just makes it that much more flexible
but<00:01:37.720> I<00:01:37.750> gotta<00:01:38.350> say<00:01:38.619> this<00:01:38.829> is<00:01:39.070> a<00:01:39.100> great<00:01:39.520> looking

investment<00:02:24.300> potential<00:02:24.690> you're<00:02:25.560> going<00:02:25.740> to<00:02:25.860> pay

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
investment potential you're going to pay

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.760

a<00:02:26.040> lot<00:02:26.310> more<00:02:26.340> for<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:27.000> ceramic<00:02:27.510> version<00:02:28.230> and

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
a lot more for a ceramic version and

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.580 
a lot more for a ceramic version and

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.430 
these have got a huge upside I think
these<00:02:31.830> will<00:02:32.220> really<00:02:32.820> become<00:02:33.440> really

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
these will really become really

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
making any more of these I think though

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.650 
making any more of these I think though
they<00:02:42.900> will<00:02:43.200> actually<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.940> desirability<00:02:45.630> of

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
they will actually the desirability of

they will actually the desirability of
them<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:46.700> think<00:02:47.700> they<00:02:48.000> must<00:02:48.330> have<00:02:48.510> must<00:02:49.380> have
