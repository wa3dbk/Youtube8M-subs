00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
in the original game over so nothing is

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.780 
in the original game over so nothing is
upscaled<00:02:10.140> in<00:02:10.289> any<00:02:10.440> way<00:02:10.739> shape<00:02:11.160> or<00:02:11.310> form<00:02:11.370> which

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
upscaled in any way shape or form which

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.170 
upscaled in any way shape or form which
is<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> bit<00:02:12.360> disappointing<00:02:12.739> you<00:02:13.739> know<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:14.550> even

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
is a bit disappointing you know it even

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.020 
is a bit disappointing you know it even
just<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.600> straight-up<00:02:15.930> upscaled<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.830> 1080p

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
just a straight-up upscaled to 1080p

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.370 
just a straight-up upscaled to 1080p
would<00:02:18.030> be<00:02:18.239> an<00:02:18.480> improvement<00:02:19.730> but<00:02:20.730> i<00:02:21.090> think<00:02:21.510> what

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
would be an improvement but i think what

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.229 
would be an improvement but i think what
you'll<00:02:22.500> soon<00:02:22.800> realize<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.580> all<00:02:23.940> this

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
you'll soon realize is that all this

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.470 
you'll soon realize is that all this
version<00:02:24.989> is<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.400> exact<00:02:26.760> same<00:02:27.060> Wii

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
version is it is the exact same Wii

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.210 
version is it is the exact same Wii
version<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.799> all<00:02:28.920> you're<00:02:29.070> really

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
version and all you're really

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.120 
version and all you're really
downloading<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.180> it's<00:02:30.690> like<00:02:31.079> a<00:02:31.110> shortcut<00:02:31.709> to

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
downloading is it's like a shortcut to

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.680 
downloading is it's like a shortcut to
the<00:02:32.579> Wii<00:02:33.510> mode<00:02:34.640> which<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:35.760> see<00:02:35.940> if<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.150> go

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
the Wii mode which you see if you go

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.240 
the Wii mode which you see if you go
into<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.959> home<00:02:37.320> menu<00:02:37.620> you'll<00:02:37.950> get<00:02:38.130> the

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
into the home menu you'll get the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.990 
into the home menu you'll get the
standard<00:02:38.780> Wii<00:02:39.780> Menu<00:02:40.110> or<00:02:40.530> reset<00:02:40.950> option<00:02:41.370> so

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
standard Wii Menu or reset option so

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.370 
standard Wii Menu or reset option so
that<00:02:42.030> proves<00:02:42.299> that<00:02:42.480> all<00:02:42.600> this<00:02:42.840> is<00:02:43.049> this<00:02:43.230> is

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
that proves that all this is this is

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.650 
that proves that all this is this is
just<00:02:43.500> kind<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.130> shortcut<00:02:44.579> to<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:45.090> normal

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
just kind of a shortcut to the normal

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.949 
just kind of a shortcut to the normal
Wii<00:02:45.900> mode<00:02:46.340> so<00:02:47.340> if<00:02:47.459> I<00:02:47.549> went<00:02:47.730> into<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.269> Wii<00:02:48.690> Menu

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
Wii mode so if I went into the Wii Menu

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.130 
Wii mode so if I went into the Wii Menu
for<00:02:49.350> example<00:02:49.980> then<00:02:50.970> all<00:02:51.269> that<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:51.570> going<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.959> do

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
for example then all that is going to do

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.550 
for example then all that is going to do
is<00:02:52.410> take<00:02:53.040> me<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.959> text<00:02:54.959> write<00:02:55.079> back<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.440> the

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
is take me to the text write back to the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.250 
is take me to the text write back to the
Wii<00:02:55.769> U<00:02:56.070> menu<00:02:56.579> and<00:02:57.090> which<00:02:57.959> is<00:02:58.049> a<00:02:58.079> bit

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
Wii U menu and which is a bit

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.850 
Wii U menu and which is a bit
disappointing<00:02:59.060> but<00:03:00.500> you're<00:03:01.500> getting

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
disappointing but you're getting

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.740 
disappointing but you're getting
probably<00:03:02.640> one<00:03:02.850> of<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:03.000> best<00:03:03.150> mario<00:03:03.540> games

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
probably one of the best mario games

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.080 
probably one of the best mario games
ever<00:03:04.079> made<00:03:04.350> for<00:03:04.980> at<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.280> moment<00:03:05.640> less<00:03:05.790> than<00:03:06.060> a

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
ever made for at the moment less than a

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.270 
ever made for at the moment less than a
tenner<00:03:06.390> you<00:03:07.260> can't<00:03:07.530> really<00:03:07.709> complain<00:03:07.980> too

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
tenner you can't really complain too

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.850 
tenner you can't really complain too
much<00:03:08.310> about<00:03:08.519> that<00:03:09.170> so<00:03:10.170> I<00:03:10.200> haven't<00:03:10.590> really

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
much about that so I haven't really

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.199 
much about that so I haven't really
played<00:03:11.070> this<00:03:11.220> game<00:03:11.400> in<00:03:11.579> quite<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:11.820> few<00:03:11.970> years

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
played this game in quite a few years

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.080 
played this game in quite a few years
now<00:03:12.799> and<00:03:13.799> playing<00:03:14.130> it<00:03:14.400> can<00:03:14.700> let<00:03:14.820> everything

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
now and playing it can let everything

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.640 
now and playing it can let everything
kind<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.390> comes<00:03:15.540> back<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:16.049> you<00:03:16.200> then<00:03:16.380> once<00:03:16.530> you

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
kind of comes back to you then once you

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.530
