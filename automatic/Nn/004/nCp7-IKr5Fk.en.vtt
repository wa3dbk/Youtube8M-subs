okay<00:00:40.560> guys<00:00:40.740> we've<00:00:41.070> already<00:00:41.250> scored<00:00:41.760> our

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
okay guys we've already scored our

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.700 
okay guys we've already scored our
points<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.780> next<00:00:43.020> thing<00:00:43.230> I'm<00:00:43.380> going<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.560> do

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
points so the next thing I'm going to do

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.690 
points so the next thing I'm going to do
is<00:00:43.860> I'm<00:00:44.010> going<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.190> measure<00:00:44.340> their

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
is I'm going to measure their

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.610 
is I'm going to measure their
circumference<00:00:45.330> you<00:00:45.840> get<00:00:45.990> four<00:00:46.320> mass

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
circumference you get four mass

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.910 
circumference you get four mass
measurements<00:00:47.310> between<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.120> g1<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.840> g2<00:00:49.020> it's

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
measurements between the g1 and g2 it's

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.220 
measurements between the g1 and g2 it's
called<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.280> h1<00:00:50.760> measurement<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.020> boone

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
called the h1 measurement on the boone

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.560 
called the h1 measurement on the boone
and<00:00:52.350> crockett<00:00:52.380> does<00:00:52.980> score<00:00:53.280> sheet<00:00:53.570> between

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
and crockett does score sheet between

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.110 
and crockett does score sheet between
the<00:00:54.900> G<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.320> G<00:00:55.350> 3G<00:00:56.240> 3G<00:00:57.240> 4G<00:00:57.920> 4G<00:00:58.920> v<00:00:59.400> I'm<00:00:59.880> going<00:01:00.060> to

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
the G to G 3G 3G 4G 4G v I'm going to

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.440 
the G to G 3G 3G 4G 4G v I'm going to
take<00:01:00.240> the<00:01:00.390> smallest<00:01:00.840> circumference<00:01:02.150> so<00:01:03.150> I

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
take the smallest circumference so I

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:11.920 
take the smallest circumference so I
take<00:01:04.199> my<00:01:04.410> tape<00:01:08.300> come<00:01:09.300> around

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.520 

that's<00:01:12.500> right<00:01:12.800> at<00:01:13.010> eight<00:01:13.280> inches<00:01:14.080> so<00:01:15.080> it's

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
that's right at eight inches so it's

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.300 
that's right at eight inches so it's
right<00:01:15.980> about<00:01:16.220> Stanford<00:01:17.740> for<00:01:18.740> a<00:01:18.800> bowl<00:01:18.980> of<00:01:19.010> this

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
right about Stanford for a bowl of this

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.540 
right about Stanford for a bowl of this
caliber<00:01:20.170> next<00:01:21.170> measurement<00:01:21.560> that<00:01:21.950> I'm<00:01:22.160> going

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
caliber next measurement that I'm going

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.140 
caliber next measurement that I'm going
to<00:01:22.670> do<00:01:22.910> it<00:01:23.150> is<00:01:23.270> between<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:24.620> g2<00:01:25.160> and<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:25.550> g3

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
to do it is between the g2 and the g3

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.530 
to do it is between the g2 and the g3
I'm<00:01:27.080> going<00:01:27.230> to<00:01:27.290> take<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:27.620> smallest

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
I'm going to take the smallest

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.220 
I'm going to take the smallest
circumference<00:01:29.540> right<00:01:30.280> there<00:01:31.280> six<00:01:31.910> and<00:01:32.150> a<00:01:32.180> half

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
circumference right there six and a half

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.840

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.760 

I<00:01:43.859> ride<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.700> down<00:01:44.850> on<00:01:45.030> my<00:01:45.149> piece<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.420> paper<00:01:45.770> I'm

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
I ride it down on my piece of paper I'm

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.499 
I ride it down on my piece of paper I'm
on<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.219> next<00:01:47.310> measurement<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.240> between

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
on to the next measurement so between

00:01:48.509 --> 00:03:48.990 
on to the next measurement so between
the<00:01:48.750> g3<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.619> g4
