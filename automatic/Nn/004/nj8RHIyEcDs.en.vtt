goes in the bottle pan and that will do

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.770 
goes in the bottle pan and that will do
that

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
that

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.479 
that
so<00:00:57.780> once<00:01:00.559> now<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.739> we've<00:01:01.890> got<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.250> this

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
so once now that we've got it to this

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.730 
so once now that we've got it to this
point<00:01:03.049> you<00:01:04.049> can<00:01:04.260> see<00:01:04.500> these<00:01:04.680> brackets<00:01:06.740> we're

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
point you can see these brackets we're

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.080 
point you can see these brackets we're
gonna<00:01:07.920> bite<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.280> screws<00:01:08.580> out<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:09.000> these

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
gonna bite the screws out of these

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.310 
gonna bite the screws out of these
brackets<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:11.270> then<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.420> skylight<00:01:12.900> will<00:01:13.140> lift

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
brackets and then the skylight will lift

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.140 
brackets and then the skylight will lift
right<00:01:13.560> off<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.770> here<00:01:14.220> we're<00:01:14.760> just<00:01:14.940> by<00:01:15.090> two

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
right off of here we're just by two

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.510 
right off of here we're just by two
screws<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.780> always<00:01:16.020> got<00:01:16.439> two<00:01:16.680> screws<00:01:17.010> and<00:01:17.310> two

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
screws I always got two screws and two

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.850 
screws I always got two screws and two
nails<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.420> nails<00:01:18.659> may<00:01:18.960> be<00:01:19.020> tricky<00:01:19.470> for<00:01:19.619> us

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
nails so the nails may be tricky for us

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.789 
nails so the nails may be tricky for us
but<00:01:20.220> once<00:01:20.430> we<00:01:20.610> pull<00:01:20.880> them<00:01:20.970> out<00:01:21.470> pop<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.650> up

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
but once we pull them out pop it up

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.010 
but once we pull them out pop it up
click<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.460> new<00:01:23.610> one<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.299> I'll<00:01:24.570> show<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.810> how

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
click a new one on and I'll show you how

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.550 
click a new one on and I'll show you how
it<00:01:25.170> goes<00:01:25.320> back<00:01:25.590> together

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
it goes back together

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:43.200 
it goes back together
okay<00:01:28.560> that's<00:01:28.860> all<00:01:28.950> ready<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.670> think

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:52.580 

you<00:01:44.210> want<00:01:44.420> to<00:01:44.480> go<00:01:44.570> over<00:01:44.690> the<00:01:44.870> rail<00:01:45.050> line<00:01:45.790> okay

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.620 

I'm<00:01:53.070> making<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.460> harder<00:01:53.760> for<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.090> your<00:01:54.210> honor

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630
