00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
it's a nimble so it is a larger sedae in

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.360 
it's a nimble so it is a larger sedae in
a<00:00:50.670> larger<00:00:51.090> vehicle<00:00:51.510> but<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.469> doesn't<00:00:52.890> feel

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
a larger vehicle but it doesn't feel

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.660 
a larger vehicle but it doesn't feel
heavy<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.300> doesn't<00:00:54.329> feel<00:00:55.199> too<00:00:55.680> big<00:00:56.370> when<00:00:56.579> you

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
heavy it doesn't feel too big when you

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.820 
heavy it doesn't feel too big when you
drive<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.059> down<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.270> road<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.690> that's

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
drive it down the road and that's

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.680 
drive it down the road and that's
especially<00:00:59.830> when<00:01:00.070> it's<00:01:00.220> got<00:01:00.580> that<00:01:00.730> SS<00:01:01.150> badging

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
especially when it's got that SS badging

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.350 
especially when it's got that SS badging
on<00:01:01.840> it<00:01:02.020> and<00:01:02.140> it<00:01:02.200> is<00:01:02.320> being<00:01:02.530> considered<00:01:03.360> about

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
on it and it is being considered about

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.650 
on it and it is being considered about
performance<00:01:04.900> vehicles<00:01:05.730> the<00:01:06.730> SS<00:01:07.120> I<00:01:07.270> think<00:01:07.510> does

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
performance vehicles the SS I think does

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.170 
performance vehicles the SS I think does
a<00:01:07.690> good<00:01:07.870> job<00:01:07.930> of<00:01:08.740> coming<00:01:09.490> through<00:01:09.850> on<00:01:10.030> that

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
a good job of coming through on that

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.300 
a good job of coming through on that
promise<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:11.350> today<00:01:11.650> we'll<00:01:11.800> talk<00:01:11.830> about<00:01:11.980> that

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
promise and today we'll talk about that

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.120 
promise and today we'll talk about that
a<00:01:12.370> little<00:01:12.520> bit<00:01:12.730> of<00:01:12.790> more<00:01:12.940> mr.<00:01:13.330> Graham<00:01:14.040> one<00:01:15.040> of

kind<00:01:36.310> of<00:01:36.340> tenses<00:01:36.820> it<00:01:36.940> up<00:01:37.030> a<00:01:37.150> little<00:01:37.240> bit<00:01:37.479> you

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
kind of tenses it up a little bit you

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.440 
kind of tenses it up a little bit you
kind<00:01:37.720> of<00:01:37.750> feel<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.050> car<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:39.640> firm<00:01:40.090> up<00:01:40.330> a

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
kind of feel the car just firm up a

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.969 
kind of feel the car just firm up a
little<00:01:40.479> bit<00:01:40.810> better<00:01:41.020> handling<00:01:41.560> better<00:01:41.740> ride

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
little bit better handling better ride

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.830 
little bit better handling better ride
this<00:01:42.190> is<00:01:42.250> probably<00:01:42.790> where<00:01:43.000> I<00:01:43.030> am<00:01:43.390> that<00:01:43.600> I<00:01:43.660> would

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
this is probably where I am that I would

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.480 
this is probably where I am that I would
drive<00:01:44.080> most<00:01:44.290> of<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.590> time<00:01:44.770> I<00:01:44.800> really<00:01:44.979> like<00:01:45.369> the

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
drive most of the time I really like the

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.609 
drive most of the time I really like the
way<00:01:45.610> they<00:01:45.790> up<00:01:45.970> the<00:01:46.479> handling<00:01:46.990> is<00:01:47.170> I<00:01:47.290> write<00:01:47.440> the

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
way they up the handling is I write the

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.219 
way they up the handling is I write the
way<00:01:47.740> though<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.160> body<00:01:48.340> roll<00:01:48.640> is<00:01:48.930> on<00:01:49.930> this

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
way though the body roll is on this

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.540

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.190 
personal opinion you know for me this
vehicle<00:03:45.190> has<00:03:45.340> that<00:03:45.550> 6-speed<00:03:46.060> automatic<00:03:47.050> which

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
vehicle has that 6-speed automatic which

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.560 
vehicle has that 6-speed automatic which
is<00:03:47.350> very<00:03:47.590> nice<00:03:47.970> but<00:03:48.970> one<00:03:49.150> thing<00:03:49.360> I've<00:03:49.450> noticed

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
is very nice but one thing I've noticed

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.780 
is very nice but one thing I've noticed
is<00:03:49.780> that<00:03:49.960> 6-speed<00:03:50.620> automatic<00:03:51.100> this<00:03:51.250> doesn't

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
is that 6-speed automatic this doesn't

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.430 
is that 6-speed automatic this doesn't
seem<00:03:52.000> to<00:03:52.830> change<00:03:54.660> even<00:03:55.660> as<00:03:55.900> quickly<00:03:56.140> as<00:03:56.410> you

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
seem to change even as quickly as you

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.140 
seem to change even as quickly as you
see<00:03:56.709> the<00:03:56.860> automatic<00:03:57.250> in<00:03:57.550> the<00:03:57.580> Corvette<00:03:58.000> is

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
see the automatic in the Corvette is

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.700 
see the automatic in the Corvette is
changing

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 
changing

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.650 
changing
I<00:03:59.770> think<00:04:00.520> of<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:00.700> people<00:04:01.030> like<00:04:01.180> this<00:04:01.360> is

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
I think of the people like this is

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.680 
I think of the people like this is
probably<00:04:02.200> going<00:04:02.350> to<00:04:02.410> be<00:04:02.470> something<00:04:03.010> that<00:04:03.690> for

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
probably going to be something that for

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.640 
probably going to be something that for
some<00:04:04.870> people<00:04:05.140> that<00:04:05.170> are<00:04:05.290> gonna<00:04:05.380> hit<00:04:05.590> it

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
some people that are gonna hit it

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.900 
some people that are gonna hit it
they're<00:04:05.830> gonna<00:04:05.920> love<00:04:06.130> the<00:04:06.310> automatic<00:04:06.790> they're

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
they're gonna love the automatic they're

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
they're gonna love the automatic they're
gonna<00:04:07.000> want<00:04:07.180> to<00:04:07.210> go<00:04:07.330> with<00:04:07.450> it<00:04:07.540> but<00:04:07.600> I<00:04:07.690> think

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
gonna want to go with it but I think

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.140 
gonna want to go with it but I think
that<00:04:08.170> the<00:04:08.470> pure<00:04:08.740> performance<00:04:09.700> kind<00:04:10.030> of

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
that the pure performance kind of

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.230 
that the pure performance kind of
enthusiast<00:04:10.840> is<00:04:11.830> gonna<00:04:12.130> want<00:04:12.400> that<00:04:12.520> available

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
enthusiast is gonna want that available

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.210 
enthusiast is gonna want that available
6-speed<00:04:13.780> manual<00:04:13.810> that<00:04:14.470> they<00:04:14.590> have<00:04:14.770> in<00:04:14.920> it<00:04:15.040> this

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
6-speed manual that they have in it this

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.250 
6-speed manual that they have in it this
year<00:04:15.520> I<00:04:15.730> think<00:04:16.330> that<00:04:16.510> would<00:04:16.750> really<00:04:16.930> make<00:04:17.200> a

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
year I think that would really make a

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.050 
year I think that would really make a
difference<00:04:17.530> for<00:04:17.920> the<00:04:18.040> feel<00:04:18.340> of<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.640> drive<00:04:18.850> the

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
difference for the feel of the drive the

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.280 
difference for the feel of the drive the
particular<00:04:19.540> one<00:04:19.660> that<00:04:19.780> I'm<00:04:19.840> driving<00:04:20.260> right

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
particular one that I'm driving right

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.250 
particular one that I'm driving right
now<00:04:20.560> is<00:04:20.830> the<00:04:21.070> automatic<00:04:21.489> I<00:04:21.940> would<00:04:22.750> really<00:04:23.020> like

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
now is the automatic I would really like

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.110 
now is the automatic I would really like
to<00:04:23.470> try<00:04:23.740> out<00:04:23.950> one<00:04:24.190> of<00:04:24.220> the<00:04:24.370> manuals<00:04:24.850> and<00:04:25.060> I

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
to try out one of the manuals and I

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.810 
to try out one of the manuals and I
might<00:04:25.330> I<00:04:25.800> might<00:04:26.800> put<00:04:27.040> out<00:04:27.070> another<00:04:27.400> review

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
might I might put out another review

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.670 
might I might put out another review
video<00:04:28.150> once<00:04:28.480> I<00:04:28.630> get<00:04:28.810> that<00:04:28.960> opportunity<00:04:31.680> you

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
video once I get that opportunity you

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
know the SS has a lot of systems on it

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.370 
know the SS has a lot of systems on it
that<00:04:34.870> are<00:04:34.900> really<00:04:35.320> centered<00:04:35.800> around

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
that are really centered around

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.830 
that are really centered around
performance<00:04:38.400> in<00:04:39.400> this<00:04:39.670> vehicle<00:04:40.270> you<00:04:40.300> actually

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
ride control system that really just

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.190 
ride control system that really just
helps<00:05:42.850> it<00:05:42.910> to<00:05:43.030> soak<00:05:43.330> up<00:05:43.510> the<00:05:43.690> road<00:05:43.870> better

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.800

think<00:05:50.190> I<00:05:50.310> would<00:05:50.430> probably<00:05:50.640> prefer<00:05:51.030> the<00:05:51.360> manual

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.010 
but I'm a little bit old-school like
that<00:05:53.340> I<00:05:53.370> really<00:05:53.760> prefer<00:05:54.090> changing<00:05:54.690> the<00:05:54.810> gears

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020
