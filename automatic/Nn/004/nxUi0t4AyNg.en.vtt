fight you guys to remember that tour

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.600 
fight you guys to remember that tour
because<00:02:41.030> that<00:02:41.660> tour<00:02:41.900> was<00:02:42.050> huge<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:42.890> think<00:02:43.460> was<00:02:43.580> a

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
because that tour was huge I think was a

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.730 
because that tour was huge I think was a
like<00:02:44.240> a<00:02:44.270> tent<00:02:44.570> city<00:02:44.780> it<00:02:45.110> was<00:02:45.260> supposed<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.620> be

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
like a tent city it was supposed to be

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.980 
like a tent city it was supposed to be
11<00:02:46.100> cities<00:02:46.310> but<00:02:46.580> it<00:02:46.910> ended<00:02:47.150> up<00:02:47.240> being<00:02:47.300> 10<00:02:47.660> or<00:02:47.810> 9

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
11 cities but it ended up being 10 or 9

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.699 
11 cities but it ended up being 10 or 9
so<00:02:48.940> whoo-hoo<00:02:49.970> hopefully<00:02:50.840> it's<00:02:51.290> bigger<00:02:51.560> than

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
so whoo-hoo hopefully it's bigger than

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.680 
so whoo-hoo hopefully it's bigger than
that<00:02:51.770> they<00:02:52.370> can<00:02:52.520> make<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:52.820> more<00:02:52.970> international

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
that they can make it more international

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.390 
that they can make it more international
