00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
videos regularly again these are a few

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.040 
videos regularly again these are a few
people<00:00:20.670> who<00:00:20.850> couldn't<00:00:21.240> go<00:00:21.420> with<00:00:21.570> us<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:21.930> they

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
people who couldn't go with us so they

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.830 
people who couldn't go with us so they
wanted<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.439> do<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.590> shout<00:00:22.859> out<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.330> I<00:00:24.330> thought

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
wanted to do a shout out and I thought

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.320 
wanted to do a shout out and I thought
it<00:00:24.960> would<00:00:25.050> be<00:00:25.170> fair<00:00:25.439> since<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.460> pqu<00:00:26.910> can<00:00:27.150> only

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
it would be fair since this pqu can only

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.380 
it would be fair since this pqu can only
have<00:00:27.660> up<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:28.019> 4<00:00:28.199> people<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:29.160> they<00:00:30.000> said<00:00:30.240> they

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
have up to 4 people and they said they

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.700 
have up to 4 people and they said they
would<00:00:30.539> help<00:00:30.720> but<00:00:31.019> they<00:00:31.769> were<00:00:33.320> not<00:00:34.320> strong

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
would help but they were not strong

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.520 
would help but they were not strong
enough<00:00:34.980> because<00:00:35.309> since<00:00:36.210> I'm<00:00:36.360> 194<00:00:37.050> they're

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
enough because since I'm 194 they're

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.440 
enough because since I'm 194 they're
going<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.100> make<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.610> monsters<00:00:39.000> around<00:00:39.239> my

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
talking or you know if you have both the

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.670 
talking or you know if you have both the
next<00:05:18.360> stage<00:05:18.539> you<00:05:18.779> go<00:05:18.900> in<00:05:19.050> there's<00:05:19.229> no<00:05:19.319> monsters

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
next stage you go in there's no monsters

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.019 
next stage you go in there's no monsters
but<00:05:19.800> then<00:05:19.979> they<00:05:20.069> just<00:05:20.250> appear<00:05:20.639> there<00:05:20.819> it<00:05:20.939> was

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:21.029 
but then they just appear there it was

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:23.719 
but then they just appear there it was
like<00:05:21.060> a<00:05:21.180> trap<00:05:21.539> I<00:05:21.750> like<00:05:22.080> the<00:05:22.229> storyline<00:05:22.740> bad<00:05:23.490> guy

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
like a trap I like the storyline bad guy

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:25.640 
like a trap I like the storyline bad guy
or<00:05:23.969> whatever<00:05:24.180> you<00:05:25.110> kill<00:05:25.289> all<00:05:25.409> the<00:05:25.500> monsters

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
or whatever you kill all the monsters

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.309 
or whatever you kill all the monsters
and<00:05:26.129> then<00:05:26.250> it's<00:05:26.460> the<00:05:26.580> sparkly<00:05:26.990> switch<00:05:27.990> thing

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319 
and then it's the sparkly switch thing

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:30.589 
and then it's the sparkly switch thing
again<00:05:28.620> you<00:05:28.770> gotta<00:05:28.919> find<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.370> switch<00:05:29.610> there's

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
again you gotta find the switch there's

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:32.179 
again you gotta find the switch there's
only<00:05:30.779> like<00:05:30.930> four<00:05:30.990> spots<00:05:31.469> so<00:05:31.740> it<00:05:31.860> takes<00:05:32.039> like

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:32.189 
only like four spots so it takes like

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:33.769 
only like four spots so it takes like
five<00:05:32.400> seconds<00:05:32.759> to<00:05:32.909> find<00:05:33.150> it<00:05:33.300> but<00:05:33.449> all<00:05:33.689> the

00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:33.779 
five seconds to find it but all the

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:35.749 
five seconds to find it but all the
monsters<00:05:34.110> have<00:05:34.259> to<00:05:34.409> be<00:05:34.529> dead<00:05:34.830> but<00:05:35.340> if<00:05:35.460> you<00:05:35.580> hit

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 
monsters have to be dead but if you hit

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:37.159 
monsters have to be dead but if you hit
the<00:05:35.879> switch<00:05:36.029> before<00:05:36.210> the<00:05:36.539> door<00:05:36.719> appears<00:05:36.960> but

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
the switch before the door appears but

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.140 
the switch before the door appears but
you<00:05:37.229> can't<00:05:37.439> go<00:05:37.560> through<00:05:37.740> the<00:05:37.860> door<00:05:38.009> now

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
you can't go through the door now

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.329 
you can't go through the door now
there's<00:05:39.449> rooms<00:05:40.020> in<00:05:40.379> the<00:05:40.800> next<00:05:41.039> stage<00:05:41.279> in

00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:43.339 
there's rooms in the next stage in

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:45.860 
there's rooms in the next stage in
basically<00:05:44.339> one<00:05:44.610> room<00:05:44.819> per<00:05:45.029> person<00:05:45.449> you<00:05:45.479> go<00:05:45.659> in

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
basically one room per person you go in

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.420 
basically one room per person you go in
the<00:05:46.020> door<00:05:46.259> lights<00:05:46.529> up<00:05:46.770> saying<00:05:47.009> someone's<00:05:47.339> in

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
the door lights up saying someone's in

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.829 
the door lights up saying someone's in
the<00:05:47.580> door<00:05:47.729> and<00:05:48.740> you<00:05:49.740> have<00:05:49.770> to<00:05:50.250> basically<00:05:50.839> find

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:51.839 
the door and you have to basically find

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:54.379 
the door and you have to basically find
the<00:05:52.139> pattern<00:05:52.620> up<00:05:52.860> to<00:05:52.919> the<00:05:53.310> top<00:05:53.520> as<00:05:53.849> you<00:05:53.909> can<00:05:54.240> see

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:54.389 
the pattern up to the top as you can see

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:57.939 
the pattern up to the top as you can see
it's<00:05:54.509> kind<00:05:54.690> of<00:05:54.719> like<00:05:54.779> the<00:05:54.960> Ludi<00:05:56.629> quest<00:05:57.629> the

00:05:57.939 --> 00:05:57.949 
it's kind of like the Ludi quest the

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:01.309 
it's kind of like the Ludi quest the
dimensional<00:05:58.949> crack<00:05:59.250> PQ<00:05:59.940> but<00:06:00.629> instead

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 
dimensional crack PQ but instead

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.400 
dimensional crack PQ but instead
everyone's<00:06:01.949> got<00:06:02.279> their<00:06:02.460> own<00:06:02.490> room

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
everyone's got their own room

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.740 
everyone's got their own room
and<00:06:03.830> basically<00:06:04.670> the<00:06:05.030> first<00:06:05.180> person<00:06:05.540> to<00:06:05.570> the

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
and basically the first person to the

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.210 
and basically the first person to the
top<00:06:06.310> gets<00:06:07.450> completes<00:06:08.450> it<00:06:08.630> like<00:06:09.560> if<00:06:09.710> I<00:06:09.800> were<00:06:10.070> to

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
top gets completes it like if I were to

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.990 
top gets completes it like if I were to
complete<00:06:10.520> it<00:06:10.640> right<00:06:10.850> now<00:06:11.000> then<00:06:11.780> everyone

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
complete it right now then everyone

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.180 
complete it right now then everyone
comes<00:06:14.000> through<00:06:14.360> so<00:06:15.050> even<00:06:15.440> if<00:06:15.560> you<00:06:15.710> don't<00:06:15.950> get

Frankenstein is the boss of this PQ and

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.190 
Frankenstein is the boss of this PQ and
the<00:06:55.820> monsters<00:06:56.240> that<00:06:56.450> are<00:06:56.510> spawned<00:06:56.810> around<00:06:57.080> and

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:57.200 
the monsters that are spawned around and

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.410 
the monsters that are spawned around and
have<00:06:57.350> that<00:06:57.590> you<00:06:58.130> know<00:06:58.220> immunity<00:06:58.820> to<00:06:58.970> damage

have that you know immunity to damage
and<00:06:59.690> magic<00:07:00.560> damage<00:07:00.740> so<00:07:01.310> that's<00:07:01.580> why<00:07:01.760> I<00:07:01.790> wasn't

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:02.060 
and magic damage so that's why I wasn't

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.480 
and magic damage so that's why I wasn't
like<00:07:02.300> doing<00:07:02.600> any<00:07:02.780> damage<00:07:02.990> per<00:07:03.380> sec<00:07:06.490> that's

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.490 
like doing any damage per sec that's

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.710 
like doing any damage per sec that's
basically<00:07:08.210> it
