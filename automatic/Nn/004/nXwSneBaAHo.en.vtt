00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.330
 that's all it is he who I hope that 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.490
 since the time it's okay or in all 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.080
 case it's going so the phase has long that 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.430
 I did not come on youtube and 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.270
 finally excused me so that makes 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.949
 it's nice to see you again 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.020
 so I will put in the description the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.279
 little reason so for the occasion I 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.619
 wanted to introduce you to a little glitch 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.000
 that I found really very nice so 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.330
 indeed allows you to be able to wear 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.349
 a helmet with and a mask so 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.090
 for that it is very healthy for you 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.219
 render but an interaction so in 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.380
 appearance put on your apartment 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.250
 not any apartment 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.989
 so once it's done you go 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.420
 have to ask your mechanic about you 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.370
 bring either a quad or a motorcycle that 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.450
 does not matter so you put 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.460
 before then you are in the menu 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.809
 inventory interaction accessories and 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.510
 our accessories wearing the helmet you 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.620
 be sure to put on with so once 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.270
 that of course you have with you go 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.260
 in headphones and you will define the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.699
 headset that you want to put 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.710
 automatically when you go on a 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.050
 motorcycle or a trade of which I took the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.449
 black forecourt so you are defining so 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.390
 with carey so once it's done 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.189
 you will be able to put helmet without 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.439
 which you go on mask so sweat 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.490
 mask actually you stay on masked 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.710
 you are going to do triangle for 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.470
 meet to go on your code or 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.000
 a motorcycle so once you're 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.369
 on top you're going to wait for your 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.970
 character put on his helmet 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.320
 automatically once it's done 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.390
 you will switch directly 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.619
 with the arrows and well 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.479
 sure a mask you want so will 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.189
 really very very fast so me 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.990
 see well anthracite fight gemin 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.400
 so see that it's a mix of 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.079
 two which can really be very 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.119
 nice so once it's done you 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.880
 will be able to make start online the 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.900
 change character so a 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.220
 Once you change character 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.619
 you will be able to see your character 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.040
 and if he has the mask and the helmet 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.479
 you will be able to choose them there 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.970
 you will naturally have arrived in a 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.220
 other session and you will arrive in 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.390
 your apartment so there if all well 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.460
 worked you will be able to see your 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.829
 character with a helmet and a mask 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.990
 and so for really not that he is taking off 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.100
 if you change your assignment of which you 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.820
 see it can really give some 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.500
 really not bad thing 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.420
 so you just have to go 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.000
 in the interaction menu and you 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.230
 commit suicide once in your apartment 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.400
 you commit suicide then the fact you committed suicide 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.750
 will you be able to appear 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.270
 you will automatically appear 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.130
 out and so that's from the 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.680
 pre-list really worked you go 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.020
 able to change assignment and mask 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.040
 restaurant as it is so you can 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.780
 see that that can really make it 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.030
 something nice then I 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.940
 I was wrong I took the helmet the 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.770
 anthracite combat helmet so it's okay 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.120
 not so black eagles so you 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.790
 can happily do it with 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.600
 anywhere anywhere but it can 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.459
 really give something 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.860
 really not bad what I find that 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.770
 the helmets the combat helmet was 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.209
 not superb of 1.17 so with the big 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.550
 headphones on top it can really be 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.930
 nice this I hope these little videos 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.680
