00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
do is to begin with start by threading

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.260 
do is to begin with start by threading
your<00:01:24.740> bells<00:01:26.380> onto<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.950> ribbon<00:01:28.160> and<00:01:28.729> the

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
your bells onto the ribbon and the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.779 
your bells onto the ribbon and the
ribbon<00:01:29.539> is<00:01:29.660> small<00:01:29.930> enough<00:01:30.200> that<00:01:30.459> it'll<00:01:31.459> just

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
ribbon is small enough that it'll just

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.650 
ribbon is small enough that it'll just
go<00:01:31.940> like<00:01:32.300> right<00:01:32.479> through<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.720> top<00:01:33.069> here<00:01:34.660> and

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
go like right through the top here and

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.260 
go like right through the top here and
it's<00:01:36.080> a<00:01:36.140> little<00:01:36.319> bit<00:01:36.500> easier<00:01:36.979> I<00:01:37.340> think<00:01:37.880> if<00:01:38.060> you

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
it's a little bit easier I think if you

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.850 
it's a little bit easier I think if you
put<00:01:38.509> all<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.990> bells<00:01:39.200> on<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.530> ribbon<00:01:39.709> first<00:01:41.860> so

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
put all the bells on the ribbon first so

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.740 
put all the bells on the ribbon first so
thread<00:01:43.130> all<00:01:43.250> your<00:01:43.369> bells<00:01:43.550> first<00:01:43.819> and<00:01:44.090> then<00:01:44.509> you

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
thread all your bells first and then you

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.740 
thread all your bells first and then you
can<00:01:44.899> go<00:01:45.080> and<00:01:45.399> start<00:01:46.399> making<00:01:46.789> your<00:01:46.819> wreath<00:01:47.179> but

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750
