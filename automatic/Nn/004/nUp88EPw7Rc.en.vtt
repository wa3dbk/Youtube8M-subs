00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.610
 Well, let's start friends 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.010
 the final part of our lesson and 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.369
 let's use that knowledge 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.330
 which we already have to us now 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.210
 will need 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.290
 both positional and metric 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.439
 set pulsation or counting 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:34.430
 right hand in a comfortable position so that 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.890
 all the keys you need were under your fingers 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:54.050
 count and play since the fourth 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:54.050
 share 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 3 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.420
 23 please pay attention to 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.150
 what's the fourth beat in our melody 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:10.409
 have to fast but you are 16 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.970
 and at the expense of one-two-three in almost all 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:38.780
 melodies sound one long note 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:38.780
 exception only in the second phrase 23 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.100
 two three times two three 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:56.659
 I now have this request for you 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:00.189
 please learn to play a tune or 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:04.219
 almost without looking right hand 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:07.189
 almost to the touch for this turn 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:08.810
 head left a little look 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.979
 please go here to the left side 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.790
 keyboard 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.220
 friends we have new year twigs and 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.489
 try to play the game time after time 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:23.079
 right hand without mistakes 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:26.360
 the fact is that the performance of the party left 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.890
 will require you to be so significant 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.349
 parts of your attention 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.140
 that you will simply not be up to the right hand and 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.269
 so in your right hand you should be 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.910
 quite sure you must be 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.790
 sure that you are playing without errors 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.840
 by the time you start to connect 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:48.579
 hand to left hand started brightly and 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.579
 quieter right 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.010
 theme 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.920
 and 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.750
 Please note that here on 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.480
 Those three shares while we have a long 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.319
 note in the melody in the left hand is played 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.319
 accompaniment 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.090
 and so on and now i play again 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.570
 two hands and call a rumor each 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.420
 main bass from main bass 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.880
 then it is difficult for me to build here completely 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.550
 not a complicated shape or texture of a tion 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.970
 a compliment i call only main 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.730
 Basque 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.730
 which accounts for share 1 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:32.720
 let's see what is built 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:38.230
 What is the accompaniment ? 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.230
 just an octave is built from the main bass 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.680
 and populated clint and fifths played 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.150
 second finger all the time Clint is 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:52.979
 fifth step 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:52.979
 12345 from the bass turned out yes 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:03.919
 lower gap here so that's a crit 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.919
 12345 will it work 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.200
 if father 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:15.490
 but the fifth with 1 2 3 4 5 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.270
 the exception here is 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.650
 note accompaniment 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.650
 them and that's how it is played 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:28.500
 this is not a quint 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:31.320
 but here take a chord in circulation and 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.850
 now these theoretical details 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:39.000
 we will not go 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:42.090
 and still quite a bit playing with both hands 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.540
 at the same time I call all the keys that 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:47.490
 need us in the left hand is not necessary 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.640
 called because we are not playing 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:53.490
 grinding what we are now learning 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:56.910
 this is called play by show 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:06:00.350
 playing with hands so i call all keys 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.350
 who need 2 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:13.189
 your 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:19.690
 and both repeats this section 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.860
 with 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.600
 Yes 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.460
 with 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.650
 one more here could be here and 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.000
 you can’t finish it anyway 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:07:00.680
 because it 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.920
 nominee a new chord on which music 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:07.340
 when will not end us here 

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:09.980
 need with you a little code code this 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:14.500
 final build in the musical 

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.500
 let’s be like that 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:27.650
 now everything was with you tatyana 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.960
