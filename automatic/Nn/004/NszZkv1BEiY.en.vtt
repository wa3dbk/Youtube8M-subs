00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
hi I'm Frederick and i've been using

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.410 
hi I'm Frederick and i've been using
blender<00:00:07.049> for<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.680> little<00:00:08.220> over<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.670> year<00:00:08.790> now<00:00:09.059> and

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
blender for a little over a year now and

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.839 
blender for a little over a year now and
I've<00:00:09.780> learned<00:00:09.990> so<00:00:10.769> much<00:00:10.889> about<00:00:10.950> it<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.580> wouldn't

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
I've learned so much about it I wouldn't

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.249 
I've learned so much about it I wouldn't
be<00:00:11.940> able<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.179> use<00:00:12.300> it<00:00:12.330> at<00:00:12.570> all<00:00:12.599> if<00:00:12.929> it<00:00:13.049> wasn't

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
be able to use it at all if it wasn't

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.129 
be able to use it at all if it wasn't
for<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.710> blender<00:00:14.070> community<00:00:14.549> so<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.480> decided

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
for the blender community so I decided

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.750 
for the blender community so I decided
to<00:00:16.350> give<00:00:16.500> something<00:00:16.740> back<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:19.160> here<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.400> an

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
to give something back and here is an

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.660 
to give something back and here is an
idea<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:21.119> what<00:00:21.840> we'll<00:00:22.050> be<00:00:22.080> creating<00:00:22.670> creating

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
idea of what we'll be creating creating

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.439 
idea of what we'll be creating creating
a<00:00:24.060> nice<00:00:24.570> metallic<00:00:24.990> looking<00:00:25.470> chains<00:00:26.090> with<00:00:27.090> a

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
go to over here where it says spin 4

go to over here where it says spin 4
degrees<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.610> type<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:11.939> 360<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.810> four<00:01:13.260> steps

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
degrees you type in 360 and four steps

you<00:01:13.920> type<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.280> 32<00:01:14.930> then<00:01:15.930> it's<00:01:16.770> important<00:01:17.220> to

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
you type in 32 then it's important to

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.630 
you type in 32 then it's important to
change<00:01:17.640> back<00:01:17.939> into<00:01:17.970> top<00:01:18.540> into<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.960> front<00:01:19.320> view

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
change back into top into a front view

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.330 
change back into top into a front view
because<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:21.479> axis<00:01:21.900> around<00:01:22.049> which<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:23.100> is

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
because the axis around which this is

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.590 
because the axis around which this is
going<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.790> spin<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.860> actually<00:01:25.860> um<00:01:26.600> depending

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
going to spin is actually um depending

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.319 
going to spin is actually um depending

on the projection of your viewport so if

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.760 
on the projection of your viewport so if
i<00:01:30.390> press<00:01:30.570> spin<00:01:30.840> it's<00:01:31.079> going<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.320> ask<00:01:31.470> me<00:01:31.560> which

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
i press spin it's going to ask me which

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.740 
i press spin it's going to ask me which

and<00:02:13.700> i'm<00:02:14.700> going<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.090> show<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.710> first<00:02:16.710> have<00:02:16.920> to

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
and i'm going to show you first have to

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.620 
and i'm going to show you first have to
get<00:02:17.190> into<00:02:17.400> edit<00:02:17.640> mode<00:02:17.670> make<00:02:18.060> sure<00:02:18.240> all<00:02:18.480> your

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
get into edit mode make sure all your

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.780 
get into edit mode make sure all your
vertices<00:02:19.110> are<00:02:19.290> selected<00:02:19.860> press<00:02:20.070> control<00:02:20.550> n

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
vertices are selected press control n

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.990 
vertices are selected press control n
and<00:02:21.680> confirm<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.920> recalculate<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.730> norms

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
and confirm to recalculate the norms

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.200 
and confirm to recalculate the norms
outside<00:02:24.480> ok<00:02:25.440> there<00:02:25.710> you<00:02:25.740> go<00:02:25.970> now<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.000> have

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
outside ok there you go now you have

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.680 
outside ok there you go now you have
your<00:02:27.240> smooth<00:02:27.600> ring<00:02:27.920> ok<00:02:28.920> press<00:02:29.250> arm<00:02:29.670> this<00:02:30.510> ring

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
your smooth ring ok press arm this ring

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.870 
your smooth ring ok press arm this ring
is<00:02:30.720> really<00:02:31.620> huge<00:02:31.860> we<00:02:32.190> needed<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.550> be<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.730> lot

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
is really huge we needed to be a lot

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.180 
is really huge we needed to be a lot
smaller<00:02:33.150> so<00:02:33.510> press<00:02:33.750> s<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.500> then<00:02:34.680> type<00:02:35.010> in

now<00:02:46.290> press<00:02:47.280> s<00:02:47.520> and<00:02:47.880> scale<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.480> lattice<00:02:48.780> up

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
now press s and scale the lattice up

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.910 
now press s and scale the lattice up
until<00:02:49.980> it's<00:02:50.489> bigger<00:02:50.850> than<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.270> ring<00:02:51.770> ok<00:02:52.770> now

as<00:04:10.440> well<00:04:10.620> right<00:04:11.130> here<00:04:11.340> so<00:04:12.239> if<00:04:12.900> you're<00:04:13.079> working

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
as well right here so if you're working

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.949 
as well right here so if you're working
in<00:04:13.560> orthographic<00:04:14.010> view<00:04:14.730> right<00:04:15.120> in<00:04:15.299> front<00:04:15.570> it's

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
in orthographic view right in front it's

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.280 
in orthographic view right in front it's
always<00:04:16.410> important<00:04:16.979> to<00:04:17.040> select<00:04:17.910> all<00:04:18.269> over<00:04:18.780> it

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
always important to select all over it

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.289 
always important to select all over it
usually<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.890> easiest<00:04:19.919> way<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.760> use<00:04:20.940> box

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
usually the easiest way to to use box

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.000 
usually the easiest way to to use box
select<00:04:21.690> because<00:04:21.959> it<00:04:22.080> will<00:04:22.260> select<00:04:22.590> everything

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
select because it will select everything

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.090 
select because it will select everything
behind<00:04:23.669> it<00:04:24.090> if<00:04:24.690> you<00:04:24.840> just<00:04:25.050> select<00:04:25.200> these<00:04:25.500> three

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
behind it if you just select these three

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.850 
behind it if you just select these three
you're<00:04:26.280> gonna<00:04:26.460> miss<00:04:27.390> the<00:04:27.690> latter<00:04:28.110> two<00:04:28.350> but<00:04:28.590> I

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
you're gonna miss the latter two but I

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.780 
you're gonna miss the latter two but I
guess<00:04:29.160> that's<00:04:29.430> obvious<00:04:29.760> so<00:04:30.750> I'll<00:04:31.490> select<00:04:32.490> them

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
guess that's obvious so I'll select them

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.240

we'll<00:07:10.110> do<00:07:10.290> is<00:07:10.530> we'll<00:07:10.800> say<00:07:11.100> are<00:07:11.430> fit<00:07:12.330> to<00:07:12.360> curve

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 
we'll do is we'll say are fit to curve

we'll do is we'll say are fit to curve
length<00:07:13.140> and<00:07:13.820> surprise<00:07:14.820> the<00:07:15.120> curve<00:07:15.360> of<00:07:15.570> course
