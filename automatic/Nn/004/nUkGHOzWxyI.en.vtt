movement patterns a little bit more I

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.420 
movement patterns a little bit more I

corridors or shooting down areas where I

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.820 
corridors or shooting down areas where I
think<00:03:59.310> people<00:04:00.180> will<00:04:00.300> be<00:04:00.390> coming<00:04:00.840> from<00:04:01.020> because

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.220 
there's a travel time enemies can walk
into<00:04:05.790> certain<00:04:06.360> places<00:04:06.630> and<00:04:06.990> then<00:04:07.110> perhaps

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
into certain places and then perhaps

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.140 
into certain places and then perhaps
walk<00:04:07.650> straight<00:04:08.070> into<00:04:08.220> your<00:04:08.370> bullet<00:04:08.670> whereas
