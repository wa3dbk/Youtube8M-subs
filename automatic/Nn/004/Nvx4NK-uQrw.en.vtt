00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.100 
in here yeah it'll give us the
temperature<00:01:39.689> right<00:01:39.869> here

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
temperature right here

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.170 
temperature right here
totally<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.220> there<00:01:41.340> we<00:01:41.430> go<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.610> got<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:42.060> right

totally so there we go I got that right

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.270 
totally so there we go I got that right
where<00:01:42.390> needs<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.780> wait<00:01:43.079> for<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.380> warm<00:01:43.439> up<00:01:43.740> it

I'm<00:03:10.890> gonna<00:03:11.100> make<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.310> prediction<00:03:11.519> it's<00:03:11.940> gonna

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
I'm gonna make a prediction it's gonna

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.550 
I'm gonna make a prediction it's gonna
be<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.299> same<00:03:12.480> it's<00:03:12.720> gonna<00:03:13.049> be<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.260> same<00:03:13.440> in

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
be the same it's gonna be the same in

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.140 
be the same it's gonna be the same in
terms<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.890> temperature<00:03:14.340> in<00:03:14.579> terms<00:03:14.610> of<00:03:14.910> froth

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
terms of temperature in terms of froth

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.180 
terms of temperature in terms of froth
both<00:03:15.510> just<00:03:15.959> a<00:03:16.019> prediction<00:03:16.290> yeah<00:03:16.590> I<00:03:16.620> think<00:03:16.859> so<00:03:17.160> I

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
both just a prediction yeah I think so I

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.430 
both just a prediction yeah I think so I
mean<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:18.299> functions<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.810> same<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.140> guts<00:03:19.320> on

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
mean it functions the same the guts on

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.289 
mean it functions the same the guts on
the<00:03:19.530> inside<00:03:19.829> of<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.040> same<00:03:20.250> yeah<00:03:21.890> so<00:03:23.209> what<00:03:24.209> did

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
the inside of the same yeah so what did

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.380 
the inside of the same yeah so what did
we<00:03:24.420> get<00:03:24.540> on<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.840> other<00:03:24.959> one<00:03:25.170> 160<00:03:25.739> 170<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.700> 172

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
we get on the other one 160 170 to 172

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.430 
we get on the other one 160 170 to 172
is<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.750> highest<00:03:28.079> yep

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
when we tried this on this machine we

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.009 
when we tried this on this machine we
were<00:03:40.890> getting<00:03:41.160> kind<00:03:41.579> of<00:03:41.700> close<00:03:41.820> to<00:03:42.120> 140<00:03:42.630> it

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
were getting kind of close to 140 it

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.430 
were getting kind of close to 140 it
definitely<00:03:43.739> doesn't<00:03:43.890> seem<00:03:44.220> as<00:03:44.459> hot<00:03:45.079> 133<00:03:46.079> for

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
definitely doesn't seem as hot 133 for

the same the guts are the same this is
the<00:04:05.880> same<00:04:06.030> I<00:04:06.450> mean<00:04:07.140> this<00:04:07.290> this<00:04:07.680> will<00:04:07.919> work<00:04:08.190> let

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
the same I mean this this will work let

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:09.800 
the same I mean this this will work let
me<00:04:08.549> put<00:04:08.760> it<00:04:08.850> that<00:04:08.880> way<00:04:09.000> I<00:04:09.120> don't<00:04:09.510> want<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:09.690> say

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
this won't work because yeah that was

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.280 
this won't work because yeah that was
pretty<00:04:12.269> close<00:04:12.510> to<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.810> temperature

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
pretty close to the temperature

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.420 
pretty close to the temperature
we<00:04:13.319> were<00:04:13.409> getting<00:04:13.530> on<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.799> excelsis<00:04:14.250> is

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
we were getting on the excelsis is

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.629 
we were getting on the excelsis is
anywhere<00:04:14.760> from<00:04:14.819> 135<00:04:15.599> to<00:04:15.659> 145<00:04:16.440> 141<00:04:17.340> something

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
anywhere from 135 to 145 141 something

like that yeah and this I was really
surprised<00:04:19.799> at<00:04:19.949> how<00:04:19.979> hot<00:04:20.280> this<00:04:20.459> just<00:04:20.729> got<00:04:20.910> yeah

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
surprised at how hot this just got yeah

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.090 
surprised at how hot this just got yeah
that<00:04:21.479> was<00:04:21.660> that<00:04:21.870> was<00:04:22.019> it's<00:04:22.259> a<00:04:22.410> stainless<00:04:22.710> key<00:04:22.949> I

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100

Gail<00:04:27.240> always<00:04:27.690> knows<00:04:27.960> Salus<00:04:28.710> versus<00:04:29.100> black

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
Gail always knows Salus versus black

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.760 
Gail always knows Salus versus black
plastic<00:04:30.240> of<00:04:31.229> course<00:04:31.289> the<00:04:31.889> duh<00:04:32.630> no<00:04:33.630> I<00:04:33.990> I<00:04:34.110> don't<00:04:34.590> I

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
plastic of course the duh no I I don't I

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.390 
plastic of course the duh no I I don't I
don't<00:04:34.830> get<00:04:35.070> it

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
don't get it

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.279 
don't get it
I'm<00:04:35.820> not<00:04:36.000> quite<00:04:36.389> sure<00:04:36.419> why<00:04:36.780> it's<00:04:36.930> so<00:04:37.110> much

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
I'm not quite sure why it's so much

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:40.189 
I'm not quite sure why it's so much
hotter<00:04:37.530> but<00:04:37.949> either<00:04:38.280> way<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:39.389> this<00:04:39.720> would<00:04:40.020> work

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
hotter but either way it this would work

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:41.920 
hotter but either way it this would work
if<00:04:40.380> you<00:04:40.710> know<00:04:40.830> if<00:04:40.919> you<00:04:41.039> have<00:04:41.220> a<00:04:41.250> focus<00:04:41.490> and

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
if you know if you have a focus and

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.150 
if you know if you have a focus and
you're<00:04:42.930> manually<00:04:43.320> steam<00:04:43.620> your<00:04:43.770> milk<00:04:43.830> and<00:04:44.039> you

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
you're manually steam your milk and you

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.290 
you're manually steam your milk and you
don't<00:04:44.340> want<00:04:44.460> to<00:04:44.490> do<00:04:44.610> that<00:04:44.729> you<00:04:44.880> want<00:04:45.060> it<00:04:45.120> to<00:04:45.210> be

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
don't want to do that you want it to be

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.180 
don't want to do that you want it to be
a<00:04:45.330> little<00:04:45.479> more<00:04:45.630> automated<00:04:46.199> on<00:04:46.680> this<00:04:47.039> would

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
a little more automated on this would

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.379 
a little more automated on this would
work<00:04:47.310> on<00:04:47.460> your<00:04:47.580> machine<00:04:47.820> just<00:04:47.849> fine<00:04:48.240> well

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
work on your machine just fine well

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.029 
work on your machine just fine well
that's<00:04:48.630> why<00:04:48.810> we<00:04:48.960> did<00:04:49.139> this<00:04:49.259> experiment<00:04:49.680> to<00:04:49.919> see

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
that's why we did this experiment to see

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.640 
that's why we did this experiment to see
if<00:04:50.070> it<00:04:50.220> would<00:04:50.340> work<00:04:50.400> and<00:04:50.729> it<00:04:50.849> does<00:04:51.030> yeah<00:04:51.330> so<00:04:51.780> hmm

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
if it would work and it does yeah so hmm

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.210 
if it would work and it does yeah so hmm
I'll<00:04:52.800> be<00:04:52.919> darned

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
I'll be darned

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.040 
I'll be darned
so<00:04:53.430> we<00:04:53.550> have<00:04:53.729> that<00:04:53.910> available<00:04:54.330> as<00:04:54.449> a<00:04:54.479> parts<00:04:54.840> kit
