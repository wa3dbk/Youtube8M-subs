 And the upper body does not have a cat but does not tilt too much forward 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:47.470
 The face turns down all the time and at this time 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:53.720
 Please completely remove the power of the person and the monk 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:58.100
 And please squat down with the intention to sit in the back position 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:03.620
 A way to push squatting enough at this time full squat of market 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:08.409
 It is a dolly to try while looking at the mirror because this has not been done surprisingly to everyone 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:13.340
 You will find that you have to go as far as you want 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:18.240

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.300
 Please contract 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:39.159
 I feel like I keep putting power on the thighs throughout the operation 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:43.190
 It is easy to do with arms folded behind 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:48.890
 Speed of the vertical movement is in the individual 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.990
 It may be easier to grasp the sense of stretch and contraction if it is done by the quick movement at first 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.530
 Hmm 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:58.330
 Of course you can do it by slow training 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.700
 Because some people that it is that the person is feeling a pillar inn of foot 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:06.420
 is 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:08.399
 As you push up the ground with the sole of the foot when you stand up, you feel the contraction of the muscle of the foot sideways 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:16.140
 can do 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:18.799
 How many times have you repeated it? After going to bed all the time during operation of the squat and the tension of the mitral muscle is law 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.799
 Put it down please 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.860
