mechanism<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.970> bit<00:02:06.299> buggy<00:02:06.630> as<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:07.260> just<00:02:07.440> saw

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
mechanism is a bit buggy as you just saw

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.340 
mechanism is a bit buggy as you just saw
it<00:02:07.950> was<00:02:08.250> almost<00:02:08.490> point-blank<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:10.020> managed

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
it was almost point-blank and it managed

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.010 
it was almost point-blank and it managed
to<00:02:10.410> miss<00:02:10.709> me<00:02:10.979> somehow<00:02:11.300> but<00:02:12.300> there<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.600> go<00:02:12.660> as

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
to miss me somehow but there you go as

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.780 
to miss me somehow but there you go as
you<00:02:13.050> can<00:02:13.260> see<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.740> hits<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.580> causes

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
you can see it hits you and it causes

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.100 
you can see it hits you and it causes
three<00:02:15.180> hearts<00:02:15.450> of<00:02:15.569> damage

now<00:02:16.470> all<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:17.100> Daleks<00:02:17.310> will<00:02:17.670> spawn<00:02:17.970> in

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
now all the Daleks will spawn in

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.090 
now all the Daleks will spawn in
naturally<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:19.080> when<00:02:19.380> you<00:02:19.530> kill<00:02:19.740> them<00:02:19.920> they

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
naturally and when you kill them they

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.300 
naturally and when you kill them they
will<00:02:20.459> all<00:02:20.700> just<00:02:21.270> one<00:02:21.660> darken<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.260> minger<00:02:22.770> which

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
will all just one darken a minger which

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.370 
will all just one darken a minger which
you<00:02:23.459> can<00:02:23.640> use<00:02:23.819> to<00:02:23.970> make<00:02:24.090> Dalek<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.690> Miam<00:02:24.989> armor

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
you can use to make Dalek a Miam armor

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.740 
you can use to make Dalek a Miam armor
which<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.920> strongest<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.940> game<00:02:27.150> so

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
which is the strongest in the game so

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.199 
which is the strongest in the game so
that<00:02:28.020> was<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.500> red<00:02:28.709> Dalek<00:02:29.069> I'll<00:02:29.310> go<00:02:29.700> ahead<00:02:29.819> and

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
that was the red Dalek I'll go ahead and

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.479 
that was the red Dalek I'll go ahead and
show<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.810> zoom<00:02:30.989> Preem<00:02:31.319> Dalek<00:02:31.709> now<00:02:32.190> this

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
show you the zoom Preem Dalek now this

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.729 
show you the zoom Preem Dalek now this
one<00:02:32.670> again<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.209> red<00:02:33.540> it's<00:02:33.989> exactly<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.530> same

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
one again is red it's exactly the same

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.650 
one again is red it's exactly the same
except<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.310> colors<00:02:35.640> are<00:02:35.760> different<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.239> it's

world<00:03:39.600> that<00:03:39.870> didn't<00:03:40.109> really<00:03:40.200> make<00:03:40.380> sense<00:03:40.440> but

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
world that didn't really make sense but

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.610 
world that didn't really make sense but
basically<00:03:41.609> it's<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.090> squid<00:03:42.359> it's<00:03:42.750> useless<00:03:43.230> it

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
basically it's a squid it's useless it

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.470 
basically it's a squid it's useless it
just<00:03:43.859> swims<00:03:44.040> around<00:03:44.220> in<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.459> water<00:03:44.670> doesn't

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
just swims around in the water doesn't

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.900 
just swims around in the water doesn't
do<00:03:45.810> anything<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.890> doesn't<00:03:47.100> attack<00:03:47.459> you<00:03:47.730> and

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
do anything it doesn't attack you and

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.479 
do anything it doesn't attack you and
when<00:03:48.570> you<00:03:48.660> kill<00:03:48.840> it<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:49.049> drops<00:03:49.350> ink<00:03:49.650> sacs<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:50.459> I

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
when you kill it it drops ink sacs so I

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.580 
when you kill it it drops ink sacs so I
think<00:03:50.640> that's<00:03:50.940> kind<00:03:51.180> of<00:03:51.239> like<00:03:51.359> a<00:03:51.420> mean<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:52.019> the

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
think that's kind of like a mean of the

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.380 
think that's kind of like a mean of the
squid<00:03:52.859> just<00:03:53.280> showing<00:03:53.519> you<00:03:53.640> all<00:03:53.880> these<00:03:54.150> darts

are really powerful

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.610 
are really powerful

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
would normally craft armor but out of

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.530 
would normally craft armor but out of
dalekanium<00:04:40.280> ingots<00:04:40.850> which<00:04:41.090> are<00:04:41.240> obtained

00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:58.910 
so lastly we have the cyber leader so if

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.820 
so lastly we have the cyber leader so if
you<00:06:59.120> spawn<00:06:59.360> us<00:06:59.510> in<00:06:59.690> it<00:07:00.080> looks<00:07:00.350> kind<00:07:00.560> of<00:07:00.620> more

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:00.830 
you spawn us in it looks kind of more

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.500 
you spawn us in it looks kind of more
like<00:07:00.980> one<00:07:01.220> of<00:07:01.310> the<00:07:01.430> more<00:07:01.640> modern<00:07:02.030> Cybermen

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:02.510 
like one of the more modern Cybermen

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.450 
like one of the more modern Cybermen
which<00:07:03.200> is<00:07:03.350> fair<00:07:03.530> enough<00:07:03.680> because<00:07:03.860> the<00:07:04.190> cyber

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:04.460 
which is fair enough because the cyber

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.790 
which is fair enough because the cyber
leader<00:07:04.700> is<00:07:05.150> more<00:07:05.570> of<00:07:05.630> a<00:07:05.690> modern<00:07:06.020> Cyberman

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 
leader is more of a modern Cyberman

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.830 
leader is more of a modern Cyberman
now<00:07:07.160> as<00:07:07.400> it<00:07:07.610> hits<00:07:07.790> you<00:07:07.940> again<00:07:08.090> and<00:07:08.570> we'll<00:07:08.690> just

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 
now as it hits you again and we'll just

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.930 
now as it hits you again and we'll just
do<00:07:08.990> one<00:07:09.230> heart<00:07:09.470> of<00:07:09.560> damage<00:07:09.920> it's<00:07:10.520> pretty<00:07:10.790> much

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940 
do one heart of damage it's pretty much

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.480 
do one heart of damage it's pretty much
the<00:07:11.120> same<00:07:11.330> in<00:07:11.600> all<00:07:11.930> ways<00:07:12.170> to<00:07:12.530> the<00:07:12.980> Cyberman

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:13.490 
the same in all ways to the Cyberman

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.640 
the same in all ways to the Cyberman
except<00:07:14.240> this<00:07:14.360> coffin<00:07:14.750> I<00:07:14.900> think<00:07:15.020> is<00:07:15.320> a<00:07:15.350> much

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:15.650 
except this coffin I think is a much

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.650 
except this coffin I think is a much
better<00:07:15.890> texture<00:07:16.430> as<00:07:16.760> you<00:07:17.030> can<00:07:17.150> see<00:07:17.360> it's<00:07:17.510> got

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:17.660 
better texture as you can see it's got

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.630 
better texture as you can see it's got
the<00:07:17.750> little<00:07:17.960> blue<00:07:18.290> mouth<00:07:18.620> which<00:07:19.160> light<00:07:19.430> up

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:19.640 
the little blue mouth which light up

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.970 
the little blue mouth which light up
when<00:07:19.790> it<00:07:19.880> talks<00:07:20.150> it<00:07:20.750> makes<00:07:20.960> the<00:07:21.140> same<00:07:21.320> clunking

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:21.980 
when it talks it makes the same clunking

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.159 
when it talks it makes the same clunking
noise<00:07:22.130> as<00:07:22.370> it<00:07:22.490> walks<00:07:22.700> and<00:07:23.000> you<00:07:23.510> can<00:07:23.660> see<00:07:23.900> its

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:24.169 
noise as it walks and you can see its

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:26.560 
noise as it walks and you can see its
brain<00:07:24.560> in<00:07:24.980> the<00:07:25.340> top<00:07:25.520> of<00:07:25.640> its<00:07:25.760> head<00:07:25.820> how<00:07:26.120> weird

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:26.570 
brain in the top of its head how weird

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.140 
brain in the top of its head how weird
is<00:07:26.690> that<00:07:26.720> it's<00:07:27.260> so<00:07:27.590> cool<00:07:27.830> I<00:07:27.890> think<00:07:28.070> but<00:07:29.000> yeah

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:29.150 
is that it's so cool I think but yeah

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.150 
is that it's so cool I think but yeah
that<00:07:29.480> is<00:07:29.510> the<00:07:29.630> cyber<00:07:29.960> leader<00:07:30.200> I<00:07:30.500> can<00:07:30.800> go<00:07:30.919> ahead

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.160 
that is the cyber leader I can go ahead

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.130 
that is the cyber leader I can go ahead
and<00:07:31.430> kill<00:07:31.640> it<00:07:31.760> it's<00:07:32.210> not<00:07:32.390> really<00:07:32.600> any<00:07:32.720> tougher

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:33.140 
and kill it it's not really any tougher

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.800 
and kill it it's not really any tougher
as<00:07:33.320> you<00:07:33.770> can<00:07:33.919> see<00:07:34.160> it<00:07:34.700> drops<00:07:35.030> exactly<00:07:35.480> the<00:07:35.630> same

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:35.810 
as you can see it drops exactly the same

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.380 
as you can see it drops exactly the same
things<00:07:36.110> but<00:07:37.040> yeah<00:07:37.250> those<00:07:37.550> are<00:07:37.730> the<00:07:37.820> Cybermen<00:07:38.240> I

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:38.390 
things but yeah those are the Cybermen I

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:40.030
