want to spend more time on and then I
can<00:01:25.600> delegate<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.320> simple<00:01:26.680> restorative

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
can handle very well so definitely it

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.219 
can handle very well so definitely it
allows<00:01:32.080> me<00:01:32.110> more<00:01:32.799> time<00:01:33.729> to<00:01:33.990> do<00:01:34.990> bigger

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
allows me more time to do bigger

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.800 
allows me more time to do bigger
procedures<00:01:35.740> and<00:01:36.159> mainly<00:01:37.090> procedures<00:01:37.540> of<00:01:37.659> my

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
choice so I was a little hesitant about

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.469 
choice so I was a little hesitant about
their<00:01:41.049> training<00:01:41.560> and<00:01:41.799> I<00:01:41.950> wasn't<00:01:42.159> sure<00:01:42.479> that

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
their training and I wasn't sure that
