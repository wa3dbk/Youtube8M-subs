it<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.850> can<00:03:12.000> feel<00:03:12.120> all<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.450> heat<00:03:12.630> coming

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
it you can feel all the heat coming

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.009 
it you can feel all the heat coming
right<00:03:13.080> off<00:03:13.110> it<00:03:17.090> how<00:03:18.090> these<00:03:18.269> work<00:03:18.600> is<00:03:18.840> when

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
right off it how these work is when

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.530 
right off it how these work is when
candles<00:03:19.410> normally<00:03:19.799> burn<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.970> heat<00:03:21.150> just<00:03:21.390> goes

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
candles normally burn the heat just goes

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.940 
candles normally burn the heat just goes
straight<00:03:21.870> up<00:03:21.930> towards<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.440> ceiling<00:03:22.650> and

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
straight up towards the ceiling and

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.890 
straight up towards the ceiling and
disperses<00:03:23.459> throughout<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.850> whole<00:03:24.030> room<00:03:24.269> this

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
disperses throughout the whole room this

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.199 
disperses throughout the whole room this
grabs<00:03:25.350> almost<00:03:25.830> all<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:26.220> heat<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.610> saturates

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
grabs almost all the heat and saturates

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.120 
grabs almost all the heat and saturates
those<00:03:27.510> clay<00:03:27.810> pots<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.680> then<00:03:28.890> it<00:03:28.980> just

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
those clay pots and then it just

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.949 
those clay pots and then it just
emanates<00:03:29.549> out<00:03:29.730> slowly<00:03:30.060> kind<00:03:30.390> of<00:03:30.540> like<00:03:30.660> a<00:03:30.690> wood

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
emanates out slowly kind of like a wood

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:39.130 
emanates out slowly kind of like a wood
stove

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.640 

it's<00:03:40.140> been<00:03:40.349> off<00:03:40.470> now<00:03:40.800> for<00:03:40.830> Oh<00:03:42.260> 15<00:03:43.260> maybe<00:03:43.530> 20

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
it's been off now for Oh 15 maybe 20

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.040 
it's been off now for Oh 15 maybe 20
minutes<00:03:44.069> it<00:03:44.610> seems<00:03:45.090> like<00:03:45.300> it's<00:03:45.480> just<00:03:45.750> as<00:03:45.900> hot

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
minutes it seems like it's just as hot

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.360 
minutes it seems like it's just as hot
as<00:03:46.170> it<00:03:46.290> was<00:03:46.410> when<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.709> candles<00:03:47.069> are<00:03:47.160> under

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
as it was when the candles are under

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.890 
as it was when the candles are under
there<00:03:47.489> I<00:03:47.520> still<00:03:47.849> can't<00:03:48.120> touch<00:03:48.270> it<00:03:48.330> longer<00:03:48.750> than

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
there I still can't touch it longer than

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.430 
there I still can't touch it longer than
what<00:03:49.050> you<00:03:49.170> say<00:03:49.410> it's<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.430> same<00:03:50.959> that's<00:03:51.959> really

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
what you say it's the same that's really

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.080 
what you say it's the same that's really
hot<00:03:52.620> but<00:03:53.160> this<00:03:53.280> is<00:03:53.430> going<00:03:53.580> to<00:03:53.640> stay<00:03:53.760> hot<00:03:53.880> for

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
hot but this is going to stay hot for

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.490 
hot but this is going to stay hot for
like<00:03:54.209> an<00:03:54.330> hour<00:03:54.480> or<00:03:55.069> more<00:03:56.930> okay<00:03:57.930> so<00:03:57.989> here<00:03:58.319> it<00:03:58.410> is

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
like an hour or more okay so here it is

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.860 
like an hour or more okay so here it is
again<00:03:58.800> through<00:03:59.430> experimentation<00:04:00.090> I<00:04:00.390> realized

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
again through experimentation I realized

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.890 
again through experimentation I realized
you<00:04:01.110> do<00:04:01.260> not<00:04:01.470> need<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:02.069> third<00:04:02.340> pot<00:04:02.670> if<00:04:03.420> you're

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
you do not need the third pot if you're

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.150 
you do not need the third pot if you're
using<00:04:04.110> two<00:04:04.500> large<00:04:04.920> thick<00:04:05.489> pots<00:04:06.360> like<00:04:06.660> this

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
using two large thick pots like this

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.820 
using two large thick pots like this
unglazed<00:04:08.160> of<00:04:08.400> course<00:04:08.700> a<00:04:09.440> tents<00:04:10.440> almost

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
unglazed of course a tents almost

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.160 
unglazed of course a tents almost
holding<00:04:11.130> too<00:04:11.400> much<00:04:11.580> heat<00:04:11.910> but<00:04:12.540> two<00:04:12.780> should<00:04:13.050> be

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
holding too much heat but two should be

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.440 
holding too much heat but two should be
perfect<00:04:13.709> unless<00:04:14.370> you're<00:04:14.640> using<00:04:14.819> like<00:04:15.090> smaller

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
perfect unless you're using like smaller

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.920 
perfect unless you're using like smaller
or<00:04:15.720> thinner<00:04:15.750> ones<00:04:16.169> and<00:04:16.380> go<00:04:16.500> with<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.739> three

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
or thinner ones and go with the three

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.300 
or thinner ones and go with the three
just<00:04:18.930> one<00:04:19.079> other<00:04:19.169> thing<00:04:19.290> take<00:04:19.769> care<00:04:20.100> and

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
just one other thing take care and
