that<00:00:54.090> move<00:00:54.330> goes<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.989> whether<00:00:55.170> they<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.620> fill

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
that move goes and whether they can fill

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.070 
that move goes and whether they can fill
the<00:00:56.070> stadium<00:00:56.580> whether<00:00:56.790> they've<00:00:57.030> got<00:00:57.330> the

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
the stadium whether they've got the

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.500 
the stadium whether they've got the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
tread the following to do that but it is

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.990 
tread the following to do that but it is
a<00:01:00.540> forward<00:01:00.930> move<00:01:01.860> for<00:01:02.160> them<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.370> think<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:02.850> a

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
a forward move for them I think it's a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.039 
a forward move for them I think it's a
progressive<00:01:03.510> one

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
progressive one

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.289

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.030 

maybe<00:03:40.180> express<00:03:40.750> it<00:03:40.870> a<00:03:40.960> bit<00:03:41.110> more<00:03:41.260> but<00:03:41.320> it's<00:03:41.620> 200

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040
