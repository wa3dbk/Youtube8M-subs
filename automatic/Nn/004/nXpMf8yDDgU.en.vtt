00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:09.710
 good I will show you how to install the live 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.500
 loud 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.940
 the paid version 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.750
 in the description of the video I leave you 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.750
 the link 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.970
 and they download it happen to the south 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.130
 they do not pass to your cell phone 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.960
 banal 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:43.210
 folder where they downloaded it 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.210
 in the case I have it I think here 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.500
 and it is this 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.980
 in the install it already I have it 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.650
 installed therefore I'm not going to 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:07.000
 re -do the install it gives you no 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:09.580
 accept it normally as it is installed 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.320
 any application 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.320
 once they have them installed 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.640
 they will go to option to adjustments 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.900
 and they will have to activate in options of 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.570
 developing 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.890
 activate the debugging and in the 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.430
 accessibility 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.030
 they appear services in live loud le 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.030
 they give to activate 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.300
 and that's it 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.300
 that is the configuration for this part 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.000
 so that it works well 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.000
 and then enter life low 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.600
 I remind you this is the paid version 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.600
 and in the 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.760
 the app store 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.760
 I do not remember how much it costs 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.110
 but here I leave them for free 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.500
 we wait for him to load 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.640
 It is a very good application 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.780
 is this this is the last lesson and if 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:50.250
 it appears in English 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.250
 the great here in settings 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.440
 I can not 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.440
 they give in 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.100
 Languages 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.500
 choose the language 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.990
 and here in notifications we are going to 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.600
 configure the 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:29.680
 as we want 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:34.230
 for example here in low battery 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.230
 you are given to activate notification 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.300
 Well to save battery I have you 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.690
 to turn it off while it's charging 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.690
 mobile 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.240
 for that part of the light here the active 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.820
 in the color that you leave 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.910
 and here the speed they want 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.540
 it appears 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.540
 in me 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.960
 and for my part I have it in slow 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.690
 and if they want me to also broadcast some 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.819
 application sound is also what 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.300
 can configure from here nobody 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:14.550
 I configured it because it does not seem like 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:18.040
 I only need the one that illuminates the led 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.380
 to verify the color to not be 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.730
 hoping it's the download the 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.730
 bacteria or this one give you here 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:30.680
 in this option and there is a test mode 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.600
 enabled then some are 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.230
 activate others should turn off the 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.889
 screen and and and they look at how it works 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:43.400
 its law 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:46.490
 and that's all it's really simple 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.340
 one more time and here are all the 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.440
 applications by putting the color of the 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.290
 age who want 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.840
 to the application that I want I can not 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.500
 show them how to light the led because 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.840
 I'm recording the screen only 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:06.300
 but I can swear to you and make sure 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.550
 that works perfectly is a sony 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.860
 ericsson walkman light in this works 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.980
 to perfection we in others 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.080
 but 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.590
 have all the security that the 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.590
 it will work 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.080
 obviously being a root user 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.970
 well do not forget to give like and share 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.970
 the video and subscribe 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.200
