00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.770
 first of all we hit all four 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.770
 the eggs in a bowl 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.899
 meanwhile we slowly add it 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:58.899
 sugar 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:24.280
 we also add the grated rind 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:32.229
 of the lemon we add the milk to the compote 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:34.450
 let warm in a saucepan we take 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.140
 we print and fill the bottom of 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.140
 caramel 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.080
 this is packaged but you can too 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.080
 make it at home 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:11.810
 bake the baked molds 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.810
 preheated to 180 degrees for an hour 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.420
 the result will be tasty and 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.420
 very soft plans
