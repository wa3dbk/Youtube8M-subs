it's being shown live to over 200
countries<00:00:33.820> I<00:00:38.820> think<00:00:39.820> that<00:00:40.270> the<00:00:40.780> world<00:00:40.960> has

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
countries I think that the world has

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.990 
countries I think that the world has
taken<00:00:41.290> notice<00:00:41.680> of<00:00:42.010> who<00:00:42.460> this<00:00:42.580> young<00:00:42.760> man<00:00:42.820> is

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
taken notice of who this young man is

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.850 
taken notice of who this young man is
and<00:00:43.449> that's<00:00:44.080> what<00:00:44.230> we're<00:00:44.410> aiming<00:00:44.440> for<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
and that's what we're aiming for the

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.560 
and that's what we're aiming for the
difference<00:00:48.220> between<00:00:49.650> 2013<00:00:50.650> March<00:00:51.300> last<00:00:52.300> year

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
difference between 2013 March last year

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.720 
difference between 2013 March last year
when<00:00:52.809> we<00:00:52.839> file<00:00:53.290> a<00:00:53.320> cheetah<00:00:53.650> here<00:00:53.949> is<00:00:54.460> that

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
when we file a cheetah here is that

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.549 
when we file a cheetah here is that
we've<00:00:54.879> had<00:00:55.089> several<00:00:55.750> training<00:00:56.170> camps<00:00:56.470> since

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
we've had several training camps since

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.060 
we've had several training camps since
then<00:00:56.829> and<00:00:57.129> the<00:00:57.909> progress<00:00:58.329> has<00:00:58.449> been<00:00:59.070> dramatic

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
then and the progress has been dramatic

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.760 
then and the progress has been dramatic
in<00:01:00.579> his<00:01:00.730> improvement<00:01:01.270> so<00:01:01.449> he's<00:01:02.320> a<00:01:02.350> been<00:01:02.590> much

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
in his improvement so he's a been much

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:11.770 
in his improvement so he's a been much
better<00:01:02.920> fighter<00:01:03.219> did<00:01:03.430> it

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.840 

I<00:01:12.040> think<00:01:13.040> what<00:01:13.159> makes<00:01:13.310> them<00:01:13.490> better<00:01:13.520> is<00:01:13.820> that

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
I think what makes them better is that

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.520 
I think what makes them better is that
we've<00:01:14.090> been<00:01:14.180> able<00:01:14.330> to<00:01:14.479> work<00:01:14.690> on<00:01:14.869> particular

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
we've been able to work on particular

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.649 
we've been able to work on particular
things<00:01:15.860> that<00:01:16.510> we<00:01:17.510> needed<00:01:17.690> to<00:01:17.780> improve<00:01:18.110> on

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
things that we needed to improve on

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.950 
things that we needed to improve on
patience<00:01:21.130> distance<00:01:22.299> not<00:01:23.299> looking<00:01:23.630> for<00:01:23.810> one

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
patience distance not looking for one

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.770 
patience distance not looking for one
shot<00:01:24.200> there's<00:01:24.830> a<00:01:24.890> lot<00:01:25.040> of<00:01:25.159> things<00:01:25.369> that

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
shot there's a lot of things that

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.749
