00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:11.450
 to be what you'll need a glaze 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.389
 Nail of any color for the base 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.799
 enamel diffuser this is the one that is used 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.250
 for when the glazes are put 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.250
 thick 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.460
 mixing vessel 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.720
 and talc 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.720
 started painting the nails in one color 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:42.300
 normal the one that I had days 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:46.820
 let's mix in our container 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.820
 Talc and diffuser in equal parts 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.820
 the texture you should get is something 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.820
 similar to a nail shine 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.310
 remember to mix them very well every time 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.310
 that you apply diffuser 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.500
 although very thick 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.750
 apply more diffuser data 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.710
 you can help with a brush of some 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.390
 enamel you have already finished the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.040
 clean very well with acetone and you 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.040
 will serve for this in many other courses 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.130
 when you've gotten the texture of 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.290
 shine simply taking and put it on 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.770
 the nail as if it were a layer of enamel 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.770
 normal 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:04.290
 and quickly in just a few seconds you 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.290
 enamel will change to a matte texture 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.630
 do not worry about the white edges 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.950
 you can clean them simply with a 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.950
 brochita and a little water 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.770
 you 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.660
 this is the final look I could leave it like this 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.410
 or even just a few small changes to 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.410
 your good mates 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.180
 simply with brightness look at everything 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.180
 you can do in this he did some stripes 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:59.250
 here some circles 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.640
 and then I made a French style 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.640
 mate 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.990
 all the designs then do it 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.990
 simply with nail shine 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.250
 now some tips 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.650
 if it does a little more mixing and the 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.820
 kept in an empty enamel you will be able to 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.820
 have it always at hand 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.790
 so you will not have to do the mixing every 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.110
 once they paint your nails and you can 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.380
 turn into more than the enamel that 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.380
 want 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.650
 another option is to use these glazes 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.799
 that have a craquelure effect 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:49.450
 if you apply it in two layers you will 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.450
 get the same matt effect 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.550
 do not 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:37.970
