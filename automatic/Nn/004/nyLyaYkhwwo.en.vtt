00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.520
 good 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:21.720
 I recorded this afternoon about 20 videos 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.119
 about radiological signs terms that 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.420
 appear in the resonance reports 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.880
 of the biographies of tomographies 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.010
 performed by radiologists and read by 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.790
 medical trauma bedside 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:39.629
 these reports end up in 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.590
 hands of patients with higher or lower 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:47.940
 information from your doctors and 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:51.540
 with more or less good information 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.020
 intentionally correct or somehow 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:58.290
 healthy to give the person a 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.660
 reference of what happens to you many 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.489
 times an individual who has a pain in 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.150
 his back has a pain in his neck 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.160
 goes where the doctor asking for help 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.770
 who does not know what happens to his 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.870
 patient will do a resonance 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.970
 which is the tool that has so 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.420
 general at hand and that is also a 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.960
 very reputable tool with very good 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.340
 fame this resonance this test reveals 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.860
 that the person has a protrusion 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.890
 disc has a small herniated disc 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.440
 it has some degenerative changes 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:35.640
 spondylitis has I do not know what or I do not know 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.800
 how many and since the doctor continues without 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.390
 really know what happens to this 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.060
 person who can be much more 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.610
 related to work overload 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.770
 with a stress like a lack of rest 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.750
 or with a bad diet with a 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.180
 mechanical problem with bad activity 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.610
 sports with a lot of issues 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.400
 different than of course it would have to be 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.369
 study analyze and spend a lot of time 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.720
 that the safest thing is that this doctor does not 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.090
 have 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.950
 how can you not spend that time as 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.170
 you can not do that research like no 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.840
 can deepen the problem of this 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.880
 person picks up his resonance picks up his 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.210
 herniated disc your changes and politicians and 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:19.380
 says this is your good problem many 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.140
 many many times nothing is further from the 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.110
 reality 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.410
 I'm really tired of seeing 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.800
 daily in my patients consultation 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.420
 they arrive with their magnetic resonance 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.870
 scared because they have a protrusion 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.820
 disc have a herniated disc and have 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.610
 fear of oh my god this I'm going to 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.950
 do that and most of the time 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.640
 the symptomatology of the pain of these 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.800
 people has nothing to do with that 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.160
 herniated disc with that disc production 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.380
 that if I did we go to a thousand people 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.910
 that same resonance of the lower back to 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.350
 people of the same age 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.630
 surely we would meet in 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.769
 many people who do not have any 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.780
 pain that do not have any 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.030
 symptomatology we would find 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.600
 equally those signs is to make us those 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.570
 protections those arthritic changes yes 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.970
 but that in this person the doctor has 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.820
 given the take batch this is your problem 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.970
 This is the cause of your pain. 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.010
 it seems very dangerous to the person very 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.810
 dangerous because in addition if there are other 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.820
 causes that are causing this 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.790
 person has this pain 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.799
 the new guy look 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.019
 if your pain can come from a 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.060
 overload of an emotional conflict that 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.310
 is somatizing from a bad 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.920
 food that definitely does not 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.299
 take care or do a physical activity a 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.640
 lots of causes that can 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.040
 In short, cause me to have a 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.230
 pain in the back but already the individual 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.049
 already has a resonance that says no 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.359
 which is a disc prothesis if the 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.299
 individual is going to stay fixed on that 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:57.090
 fear in that problem and will not look no 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.430
 will look at the real problems of 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.980
 way that my first mission with these 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.750
 people is to convince them to take 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.569
 that resonance and keep it in a drawer 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.299
 deep down or throw it to be able to 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:13.230
 start looking at what is your true 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:14.909
 problem people who have not had in 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.620
 the sense of luck to come to me 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:19.530
 query 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:23.400
 so they can take away the importance of 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.350
 that resonance that care there are times that 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.110
 yes they are resonances with importance and if 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.910
 they are really important signs 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.740
 that are important and have a relationship 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.229
 with his pain does not mean that all 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.260
 the resonances are in that bad sense 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:39.449
 diagnosed but yes many many 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.190
 they respond or are not related 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:44.040
 with the good symptoms as well as 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.620
 said the people who made them a 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.810
 resonance years ago may take years 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.220
 with the resonance as I say saved 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.020
 in your pocket so that every time 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.300
 they go to a doctor they go to a site I do not have 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.310
 one I have a doctor I do not have one 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.500
 production that lower its production its 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.300
 herniated disc carry their resonance 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.210
 diagnosis always been here 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.220
 I think he is people that even 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.830
 has left physical activities that have 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.460
 modified your lifestyle 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.990
 usually it got worse because when 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.880
 one is dominated by fear of air 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.650
 it's mine that I have that protection so 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.200
 general the attitudes they take are not 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.090
 the most healthy but rather 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.880
 restriction of movements 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.740
 restriction of physical activity 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.110
 tighter restriction restriction more 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.080
 fearful I'm not going to I'm not going to if 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.270
 they are people who can take years 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.690
 with that fear in the body that 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.430
 prevents and that he is in this not me 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.700
 one nor two nor three nor five nor ten 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:44.490
 cases of people that my main job 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.290
 it has been taking away that fear of years 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.330
 from those who made that 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.100
 resonance the fact of taking away that 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.220
 fear has made his lumbar muscles 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.320
 have relaxed have done again 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.140
 a physical activity have lost the 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.600
 fear of your body and its symptoms 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.040
 improved having the same herniated disc 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.200
 having the same production of 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.850
 scalextric boom is when with the same 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.400
 degree of osteoarthritis or even more because 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:12.300
 that resonance was made 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:14.460
 five six eight or ten years I wanted to 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.090
 this video that's why I wanted to do this 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.400
 video because I made another 20 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.620
 talking about all the signs and all the 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:25.610
 diagnoses that can occur in a 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:28.520
 resonance to inform the 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.560
 people who read in their reports these 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.090
 expressions so difficult so technical 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.419
 that many times do not mean 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:39.229
 practically nothing are very expressions 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:41.300
 of limbo lovers with with words that 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:43.820
 they come from Latin and they form at the end 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.510
 expressions and nothing more to wear 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.500
 aging changes spondyloarthritis 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:52.150
 spondyloarthritis cause the 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:55.130
 aging are expressions that 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:57.380
 they scare the person and yet 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:00.500
 they hide other things that they do not have 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.600
 what to be, let alone so serious and for 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:06.110
 that I wanted to make this video also for 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:08.330
 explain that not always what appears 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:11.139
 in the resonances is something for which 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.139
 we have to 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.629
 good and this is all I wanted 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.789
 explain about this topic you know that 

00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:21.680
 you can subscribe to our channel 

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:25.099
 youtube that if you liked the video 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:28.370
 you can click on I like it and that you can 

00:07:25.099 --> 00:07:31.039
 share or comment on this video and 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.099
 we are very grateful for that we 

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:33.099
 we see 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.500
 and 

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.270
 but no 

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.640
 yes
