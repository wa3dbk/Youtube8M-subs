00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:04.640
 Hello everyone after a short absence 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.009
 I welcome you again 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.420
 in the dragon scene today I 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:12.290
 will introduce you to the first dragon 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.120
 rare from the region of the i10 which is the 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.700
 first region from which we 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.500
 begins to take the regions 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.660
 that I had presented in my 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.110
 previous videos were regions 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.520
 starting the n 10 is really by 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.470
 excellence the first region in 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.110
 which one begins to have a level 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:34.210
 of difficulty a bit higher if we 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:37.970
 does not have the required level to access it 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.310
 the first dragon of this region is 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.880
 appoint emissaries of the abyss 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:46.760
 finds in the nest then gives in all 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.140
 difficulty levels it's a dragon 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:55.790
 aquatic and harness 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:58.300
 half purple between croco and 1 va 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.680
 to say almost the barracuda 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.410
 a goal that the cave is badly enough 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.579
 enlightened it is quite difficult to the 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.679
 spot but it's not a problem 

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:11.569
 I usually go away from 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:13.219
 following you show her a pop as well as 

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:16.069
 the location of dungeons on the map 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:20.329
 it's gone then to capture it serves 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:21.889
 of the abyss there are two solutions it takes 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.469
 the lighthouse but that is to say to enter 

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:26.929
 the dungeon to up to its place of pop 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.849
 if he does not turn it around or get 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:33.560
 have them demolished voluntarily by 

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:36.079
 mobs where you can get it in flute well 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.759
 obviously personally I have them 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.499
 got in flute I have not yet 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.880
 met in the dungeon because according to this 

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:44.649
 that I could understand and win small 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.569
 subtlety that I will explain to you 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:51.529
 in a short time 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:53.299
 so here is the same of the i10 so 

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:55.369
 composed of two islands 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.979
 a small one that we arrive at 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:03.499
 departure and a big one with the dungeons and 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:05.209
 so it's at the i10 there are four dungeons 

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:06.799
 it is also from this 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:08.750
 region where we start to have 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.040
 four in which one can enter I 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.770
 recalls that in the previous region 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.120
 there were three of which one condemned 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.870
 so the nest gives then so we have the 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.060
 port to do here in law we arrive 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.180
 when we take an airship from the vineyard 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:27.050
 out of united roanne then give 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.980
 find just opposite unite operable enough 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.920
 easily or always levels 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.320
 of difficulty an exploration mode in 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.440
 which words goron level good here 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.900
 it will be 30 31 pretty much and a fashion 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.890
 adventure in which members have 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.720
 your own level 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.640
 in this case if I would be if I 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.640
 choose this mode the mobs will be at 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.370
 level 80 I'm not suicidal 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.590
 so choose it the exploration mode by 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.640
 a priori in the main find in the 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:03.520
 two difficulty modes you see a 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:06.170
 this dungeon changes a little I go quickly 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:10.460
 busy with the graphical configuration because 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.980
 a priori no it's not here because a priori 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:18.110
 I lagain little bit it will not be practical 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:22.820
 that's okay I'll go to 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.180
 lower video quality that's it should 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.390
 pass 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.550
 yeah fir so is called you as 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.850
 you see it's a cave with 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:37.100
 crocos crabs sometimes even 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.520
 frogs game there a little all my 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.010
 apology 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.010
 originally he should be here 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.620
 near the bones so small 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.580
 particularity at the set point is 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:53.740
 long time 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:04:00.310
 if I can hit it here 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:04:01.450
 it is done a priori from what I have 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.700
 heard he say pop 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:11.040
 after killing the boss so we go 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:15.370
 try to kill the offspring of nador 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:18.850
 to then try to make appear 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.400
 squarely emissaries of the abyss after 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.870
 as I say you have it in flute 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.810
 the rare dungeon dragons of the i10 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.080
 come out very very often that is in 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.980
 leaking green blue or violets 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.170
 personally I advocated flow of 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.350
 weert we can get them in bigger 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:42.640
 quantity on a single jet of a single jet 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:44.940
 therefore unknown flute here for what 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.860
 is clearing 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.330
 good so when we first arrive 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.970
 once in this dungeon it's a little bit 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.040
 complicated there the levels 33 it poses 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.380
 no problem you see in one go the 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.990
 month you will see what I saw 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.310
 that the small drop of course those who are 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.410
 interested do not do like me do not 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.110
 do not let the drop 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.340
 So here here is to leave the dungeon I 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.300
 I'm not going to turn around 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:13.180
 and see if for example emissaries 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.830
 abyss is present if it is not 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.260
 present 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:20.860
 it's a bit of a shame after as I say 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:23.170
 since always having flute the three 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.590
 main dungeon dragons of the i10 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.380
 pop very regularly in again 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.360
 today I tested some of them 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.820
 I had emissaries of the abyss and the 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.040
 two others knowing that a acquired pop 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.920
 almost all the time and everyone has 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.980
 want to throw up on so much that 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:44.320
 so much we see that slice then 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.810
 let's see if he's here if he 's not 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.070
 this is a little pity no it is not 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.750
 the 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:55.560
 too bad I have fun killer 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:57.480
 will see them then 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.830
 by ace for a pure emissaries of 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.800
 abysses if you want to see her in the 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:06.870
 donate good you always have the solution 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:08.940
 of the reinitialization of the dungeon that 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.389
 I have that I presented in all 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.389
 first video 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:20.510
 after I can not find this dragon very 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:22.980
 interesting be seen its extreme beauty 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.780
 there are churches of aquatic dragons 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:30.810
 even more beautiful even crocodiles 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:32.930
 elite that we find in lesson after 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.550
 Everyone does what they want 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.740
 small pvp and dragons feature 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:42.660
 aquatic specialists are specialized in 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:45.900
 1.7 world skills I record 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.540
 this video right now after the 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.100
 dragon release of the prophet 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.229
 so level 80 outputs the new 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.300
 map also the pvp also I already have 

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:56.669
 participated in the citadel wars I 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:00.990
 will probably do a tutorial soon 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:03.770
 to explain a little to everyone 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:10.229
 who have not yet understood the basics 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:15.150
 of the pvp system to be able to get out a 

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:17.100
 little bit that's all for this video 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.440
 I hope she will need you and 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.789
 when we serve the abyss and I you 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.380
 find again very quickly for a neighbor 

00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:24.380
 number of the dragon scene
