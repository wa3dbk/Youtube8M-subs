00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
not going to you know normalize my gain

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.719 
not going to you know normalize my gain
or<00:01:08.850> anything<00:01:09.119> like<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.920> now<00:01:10.920> let's<00:01:11.520> take<00:01:11.670> a

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
or anything like that now let's take a

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.520 
or anything like that now let's take a
listen<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.540> background<00:01:12.960> noise<00:01:13.049> again<00:01:13.439> i'm

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
listen to the background noise again i'm

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.410 
listen to the background noise again i'm
in<00:01:13.619> an<00:01:13.710> untreated<00:01:14.220> room<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.119> what<00:01:15.270> my

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
in an untreated room and this is what my

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.410 
in an untreated room and this is what my
room<00:01:15.689> sounds<00:01:16.170> like<00:01:16.200> through<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.100> mic

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.389 

okay<00:01:23.420> so<00:01:24.020> let's<00:01:24.140> do<00:01:24.259> a<00:01:24.320> quick<00:01:24.560> comparison<00:01:24.829> test

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
okay so let's do a quick comparison test

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.940 
okay so let's do a quick comparison test
this<00:01:26.270> is<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.600> sounds<00:01:26.960> coming<00:01:27.200> from<00:01:27.320> my<00:01:27.530> canon

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
this is the sounds coming from my canon

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.529 
this is the sounds coming from my canon

vixia hf s 200 and now we're back to the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.919 
vixia hf s 200 and now we're back to the
road<00:01:32.750> lavalier<00:01:33.229> microphone<00:01:34.090> so<00:01:35.090> why<00:01:35.359> with<00:01:35.750> all

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
road lavalier microphone so why with all

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.569 
road lavalier microphone so why with all
the<00:01:36.079> options<00:01:36.319> available<00:01:36.859> to<00:01:37.100> you<00:01:37.250> would<00:01:37.460> you

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
the options available to you would you

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.730 
the options available to you would you
choose<00:01:37.819> a<00:01:37.880> lavalier<00:01:38.479> microphone<00:01:38.929> what's<00:01:39.560> the

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
choose a lavalier microphone what's the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.730 
choose a lavalier microphone what's the
purpose<00:01:40.009> of<00:01:40.250> a<00:01:40.340> lavalier<00:01:40.789> microphone<00:01:41.740> you

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
purpose of a lavalier microphone you

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.770 
purpose of a lavalier microphone you
know<00:01:42.829> you<00:01:42.920> could<00:01:43.130> get<00:01:43.250> a<00:01:43.310> boom<00:01:43.549> mic<00:01:43.819> or<00:01:44.209> you

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
know you could get a boom mic or you

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.260 
know you could get a boom mic or you
could<00:01:45.049> get<00:01:45.369> you<00:01:46.369> know<00:01:46.399> you<00:01:46.549> could<00:01:46.819> just<00:01:46.969> run

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270
