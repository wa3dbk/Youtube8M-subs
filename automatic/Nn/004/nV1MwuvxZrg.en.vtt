again<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.500> third<00:02:17.769> time<00:02:18.040> when<00:02:18.250> we<00:02:18.340> fill<00:02:18.700> it<00:02:18.790> up

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
again the third time when we fill it up

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.360 
again the third time when we fill it up
we'll<00:02:19.180> put<00:02:19.420> about<00:02:19.630> three<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.319> a<00:02:20.380> quarter

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
we'll put about three and a quarter

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.160 
we'll put about three and a quarter
quarts<00:02:21.850> in<00:02:22.000> just<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.540> make<00:02:22.750> sure<00:02:22.780> it's<00:02:23.050> all

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
quarts in just to make sure it's all

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.870 
quarts in just to make sure it's all
filled<00:02:23.440> up<00:02:23.530> all<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.800> way<00:02:23.950> so<00:02:24.190> that's<00:02:24.730> where

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
filled up all the way so that's where

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.630 
filled up all the way so that's where
the<00:02:24.940> transmission<00:02:25.330> fluid<00:02:25.480> goes<00:02:26.110> in<00:02:26.440> its<00:02:27.340> best

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
the transmission fluid goes in its best

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.040 
the transmission fluid goes in its best
to<00:02:27.880> descent<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.360> battery<00:02:28.660> or<00:02:28.780> take<00:02:28.959> the

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
to descent the battery or take the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.110 
to descent the battery or take the
negative<00:02:29.380> off<00:02:29.530> first<00:02:29.830> just<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.400> have<00:02:30.850> that<00:02:31.000> out

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
negative off first just to have that out

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.210 
negative off first just to have that out
of<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.209> way<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.680> when<00:02:32.680> how<00:02:32.769> many<00:02:32.920> problems

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
of the way and when how many problems

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.680 
of the way and when how many problems
make<00:02:33.370> sure<00:02:33.489> you<00:02:33.610> have<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.150> code<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.660> your

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
make sure you have the code to your

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.690 
make sure you have the code to your
stereo<00:02:35.140> because<00:02:35.980> they<00:02:36.160> will<00:02:36.310> reset<00:02:36.670> that<00:02:37.650> now

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
stereo because they will reset that now

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.990 
stereo because they will reset that now
to<00:02:40.440> running<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.530> transmission<00:02:42.040> fluid<00:02:42.160> you

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
to running the transmission fluid you

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.070 
to running the transmission fluid you
need<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.239> find<00:02:43.450> where<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.840> transmission

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
need to find where the transmission

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.590 
need to find where the transmission
fluid<00:02:44.350> comes<00:02:44.650> out<00:02:44.830> you<00:02:45.220> need<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.459> bucket<00:02:45.670> to

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
fluid comes out you need a bucket to

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.509 
fluid comes out you need a bucket to
catch<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.930> transmission<00:02:47.470> fluid<00:02:47.709> old<00:02:48.250> fluid

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
catch the transmission fluid old fluid

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:57.480 
catch the transmission fluid old fluid
and<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.959> goes<00:02:50.140> right<00:02:50.440> here

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.110 

this<00:02:58.090> bolt<00:02:58.390> right<00:02:58.450> here<00:02:59.520> that<00:03:00.520> is<00:03:00.760> where<00:03:00.970> the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
this bolt right here that is where the

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.360 
this bolt right here that is where the
transmission<00:03:01.360> fluid<00:03:01.660> comes<00:03:01.990> out<00:03:02.160> so<00:03:03.160> you'll

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
transmission fluid comes out so you'll

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.850 
transmission fluid comes out so you'll
need<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:04.540> undo<00:03:04.780> that<00:03:04.990> I<00:03:05.230> have<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.360> socket<00:03:07.860> wrench

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
need to undo that I have a socket wrench

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.750 
need to undo that I have a socket wrench
and<00:03:09.160> it<00:03:09.700> fits<00:03:09.940> perfectly<00:03:10.360> in<00:03:10.540> there<00:03:11.040> that<00:03:12.040> it's

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
and it fits perfectly in there that it's

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.470 
and it fits perfectly in there that it's
not<00:03:13.050> actually<00:03:14.050> you<00:03:14.140> don't<00:03:14.230> need<00:03:14.470> a<00:03:14.500> socket

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
not actually you don't need a socket

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.870 
not actually you don't need a socket
just<00:03:16.480> put<00:03:16.750> that<00:03:16.870> on<00:03:16.930> there<00:03:18.330> so<00:03:19.330> and<00:03:20.760> undo<00:03:21.760> the

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
just put that on there so and undo the

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.020 
just put that on there so and undo the
bolt<00:03:22.530> once<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:23.650> want<00:03:23.770> to<00:03:23.860> do<00:03:23.920> that<00:03:24.130> then<00:03:24.790> the

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
bolt once you want to do that then the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.310 
bolt once you want to do that then the
transmission<00:03:25.360> just<00:03:25.720> looks<00:03:25.870> a<00:03:25.960> little<00:03:26.110> bit

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
transmission just looks a little bit

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.250 
transmission just looks a little bit
with<00:03:27.010> this<00:03:27.220> socket<00:03:27.940> and<00:03:28.120> then<00:03:28.660> twist<00:03:29.050> it<00:03:29.140> off

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
with this socket and then twist it off

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.050 
with this socket and then twist it off
with<00:03:29.380> your<00:03:29.470> hand<00:03:29.770> let<00:03:30.250> it<00:03:30.340> drain<00:03:30.610> into<00:03:30.640> the

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
with your hand let it drain into the

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.920 
with your hand let it drain into the
bucket<00:03:31.420> and<00:03:32.610> put<00:03:33.610> it<00:03:33.700> back<00:03:33.820> in<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:34.360> then<00:03:34.570> fill
