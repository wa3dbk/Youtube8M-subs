eight hours for me the hardest thing
would<00:02:32.740> probably<00:02:33.280> be<00:02:33.640> spinning<00:02:34.360> techniques<00:02:34.840> or

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
would probably be spinning techniques or

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.890 
would probably be spinning techniques or
techniques<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.490> require<00:02:36.610> leg<00:02:37.090> flexibility
