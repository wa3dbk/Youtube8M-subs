00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hi guys today here we are with a new one 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.049
 video where I was going to start 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.750
 a new series that as you will have read 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.000
 from the title it will be called applications 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.940
 strange and in this series I will show you 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.130
 applications very strange and above all 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.500
 even useless but that is a lot 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.250
 fun and allow us to do things 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.350
 very strange and then we start immediately 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.920
 today with the application that is called 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.050
 lower then you will definitely stay 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.149
 asking what you do 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.940
 in addition to my usual iphone a lighter 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.850
 a candle and guess what is a nice one 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.680
 smelly piece of onion on the top 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.079
 table but will be used for testing 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.420
 today's application this 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.370
 application through a sound 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:57.329
 coming out of the iPhone speaker 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:00.840
 will allow this sound in practice is 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.969
 a slight puff that will be able to 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.939
 extinguish a candle instead of moving 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:11.280
 small items like this this piece 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:19.409
 onion very light and ok let's start 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:22.640
 immediately light the candle and start 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.960
 the sound that is really a lot 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.939
 deafening that also gives a lot 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.619
 bother applications to find her 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:34.290
 also free in light version 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.990
 we also find other blowers if so 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.610
 they can be called and we start and see 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.610
 if we can turn off this candle 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:04.210
 by the colleagues we succeeded without 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.040
 without burning the iPhone and how we have it 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.790
 since the cancel is expected we move on to 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.690
 next test 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:16.180
 let's take this onion and break it up 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:18.340
 in small pieces we might add 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.090
 even a little salt letting it cook 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.410
 for 10 minutes and then we'll have a nice one 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.600
 Onion soup 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.600
 ok we have application 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.630
 and as you have seen it works 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.600
 perfectly 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.240
 will allow us to move these 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.030
 small light objects you can either 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.890
 use it as they do if you want to dry yourself 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.900
 of hair that as a joke of course 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.480
 as you have seen the application 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.880
 quite useless because I don't think that 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.320
 one take the iphone to turn off one 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:10.050
 candle when it was pasta blowing if there 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.040
 v series you liked and want that that 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.140
 continue it 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.200
 put a good inch and write what 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.000

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.080

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.990
