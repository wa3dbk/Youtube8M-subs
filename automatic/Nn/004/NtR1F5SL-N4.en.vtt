00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.419
 yes hello and welcome so onions 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.879
 oldschool i'm max in this new one 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:14.769
 Follow tk-online time and again for it 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.360
 a damn reader stand challenge 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.800
 So one day here with them none 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.289
 laserjet where I can do it the camera 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.550
 Drum closets last time had 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.170
 some of you said at the first 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.220
 Challenger is way too easy 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.109
 to create too easily 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.029
 ok then there were those again 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.320
 I said this is can be a lot to frustrate 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.509
 It's not so easy to do it, but me 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.950
 tell me lead the first challenge was 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.379
 it quite from the degree of difficulty 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.789
 often energy or him if you have me 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.620
 a little bit harder for them 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:40.570
 second challenge of the difficulty level 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.940
 It is a very nice piece of heavy 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.110
 look really hard I must say I 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.559
 took a few days to get to her 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.230
 create the gameplay and record 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.030
 from there I can tell the first ones 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.829
 three places what win the first place 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.690
 So think first time first 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.820
 In addition, gameplay with the perfect 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.460
 Run gets Amazon from me 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.199
 gift voucher worth 50 euros 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.879
 the second place we think that 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.170
 More than second to be the gameplay 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.259
 with the perfect ears gets from me 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.850
 a sunglasses worth neff worth 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.470
 30 euros or third place gets for 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.720
 me so little troubles are two 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.700
 keychains of wistfulness in dassow 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.680
 bottle opener with it, I need stop 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.450
 not so you can have her 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.710
 These were the first three places I 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.900
 I thought this time I join in 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.970
 top 5 square four and five will be the 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.070
 quite normal in the video mentioned space one 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.630
 to 300 totally okay just briefly the 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.610
 Regulate by the laser is decent 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.530
 number 2 what do you have to do for it so 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.509
 He goes first to the race of 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.130
 rockstar cities air racing business 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.500
 class rhine could look around business 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.790
 class and then he flies off the course like that 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.130
 how I'll fly him off in my 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.110
 gameplay and what else is there to fix yes 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.329
 of course, the crashing jet can 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.350
 because one failed the challenge 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.210
 even if you think the way last 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.469
 Obstacle flown through and crash 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.880
 then then yes is not passed 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:52.960
 and that is no misunderstanding there 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.670
 at the challenge that you might 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.500
 do not know how through the obstacle 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.530
 by flying I have to do the same 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.939
 or do it a little differently 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.320
 That's why I explain that 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.180
 you again briefly a little bit about 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.789
 the gameplay water looks the same now 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.860
 my tennis gameplay right up to that okay 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.750
 is my gameplay from the list 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.350
 challenge number two I have one 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.000
 a few days 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.400
 needs her perfect run towards 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.230
 we'll get the obstacle the first 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.150
 obstacle you approach in principle so 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.860
 whichever matter you can do it from left or right 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.930
 right from straight or like me 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.880
 fly here that is 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.370
 completely promises that is just that 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.470
 she flies it through so flies under 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.630
 The first thing is how I do this 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.370
 So over there that you see already that is 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.380
 this what is called the archway or 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.420
 where the ZweibrÃ¼cken cases are 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.560
 under it by practically flying that 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.760
 first a normal flight 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:46.870
 position thus bridge through and 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.190
 then out again so next bridge is 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.390
 over there now on the back by 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:55.360
 fly as much as jett as the 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.830
 just put the normal position and 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.830
 a normal position then then 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.980
 under the crane by normal position 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:06.040
 then here below and now on 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.170
 because the next one does that 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.420
 is like the highway in the enztal on 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.830
 down the back fly this 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.270
 put on the back on bridges 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.880
 stay the same because there comes forward 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.670
 again this little gap here exactly 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.500
 Hanging just a bit through this 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.830
 remained as a shit important 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.290
 only that she did not crash it and that 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.200
 it was in principle already for explanation 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.520
 a week hard time until next week 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.940
 Let's think about it next week Tuesday 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.830
 0 o'clock and then I will be on wednesday 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.980
 then announce the winners 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.090
 something like that is next wednesday wednesday 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.110
 would be the 17th 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.330
 on the 17 the winner video out with the 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:50.110
 So first five places one space 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:53.620
 a gift voucher 50 euro place 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.720
 two neff sunglasses worth 30 euros 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.550
 if you want also with a signature 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.040
 I also find bock then have space 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.650
 three the two keychains from bwin 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.480
 with bottle opener and the fourth place 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.470
 and five of course also mentioned in the video 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.860
 then too ok to say i wish 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.810
 you have a lot of fun trying 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.810
 until the next video I'm out 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.699
 and 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.840
 the 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.830
 Munich 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.009
 Not
