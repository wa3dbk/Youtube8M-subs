and<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.270> rotate<00:01:06.570> them<00:01:06.750> around<00:01:06.840> whenever<00:01:07.619> you

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
and you rotate them around whenever you

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.530 
and you rotate them around whenever you
move<00:01:08.100> work<00:01:08.430> or<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> spot<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.180> move<00:01:09.390> them

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.289 
move work or the spot that you move them
onto<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:10.200> what<00:01:10.380> activates<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.580> it's<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.939> cycle

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
onto is what activates so it's a cycle

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.810 
onto is what activates so it's a cycle
of<00:01:12.479> labor<00:01:13.229> labor<00:01:13.650> money<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.520> then<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.729> go

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
of labor labor money and then you go

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.490 
of labor labor money and then you go
back<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.150> top<00:01:15.330> labor<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:16.350> is

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
back to the top labor this is

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.870 
back to the top labor this is
interesting<00:01:16.920> when<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.100> first<00:01:17.340> sat<00:01:17.549> down<00:01:17.580> and

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
interesting when I first sat down and

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.060 
interesting when I first sat down and
played<00:01:18.030> with<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.360> game<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.780> thought<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:20.009> is

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
played with this game I thought this is

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.100 
played with this game I thought this is
boring<00:01:20.490> I'll<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.880> every<00:01:21.600> turn<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.810> just

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
boring I'll just every turn you just

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.600 
boring I'll just every turn you just
move<00:01:22.259> constantly<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.009> same<00:01:23.189> cycle<00:01:23.520> you

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
move constantly in the same cycle you

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.100 
move constantly in the same cycle you
move<00:01:23.729> every<00:01:24.030> worker<00:01:24.299> once<00:01:24.540> which<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.960> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
move every worker once which is the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.600 
move every worker once which is the
maximum<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.530> can<00:01:25.650> move<00:01:25.890> them<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.189> turn<00:01:26.369> and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
maximum you can move them on a turn and

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.160 
maximum you can move them on a turn and
so<00:01:27.150> every<00:01:27.299> turn<00:01:27.450> you're<00:01:27.630> getting<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.990> labor

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
so every turn you're getting to labor

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.539 
so every turn you're getting to labor
and<00:01:28.290> one<00:01:28.560> money<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.950> then<00:01:29.040> your<00:01:29.159> opponent's

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
and one money and then your opponent's

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.770 
and one money and then your opponent's
getting<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> variable<00:01:30.299> money<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.659> then

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
getting to the variable money and then

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.560 
getting to the variable money and then
just<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.920> on<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.040> non<00:01:32.280> that's<00:01:32.610> boring

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
just on and on a non that's boring

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.020 
just on and on a non that's boring
simple<00:01:34.259> but<00:01:34.409> that's<00:01:35.280> not<00:01:35.400> actually<00:01:35.579> about<00:01:35.790> how

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
simple but that's not actually about how

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.420 
simple but that's not actually about how
you<00:01:36.090> play<00:01:36.479> that's<00:01:37.320> because<00:01:37.619> where<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.220> move

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
you play that's because where you move

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.429 
you play that's because where you move
your<00:01:38.579> workers<00:01:38.909> on<00:01:39.119> your<00:01:39.329> turn<00:01:39.570> affects<00:01:40.079> where

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
your workers on your turn affects where

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.319 
your workers on your turn affects where
your<00:01:40.799> opponent<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.520> move<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.790> workers<00:01:42.119> on

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
your opponent can move the workers on

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.929 
your opponent can move the workers on
their<00:01:42.570> turn<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.409> for<00:01:43.829> example<00:01:43.860> if<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.520> know<00:01:44.579> that

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
their turn so for example if I know that

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.310 
their turn so for example if I know that
I<00:01:44.970> don't<00:01:45.329> want<00:01:45.479> my<00:01:45.570> opponent<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.020> be<00:01:46.079> able<00:01:46.140> to

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
I don't want my opponent to be able to

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.080 
I don't want my opponent to be able to
get<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.500> lot<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.649> labor<00:01:46.920> maybe<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.670> would<00:01:47.909> move

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
get a lot of labor maybe I would move

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.600 
get a lot of labor maybe I would move
him<00:01:48.560> move<00:01:49.560> all<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.920> workers<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.399> labor

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
him move all the workers to the labor

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.609 
him move all the workers to the labor
peace<00:01:50.850> just<00:01:51.450> before<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.780> money<00:01:51.930> said<00:01:52.259> when<00:01:52.470> he

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
peace just before the money said when he

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.560 
peace just before the money said when he
moves<00:01:52.920> yeah<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.460> lot<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.850> money<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.299> he<00:01:54.420> won't

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
moves yeah a lot of money but he won't

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.280 
moves yeah a lot of money but he won't
get<00:01:54.630> believer<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.079> he<00:01:55.290> needs<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:56.040> build

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
get believer that he needs to build

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.380 
get believer that he needs to build
building<00:01:56.620> because<00:01:57.250> money<00:01:57.580> while<00:01:57.940> you<00:01:58.060> accrue

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
building because money while you accrue

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.850 
building because money while you accrue
it<00:01:58.510> over<00:01:58.690> many<00:01:58.900> turns<00:01:59.230> and<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.620> form<00:01:59.800> of

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
it over many turns and the form of

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.570 
it over many turns and the form of
actual<00:02:00.160> coins<00:02:00.490> labour<00:02:01.300> is<00:02:01.450> only<00:02:01.900> per<00:02:02.290> turn<00:02:02.770> so

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
actual coins labour is only per turn so

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.950 
actual coins labour is only per turn so
when<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:03.970> move<00:02:04.120> a<00:02:04.240> worker<00:02:04.480> on<00:02:04.600> to<00:02:04.720> a<00:02:04.750> laborer

when you move a worker on to a laborer

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.410 
when you move a worker on to a laborer
children<00:02:05.320> you<00:02:05.530> get<00:02:05.650> +1<00:02:05.920> labor<00:02:06.250> for<00:02:06.760> that<00:02:06.910> turn

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
children you get +1 labor for that turn

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.999 
children you get +1 labor for that turn
in<00:02:07.810> addition<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.290> trying<00:02:08.470> to<00:02:08.649> be<00:02:08.710> the<00:02:08.800> first
