00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.930 

so<00:00:01.050> we<00:00:01.260> hear<00:00:01.469> that<00:00:01.709> LLG<00:00:04.609> that's<00:00:05.609> right<00:00:05.759> this<00:00:05.879> is

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
so we hear that LLG that's right this is

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.750 
so we hear that LLG that's right this is
the<00:00:06.060> LG<00:00:06.330> g2<00:00:06.960> mini<00:00:07.220> it's<00:00:08.220> basically<00:00:08.639> a

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
the LG g2 mini it's basically a

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.669 
the LG g2 mini it's basically a
scaled-down<00:00:09.300> version<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.050> g2<00:00:10.440> that<00:00:10.620> we

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
scaled-down version of the g2 that we

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:11.990 
scaled-down version of the g2 that we
released<00:00:10.980> last<00:00:11.040> year<00:00:11.340> so<00:00:11.550> you<00:00:11.610> can<00:00:11.759> seem<00:00:11.969> like

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
released last year so you can seem like

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.180 
released last year so you can seem like
we've<00:00:12.809> remained<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.230> keep<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.559> rear<00:00:13.950> key

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
we've remained to keep the rear key

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.740 
we've remained to keep the rear key
which<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.670> very<00:00:14.880> popular<00:00:15.120> function<00:00:15.420> from<00:00:15.540> last

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
which is very popular function from last

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.200 
which is very popular function from last
year<00:00:16.220> the<00:00:17.220> texture<00:00:17.550> on<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.699> back<00:00:17.820> has<00:00:18.029> been

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
year the texture on the back has been

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.210 
year the texture on the back has been
improved<00:00:18.660> so<00:00:19.170> she's<00:00:19.470> got<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.590> more<00:00:19.830> grip<00:00:20.070> and

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
improved so she's got a more grip and

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.420 
improved so she's got a more grip and
stability<00:00:20.340> on<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:21.410> you<00:00:22.410> can<00:00:22.529> see<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:23.130> same

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
stability on it you can see the same

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.790 
stability on it you can see the same
thin<00:00:24.119> bezel<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:24.779> was<00:00:25.230> very<00:00:25.410> popular<00:00:25.560> on<00:00:25.769> the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
thin bezel that was very popular on the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.460 
thin bezel that was very popular on the
g2<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.599> just<00:00:27.599> come<00:00:27.689> out<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:28.050> simulation

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
g2 I just come out of this simulation

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.320 
g2 I just come out of this simulation
mode<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.010> we've<00:00:29.099> got<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.369> new<00:00:30.090> feature

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
mode and we've got this new feature

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.240 
mode and we've got this new feature
we're<00:00:30.689> showing<00:00:30.840> here<00:00:31.080> at<00:00:31.170> MWC<00:00:31.619> which<00:00:32.130> is

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
we're showing here at MWC which is

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.819 
we're showing here at MWC which is
called<00:00:32.430> lock<00:00:32.579> code<00:00:32.969> we<00:00:33.930> do<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.230> access<00:00:34.440> your

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
called lock code we do to access your

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.479 
called lock code we do to access your
phone<00:00:35.100> unlock<00:00:36.000> code<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.360> would<00:00:36.480> tap<00:00:37.489> example

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
phone unlock code you would tap example

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.730 
phone unlock code you would tap example
here

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:39.740 
here

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.610 
here
all<00:00:40.310> times

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
all times

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.860 
all times
not<00:00:42.010> code<00:00:42.250> is<00:00:42.430> unique<00:00:42.820> to<00:00:43.090> any<00:00:43.210> user<00:00:43.510> you<00:00:43.750> can

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
not code is unique to any user you can

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.420 
not code is unique to any user you can
program<00:00:44.110> and<00:00:44.440> change<00:00:44.650> it<00:00:44.830> so<00:00:44.980> you<00:00:45.040> can<00:00:45.250> have

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
program and change it so you can have

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.820 
program and change it so you can have
two<00:00:45.910> taps<00:00:46.180> up<00:00:46.480> to<00:00:46.690> eight<00:00:46.840> taps<00:00:47.110> so<00:00:47.410> you<00:00:47.470> pick<00:00:47.710> up

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
two taps up to eight taps so you pick up

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.910 
two taps up to eight taps so you pick up
one<00:00:48.010> two<00:00:48.220> three<00:00:48.490> four<00:00:48.700> five<00:00:49.590> there's<00:00:50.590> an<00:00:50.680> up<00:00:50.770> to

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
one two three four five there's an up to

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.869 
one two three four five there's an up to
eighty<00:00:51.130> four<00:00:51.520> thousand<00:00:52.360> combinations

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
eighty four thousand combinations

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.549 
eighty four thousand combinations
so<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.120> very<00:00:54.210> sensitive<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.930> where<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.260> cap

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
so it's very sensitive and where you cap

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.590 
so it's very sensitive and where you cap
and<00:00:55.800> all<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.039> yes<00:00:56.519> so<00:00:56.760> for<00:00:56.910> example<00:00:57.359> if<00:00:57.449> your

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
and all that yes so for example if your

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.630 
and all that yes so for example if your
coats<00:00:57.899> was<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.769> one<00:00:59.010> two<00:00:59.219> three<00:00:59.430> four

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
coats was this one two three four

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.549 
coats was this one two three four
pattern<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.180> that's<00:01:00.390> showing<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:01.410> can

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
pattern like that's showing you can

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.249 
pattern like that's showing you can
actually<00:01:01.860> start<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.760> corner<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:04.049> here

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
actually start it in the corner so here

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:05.719 
actually start it in the corner so here
we<00:01:04.320> use<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.739> phone<00:01:04.920> with<00:01:05.040> one<00:01:05.220> hand<00:01:05.489> you

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
we use in the phone with one hand you

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.330 
we use in the phone with one hand you
could<00:01:05.850> actually<00:01:06.030> do<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.390> like<00:01:06.570> this

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.980 

so<00:01:09.729> instead<00:01:09.909> of<00:01:09.970> me<00:01:10.149> actually<00:01:10.270> doing<00:01:10.630> it<00:01:10.780> in

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
so instead of me actually doing it in

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.600 
so instead of me actually doing it in
the<00:01:11.110> corner<00:01:11.409> I<00:01:11.470> can<00:01:11.590> do<00:01:11.680> it<00:01:11.740> here<00:01:11.920> to<00:01:12.280> bring

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:22.219 

and<00:01:16.030> it<00:01:16.150> shouldn't

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.200 

it<00:01:22.770> depends<00:01:23.130> what<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.310> password<00:01:23.610> words<00:01:23.969> I

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
it depends what the password words I

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.940 
it depends what the password words I
mean<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.450> account<00:01:24.689> like<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.899> password<00:01:25.289> it

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
mean this account like the password it

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.980 
mean this account like the password it
basically<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:26.850> replacing<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.570> password

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
basically it's replacing the password

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.359 
basically it's replacing the password
that<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.259> would<00:01:28.350> have<00:01:28.469> actually<00:01:28.740> had<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.219> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
that you would have actually had in the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.139 
that you would have actually had in the
phone<00:01:29.549> yes

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
phone yes

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.969 
phone yes
so<00:01:30.719> what<00:01:31.229> I'll<00:01:31.320> say<00:01:31.500> shown<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.799> here<00:01:32.149> really

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
so what I'll say shown you here really

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.380 
so what I'll say shown you here really
different<00:01:34.979> colors<00:01:35.340> also<00:01:35.640> yeah<00:01:35.969> so<00:01:36.179> here<00:01:36.329> we

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
different colors also yeah so here we

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.359 
different colors also yeah so here we
have<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.570> white<00:01:36.689> version<00:01:37.070> exactly<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.189> same

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
have the white version exactly the same

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.580 
have the white version exactly the same
in<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.610> spec<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.990> camera<00:01:40.289> on<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.470> rear

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
in this spec so the camera on the rear

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.669 
in this spec so the camera on the rear
is<00:01:40.799> 8<00:01:41.009> megapixel<00:01:42.079> internal<00:01:43.079> memory<00:01:43.439> is

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
is 8 megapixel internal memory is

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:45.859 
is 8 megapixel internal memory is
hanging<00:01:44.340> about<00:01:44.579> it's<00:01:44.700> out<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.030> box<00:01:45.210> but

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
hanging about it's out of the box but

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.899 
hanging about it's out of the box but
unlike<00:01:46.289> the<00:01:46.530> g2<00:01:46.979> which<00:01:47.250> came<00:01:47.429> out<00:01:47.460> last<00:01:47.700> year

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
unlike the g2 which came out last year

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.149 
unlike the g2 which came out last year
was<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> sealed<00:01:48.450> unit<00:01:48.840> only<00:01:49.110> available<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.679> 16

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
was a sealed unit only available in 16

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.639 
was a sealed unit only available in 16
and<00:01:50.340> 32<00:01:50.729> gigabytes<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:52.049> particular<00:01:52.319> one

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
and 32 gigabytes this particular one

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.219 
and 32 gigabytes this particular one
that<00:01:52.799> has<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> removable<00:01:53.610> back<00:01:53.850> cover

gigabytes<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.780> will<00:02:00.869> give<00:02:00.959> you<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.110> 40

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
gigabytes so that will give you a 40

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.199 
gigabytes so that will give you a 40
gigabytes<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.009> device<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.789> it<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.030> same

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209 
gigabytes in the device is it the same

processor<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:04.470> process<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.039> slightly

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
processor the process is slightly

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.260 
processor the process is slightly
different<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:05.759> it's<00:02:05.880> going<00:02:05.970> to<00:02:06.030> be<00:02:06.119> two

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
different so it's going to be two

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.719 
different so it's going to be two
processes

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729
