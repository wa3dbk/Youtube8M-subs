00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.639
 hello friends I'm javier and I want to give you the 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.920
 welcome to another hair chapter of 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.630
 new studio tv as I have always asked 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.520
 that you subscribe to our channel 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.880
 youtube by clicking on this link that 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.949
 you can see right here every time you see 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.310
 a belo chapter of the study of tve and 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:29.650
 do not sign god torture and kill a 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.720
 kitty today we're going to talk about one of the 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.729
 most common problems in our 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.510
 cyclists that is the foundation of 

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:36.100
 hands 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.989
 there are two nerves that usually cause 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.870
 problems when we practice cycling 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.489
 the first is the ulnar nerve and it is a 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.190
 nerve that goes on the outside of the arm 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.499
 It goes on the outside of the wrist and 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.139
 branches on the little finger and on the finger 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:52.059
 cancel this nerve controls the 

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:53.649
 sensations of these two fingers and the 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.039
 most of the muscles of the hand 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:59.019
 the second is the median nerve and goes by 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.940
 the center of the arm passes through the center 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.170
 of the wrist and branches on the finger 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.019
 thumb 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.330
 and it gave me the natural anatomical shape of 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.790
 our dolls is relaxed and looking 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.890
 down compression or hyper 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.020
 extension of these nerves are those that 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.210
 the foundation will cause me the 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.190
 anthills for example is very common in 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.810
 road bike clamping 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.450
 of the ulnar nerve when we go 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.159
 placed in the lower part of the handlebar 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.170
 incorrectly running the handle 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.020
 placed and too high on the handlebar 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.640
 when trying to achieve it we paint the 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.100
 ulnar nerve and will cause us 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.619
 numbness and tingling in the hand 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.630
 the solution is to place the handle as 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.090
 vertical possible and perpendicular to 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.920
 soil and so we will not have problem to the 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.479
 time to bring it closer and we will have a 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.130
 relaxed position of the wrist in 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.590
 mountain bike a handlebar 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.690
 too wide will also cause this 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.179
 impingement the solution to this problem 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.340
 is to slightly trim the handlebar to 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.110
 get a more initial position 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.539
 of the wrist and avoid pinching the 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.190
 berlin anyway the problem more 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.319
 common is the impingement of the 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.509
 medium nerve due to excessive 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:05.860
 nerve compression when we go in 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.170
 road bike 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.179
 the first and the most basic is a 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.980
 incorrect distribution of your weight 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.470
 about the contact points on the 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.720
 bike a correct position on the 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.700
 bicycle is crucial to be able to reduce 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.740
 the pressure in the palm of the hands a 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.600
 handlebar too low will create a lot 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.790
 pressure in the palm of your hands and a 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.370
 handlebar too high will have the same 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.990
 effect as a basic reference you must 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.670
 to think that 60 percent of 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.709
 our weight has to fall on the 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.840
 saddle and only 40 percent of 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.730
 your maximum weight on the 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.230
 handlebar that you want assured a hundred 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.060
 hundred of your position on the 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.650
 bicycle a mechanical scribe with 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.270
 veil of studies will help you 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.970
 find the perfect position where 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.890
 correctly distribute the other charges 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.020
 cause to increase the pressure on the 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.120
 black and medium is usually the way in 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.010
 that grip the handlebar handlebar 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.720
 you need to have him hold tightly 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.090
 during the entire output you have to 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.830
 hold it gently and keep changing 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.480
 the position of the hands this will allow 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.030
 relieve pressure on the nerve 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.920
 medium another solution may be to increase 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.970
 the padding of the contact point of 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.030
 your hand with life 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.280
 either by placing a few fists of foam 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.140
 thicker or silicone cuffs or 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.120
 simply using gloves with greater 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.640
 This way you padded your help to 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.960
 reduce the vibrations produced by the 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.850
 train or on the road on the 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.040
 bicycle by reducing the pressure that 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.480
 think about the median nerve one of 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.520
 the solutions that we propose here in 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.210
 belo of the study is the use of 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.970
 the fists 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.890
 gs1 of these fists come 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.140
 Ergonomically designed to increase 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.690
 the contact surface between you 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.480
 hand and fist as the surface increases 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.800
 of contact we reduce and distribute the 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.050
 pressure that we exert on her 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.850
 thus reducing the pressure in your 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.410
 medium nerve despite being a 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.270
 pretty basic explanation of the 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.860
 growth problems in hands 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.180
 we hope that you have been cycling 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.160
 helped to try 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.470
 identify what is your problem in 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.700
 We particularly see you next week 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.700
 veil in the studies of vee 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.620
 do not 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.380
 There are several medical to the ear fuck 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.759
 another solution that we usually propose 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.759
 means the young mouth 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.850
 increase in vibrations 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.370
 with me 2 in the hands while 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.700
 we practice cycling we practice the 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.020
 cycling compression compression 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.590
 compression compression and 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.590
 LOL
