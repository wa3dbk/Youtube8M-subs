that<00:00:18.029> five<00:00:18.330> times<00:00:18.600> fast<00:00:19.460> yeah<00:00:20.460> while<00:00:20.760> you're

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
that five times fast yeah while you're

that five times fast yeah while you're
having<00:00:21.090> fun<00:00:21.300> I'll<00:00:21.600> continue<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.140> demo<00:00:22.580> so<00:00:23.580> a

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
having fun I'll continue the demo so a

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.420 
having fun I'll continue the demo so a
supermoon<00:00:25.019> has<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.350> sway<00:00:25.740> knob<00:00:25.980> in<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.189> middle

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
supermoon has a sway knob in the middle

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.890 
supermoon has a sway knob in the middle
which<00:00:26.550> controls<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.090> amount<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.449> modulation

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
which controls the amount of modulation

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.650 
which controls the amount of modulation
and<00:00:28.199> then<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> reverb<00:00:29.609> knob<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.210> decay<00:00:30.480> nub

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
and then a reverb knob and a decay nub

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.150 
and then a reverb knob and a decay nub
rv5<00:00:33.660> after<00:00:34.110> you've<00:00:34.260> selected<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.770> type<00:00:35.130> of

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
rv5 after you've selected the type of

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.310 
rv5 after you've selected the type of
reverb<00:00:35.520> modulate<00:00:36.149> you're<00:00:36.780> left<00:00:36.960> with<00:00:37.110> three

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
reverb modulate you're left with three

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.770 
reverb modulate you're left with three
knobs<00:00:37.550> the<00:00:38.550> effect<00:00:38.879> level<00:00:39.059> which<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.540> same

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
knobs the effect level which is the same

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.869 
knobs the effect level which is the same
as<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.050> reverb<00:00:40.379> knob<00:00:40.590> on<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.980> supermoon<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
as the reverb knob on the supermoon the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.880 
as the reverb knob on the supermoon the
time<00:00:42.210> which<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.750> same<00:00:42.930> as<00:00:43.079> decay<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:43.770> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
time which is the same as decay on the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.740 
time which is the same as decay on the
supermoon<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.550> then<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.239> got<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> tone<00:00:45.719> knob

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
supermoon and then you got a tone knob

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.110 
supermoon and then you got a tone knob
there<00:00:46.260> which<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.800> find<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.579> needs<00:00:47.789> it's<00:00:48.030> a

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
there which I find it needs it's a

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.990 
there which I find it needs it's a
little<00:00:48.329> bright<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.070> so<00:00:50.070> that's<00:00:50.370> why<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.700> is

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
little bright and so that's why it is

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.869 
little bright and so that's why it is
where<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.420> set<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.280> so<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.370> don't<00:00:53.550> have<00:00:53.760> an

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
where it is set and so you don't have an

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.400 
where it is set and so you don't have an
ability<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.270> control<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.899> amount<00:00:55.230> of

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
ability to control the amount of

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.950 
ability to control the amount of
modulation<00:00:56.039> with<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.460> rv5<00:00:57.000> like<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.539> do<00:00:57.780> on

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
modulation with the rv5 like you do on

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.500 
modulation with the rv5 like you do on
the<00:00:58.050> supermoon<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.219> i'm<00:00:59.910> going<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.149> leave<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
the supermoon and i'm going to leave the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.840 
the supermoon and i'm going to leave the
sway<00:01:01.500> knob<00:01:01.710> where<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.100> set<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
sway knob where it's set in the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.700 
sway knob where it's set in the
supermoon<00:01:03.270> demo<00:01:04.489> purely<00:01:05.489> because<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:06.710> really

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
supermoon demo purely because I really

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.370 
supermoon demo purely because I really
can't<00:01:08.070> be<00:01:08.729> fair<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.210> rv5<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.049> crank<00:01:10.260> up

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
can't be fair to the rv5 and crank up

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.890 
can't be fair to the rv5 and crank up
the<00:01:10.530> modulation<00:01:10.979> if<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.119> want<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.390> see<00:01:12.570> more

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
the modulation if you want to see more

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.770 
the modulation if you want to see more
of<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.590> sway<00:01:13.860> knob<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.729> modulate<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
of the sway knob and and modulate in the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.370 
of the sway knob and and modulate in the
reverb<00:01:16.439> decay<00:01:17.299> in<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.450> supermoon<00:01:18.810> check<00:01:19.229> out

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380

ah<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:38.170> here<00:01:39.170> is<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:40.850> boss<00:01:41.119> rv5

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.789 

Oh

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:26.940 

and<00:02:09.250> here<00:02:10.250> is<00:02:10.460> the<00:02:10.729> supermoon

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.030 

Oh

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.860 

so<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.250> would<00:02:42.520> consider<00:02:42.910> these<00:02:43.360> similar

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
so I would consider these similar

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.920 
so I would consider these similar
settings<00:02:44.380> on<00:02:44.680> these<00:02:45.040> two<00:02:45.280> pedals<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:46.480> want<00:02:46.870> to

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
settings on these two pedals I want to

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.559 
settings on these two pedals I want to
show<00:02:47.080> you<00:02:47.170> a<00:02:47.260> little<00:02:47.530> bit<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:49.330> full

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
show you a little bit the full

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.930 
show you a little bit the full
capabilities<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.620> boss<00:02:50.770> rv5<00:02:51.400> so<00:02:51.850> I'm

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
capabilities of the boss rv5 so I'm

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.880 
capabilities of the boss rv5 so I'm
going<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.120> crank<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.569> effect<00:02:53.110> level<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:53.590> the

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
going to crank the effect level and the

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.590 
going to crank the effect level and the
time<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:56.580> I'm<00:02:57.580> going<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.760> add<00:02:57.940> a<00:02:57.970> bit<00:02:58.300> more<00:02:58.330> of

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
time and I'm going to add a bit more of

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.870 
time and I'm going to add a bit more of
both<00:02:59.230> of<00:02:59.410> those<00:02:59.530> on<00:02:59.800> the<00:02:59.950> supermoon<00:03:00.370> but<00:03:00.670> I

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
both of those on the supermoon but I

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.850 
both of those on the supermoon but I
don't<00:03:03.880> want<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.030> be<00:03:04.150> here<00:03:04.330> forever<00:03:04.690> so<00:03:05.650> I'm<00:03:05.739> not

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
don't want to be here forever so I'm not

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.640 
don't want to be here forever so I'm not
going<00:03:05.980> to<00:03:06.040> crank<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.400> decay<00:03:07.000> totally<00:03:08.700> the

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
going to crank the decay totally the

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.220 
going to crank the decay totally the
decay<00:03:11.650> on<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:11.950> supermoon<00:03:12.430> is<00:03:13.230> incredibly

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
decay on the supermoon is incredibly

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.130 
decay on the supermoon is incredibly
fast<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:15.400> slow<00:03:16.300> and<00:03:16.690> it's<00:03:16.810> absolutely

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
fast and slow and it's absolutely

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.610 
fast and slow and it's absolutely
wonderful<00:03:17.800> but<00:03:18.760> it's<00:03:18.970> a<00:03:19.120> lot<00:03:19.390> longer<00:03:19.720> than<00:03:20.200> the

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
wonderful but it's a lot longer than the

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.059 
wonderful but it's a lot longer than the

and<00:04:44.009> I've<00:04:45.840> my<00:04:46.840> volume<00:04:47.229> is<00:04:47.289> off<00:04:47.560> the<00:04:48.280> supermoon

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
and I've my volume is off the supermoon

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.990 
and I've my volume is off the supermoon
is<00:04:48.910> still<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.660> king<00:04:49.900> softly<00:04:50.620> and<00:04:50.830> slowly<00:04:51.069> it's

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
is still the king softly and slowly it's

one of the fabulous things about this

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.659 
one of the fabulous things about this
pedal<00:04:53.800> is<00:04:53.889> a<00:04:53.949> really<00:04:54.340> really<00:04:54.669> long<00:04:55.349> decay<00:04:56.349> I

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
pedal is a really really long decay I

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.020 
pedal is a really really long decay I
can<00:04:57.669> still<00:04:57.940> hear<00:04:58.210> it<00:04:58.360> fading<00:04:58.720> out<00:04:59.160> and<00:05:00.160> it's

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
can still hear it fading out and it's

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.680 
can still hear it fading out and it's
just<00:05:01.270> so<00:05:01.960> good<00:05:02.340> in<00:05:03.340> that<00:05:03.580> decay<00:05:04.030> it<00:05:04.330> doesn't

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
just so good in that decay it doesn't

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.370 
just so good in that decay it doesn't
get<00:05:04.780> tinny<00:05:05.110> doesn't<00:05:05.620> get<00:05:05.770> too<00:05:06.639> shiny<00:05:07.380> it's

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
get tinny doesn't get too shiny it's

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.080 
get tinny doesn't get too shiny it's
really<00:05:08.830> great<00:05:09.039> when<00:05:09.280> you're<00:05:09.430> strumming<00:05:09.729> over

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
really great when you're strumming over

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.779 
really great when you're strumming over
top<00:05:10.300> even<00:05:10.569> if<00:05:10.750> you<00:05:10.870> have<00:05:11.050> the<00:05:11.259> decay<00:05:11.590> not<00:05:12.550> quite

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
top even if you have the decay not quite

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:14.760 
top even if you have the decay not quite
this<00:05:12.940> high<00:05:13.000> a<00:05:13.180> little<00:05:13.360> bit<00:05:13.570> less<00:05:13.780> you<00:05:14.620> can

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
this high a little bit less you can

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.260 
this high a little bit less you can
really<00:05:15.039> hear<00:05:15.190> your<00:05:15.370> strums<00:05:15.729> but<00:05:16.030> it<00:05:16.090> really

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
really hear your strums but it really

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.170 
really hear your strums but it really
feels<00:05:16.539> fills<00:05:17.229> a<00:05:17.349> room<00:05:17.530> as<00:05:17.740> well<00:05:17.970> most<00:05:18.970> of<00:05:19.090> the

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
feels fills a room as well most of the

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.330 
feels fills a room as well most of the
time<00:05:19.360> guys<00:05:19.840> like<00:05:19.870> these<00:05:20.770> kind<00:05:21.070> of<00:05:21.099> reverb

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
time guys like these kind of reverb

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.170 
time guys like these kind of reverb
pedals<00:05:22.800> when<00:05:23.800> you're<00:05:24.580> doing<00:05:24.729> some<00:05:24.910> soft

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
pedals when you're doing some soft

plucking<00:05:25.690> or<00:05:25.840> volume<00:05:26.530> swells<00:05:26.830> and<00:05:27.300> so<00:05:28.300> I<00:05:29.009> am

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
plucking or volume swells and so I am

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.350 
plucking or volume swells and so I am
going<00:05:30.190> to<00:05:30.370> turn<00:05:31.300> on<00:05:31.509> a<00:05:31.780> delay<00:05:32.650> pedal<00:05:33.360> Strymon

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
going to turn on a delay pedal Strymon

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.770 
going to turn on a delay pedal Strymon
el<00:05:34.449> capistan<00:05:34.810> but<00:05:35.349> I've<00:05:35.470> removed<00:05:35.919> the<00:05:36.630> the<00:05:37.630> Wow

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
el capistan but I've removed the the Wow

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.620 
el capistan but I've removed the the Wow
and<00:05:38.050> flutter<00:05:38.080> part<00:05:38.710> of<00:05:38.800> the<00:05:38.860> circuit<00:05:39.300> not<00:05:40.300> to

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
and flutter part of the circuit not to

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.060 
and flutter part of the circuit not to
cause<00:05:41.139> more<00:05:41.440> modulation<00:05:42.009> so<00:05:42.490> I<00:05:43.090> just<00:05:43.620> I'll<00:05:44.620> do

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
cause more modulation so I just I'll do

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.779 
cause more modulation so I just I'll do
volume<00:05:45.909> swells<00:05:46.150> with<00:05:46.479> the<00:05:46.630> rv5<00:05:47.400> same<00:05:48.400> chords<00:05:48.729> I

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789 
volume swells with the rv5 same chords I

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.120 
volume swells with the rv5 same chords I
was<00:05:48.880> playing<00:05:49.060> before<00:05:49.389> and<00:05:49.659> a<00:05:50.650> bit<00:05:50.800> of<00:05:50.889> delay

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
was playing before and a bit of delay

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.830 
was playing before and a bit of delay
added<00:05:51.520> so<00:05:54.000> helps<00:05:55.000> with<00:05:55.150> the<00:05:55.210> guitar<00:05:55.509> volumes

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
added so helps with the guitar volumes

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:11.480 
added so helps with the guitar volumes
up

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:29.220

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:21.870 
so there's a little bit of a comparison

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:26.420 
so there's a little bit of a comparison
anyways<00:07:22.800> these<00:07:23.580> two<00:07:23.819> petals<00:07:24.199> are<00:07:25.199> v5<00:07:25.710> and<00:07:26.099> the

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:26.430 
anyways these two petals are v5 and the
