cups<00:01:48.000> ice<00:01:48.149> I'm<00:01:48.390> gonna<00:01:48.570> half<00:01:48.780> everything<00:01:49.229> but

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
cups ice I'm gonna half everything but

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.230 
cups ice I'm gonna half everything but
just<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:50.280> recipe<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.790> what<00:01:50.970> I'm<00:01:51.060> actually

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
just the recipe is what I'm actually

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.719 
just the recipe is what I'm actually
saying<00:01:51.450> but<00:01:51.990> I'm<00:01:52.140> doing<00:01:52.439> half<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.950> I've<00:01:53.490> got

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
saying but I'm doing half so I've got

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.940 
saying but I'm doing half so I've got
three<00:01:54.030> cups<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.360> see<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.110> recipe

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
three cups I see the recipe

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.859 
three cups I see the recipe
is<00:01:56.960> six<00:01:57.960> cups<00:01:58.229> ice<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:59.270> half<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.390> cup<00:02:00.539> of<00:02:00.719> white

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
is six cups ice a half a cup of white

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.510 
is six cups ice a half a cup of white
sugar<00:02:00.899> but<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.680> thought<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.219> would<00:02:02.340> be<00:02:02.399> better

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
sugar but I thought it would be better

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.109 
sugar but I thought it would be better
to<00:02:02.640> use<00:02:03.950> to<00:02:04.950> use<00:02:05.070> powdered<00:02:05.520> sugar<00:02:05.759> because<00:02:06.000> it

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
to use to use powdered sugar because it

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.359 
to use to use powdered sugar because it
will<00:02:06.240> dissolve<00:02:06.509> faster<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.710> we're<00:02:08.160> actually

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
will dissolve faster so we're actually

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.150 
will dissolve faster so we're actually
I'm<00:02:08.580> using<00:02:08.729> powdered<00:02:09.569> sugar<00:02:09.810> here<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.229> if<00:02:10.979> you

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
I'm using powdered sugar here so if you

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.339 
I'm using powdered sugar here so if you
use<00:02:11.400> if<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.150> do<00:02:12.269> the<00:02:12.390> full<00:02:12.510> recipe<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.989> think<00:02:13.260> it

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
use if you do the full recipe I think it

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.339 
use if you do the full recipe I think it
makes<00:02:13.470> drinks<00:02:13.830> for<00:02:14.010> two<00:02:14.190> or<00:02:14.910> one<00:02:15.599> person<00:02:16.230> who

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
makes drinks for two or one person who

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.589 
makes drinks for two or one person who
really<00:02:16.530> likes<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.890> drink<00:02:17.130> it's<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.120> half<00:02:18.300> cup

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
really likes to drink it's a half cup

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.809 
really likes to drink it's a half cup
white<00:02:18.900> sugar<00:02:18.930> but<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:19.890> sort<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.310> double<00:02:20.700> it

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
white sugar but you sort of double it

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.490 
white sugar but you sort of double it
for<00:02:21.030> powdered<00:02:21.569> sugar<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:21.989> it<00:02:22.049> would<00:02:22.140> be<00:02:22.260> one

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
for powdered sugar so it would be one

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.130 
for powdered sugar so it would be one
cup<00:02:22.769> of<00:02:22.980> powdered<00:02:23.310> sugar<00:02:23.340> then<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:24.810> there<00:02:24.989> goes

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
cup of powdered sugar then so there goes

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.180 
cup of powdered sugar then so there goes
the<00:02:25.379> powdered<00:02:25.709> sugar

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
the powdered sugar

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.570 
the powdered sugar
