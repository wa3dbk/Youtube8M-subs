00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.580 
and it doesn't take me that long to make
at<00:02:00.250> all<00:02:00.400> the<00:02:00.550> longest<00:02:00.760> time<00:02:01.090> is<00:02:01.540> for<00:02:02.200> it<00:02:02.290> to<00:02:02.410> sit

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
at all the longest time is for it to sit

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.670 
at all the longest time is for it to sit
in<00:02:02.680> the<00:02:02.800> oven<00:02:02.950> you<00:02:03.760> can<00:02:03.790> use<00:02:04.470> lasagna<00:02:05.470> pasta

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
in the oven you can use lasagna pasta

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.620 
in the oven you can use lasagna pasta
that's<00:02:06.070> already<00:02:06.400> oven<00:02:07.650> that's<00:02:08.650> oven<00:02:09.100> ready

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
that's already oven that's oven ready

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.570 
that's already oven that's oven ready
and<00:02:10.630> if<00:02:10.840> you<00:02:10.960> use<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.410> oven<00:02:11.440> ready<00:02:11.950> lasagna

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
and if you use the oven ready lasagna

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.520 
and if you use the oven ready lasagna
then<00:02:13.150> that<00:02:13.360> just<00:02:13.570> stays<00:02:13.780> in<00:02:13.990> for<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.260> little

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
then that just stays in for a little

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.960 
then that just stays in for a little
longer<00:02:14.770> than<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:16.120> half<00:02:16.930> an<00:02:17.110> hour<00:02:17.730> but<00:02:18.730> when<00:02:18.940> I

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
longer than a half an hour but when I

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.820

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.760 
have my pasta already cool you should
just<00:02:20.980> stay<00:02:21.670> in<00:02:21.700> for<00:02:22.120> about<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.300> half<00:02:22.540> an<00:02:22.660> hour<00:02:22.780> it

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
just stay in for about a half an hour it

now we're just gonna put I usually put a
good<00:03:52.650> portion<00:03:53.040> of<00:03:53.550> the<00:03:53.700> meat<00:03:53.850> I<00:03:53.880> don't

good portion of the meat I don't

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.860 
good portion of the meat I don't
imagine<00:03:56.549> how<00:03:56.670> much<00:03:56.819> I<00:03:57.000> put<00:03:57.180> in<00:03:57.299> there<00:03:57.450> I<00:03:57.510> just
