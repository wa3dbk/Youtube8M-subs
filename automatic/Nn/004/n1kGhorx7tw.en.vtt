00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
health of actually regenerate never

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.650 
health of actually regenerate never
generates<00:00:47.460> buddy<00:00:47.730> how<00:00:48.690> much<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.960> heals<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.350> by

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.410 

storm<00:00:54.949> so<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.219> can<00:00:56.430> go<00:00:56.610> around<00:00:56.789> pick<00:00:57.120> up<00:00:57.270> all

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
storm so you can go around pick up all

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.160 
storm so you can go around pick up all
these<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.739> raw<00:00:59.670> it<00:01:00.210> heals<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.719> one<00:01:00.989> and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
these and just raw it heals you one and

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.060 
these and just raw it heals you one and
you'll<00:01:01.530> get<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.770> bone<00:01:02.039> from<00:01:02.280> unit<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:04.070> that's

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
you'll get a bone from unit so that's

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.590 
you'll get a bone from unit so that's
nice<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.580> guess<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:06.119> like<00:01:06.210> killing<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
nice I guess it's like killing the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.359 
nice I guess it's like killing the
skeleton<00:01:07.140> except<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.560> also<00:01:07.799> get<00:01:07.920> some<00:01:08.070> food

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
skeleton except you also get some food

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.090 
skeleton except you also get some food
from<00:01:08.549> it

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
from it

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.100 
from it
then<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.220> can<00:01:11.399> cook<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.850> meat<00:01:12.060> as<00:01:12.270> well<00:01:12.329> and

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
then you can cook the meat as well and

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.340 
then you can cook the meat as well and
it<00:01:13.860> will<00:01:14.040> remain<00:01:14.490> rotten<00:01:15.329> but<00:01:15.720> it'll<00:01:15.899> still<00:01:16.170> be

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
it will remain rotten but it'll still be

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.929 
it will remain rotten but it'll still be
cooked<00:01:17.299> better<00:01:18.299> than<00:01:18.600> just<00:01:18.810> having<00:01:19.020> run<00:01:19.939> so

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
cooked better than just having run so

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.029 
cooked better than just having run so
when<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.299> eat<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:22.049> kills<00:01:22.409> two<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.890> half

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
when you eat it it kills two and a half

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.950 
when you eat it it kills two and a half
which<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.990> definitely<00:01:24.990> better<00:01:25.680> than<00:01:25.860> just<00:01:26.189> one

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
which is definitely better than just one

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.160 
which is definitely better than just one
but<00:01:27.960> yeah<00:01:28.939> it's<00:01:29.939> definitely<00:01:30.149> better<00:01:30.450> along

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
but yeah it's definitely better along

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.380 
but yeah it's definitely better along
lines<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:31.920> you're<00:01:32.100> on<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> cave<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.880> all<00:01:33.240> you

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
lines of if you're on a cave and all you

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.669 
lines of if you're on a cave and all you
have<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:34.189> zombie<00:01:35.189> meat<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:36.270> uh<00:01:36.350> to<00:01:37.350> eat<00:01:37.530> it

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
have is zombie meat to uh to eat it

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.070 
have is zombie meat to uh to eat it
because<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.399> better<00:01:38.640> than<00:01:38.789> having<00:01:39.409> nothing

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
because it's better than having nothing

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.020 
because it's better than having nothing
and<00:01:43.549> practically<00:01:44.549> parking<00:01:45.330> being<00:01:45.569> dead<00:01:45.959> so<00:01:47.030> I

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
and practically parking being dead so I

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.210 
and practically parking being dead so I
definitely<00:01:48.810> advise<00:01:49.229> using<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.740> mod<00:01:49.920> it's

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
definitely advise using the mod it's

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.230

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.499 
very helpful and I've already tested it
out<00:01:54.770> by<00:01:55.770> myself<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:56.520> some<00:01:56.880> my<00:01:57.030> own<00:01:57.209> little

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
out by myself in some my own little

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.559 
out by myself in some my own little
worlds<00:01:58.110> I'm<00:01:59.009> killing<00:01:59.280> zombies<00:01:59.700> other<00:02:00.299> than

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
worlds I'm killing zombies other than

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:06.139 
worlds I'm killing zombies other than
this<00:02:00.929> world<00:02:01.200> but<00:02:02.539> so<00:02:04.759> sorry<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.970> don't<00:02:06.119> think

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
this world but so sorry I don't think

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.080 
this world but so sorry I don't think
there's<00:02:06.479> no<00:02:06.950> you<00:02:07.950> get<00:02:08.130> bones<00:02:08.369> back<00:02:08.670> as<00:02:08.910> well

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
there's no you get bones back as well

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.860 
there's no you get bones back as well
from<00:02:09.330> when<00:02:09.720> eating<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.200> which<00:02:11.269> I'm<00:02:12.269> just<00:02:12.630> as

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
from when eating it which I'm just as

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.699 
from when eating it which I'm just as
functional<00:02:13.440> as<00:02:13.560> skeletal<00:02:14.489> bones<00:02:15.530> so<00:02:16.530> it's

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
functional as skeletal bones so it's

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.319 
functional as skeletal bones so it's
like<00:02:16.739> effectively<00:02:17.519> killing<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.850> skeleton

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
like effectively killing a skeleton

except with me as I said so but I

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.690 
except with me as I said so but I
definitely<00:02:20.940> prefer<00:02:21.269> using<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:22.260> instead<00:02:22.700> of

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
definitely prefer using it instead of

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.160 
definitely prefer using it instead of
getting<00:02:25.340> feathers<00:02:26.480> because<00:02:27.480> i<00:02:27.840> hate<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.680> drop

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
of feathers that comes to zombies it's

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.800 
of feathers that comes to zombies it's
just<00:02:35.599> annoying<00:02:36.250> so<00:02:37.250> yeah<00:02:38.770> I<00:02:40.330> hope<00:02:41.330> to<00:02:41.599> see<00:02:41.780> some
