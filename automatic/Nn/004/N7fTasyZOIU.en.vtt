reality and what I do like about it

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.469 
reality and what I do like about it
actually<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.130> its<00:01:11.340> following<00:01:11.760> Daryl<00:01:12.330> and

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
actually is its following Daryl and

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.480 
actually is its following Daryl and
Merle<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:13.560> following<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.100> brothers

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
Merle so it's following the brothers

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.310 
Merle so it's following the brothers
before<00:01:14.729> they<00:01:15.270> meet<00:01:15.450> up<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.810> become<00:01:16.049> involved

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
in the storyline which is kind of cool

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.120 
in the storyline which is kind of cool
so<00:01:18.630> there<00:01:18.780> will<00:01:18.900> be<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> lot<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.290> stealth<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.979> lot

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
construct something in our minds so

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.690

quite<00:03:07.130> as<00:03:07.310> well<00:03:07.580> as<00:03:07.910> I<00:03:08.480> think<00:03:08.720> they<00:03:08.870> were

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
quite as well as I think they were

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.170 
quite as well as I think they were
hoping<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:09.709> would<00:03:10.070> be<00:03:10.400> really<00:03:10.730> good<00:03:10.970> to<00:03:11.060> be

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
hoping it would be really good to be

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.440 
hoping it would be really good to be
able<00:03:11.209> to<00:03:11.420> get<00:03:11.600> a<00:03:11.630> game<00:03:11.959> like<00:03:12.489> Borderlands<00:03:13.489> onto

able to get a game like Borderlands onto

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.410 
able to get a game like Borderlands onto
it<00:03:14.660> so<00:03:14.870> it<00:03:15.830> I<00:03:16.070> think<00:03:16.519> that<00:03:16.670> it<00:03:16.850> would<00:03:16.970> be<00:03:17.120> silly

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
it so it I think that it would be silly

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.150 
it so it I think that it would be silly
for<00:03:17.540> them<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.870> say<00:03:18.019> no<00:03:18.290> I<00:03:18.650> think<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.040> major

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
for them to say no I think the major

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.680 
for them to say no I think the major

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
hiccup right now honestly is that

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.479

like talk to each other in game sort of
an<00:03:37.670> idea<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:39.260> problem<00:03:39.769> is<00:03:39.920> is<00:03:40.250> that<00:03:40.310> they're

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
an idea the problem is is that they're

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.670 
an idea the problem is is that they're
like<00:03:41.180> we're<00:03:42.019> not<00:03:42.170> we<00:03:42.950> would<00:03:43.220> not<00:03:43.400> be<00:03:43.459> able<00:03:43.880> to

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
like we're not we would not be able to

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.289 
like we're not we would not be able to
spare<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.890> time<00:03:46.100> to<00:03:46.459> make<00:03:46.640> a<00:03:46.700> Vita<00:03:47.060> version

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
spare the time to make a Vita version

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.780 
spare the time to make a Vita version
but<00:03:48.079> we<00:03:48.230> like<00:03:48.470> our<00:03:48.620> game<00:03:48.829> on<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.220> Vita<00:03:49.459> so

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
but we like our game on the Vita so

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.160 
but we like our game on the Vita so

they're kind of going to Sony and saying
yo<00:03:51.440> you<00:03:51.829> have<00:03:52.010> people<00:03:52.370> who<00:03:52.640> could<00:03:52.820> do<00:03:52.970> this

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
yo you have people who could do this

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.509 
yo you have people who could do this
right<00:03:53.450> like<00:03:53.750> here's<00:03:54.019> the<00:03:54.200> game<00:03:54.380> we<00:03:54.769> got<00:03:54.950> in<00:03:55.160> the

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
right like here's the game we got in the

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.690 
right like here's the game we got in the
game<00:03:55.670> if<00:03:56.000> you<00:03:56.150> want<00:03:56.329> to<00:03:56.420> just<00:03:56.570> take<00:03:56.780> that<00:03:57.019> and

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
game if you want to just take that and

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.319 
game if you want to just take that and
make<00:03:58.700> it<00:03:58.730> for<00:03:59.510> Vita<00:04:00.230> for<00:04:01.130> us<00:04:01.370> I<00:04:01.850> don't<00:04:02.120> know<00:04:02.180> man

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
make it for Vita for us I don't know man

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.000 
make it for Vita for us I don't know man
we'll<00:04:02.540> have<00:04:02.660> to<00:04:02.840> see<00:04:03.019> but<00:04:03.049> I<00:04:03.290> stand<00:04:03.769> by<00:04:03.980> the

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
we'll have to see but I stand by the

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.520 
we'll have to see but I stand by the
idea<00:04:04.430> that<00:04:04.640> if<00:04:05.030> they<00:04:05.239> did<00:04:05.570> get<00:04:05.780> borderlands<00:04:06.350> 2

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
idea that if they did get borderlands 2

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.100 
idea that if they did get borderlands 2
on<00:04:06.680> Vita<00:04:06.950> it<00:04:07.670> would<00:04:08.030> give<00:04:08.060> people<00:04:08.810> more<00:04:08.959> of<00:04:09.049> a

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
on Vita it would give people more of a

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.560 
on Vita it would give people more of a
reason<00:04:09.290> to<00:04:09.440> buy<00:04:09.739> and<00:04:10.010> play<00:04:10.220> their<00:04:10.670> Vitas<00:04:11.120> any
