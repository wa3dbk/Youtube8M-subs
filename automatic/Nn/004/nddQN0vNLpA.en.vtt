mike<00:03:29.760> is<00:03:30.709> because<00:03:31.709> you<00:03:31.860> get<00:03:32.040> way<00:03:32.250> more

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
mike is because you get way more

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.960 
mike is because you get way more
features<00:03:33.780> on<00:03:33.959> this<00:03:34.340> then<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:35.490> do<00:03:35.700> with<00:03:35.880> the

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
features on this then you do with the

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.040 
features on this then you do with the
b12<00:03:36.420> be<00:03:36.810> one<00:03:38.360> it<00:03:39.360> was<00:03:39.630> bigger<00:03:40.370> more<00:03:41.370> bulkier

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
b12 be one it was bigger more bulkier

but<00:03:43.050> you<00:03:43.200> didn't<00:03:43.410> get<00:03:43.530> as<00:03:43.650> many<00:03:43.830> features<00:03:44.280> like

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
but you didn't get as many features like

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
but you didn't get as many features like
I<00:03:45.350> think<00:03:46.350> you<00:03:46.470> just<00:03:46.680> had<00:03:47.209> that's<00:03:48.209> what's<00:03:48.420> right

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
I think you just had that's what's right

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.890 
I think you just had that's what's right
there<00:03:48.720> that<00:03:48.900> uh<00:03:50.390> the<00:03:51.390> DV<00:03:51.780> switch<00:03:52.110> I<00:03:53.270> i<00:03:54.270> think

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
there that uh the DV switch I i think

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.750 
there that uh the DV switch I i think
the<00:03:54.989> DB<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:56.360> the<00:03:57.360> low-cut<00:03:57.870> was<00:03:58.739> on<00:03:59.010> one<00:03:59.459> switch

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
the DB and the low-cut was on one switch

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.380 
the DB and the low-cut was on one switch
it<00:03:59.970> was<00:04:00.060> just<00:04:00.239> driven<00:04:00.590> low<00:04:01.590> cut<00:04:01.890> flat<00:04:02.640> and<00:04:02.910> then

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
it was just driven low cut flat and then

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.680 
it was just driven low cut flat and then
a<00:04:03.450> negative<00:04:04.260> 10<00:04:04.470> DBS<00:04:04.890> I<00:04:05.330> can't<00:04:06.330> remember<00:04:06.360> I

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
a negative 10 DBS I can't remember I

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.300 
a negative 10 DBS I can't remember I
anything<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:07.170> mic<00:04:07.350> in<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.590> wise<00:04:07.800> and<00:04:08.220> there

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
anything the mic in the wise and there

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.310 
anything the mic in the wise and there
might<00:04:08.489> get<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:08.640> while<00:04:08.850> but<00:04:09.570> this<00:04:09.750> one<00:04:09.959> you<00:04:09.989> got

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320
