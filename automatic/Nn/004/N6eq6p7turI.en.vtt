00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
just like so so spectators car could be

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.010 
just like so so spectators car could be
any<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.050> these<00:00:46.200> fifty-two<00:00:46.680> cards<00:00:47.690> now<00:00:48.690> what

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020

any of these fifty-two cards now what
I'm<00:00:49.110> going<00:00:49.380> to<00:00:49.410> do<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.770> I'm<00:00:49.950> going<00:00:50.130> to<00:00:50.250> use<00:00:50.370> a

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
I'm going to do is I'm going to use a

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.290 
I'm going to do is I'm going to use a
process<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.739> elimination<00:00:52.940> to<00:00:53.940> find<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
process of elimination to find the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.600 
process of elimination to find the
spectators<00:00:54.720> card<00:00:54.899> okay<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.950> grab<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> random

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
spectators card okay so grab a random

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.350 
spectators card okay so grab a random
stack<00:00:57.090> like<00:00:57.450> this<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.960> show<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:59.180> so<00:01:00.180> we<00:01:00.329> got

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
stack like this and show you so we got

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.429 
stack like this and show you so we got
the<00:01:00.750> 8<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.230> clubs<00:01:01.579> so<00:01:02.579> there's<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.790> 8<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.030> clubs

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 
the 8 of clubs so there's the 8 of clubs

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:05.990 
the 8 of clubs so there's the 8 of clubs
the<00:01:04.439> spectator<00:01:04.890> selective<00:01:05.280> car<00:01:05.460> where<00:01:05.969> I

the spectator selective car where I

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.740 
the spectator selective car where I
select<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.360> car<00:01:06.860> know<00:01:08.060> how<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.240> one<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.450> it

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
select the car know how this one is it

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.660 
select the car know how this one is it
the<00:01:09.840> Aces<00:01:10.229> base<00:01:11.479> still<00:01:12.479> know<00:01:12.659> how<00:01:13.280> it<00:01:14.280> might<00:01:14.490> be

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the Aces base still know how it might be

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.169 
the Aces base still know how it might be
a<00:01:14.700> little<00:01:14.969> bit<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.179> a<00:01:15.209> problem<00:01:15.560> but<00:01:16.939> well<00:01:17.939> it's

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:18.179 
a little bit of a problem but well it's

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:19.910 
a little bit of a problem but well it's
only<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.450> first<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.840> try<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.259> we<00:01:19.380> serve<00:01:19.560> 50

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
only the first to try so we serve 50

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.919 
only the first to try so we serve 50
more<00:01:20.069> cards<00:01:20.429> we<00:01:20.520> serve<00:01:20.729> 50<00:01:21.090> more<00:01:21.209> chances<00:01:21.659> to

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:21.929 
more cards we serve 50 more chances to

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:24.129 
more cards we serve 50 more chances to
do<00:01:22.079> the<00:01:22.200> process<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.649> elimination

00:01:24.129 --> 00:01:24.139 
do the process of elimination

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:27.349 
do the process of elimination
well<00:01:25.139> if<00:01:25.319> I<00:01:25.409> were<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.740> do<00:01:25.829> that<00:01:26.149> that<00:01:27.149> would<00:01:27.209> be

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
well if I were to do that that would be

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:29.029 
well if I were to do that that would be
very<00:01:27.479> boring<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.499> it<00:01:28.619> would<00:01:28.709> take<00:01:28.859> forever

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
very boring and it would take forever

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.120 
very boring and it would take forever
not<00:01:29.459> very<00:01:29.729> magical<00:01:30.209> indeed<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:31.380> instead<00:01:31.920> what

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
not very magical indeed so instead what

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.370 
not very magical indeed so instead what
I'm<00:01:32.310> going<00:01:32.639> to<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.090> I'm<00:01:33.719> actually<00:01:33.899> going<00:01:34.139> to

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
I'm going to do is I'm actually going to

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.859 
I'm going to do is I'm actually going to
divide<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.399> deck<00:01:35.609> in<00:01:36.539> to<00:01:38.090> be<00:01:39.090> approximately

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
divide the deck in to be approximately

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.160 
divide the deck in to be approximately
even<00:01:40.139> piles<00:01:40.679> as<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.849> see<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.869> what<00:01:43.049> I'm

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
even piles as you can see and what I'm

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.599 
even piles as you can see and what I'm
going<00:01:43.319> to<00:01:43.349> do<00:01:43.499> is<00:01:43.619> I'm<00:01:43.859> going<00:01:43.889> to<00:01:44.099> shuffle<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:44.609 
going to do is I'm going to shuffle the

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:48.440 
going to do is I'm going to shuffle the
cards<00:01:44.999> face<00:01:45.929> up<00:01:46.009> and<00:01:47.009> face<00:01:47.069> down<00:01:47.639> just<00:01:48.060> like<00:01:48.179> so

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
cards face up and face down just like so

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.050 
cards face up and face down just like so
so<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.749> can<00:01:48.810> see<00:01:49.170> they<00:01:49.920> drive<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.310> clearly<00:01:50.579> and

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
so you can see they drive it clearly and

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.789 
so you can see they drive it clearly and
so<00:01:51.990> all<00:01:52.139> the<00:01:52.259> cards<00:01:52.619> by<00:01:52.919> not<00:01:53.099> quite<00:01:53.819> mixed<00:01:57.799> face

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
so all the cards by not quite mixed face

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.039 
so all the cards by not quite mixed face
up<00:01:59.009> face<00:01:59.039> down<00:01:59.450> just<00:02:00.450> like<00:02:00.599> so<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:02.899> let's<00:02:03.899> see

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
up face down just like so and let's see

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:04.879 
up face down just like so and let's see
how<00:02:04.200> we<00:02:04.229> did

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:04.889 
how we did

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:09.100 
how we did
so<00:02:05.759> we<00:02:05.849> got<00:02:06.029> you<00:02:06.450> know<00:02:06.569> some<00:02:06.869> face<00:02:07.079> cards<00:02:07.859> some

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
so we got you know some face cards some

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.020 
so we got you know some face cards some
facedown<00:02:10.110> cards<00:02:10.760> some<00:02:11.760> face-up

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
facedown cards some face-up

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.730 
facedown cards some face-up
and<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:14.320> course<00:02:14.560> some<00:02:14.740> face<00:02:15.070> down<00:02:16.030> cards<00:02:16.740> face

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
and of course some face down cards face

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.740 
and of course some face down cards face
up<00:02:17.770> and<00:02:18.340> face<00:02:19.050> down<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:21.550> with<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.450> little
