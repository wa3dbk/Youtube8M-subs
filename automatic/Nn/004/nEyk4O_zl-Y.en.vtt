is cold
crystallization<00:00:42.379> obviously<00:00:44.180> alright<00:00:45.180> let's

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
crystallization obviously alright let's

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:54.920 
crystallization obviously alright let's
see<00:00:46.079> if<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.649> can<00:00:46.829> turn<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:51.920> there<00:00:52.920> we<00:00:53.070> go<00:00:53.930> look

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
see if it can turn on there we go look

our<00:01:16.750> ThinkPad<00:01:17.289> x1<00:01:17.500> carbon<00:01:17.920> had<00:01:18.219> no<00:01:18.759> problem

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
our ThinkPad x1 carbon had no problem

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.999 
our ThinkPad x1 carbon had no problem
with<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.689> cold<00:01:19.930> let's<00:01:20.229> see<00:01:20.350> how<00:01:20.469> it<00:01:20.590> does<00:01:20.770> with

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
with the cold let's see how it does with

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.039 
with the cold let's see how it does with
the<00:01:21.039> heat<00:01:21.340> all<00:01:22.270> right<00:01:22.390> we<00:01:22.479> have<00:01:22.600> our<00:01:22.720> oven<00:01:22.840> at

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
the heat all right we have our oven at

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.140 
the heat all right we have our oven at
200<00:01:23.710> degrees<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.820> we<00:01:25.240> go

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:37.850 

oh<00:01:30.450> god<00:01:31.450> this<00:01:31.750> feels<00:01:31.990> wrong<00:01:32.970> okay<00:01:33.970> one<00:01:34.510> hour

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:46.260 

off<00:01:38.860> ago<00:01:43.350> all<00:01:44.350> right<00:01:44.850> let's<00:01:45.850> see<00:01:46.000> how<00:01:46.120> it's

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
off ago all right let's see how it's

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:53.490 
off ago all right let's see how it's
doing<00:01:50.040> cool<00:01:51.540> smelling<00:01:52.540> a<00:01:52.630> little<00:01:52.960> bit<00:01:53.110> melty

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
doing cool smelling a little bit melty

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.290 
doing cool smelling a little bit melty
very<00:01:53.800> chemical<00:01:54.340> this<00:01:54.550> is<00:01:54.700> probably<00:01:55.060> off

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
very chemical this is probably off

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.060 
very chemical this is probably off
gassing<00:01:55.810> in<00:01:55.900> a<00:01:55.960> way<00:01:56.110> that<00:01:56.350> I<00:01:56.560> don't<00:01:56.890> want<00:01:57.010> to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
gassing in a way that I don't want to

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.420 
gassing in a way that I don't want to
think<00:01:57.220> about<00:01:57.310> right<00:01:57.580> now<00:01:57.610> okay<00:01:58.800> I<00:01:59.800> am<00:02:00.010> going<00:02:00.280> to

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
think about right now okay I am going to

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.100 
think about right now okay I am going to
assume<00:02:00.850> it's<00:02:01.240> very<00:02:01.420> hot<00:02:01.630> to<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:01.810> touch

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
assume it's very hot to the touch

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.820 
assume it's very hot to the touch
oh<00:02:02.410> it<00:02:03.340> is<00:02:04.860> let's<00:02:05.860> just<00:02:07.229> go<00:02:08.229> ahead<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:08.679> let

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
oh it is let's just go ahead and let

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.830 
oh it is let's just go ahead and let
this<00:02:08.950> little<00:02:09.190> cake<00:02:09.459> rest<00:02:09.820> for<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.209> while<00:02:10.390> and

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
this little cake rest for a while and

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.390 
this little cake rest for a while and
then<00:02:11.110> we'll<00:02:11.260> fire<00:02:11.530> it<00:02:11.560> up<00:02:11.770> and<00:02:11.920> see<00:02:12.010> how<00:02:12.160> it's

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
then we'll fire it up and see how it's

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.210 
then we'll fire it up and see how it's
doing<00:02:12.600> it<00:02:13.600> looks<00:02:13.810> like<00:02:13.959> our<00:02:14.110> pie<00:02:14.320> is<00:02:14.380> done<00:02:14.890> here

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
doing it looks like our pie is done here

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.400 
doing it looks like our pie is done here
it<00:02:15.340> is<00:02:15.459> cooled<00:02:15.730> off<00:02:15.940> enough<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.330> remove<00:02:16.870> from

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
it is cooled off enough to remove from

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.620 
it is cooled off enough to remove from
the<00:02:17.560> pan<00:02:17.730> definitely<00:02:18.730> still<00:02:18.970> warm<00:02:19.300> to<00:02:19.450> touch

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
the pan definitely still warm to touch

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.550 
the pan definitely still warm to touch
on<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.870> bottom<00:02:19.990> that<00:02:20.709> kind<00:02:21.580> of<00:02:21.640> scary<00:02:22.560> scary

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
on the bottom that kind of scary scary

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.530 
on the bottom that kind of scary scary
chemical<00:02:24.010> smell<00:02:24.250> has<00:02:24.459> not<00:02:24.640> gone<00:02:24.850> away<00:02:24.910> that

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
chemical smell has not gone away that

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.910 
chemical smell has not gone away that
probably<00:02:25.900> just<00:02:25.959> took<00:02:26.230> two<00:02:26.440> years<00:02:26.470> off<00:02:26.709> my<00:02:26.770> life

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
probably just took two years off my life

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.590 
probably just took two years off my life
just<00:02:27.280> taken<00:02:27.520> away<00:02:27.610> for<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:27.970> we<00:02:28.450> have<00:02:28.570> a

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
just taken away for that we have a

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.140 
just taken away for that we have a
little<00:02:28.990> bit<00:02:29.080> of<00:02:29.170> warpage<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:30.490> looks<00:02:30.730> like<00:02:30.940> on

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
little bit of warpage it looks like on

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.990 
little bit of warpage it looks like on
one<00:02:31.330> of<00:02:31.360> our<00:02:31.739> covers<00:02:32.739> here<00:02:33.250> we<00:02:33.610> have<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:33.760> little

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
one of our covers here we have a little

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.410 
one of our covers here we have a little
leakage<00:02:34.750> from<00:02:35.019> one<00:02:35.140> of<00:02:35.230> our<00:02:35.320> stickers<00:02:36.420> other

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
leakage from one of our stickers other

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.600 
leakage from one of our stickers other
than<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:37.600> no<00:02:38.019> obvious<00:02:38.650> damage<00:02:38.950> let's<00:02:39.370> see<00:02:39.550> if

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
than that no obvious damage let's see if

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.090 
than that no obvious damage let's see if
we<00:02:39.700> can<00:02:39.820> get<00:02:39.910> it<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.090> come<00:02:40.120> on<00:02:43.769> so<00:02:44.769> it<00:02:44.830> didn't

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
we can get it to come on so it didn't

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.770 
we can get it to come on so it didn't
wake<00:02:45.250> up<00:02:45.459> right<00:02:45.670> from<00:02:45.790> sleep<00:02:46.120> oh<00:02:46.300> you<00:02:46.360> can<00:02:46.630> see

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
wake up right from sleep oh you can see

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.330 
wake up right from sleep oh you can see
we've<00:02:46.930> got<00:02:46.959> some<00:02:47.290> warping<00:02:47.650> here<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:48.130> the

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
we've got some warping here to the

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.100 
we've got some warping here to the
screen<00:02:48.700> is<00:02:48.910> starting<00:02:49.239> to<00:02:49.330> separate<00:02:49.780> from<00:02:49.989> the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
screen is starting to separate from the

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.470 
screen is starting to separate from the
cover<00:02:51.209> and<00:02:52.209> I<00:02:52.330> can<00:02:52.769> snap<00:02:53.769> it<00:02:54.010> back<00:02:54.040> in<00:02:54.519> a<00:02:55.000> little

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
cover and I can snap it back in a little

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.979 
cover and I can snap it back in a little
bit<00:02:55.920> so<00:02:56.920> we<00:02:57.010> definitely<00:02:57.190> have<00:02:57.459> cracking

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
bit so we definitely have cracking

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.780 
bit so we definitely have cracking

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
coming away from the lid on both corners

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.780 
coming away from the lid on both corners
it<00:03:01.090> did<00:03:01.269> not<00:03:01.480> shut<00:03:01.780> down<00:03:02.010> successfully<00:03:03.010> in<00:03:03.459> the

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
it did not shut down successfully in the

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.060 
it did not shut down successfully in the

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
battery life is about the same although

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.930 
battery life is about the same although
we<00:03:19.209> definitely<00:03:19.870> have<00:03:20.110> a<00:03:20.730> little<00:03:21.730> bit<00:03:21.850> of

we definitely have a little bit of

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.350

ThinkPad<00:05:21.350> because<00:05:21.680> frankly<00:05:22.100> it<00:05:22.250> was<00:05:22.370> just<00:05:22.550> to

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
ThinkPad because frankly it was just to

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.090 
ThinkPad because frankly it was just to
who<00:05:23.120> damaged<00:05:23.630> at<00:05:23.870> that<00:05:24.050> point<00:05:24.320> I<00:05:24.500> did<00:05:24.890> do<00:05:25.070> a

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
who damaged at that point I did do a

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.220 
who damaged at that point I did do a
little<00:05:25.220> emergency<00:05:26.180> surgery<00:05:26.780> though<00:05:26.960> to<00:05:27.020> try

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
little emergency surgery though to try

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.050 
little emergency surgery though to try
to<00:05:27.350> open<00:05:27.530> it<00:05:27.800> up<00:05:27.860> and<00:05:28.040> dry<00:05:28.250> it<00:05:28.310> out<00:05:28.550> that's

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
to open it up and dry it out that's

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.370 
to open it up and dry it out that's
something<00:05:29.390> you<00:05:29.510> could<00:05:29.660> try<00:05:29.810> at<00:05:29.900> home<00:05:30.110> so

so it wants to come back to life but

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.260 
so it wants to come back to life but
these<00:06:57.590> few<00:06:58.010> components<00:06:58.490> are<00:06:58.940> just<00:06:59.150> not

working<00:06:59.630> right<00:06:59.750> I<00:06:59.810> think<00:06:59.990> that's<00:07:00.200> probably

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:00.470 
working right I think that's probably

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.030 
working right I think that's probably
fixable<00:07:01.180> although<00:07:02.180> all<00:07:02.390> of<00:07:02.420> that<00:07:02.750> lid<00:07:03.440> damage

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:04.040 
fixable although all of that lid damage

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.710 
fixable although all of that lid damage
was<00:07:04.310> really<00:07:04.640> pretty<00:07:04.880> disappointing

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 
was really pretty disappointing

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.280 
was really pretty disappointing
