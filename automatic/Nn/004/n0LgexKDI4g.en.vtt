00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
given project when I was graduating from

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:05.610 
given project when I was graduating from
college<00:02:04.690> you<00:02:04.870> were<00:02:05.110> hearing<00:02:05.350> a<00:02:05.410> lot<00:02:05.560> about

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
college you were hearing a lot about

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.560 
college you were hearing a lot about
studios<00:02:06.130> going<00:02:06.340> paperless<00:02:06.550> animation<00:02:07.360> and

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
studios going paperless animation and

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.450 
studios going paperless animation and
the<00:02:08.170> major<00:02:08.410> problem<00:02:08.860> with<00:02:08.950> paperless

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
the major problem with paperless

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.610 
the major problem with paperless
animation<00:02:09.970> was<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.660> fact<00:02:10.899> that<00:02:11.020> you<00:02:11.170> had<00:02:11.380> to

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
animation was the fact that you had to

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.920 
animation was the fact that you had to
draw<00:02:11.980> on<00:02:12.010> a<00:02:12.160> tablet<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:12.910> look<00:02:13.600> at<00:02:13.720> what<00:02:13.810> you

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
draw on a tablet and look at what you

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.660 
draw on a tablet and look at what you
were<00:02:14.020> drawing<00:02:14.290> on<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.470> screen<00:02:14.950> so<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.280> lost

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
were drawing on the screen so you lost

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.510 
were drawing on the screen so you lost
that<00:02:16.420> initial<00:02:16.990> effect<00:02:17.380> of<00:02:17.560> literally<00:02:18.040> drawing

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
that initial effect of literally drawing

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.380 
that initial effect of literally drawing
on<00:02:18.850> what<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:19.330> saw<00:02:19.830> now<00:02:20.830> with<00:02:21.490> the<00:02:21.760> wacom

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
on what you saw now with the wacom

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.080 
on what you saw now with the wacom
cintiq<00:02:22.630> it's<00:02:23.410> unbelievably<00:02:24.190> amazing<00:02:24.520> because

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
cintiq it's unbelievably amazing because

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.540 
cintiq it's unbelievably amazing because
you<00:02:25.300> get<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:25.780> exact<00:02:26.290> feeling<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:27.070> can<00:02:27.250> see

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
you get that exact feeling you can see

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.340 
you get that exact feeling you can see
what<00:02:27.910> you're<00:02:28.120> drawing<00:02:28.390> out<00:02:28.750> of<00:02:28.930> any<00:02:29.110> given

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
what you're drawing out of any given

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
what you're drawing out of any given
time<00:02:31.020> one<00:02:32.020> of<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.230> things<00:02:32.440> that<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:32.709> loved<00:02:33.190> when

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
time one of the things that I loved when

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.100 
time one of the things that I loved when
I<00:02:33.400> was<00:02:33.490> animating<00:02:34.180> is<00:02:34.330> how<00:02:34.540> much<00:02:34.660> movement<00:02:34.930> I

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
I was animating is how much movement I

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.930 
I was animating is how much movement I
could<00:02:35.290> get<00:02:35.410> out<00:02:35.440> of<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.650> paper<00:02:35.920> you<00:02:36.910> have

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
could get out of the paper you have

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.820 
could get out of the paper you have
animation<00:02:37.660> dist<00:02:37.930> where<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.410> can<00:02:38.530> literally

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
animation dist where you can literally

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.550 
animation dist where you can literally
rotate<00:02:39.459> your<00:02:39.730> paper<00:02:40.000> 180<00:02:40.930> degrees<00:02:41.290> if<00:02:41.470> you

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
rotate your paper 180 degrees if you

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.140 
rotate your paper 180 degrees if you
want<00:02:41.770> to<00:02:41.920> get<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.160> lines<00:02:42.400> that<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:42.700> want<00:02:43.030> it

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
want to get the lines that you want it

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.960 
want to get the lines that you want it
on<00:02:43.209> paper<00:02:43.480> and<00:02:43.900> I<00:02:44.500> can<00:02:44.709> never<00:02:45.040> really<00:02:45.459> get<00:02:45.760> that

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
on paper and I can never really get that

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.810 
on paper and I can never really get that
send<00:02:46.269> same<00:02:46.630> sensation<00:02:47.290> before<00:02:47.830> using<00:02:48.280> the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
send same sensation before using the

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.360 
send same sensation before using the
cintiq<00:02:49.360> it<00:02:50.019> rotates<00:02:50.500> completely<00:02:51.070> around

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
cintiq it rotates completely around

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.040 
cintiq it rotates completely around
being<00:02:51.850> able<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.150> go<00:02:52.269> at<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.510> from<00:02:52.720> any<00:02:52.900> angle

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
being able to go at it from any angle

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.110 
being able to go at it from any angle
you<00:02:53.260> want<00:02:53.350> being<00:02:54.010> able<00:02:54.160> to<00:02:54.250> get<00:02:54.340> in<00:02:54.459> any<00:02:54.640> detail

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
you want being able to get in any detail

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.840 
you want being able to get in any detail
you<00:02:55.480> want<00:02:55.720> it's<00:02:56.230> very<00:02:56.620> freeing<00:02:57.160> for<00:02:57.610> someone

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
you want it's very freeing for someone

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.180 
you want it's very freeing for someone
like<00:02:57.970> me<00:02:58.150> who<00:02:58.180> absolutely<00:02:58.690> loves<00:02:58.989> to<00:02:59.260> draw<00:02:59.560> it

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
like me who absolutely loves to draw it

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.650 
like me who absolutely loves to draw it
was<00:03:00.340> kind<00:03:00.550> of<00:03:00.610> bridging<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.060> gap<00:03:01.239> between<00:03:01.269> the

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
was kind of bridging the gap between the

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.960 
was kind of bridging the gap between the
computer<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.110> animation<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:02.920> so<00:03:03.100> I<00:03:03.370> can<00:03:03.670> see

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
computer and animation and so I can see

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.660 
computer and animation and so I can see
now<00:03:04.300> paperless<00:03:04.840> an<00:03:04.989> animation<00:03:05.410> at<00:03:05.769> studio<00:03:06.580> is

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
now paperless an animation at studio is

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.100 
now paperless an animation at studio is
really<00:03:07.030> working<00:03:07.239> working<00:03:07.570> for<00:03:07.810> someone<00:03:07.959> like

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
really working working for someone like

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.160 
really working working for someone like
me<00:03:08.380> and<00:03:08.530> that's<00:03:08.650> exciting
