00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.030
 hello and welcome to the golf shop i 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.530
 I'm back on your way 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:18.240
 understandably, come now 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:21.300
 of course, ask for than reactive 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.730
 my video is the truth about your whey 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.410
 protein question mark extra 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.599
 question mark behind it because it has to be yes 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.609
 not necessarily in each of the case 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.410
 Of course I will now click facebook 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.079
 news and e-mails as well 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.600
 example of the country and florian is 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.850
 my whey protein xy 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.820
 in the whole story we 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.250
 have been legally for a very long time 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.660
 seek advice 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.680
 we actually have ten 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.480
 Analyzes drawn and as I said the the 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.620
 Analyzes were terrifying 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.789
 for a discrepancy came about 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.520
 We have said we are legally 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.230
 let us advise it makes sense we can 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.390
 to publish these things at all 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.920
 as a reseller yes no and 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.180
 in fact it then happened that we 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.729
 No, we can not say that 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.670
 because the risk is legal here 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.799
 to be drawn to the account 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.250
 because of slander or something else is there 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.400
 Too high that means I can neither do you 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.750
 answer in writing if your putin 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.490
 I was there for you 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.390
 Hand tools now given to the hand 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.939
 how could you possibly check that 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.470
 You can lennart very short addition to 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.930
 you called the company the duh 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.780
 as far as I can endure use my 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.490
 opinion of this isolate that to 97 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.600
 percent in dry matter the whole thing in it 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.369
 that means there you could as well 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.939
 recalculate if there is the indication 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.259
 is accordingly realistic and 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:56.280
 Florian at the company called the duh 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.920
 Did you do the math as well 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.930
 Already out there so alone with the 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.530
 theory that you could calculate there 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.149
 Do you actually know that already ? 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.840
 As I said, we are legally 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.629
 We can not get advice 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.010
 we would love to do that though 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.510
 do not we also have a few others 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.819
 things said about the people 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.010
 positive the positive surprises 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.450
 second time from those from the analyzes 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.220
 we want to turn them out 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.870
 We do not because they are us then 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.599
 could not turn out either 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.530
 have not been tested or 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.330
 be noticed negatively 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.739
 and that would make you one again 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.840
 throw pot and then you would have again 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.430
 a legal problem 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.140
 I'm trying somehow a solution 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.299
 i hope we can stay in the 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.580
 next time next six months 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.709
 somehow clarify that we are there too 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.360
 neatly enlighten end customers 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.590
 because in my opinion that is 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.829
 already extremely noticeable what happens there 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.780
 as I said again I do 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.670
 no brand bad i do not want any 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.739
 make magic bad for the most part 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.209
 do not know the mark itself I am 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.489
 only the opinion should be painted next to 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.590
 Doing your homework I believe that 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.549
 I have with the first video 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.879
 I hope I can do it, I hope 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.950
 ye have also shared this video 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.060
 accordingly with it the marks and the 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.720
 manufacturer then, of course, too 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.900
 attentively 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.940
 because if I often with me 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.440
 The people from the brands with me 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.079
 on the spot are the entertained 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.980
 In fact, they have no idea 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.959
 not they are, of course 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.940
 sales representative and not the 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.639
 Developer but as I said not synonymous 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:32.680
 on the fibo was there with me is with me 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:35.349
 because of the experience that grown 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.569
 people because they were there and so too 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.060
 in development work there not so 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.060
 really 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.830
 on the stand of the things were that is 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.480
 I just wanted to shake it up and 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.209
 wanted to think and thought 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.800
 give you the tools to hand 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.390
 We can at least recalculate that 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.900
 in theory also the practice then 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.660
 turn to the practice and an analysis 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.560
 then again the whole is withstood 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.560
 like a completely different story 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:08.280
 Quite often will also be on labels in the 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.830
 concentrate and isolate percentage 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.230
 stated 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.810
 the one with our analysis back and forth 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.609
 does not match where you always be 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.709
 what okay so much isolate you can not 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.049
 if we have this analysis 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.930
 out comes the only 2% or 23 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.729
 but maybe I differ 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.419
 can not do anything about it now 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:32.700
 Unfortunately, to conclude with 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.850
 give it to us because easy 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.400
 jobs are in danger and so on 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.220
 But then I do not do it myself 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.340
 I hope I can do it very fast 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.320
 working out 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.910
 please watch the video again if 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.990
 you ask him at euroairport him 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:51.900
 actually maybe there is underneath 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.370
 and calculate accordingly yourself 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.460
 I can not do that in writing 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.680
 expressed as the just always against a 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.510
 can be used and then that is 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.039
 bude faster than you can watch 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.840
 because there are probably the 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.310
 manufacturer not exactly squeamish 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.850
 but is it really about the good 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.460
 names 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.479
 and as I said, though I'm nobody 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.700
 let us suppose that with intention 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.990
 could you imply that to me 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.570
 that I want to subordinate that and 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.840
 then is said doing that means taking 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.669
 really the shapes themselves and the 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.650
 percentage shares makes you as a 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:27.330
 excel this is a funny 3 set 4 set 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:29.930
 what do I have to be something formal and then 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.930
 aligned very fast
