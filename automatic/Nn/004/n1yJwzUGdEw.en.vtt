00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
a 5-inch screen it's one of the easiest

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
expandable memory are obvious pluses as

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.020 
expandable memory are obvious pluses as
far<00:00:40.980> as<00:00:41.070> all<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.399> new<00:00:41.550> features<00:00:41.910> were

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
new ways of doing tasks we've done

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.810 
new ways of doing tasks we've done
before<00:00:45.210> were<00:00:46.110> they<00:00:46.260> all<00:00:46.410> practical<00:00:46.950> well<00:00:47.129> even

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
before were they all practical well even

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.160 
before were they all practical well even
back<00:00:47.969> then<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.210> knew<00:00:48.300> some<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.660> them<00:00:48.870> were<00:00:49.020> more

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
back then I knew some of them were more

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.139 
back then I knew some of them were more
like<00:00:49.379> gimmicks<00:00:49.739> than<00:00:49.980> real<00:00:50.370> game<00:00:50.670> changers

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
like gimmicks than real game changers

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.900 
like gimmicks than real game changers
and<00:00:51.360> when<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.050> came<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.379> TouchWiz<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:53.039> was<00:00:53.399> never

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
and when it came to TouchWiz I was never

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.670 
and when it came to TouchWiz I was never
actually<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.390> fan<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.809> as<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> user<00:00:55.199> interface

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
actually a fan of it as a user interface

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.799 
actually a fan of it as a user interface
but<00:00:56.370> on<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> bigger<00:00:56.789> screen<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.360> thought<00:00:57.690> it

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
but on a bigger screen I thought it

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.260 
but on a bigger screen I thought it
actually<00:00:58.109> worked<00:00:58.260> better<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.550> had<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.030> phone

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.670 
differentiate between the s3 and the s4
easily<00:02:18.330> but<00:02:18.690> it's<00:02:18.810> become<00:02:19.080> clear<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.350> me<00:02:19.440> that

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
easily but it's become clear to me that

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.770 
easily but it's become clear to me that
the<00:02:19.770> general<00:02:20.130> user<00:02:20.310> can't<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.030> without<00:02:21.600> being

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
overtly head-turning the s4 just looks

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.780 
overtly head-turning the s4 just looks
and<00:02:24.150> feels<00:02:24.390> like<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.810> old<00:02:24.960> s3<00:02:25.500> as

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
and feels like the old s3 as

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.280 
and feels like the old s3 as
tried-and-true<00:02:26.790> as<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.150> design<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.810> s4

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
start as the exciting features were used

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.280 
start as the exciting features were used
less<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:35.730> less<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.270> more<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.600> phone<00:02:36.930> felt

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
less and less the more the phone felt

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.650 
less and less the more the phone felt
older<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:38.010> without<00:02:38.670> anything<00:02:39.210> else<00:02:39.360> that

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
older and without anything else that

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.960 
older and without anything else that
could<00:02:39.810> turn<00:02:39.960> heads<00:02:40.320> it<00:02:40.800> gradually<00:02:41.280> felt<00:02:41.640> less

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
could turn heads it gradually felt less

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.060 
could turn heads it gradually felt less
exciting<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.320> only<00:02:43.470> after<00:02:43.740> a<00:02:43.950> few

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
exciting and this is only after a few

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.580
