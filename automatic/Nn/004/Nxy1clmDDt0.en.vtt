still<00:02:06.130> because<00:02:06.430> you<00:02:06.550> only<00:02:06.700> have<00:02:07.030> one<00:02:07.330> chance

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
still because you only have one chance

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.930 
still because you only have one chance
of<00:02:07.960> doing<00:02:08.170> this<00:02:08.470> so<00:02:09.280> let's<00:02:09.580> just<00:02:09.790> say<00:02:09.910> for

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
of doing this so let's just say for

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.810 
of doing this so let's just say for
example<00:02:10.209> somebody<00:02:10.929> has<00:02:11.230> 60<00:02:11.709> or<00:02:11.800> 70<00:02:12.220> k<00:02:12.400> in<00:02:12.610> bed

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
example somebody has 60 or 70 k in bed

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.940 
example somebody has 60 or 70 k in bed
bank<00:02:13.060> account<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:13.570> you<00:02:13.989> decide<00:02:14.320> to<00:02:14.470> only<00:02:14.620> take

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
bank account and you decide to only take

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.160 
bank account and you decide to only take
30<00:02:15.220> k<00:02:15.640> then<00:02:16.150> that<00:02:16.360> is<00:02:16.510> how<00:02:16.690> much<00:02:16.870> you<00:02:17.019> will<00:02:17.140> be

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
30 k then that is how much you will be

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.020 
30 k then that is how much you will be
getting<00:02:17.500> because<00:02:17.769> you<00:02:18.040> cannot<00:02:18.340> go<00:02:18.550> back<00:02:18.820> into

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
getting because you cannot go back into

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.670 
getting because you cannot go back into
the<00:02:19.209> same<00:02:19.360> account<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.900> steal<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.320> rest<00:02:20.500> of

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
the money and I was thinking maybe for

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.300 
the money and I was thinking maybe for
more<00:02:22.989> money<00:02:23.170> you're<00:02:23.380> still<00:02:23.709> four<00:02:23.920> more<00:02:24.070> things

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310
