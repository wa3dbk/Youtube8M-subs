00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:11.750
 Yes So what's next? Which of the following is wrong about boiler water management? 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:16.880
 This is a very important theme for heel water management, and this one comes out frequently 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:19.310
 No matter what you ask for, I 'll come up with a lot of water management so let's hold it down 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:25.609
 It is to say any thing that is wrong 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:28.130
 Whether the aqueous solution is positive or alkaline by the spirit of hydrogen and hydroxide ions in water 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:34.699
 Be determined 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:37.090
 The alkali is what the US faction is by API er Harbor Queen 25 degrees is number 73 more than the favor 7 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:37.090
 It is sex 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:46.600
 3 consumption is oxide carbonate contained in water 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:54.510
 Indicates the amount of acid component such as bicarbonate 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:54.510
 3 consumption is divided into Mr. I 4.8 chattel consumption pH is to 3 consumption 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:04.379
 All codes correspond to the amount of calcium and magnesium ions in water 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:09.170
 Translated into an amount of calcium carbonate 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:15.119
 If the material is expressed by the number of grams in one liter 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.689
 I'll ask for the definition of moonlight words, so it might be difficult if I don't know 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.920
 But 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.920
 Please think yes 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:34.440
 I would like to announce the answer. The answer is here. 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:35.250
 33 consumption indicates the amount of acid components, such as oxides carbonates bicarbonates contained in the water 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.510
 If there 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:45.580
 This is wrong, but let's see other options . 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:50.680
 I so and so water feel or acidic or alkaline say so this is the other defining story 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:54.010
 Then and Konen acidic Please remember that it mon such of you or the other this story liquor 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.720
 Even if it is alkaline, this is also a voice 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:01.870
 voice 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:04.660
 That the cat I mean bought and Na what was number it contains the bottom of the numbers I think that there is no Well I this 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.720
 When you do not know yo try to pull the workshop on their own pitch 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:12.940
 Nara Please write anymore 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:15.050
 I freely in that I do not know anymore forced Lucky Seven and the price is the array even when the say so 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.180
 What do various wrote've been effective 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:26.140
 Please be prepared to do that image storage What 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:30.879
 And this is this , consumption is 3 consumption soccer acidity alkaline 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.379
 It might have come out even in the storage place , but the amount of consumption of science in junior high school etc. 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:39.200
 I will not come out for a moment 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:42.530
 So here is a little this side and the cat obviously not the correct place Tteyuu would know 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.490
 Very much because he the head will come to hear that so Toko is 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:52.700
 Because nothing 's also do it Well good snow say that seems to question and 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:55.760
 In the three components of 3ds buy arithmetic that is included in the breeze during even though this is 3'm consumption amount is 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:00.740
 There is no alkaline alkaline 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:05.000
 This is just the right do such things show the statement of alkali But say or to say How about this 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.510
 Is divided into Mr. stretched to the reference medical 4.8 of Tteyuu 3 consumption I 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.490
 Of whether this if say that 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.800
 The 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:15.610
 Ne 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:19.360
 Or neutralized by consuming an acid how much and when to whether this figure 4.8 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:25.330
 That is, a there there is a station I have by alkali 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:28.790
 Sometimes Mr. dropped and in Chiwa to neutralize it Then but it is not going to be the 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.670
 The Use a Dondake's when the pillars to 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.300
 It is the amount of consumption of video 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.300
 Because 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:43.060
 In the fact that driving a 3 to the alkali content in you are buying How much I alkali 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.470
 Because it is an alkali 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:50.540
 Three parts work will only become more acidic to Ms's until it shows the amount 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:54.260
 So this is different from here 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:57.439
 Well this is so well classified 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:03.079
 I remember that 's right , so this code before now 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:03.859
 Whole code Well this is right as it is. Add calcium ion in the water and a charge for maggrey sieve. 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.340
 It is 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:12.410
 Say was this in those who knew that also was 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.790
 Well around here magnesium degree is to say selfishly and Karajiumu asks To possibly 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.260
 There may be something like 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:20.380
 The code before this 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:25.900
 It does not seem to be familiar, but that is that 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:27.970
 Ya I hard water diet was popular a little old days are diet a good water it hard water perfume 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.480
 Tsu-sama is this is this 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.920
 Because 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.770
 a ridge 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:40.610
 Meaning the balance you want water which calcium was I Oh An Inn is when entering and perfume 5 convenience store 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:47.090
 I like a thing that ions and magnesium ions are added together 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:51.139
 If you remember 8 like this and remember 11 you remember and kitten Reale that time 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:55.909
 Ne I think that it be recalled that Tteyuu conducted Do's Tan 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:05:00.319
 Carried out at that time I uh while studying at Well study It is as much as possible even though is the image that 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:03.259
 If you try to remember as much as possible, it is hard to forget 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:08.349
 Please keep in mind the boiler on a daily basis 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:08.349
 Yes, it was a story of boiler replacement
