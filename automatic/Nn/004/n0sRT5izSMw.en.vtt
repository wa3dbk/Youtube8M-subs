00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:05.989
 ah 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.630
 today we are going to talk about the famous fund of 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.940
 wardrobe but before knowing what 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.459
 we have to have in the closet we're going to 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.560
 learn to remove what does not work 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.779
 from the closet 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.910
 this of throwing the clothing does not 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.619
 It hurts a lot, it hurts us a lot because there 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.480
 garments that have given us there are garments 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.400
 it has cost us a lot of money that 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.689
 typical garment that we love that the 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.160
 we have in the closet but when we the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.900
 we put on we are so bad that we the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.910
 we have to get back out but never the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.680
 we throw there stays in the closet 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.050
 garments that go great take 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.629
 small good let's try to make a 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.040
 little bit of classification to know how 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.640
 you have to do to throw these 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.309
 useless garments 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.220
 in the preparatory phase there are two moments 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.920
 important happens number one take out all 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.350
 the wardrobe clothes if all the clothes of the 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.360
 wardrobe and put it on top of the bed and the 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.750
 second phase is to prepare a large bag 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.000
 of black trash for who black because 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.769
 once I have put the clothes inside no 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.740
 I'll be tempted to take it out again 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:10.860
 because I do not see it because the black bag 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.509
 and putting together those of value let's start 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.000
 throw all those pieces that 1 pieces 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.220
 that we do not like anymore if I do not 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.810
 like I'm not going to put on clothes that 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.590
 we know that color does not feel anything 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.630
 well outside poorly preserved garments and 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.610
 clothes that are no longer fashionable or that 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.610
 make more than two seasons that I do not 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.649
 I put and most important of all all 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.590
 those garments that do not fit me with 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.450
 the current figure that of keeping those 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.780
 jeans that are small for me when 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.649
 I lose weight is a psychological torture 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.800
 forget yourself when you lose weight 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.500
 you will want to buy hard clothes 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.270
 well and all those awards that with 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.010
 Much love has brought us from all 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.590
 parts of the world those shirts 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.810
 wonderful the one in london the one 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.150
 Amsterdam and so on all these shirts 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.950
 and memories that we do not want to throw away because 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.920
 are memories we will put them in a 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:12.080
 lovely little box that puts memories but 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.080
 not in the newspaper cabinet 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.290
 It is very important and I assure you very 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.630
 important that all the pieces that 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.080
 they are in my closet they fit me and I 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.360
 favor and is also very important 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.040
 that I can see everything I have in the 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.280
 wardrobe because if I have a wardrobe 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.570
 full I always wear the same 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.230
 agreement so it's very important 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:41.170
 have everything well placed and in sight 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.420
 once cleaned everything and thrown everything 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.120
 that we have to throw away we are going to order the 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.370
 closet yes and we're going to put all the 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.260
 doors like in stores looking 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.959
 towards the same side all the jackets 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.700
 together and fastened on the first button 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.230
 so that the 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.090
 hangers are very important that they are not 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.519
 of those of iron that do as 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.319
 shoulders like that because because we 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.730
 deform clothes and when we put on 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.709
 that shirt makes us that little bump 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.319
 here and we do not get it back out so 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.290
 let's buy proper weights so 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.730
 we said the coats on the same side and 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.049
 buttoned the first button also 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.790
 buttoned the first button of the shirts 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.500
 let's put all the shirts together and 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.440
 we are going to put all the pants 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.060
 together everyone always in sight 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.370
 personally I advise you to separate 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.620
 clothes by category and not by colors 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.090
 it is better to have it during the day than at night and 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.940
 short sleeve shirts that of 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.290
 turtleneck dress shirts by 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.790
 different categories is much more 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.410
 simple visually know what 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.840
 we have in the closet 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.640
 against shoes is also very 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.110
 important that we can see what shoes 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.520
 we have sometimes we forget that 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.080
 we have that because we have them in 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.150
 accumulated boxes in the closet 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.310
 if you have them in boxes, take a picture 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.080
 and you lose it in the box and so always 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.210
 you will know what shoes you have in agreement 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.740
 because that of putting the name sometimes does not 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.260
 you remember what the red shoe was 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.000
 that you have the good position because 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.980
 we have thrown everything that we 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.320
 We have placed well all that 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.580
 we have now and we can finally do 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.510
 a shopping list of what 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.110
 we really lack and especially take care 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.110
 of clothes 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.500
 take care of the clothes like this we give you many 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.609
 years 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.609
 happy closet background 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.200
