00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:03.289
 Hello. 

00:00:03.289 --> 00:00:06.220
 I am Serizawa, an afterbeat music school guitarist. 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:13.020
 This time, it's called "percussive" which is squeezed like this in the code. 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.750
 I would like to explain how to play this kind of sound. 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.150
 I will try because I think that the image is a bit difficult. 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.870
 It is like this. 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.280
 That's such a feeling. 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:44.280
 Even if this is not included at all, ... 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.240
 Such feeling is OK at all, but 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.689
 You will feel alive with the sound when you put it on. 

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:02.850
 The song I'm playing is "CAN'T TAKE MY EYES OFF YOU", though. 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:24.840
 With this kind of feeling like "Oh, Wee," I think you can see the feeling of coming alive. 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.820
 In this first movie, start from the point of making this sound easily, 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.479
 I think it would be nice to do some more practical phrases in the second video. 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.270
 Let's do it now. 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.930
 First of all, I don't use picks, so I have to play with my fingers, 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.920
 For example, what should the code do? Shall we usually make it C? 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.350
 The code is C. 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.570
 So, hold C with your left hand, 5 strings of thumb with your right hand, 4 strings with your index finger, 3 strings with your middle finger, and 2 strings with your ring finger. 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.299
 It is the order of 5, 4, 3 and 2, right? 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.600
 There are 5 strings of thumb, 4 strings of index finger, 3 strings of (middle finger) and 2 strings of (ring finger). 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.079
 In the feeling that. 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.880
 So, I will play Bonn once with four fingers here. 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.559
 As it is with Bonn. 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:15.189
 So, here's a quick look at these four fingers. 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.760
 It feels like I'll slap it on this string. 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.889
 A snap. 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:25.700
 The strength changes a little depending on the string height, but 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.029
 People with low strings simply use snaps on their wrists and give them a shot. 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:36.269
 I think a sound of pat sounds if you give it a ton. 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.399
 People who have a high string may not be able to play if you do not give it strong but 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:45.190
 Please try trial and error in various ways. 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.209
 It's like taking something from an arm that people who don't get used to do it well. 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.579
 As an image I think, do you feel like knocking on the door? 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.069
 If there is a door, it won't go like this when knocking on the door. 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.409
 It might be, but I usually think that I will use a wrist to control. 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.419
 It is this knocking action. This swing using the wrist. 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:11.650
 Using snaps, the image seems to do lightly with tontontonton. 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.969
 With the movement of this wrist 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:17.589
 Let's beat the strings. 

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:23.510
 The reverb is a bit deep now, and it sounds like Zuko, Zuko, Zuko, 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.769
 Don't worry too much. 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:28.899
 Something like this. 

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:30.669
 So there is one more point, 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:34.109
 I would like to do it if I can do this, but when I put it with this pong, 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:41.939
 I also want the four fingers to be able to return to the position of 5, 4, 3 and 2 strings. 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.739
 I will play it once, with Bonn. 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.379
 If you play it once and put it on with a knocking action. 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:54.359
 Then your fingers are on standby, just bend your fingers and play 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:59.559
 I want you to make it ready to play one more time soon. 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:02.899
 Play and knock. Then you are ready to play. 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:07.469
 Play and knock. Play and knock. Play, knock and. 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:10.839
 If you give a bad example, I will play it, ah. 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:15.049
 I play it, this time with my whole hand, I am preparing to play again. 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.220
 Play, do the whole hand, prepare to play, not, 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:27.789
 Play this action together and hit it. Play and strike. Play and hit. 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:29.819
 Something like this. 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:33.170
 It looks pretty easy because it's doing lightly, but 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.659
 I think it is very difficult without getting used to it. 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:45.009
 The left hand can not form well and can not land well on each string, but let's do our best to practice. 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:49.790
 So, I will return to the place where I hold the left hand to C again, 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.610
 Play C once 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.679
 Well, knock. 

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:58.080
 Play and knock. 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.289
 Let's just repeat that. 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:09.530
 If this gets used, put it on the rhythm. 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.380
 Wow buffon and buffon. 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.559
 Why? It sounds like this. 

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:21.830
 Is this this? 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:22.890
 I will. 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.129
 Well, that's what it feels like. 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:26.569
 Play and knock. Play, stop the sound, knock. 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:31.509
 Play and stop. Play, stop the sound, knock and. 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:37.509
 It's a little hard. 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:43.090
 Let's be able to play a good rhythm. 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.550
 If you can do this, please proceed to the next video. 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.840
 If you can't do this for a while, let's get in more detail. 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.719
 I hit the C code and knocked, but 

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:01.789
 This rhythm has to be cut off with the left hand, so 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:05.360
 Stop playing with your left hand. 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.039
 Pup that woo is ringing. 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:11.270
 So if you do it very slowly, you may play. 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.629
 So you stop the sound. So knock on, 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:18.899
 If you stop again, your finger is on standby and you can play it again. 

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:21.699
 Stop the sound, knock and. 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:22.979
 If you do this very simply, 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:26.349
 Play, stop and knock. Play, stop and knock. 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:29.569
 Play, stop and knock. Play, stop and knock. 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:31.699
 There are only these three actions. 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:39.699
 This is the same order, but change the rhythm. 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.650
 If I do it, I think it's going really smoothly. 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:49.919
 The point is the ring finger. 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:51.770
 Look closely at your left hand movement. 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:58.770
 I'm muted with my ring finger, though. 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.369
 It feels like that. 

00:07:03.369 --> 00:07:06.270
 I think I can't do it right away, so I think I can't do it well 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.529
 I think if you can go to the next video after practicing for a while. 

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:12.770
 In the next video, using index finger next time 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:18.909
 This is what I say, If you are in music, you become x. 

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:22.029
 Should I say percussive? Should I say mute? 

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:27.670
 Hey I do not know the name, but is this kind of guy? 

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.219
 I would like to explain this. 

00:07:30.219 --> 00:07:32.599
 Please proceed to the next video if it works.
