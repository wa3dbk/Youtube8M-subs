00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
top but even with a pin figure I mean

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.990 
top but even with a pin figure I mean
this<00:01:04.409> isn't<00:01:04.619> drawn<00:01:04.920> by<00:01:05.100> Leonardo<00:01:05.549> da<00:01:05.610> Vinci

but<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.390> can<00:01:06.570> see<00:01:07.610> it<00:01:08.610> tells<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> story

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
but you can see it tells the story

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.750 
but you can see it tells the story
immediately<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:10.260> enough<00:01:10.560> tight<00:01:10.939> person

immediately is enough tight person

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.340 
immediately is enough tight person
because<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.909> can<00:01:15.030> see<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.360> stiffness<00:01:16.049> up<00:01:16.229> in

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
because you can see the stiffness up in

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.609 
because you can see the stiffness up in
the<00:01:16.439> top<00:01:16.650> hardly<00:01:17.220> moving<00:01:17.400> at<00:01:17.520> all<00:01:18.470> there's<00:01:19.470> an

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
old man and you can see the one leg is

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.270 
old man and you can see the one leg is
going<00:01:21.479> past<00:01:21.960> slowly<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.799> other<00:01:22.920> foot<00:01:23.189> is

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
going past slowly the other foot is

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.219 
going past slowly the other foot is
coming<00:01:23.520> back<00:01:23.670> coming<00:01:24.090> forward<00:01:24.509> quick<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:25.080> give

look<00:01:59.520> at<00:01:59.729> a<00:02:00.360> rubber<00:02:00.659> ball<00:02:01.009> bouncing<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.450> this

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
look at a rubber ball bouncing and this

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.080 
look at a rubber ball bouncing and this
is<00:02:03.600> what<00:02:03.750> happens<00:02:04.110> when<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.500> soft<00:02:05.070> object<00:02:05.520> meets

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
is what happens when a soft object meets

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.180 
is what happens when a soft object meets
a<00:02:06.270> hard<00:02:06.509> object<00:02:06.689> now<00:02:07.350> here<00:02:07.560> we<00:02:07.680> see<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.860> boys

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
a hard object now here we see the boys

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.029 
a hard object now here we see the boys
coming<00:02:08.489> down<00:02:08.729> it's<00:02:08.940> distorting<00:02:09.810> out<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.770> out

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
coming down it's distorting out of out

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.650 
coming down it's distorting out of out
of<00:02:11.280> all

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
of all

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.740 
of all
it's<00:02:12.930> really<00:02:13.110> stretching<00:02:13.770> out<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:15.480> now<00:02:15.570> look

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
it's really stretching out and now look

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.940 
it's really stretching out and now look
at<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.930> there<00:02:16.080> is<00:02:16.140> flattened<00:02:16.650> out<00:02:16.680> like<00:02:16.830> an

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
at it there is flattened out like an

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.400 
at it there is flattened out like an
aspirin<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.610> mean<00:02:17.910> in<00:02:18.390> animation<00:02:19.050> we<00:02:19.200> would

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
aspirin I mean in animation we would

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.020 
aspirin I mean in animation we would
hold<00:02:19.920> on<00:02:20.100> that<00:02:20.250> for<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.550> couple<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.850> frames

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
hold on that for a couple of frames

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.700 
hold on that for a couple of frames
because<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.990> know<00:02:22.110> we<00:02:22.230> really<00:02:22.260> want<00:02:22.650> to

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
because you know we really want to

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.520 
because you know we really want to
emphasize<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.400> sort<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.120> squash<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.350> is

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
emphasize that sort of squash that is

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.360 
emphasize that sort of squash that is
called<00:02:25.830> in<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.670> business<00:02:26.850> squash<00:02:28.370> fantastic

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
called in the business squash fantastic

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.370 
called in the business squash fantastic
that<00:02:29.520> now<00:02:29.760> when<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.300> ball<00:02:30.570> comes<00:02:30.810> up<00:02:31.050> I<00:02:31.230> mean

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
that now when the ball comes up I mean

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.070 
that now when the ball comes up I mean
it<00:02:31.500> changes<00:02:32.250> like<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.430> pair<00:02:32.820> now<00:02:33.480> in<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.900> next

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
it changes like a pair now in the next

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.570 
it changes like a pair now in the next
shot<00:02:34.260> you'll<00:02:34.620> see<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.950> weight<00:02:35.130> goes<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.490> the

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
shot you'll see the weight goes to the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.710 
shot you'll see the weight goes to the
top<00:02:35.790> they'll<00:02:35.910> look<00:02:36.030> at<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.300> that's<00:02:36.480> that's

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
top they'll look at that that's that's

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.320 
top they'll look at that that's that's
fantastic<00:02:37.440> now<00:02:38.010> in<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.460> next<00:02:38.640> one<00:02:38.910> it

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
fantastic now in the next one it

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.890 
fantastic now in the next one it
stretches<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.470> zips<00:02:40.770> off<00:02:40.920> like<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.190> rocket<00:02:41.900> now

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
stretches and zips off like a rocket now

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.570 
stretches and zips off like a rocket now
we're<00:02:43.080> going<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.290> have<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.530> look<00:02:43.740> at<00:02:44.010> an

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
we're going to have a look at an

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.060 
we're going to have a look at an
animated<00:02:45.570> bouncing<00:02:46.080> ball<00:02:46.290> where<00:02:46.770> you<00:02:46.860> see<00:02:47.040> the

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
animated bouncing ball where you see the

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.650 
animated bouncing ball where you see the
same<00:02:47.370> principle<00:02:47.850> in<00:02:47.970> action<00:02:49.250> so<00:02:50.250> squash<00:02:50.730> drag

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
same principle in action so squash drag

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.350 
same principle in action so squash drag
and<00:02:51.930> stretch<00:02:52.550> squash<00:02:53.550> is<00:02:53.760> when<00:02:53.940> something

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
and stretch squash is when something

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.970 
and stretch squash is when something
gets<00:02:54.480> squashed<00:02:54.900> on<00:02:55.260> impact<00:02:55.880> drag<00:02:56.880> is<00:02:57.180> when<00:02:57.390> it

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
gets squashed on impact drag is when it

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.400 
gets squashed on impact drag is when it
there<00:02:58.980> is<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.130> delayed<00:02:59.780> movement<00:03:00.780> effect<00:03:01.140> and

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
there is a delayed movement effect and

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.540 
there is a delayed movement effect and
stretch<00:03:02.370> is<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.910> rebound<00:03:03.420> after<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:04.230> squash

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
stretch is the rebound after the squash

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.640 
stretch is the rebound after the squash
now<00:03:05.550> we<00:03:05.610> use<00:03:06.000> these<00:03:06.330> things<00:03:06.360> with<00:03:06.900> more<00:03:07.320> or

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
now we use these things with more or

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.950 
now we use these things with more or
less<00:03:07.950> exaggeration<00:03:08.760> according<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.750> style

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
less exaggeration according to the style

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.010 
less exaggeration according to the style
of<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.260> film<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.590> we're<00:03:10.740> making<00:03:10.940> so

the<00:03:24.150> problem<00:03:24.450> what<00:03:24.690> happens<00:03:24.959> to<00:03:25.080> an<00:03:25.170> elephant

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
the problem what happens to an elephant

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.330 
the problem what happens to an elephant
drop<00:03:26.010> from<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.340> great<00:03:26.550> height<00:03:26.580> and<00:03:28.160> you<00:03:29.160> can

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
drop from a great height and you can

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.060 
drop from a great height and you can
feel<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.640> weight<00:03:30.140> by<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.200> speed<00:03:31.590> via<00:03:31.890> the

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
feel the weight by the speed via the

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.500 
feel the weight by the speed via the
cloud<00:03:32.220> going<00:03:32.610> by<00:03:32.880> somehow<00:03:33.390> now<00:03:34.260> what<00:03:34.440> happens

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
cloud going by somehow now what happens

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.110 
cloud going by somehow now what happens
the<00:03:36.510> volume<00:03:36.900> spreads<00:03:37.400> now<00:03:38.400> this<00:03:38.610> isn't<00:03:38.790> quite

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
the volume spreads now this isn't quite

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.670 
the volume spreads now this isn't quite
right<00:03:39.480> i<00:03:39.540> mean<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:39.990> would<00:03:40.110> happen<00:03:40.230> very<00:03:40.500> much

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
right i mean it would happen very much

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.440 
right i mean it would happen very much
faster<00:03:41.190> but<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.459> student<00:03:41.790> understands<00:03:42.209> the

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
faster but the student understands the

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.390 
faster but the student understands the
principal<00:03:42.959> and<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.560> great<00:03:43.830> thing<00:03:43.860> about<00:03:44.070> this

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
principal and the great thing about this

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.040 
principal and the great thing about this
is<00:03:44.459> you<00:03:44.640> can<00:03:44.670> keep<00:03:45.000> testing<00:03:45.300> if<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:45.810> don't<00:03:45.959> get

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
is you can keep testing if you don't get

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.110 
is you can keep testing if you don't get
it<00:03:46.170> right<00:03:46.320> first<00:03:46.350> time<00:03:46.680> shoot<00:03:47.190> it<00:03:47.310> again<00:03:47.400> at<00:03:47.970> a

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
it right first time shoot it again at a

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.050 
it right first time shoot it again at a
different<00:03:48.450> speed<00:03:48.890> here's<00:03:49.890> man<00:03:50.310> what<00:03:50.790> happens

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
different speed here's man what happens

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.510 
different speed here's man what happens
to<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.180> man<00:03:51.380> he's<00:03:52.380> heavier<00:03:52.680> already<00:03:53.130> than<00:03:53.430> the

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
to a man he's heavier already than the

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.620 
to a man he's heavier already than the
elephant<00:03:53.850> and<00:03:55.010> don't<00:03:56.010> forget<00:03:56.250> to<00:03:56.510> bend<00:03:57.510> the

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
elephant and don't forget to bend the

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.660 
elephant and don't forget to bend the
knees<00:03:57.890> said<00:03:58.890> you<00:03:59.040> don't<00:03:59.190> go<00:03:59.310> through<00:03:59.520> the
