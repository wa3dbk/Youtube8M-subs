00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.419
 good afternoon today got another 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.419
 package from china 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:21.029
 that I donâ€™t know their weight is 10 grams 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:26.660
 they are 100 grams per 100 grams of what they see 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:30.890
 so here but it feels very flat 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.890
 Now we will see what's inside 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:47.399
 put a pause in one hand is not very 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:52.530
 comfortable well i believe i opened my nose this morning 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:58.920
 interesting thing is universal 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:01.260
 business card business card key size is very, very 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.979
 little well for understanding for 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.750
 stay in a matchbox and more 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.960
 that is, it is not the size of a business card 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.590
 this size is usually a matchbox 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.960
 so let's see what is there so 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.960
 you abruptly do so is she here 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.369
 ticker have bottle opener 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.880
 there is one more opened to the legs 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.060
 northern concern jars to open there 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.560
 the saw was pretty sharp i think that 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:39.770

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.770

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.200
 crumbs heart nuts sizes sweat 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.759
 in small but small I think so 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.680
 somewhere to understand 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.920
 big sama 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.150
 about a centimeter there is a key for 10 and 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.900
 the little one herself thinks the key is 8 that is 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.440
 or he will believe us 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.440
 take a look 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:17.730
 for our ticker now we will measure 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:24.959
 so yes I was right room 1 centimeter 1 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:36.510

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:48.050

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:51.150
 obtained for 5 here in our 4 well 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:55.110

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:59.640

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.709

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.050
