00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
baby that's that that's the whole thing

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.430 
baby that's that that's the whole thing
I<00:02:02.330> know<00:02:02.390> I'm<00:02:02.600> going<00:02:02.869> out<00:02:02.990> of<00:02:03.140> a<00:02:03.200> big

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
I know I'm going out of a big

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.140 
I know I'm going out of a big
speculation<00:02:04.100> but<00:02:04.340> just<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:04.940> whole<00:02:04.970> thing

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
speculation but just the whole thing

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.050 
speculation but just the whole thing
would<00:02:05.690> make<00:02:05.840> sense<00:02:06.200> because<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:07.130> hush<00:02:07.640> comes

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
would make sense because the hush comes

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.150 
would make sense because the hush comes
in<00:02:08.270> Arkham<00:02:08.899> City<00:02:08.929> what<00:02:09.470> better<00:02:09.649> yet<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:09.950> push

is a Batman Beyond game with the return
of<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.959> joker<00:02:39.170> storyline<00:02:39.830> it<00:02:40.100> would<00:02:40.250> make

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
of the joker storyline it would make

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.430 
of the joker storyline it would make
sense<00:02:40.459> for<00:02:40.910> Harley<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.600> do<00:02:41.780> this<00:02:42.019> to<00:02:42.260> Tim

because<00:02:42.650> maybe<00:02:43.130> she<00:02:43.280> feels<00:02:43.820> that<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.330> Joker

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
because maybe she feels that the Joker

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.930 
because maybe she feels that the Joker
must<00:02:45.140> live<00:02:45.380> on<00:02:45.560> somehow<00:02:46.190> so<00:02:46.580> when<00:02:46.730> you<00:02:46.820> guys
