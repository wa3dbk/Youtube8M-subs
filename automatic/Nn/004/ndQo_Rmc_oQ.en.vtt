you<00:00:29.160> can<00:00:29.340> get<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.490> bit<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> scale<00:00:30.060> comparison

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.220 

sure<00:00:34.370> he's<00:00:34.490> a<00:00:34.520> little<00:00:34.850> too<00:00:35.180> tall<00:00:35.540> for<00:00:35.570> legends

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
sure he's a little too tall for legends

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.120 
sure he's a little too tall for legends
but<00:00:37.330> honestly<00:00:38.330> I<00:00:38.840> kind<00:00:39.320> of<00:00:39.470> prefer<00:00:39.590> being<00:00:40.070> a

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
but honestly I kind of prefer being a

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.810 
but honestly I kind of prefer being a
little<00:00:40.310> too<00:00:40.430> tall<00:00:40.840> gives<00:00:41.840> your<00:00:42.790> collection<00:00:43.790> a

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
little too tall gives your collection a

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.940 
little too tall gives your collection a
little<00:00:44.000> bit<00:00:44.120> more<00:00:44.240> of<00:00:44.300> a<00:00:44.390> dynamic<00:00:44.810> range<00:00:45.080> and<00:00:45.740> I

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
little bit more of a dynamic range and I

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.800 
little bit more of a dynamic range and I
think<00:00:46.220> he<00:00:46.370> does<00:00:46.580> fit<00:00:46.820> in<00:00:46.910> fine<00:00:47.120> or<00:00:47.420> maybe<00:00:47.630> he's

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
think he does fit in fine or maybe he's

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.350 
think he does fit in fine or maybe he's
a<00:00:47.900> little<00:00:47.960> too<00:00:48.290> short<00:00:48.530> for<00:00:48.710> Marvel<00:00:49.010> Select<00:00:49.360> but

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
a little too short for Marvel Select but

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.840 
a little too short for Marvel Select but
again<00:00:50.570> that<00:00:50.990> depends<00:00:51.440> on<00:00:51.800> who<00:00:52.250> you<00:00:52.400> are<00:00:52.580> and

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
again that depends on who you are and

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.130 
again that depends on who you are and
what<00:00:53.060> you<00:00:53.210> imagine<00:00:53.510> these<00:00:53.570> characters<00:00:54.020> to

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
what you imagine these characters to

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.130 
what you imagine these characters to
look<00:00:54.320> like<00:00:54.580> so<00:00:55.900> not<00:00:56.900> too<00:00:57.050> bothered<00:00:57.200> by<00:00:57.380> at<00:00:58.030> now

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140

everyone that Marvel Select and Marple
items<00:01:28.780> could<00:01:29.050> work<00:01:29.350> together<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.890> took<00:01:33.040> a

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
items could work together so it took a

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.160 
items could work together so it took a
while<00:01:33.400> but<00:01:33.790> a<00:01:33.850> half<00:01:34.300> bro<00:01:34.540> finally<00:01:34.840> got<00:01:34.990> around

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
while but a half bro finally got around

to doing their ripoff of tomorrow select
Thor<00:01:37.660> who<00:01:38.440> might<00:01:38.680> be<00:01:38.830> slightly<00:01:39.190> better<00:01:39.460> than

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
Thor who might be slightly better than

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.260 
Thor who might be slightly better than
this<00:01:39.850> one<00:01:40.150> just<00:01:40.950> based<00:01:41.950> off<00:01:42.100> at<00:01:42.280> articulation

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
this one just based off at articulation

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.490 
this one just based off at articulation
alone<00:01:43.740> but<00:01:45.750> again<00:01:46.750> depends<00:01:47.290> on<00:01:47.410> your

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
alone but again depends on your

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.590 
alone but again depends on your
preference<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:48.640> Marvel<00:01:48.970> Legends<00:01:49.270> one<00:01:49.480> is<00:01:49.570> a

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
preference the Marvel Legends one is a

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.890 
preference the Marvel Legends one is a
little<00:01:49.810> bit<00:01:49.900> more<00:01:50.050> stylized<00:01:50.710> or<00:01:51.520> as<00:01:51.900> the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
little bit more stylized or as the

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.150 
little bit more stylized or as the
select<00:01:53.200> one<00:01:53.410> it's<00:01:53.620> a<00:01:53.710> little<00:01:53.920> bit<00:01:54.010> more

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
select one it's a little bit more

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.370 
select one it's a little bit more
realistic<00:01:55.050> same<00:01:56.050> thing<00:01:56.200> goes<00:01:56.229> with

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
realistic same thing goes with

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.620 
realistic same thing goes with
proportions<00:01:56.800> I'd<00:01:57.370> say<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:57.880> select<00:01:58.330> one<00:01:58.510> is<00:01:58.600> a

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
proportions I'd say the select one is a

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.480 
proportions I'd say the select one is a
little<00:01:58.780> bit<00:01:58.870> more<00:01:59.020> realistic<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.979> if<00:02:00.310> you

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
little bit more realistic and if you

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.700 
little bit more realistic and if you
have<00:02:00.640> an<00:02:00.760> older<00:02:01.060> toybiz<00:02:01.690> collection<00:02:02.229> such<00:02:02.530> as

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
which I believe actually has a wash

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.470 
which I believe actually has a wash
going<00:04:24.760> through<00:04:25.030> a<00:04:25.180> very<00:04:25.240> light<00:04:25.810> wash<00:04:26.110> or<00:04:27.480> yeah

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
going through a very light wash or yeah

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.480 
going through a very light wash or yeah
it<00:04:28.600> looks<00:04:28.750> like<00:04:28.810> this<00:04:28.990> really<00:04:29.590> light<00:04:29.919> wash<00:04:30.190> on

his<00:04:30.639> chain<00:04:30.970> mail<00:04:31.210> or<00:04:31.950> sculpting<00:04:32.950> is<00:04:33.040> so<00:04:33.250> good

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
his chain mail or sculpting is so good

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.190 
his chain mail or sculpting is so good

might go with this one also you really
wouldn't<00:07:26.259> do<00:07:26.409> wrong<00:07:26.620> getting<00:07:26.949> both<00:07:27.159> the

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:27.400 
wouldn't do wrong getting both the

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.269 
wouldn't do wrong getting both the
legend<00:07:27.669> might<00:07:28.120> be<00:07:28.330> smidge<00:07:29.050> taller<00:07:29.499> so<00:07:30.159> he's

00:07:30.269 --> 00:07:30.279 
legend might be smidge taller so he's

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:31.890 
legend might be smidge taller so he's
not<00:07:30.430> even<00:07:30.669> really<00:07:30.849> in<00:07:30.999> scale<00:07:31.330> with<00:07:31.360> legends

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:31.900 
not even really in scale with legends

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.739 
not even really in scale with legends
and<00:07:32.199> sure<00:07:33.099> i<00:07:33.430> said<00:07:33.639> earlier<00:07:34.089> in<00:07:34.330> the<00:07:34.419> view<00:07:34.719> that

00:07:34.739 --> 00:07:34.749 
and sure i said earlier in the view that

00:07:34.749 --> 00:07:36.510 
and sure i said earlier in the view that
Thor<00:07:35.229> might<00:07:35.469> be<00:07:35.620> a<00:07:35.650> little<00:07:35.770> too<00:07:35.979> tall<00:07:36.279> for

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:36.520 
Thor might be a little too tall for

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.179 
Thor might be a little too tall for
legends<00:07:36.999> the<00:07:37.629> legends<00:07:38.050> Thor's<00:07:38.379> even<00:07:38.710> a<00:07:38.889> little

00:07:39.179 --> 00:07:39.189 
legends the legends Thor's even a little

00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:41.549 
legends the legends Thor's even a little
too<00:07:39.339> tall<00:07:39.610> for<00:07:39.639> select<00:07:40.270> or<00:07:40.779> maybe<00:07:41.020> he<00:07:41.199> might<00:07:41.379> be

00:07:41.549 --> 00:07:41.559 
too tall for select or maybe he might be

00:07:41.559 --> 00:07:44.159 
too tall for select or maybe he might be
about<00:07:41.949> the<00:07:42.370> right<00:07:42.400> size<00:07:42.789> for<00:07:42.819> slick<00:07:43.270> so<00:07:43.509> just

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:44.169 
about the right size for slick so just

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:45.480 
about the right size for slick so just
seems<00:07:44.319> like<00:07:44.439> scales<00:07:44.770> kind<00:07:45.039> of<00:07:45.099> all<00:07:45.219> over<00:07:45.249> the

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:45.490 
seems like scales kind of all over the

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.269 
seems like scales kind of all over the
place<00:07:45.580> with<00:07:45.939> Thor<00:07:46.559> so<00:07:47.559> I<00:07:47.589> think<00:07:47.740> he<00:07:48.099> should

00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:48.279 
place with Thor so I think he should

00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:50.549 
place with Thor so I think he should
just<00:07:48.399> go<00:07:49.300> out<00:07:49.419> there<00:07:49.599> and<00:07:49.749> look<00:07:49.870> at<00:07:50.020> some<00:07:50.199> more

00:07:50.549 --> 00:07:50.559 
just go out there and look at some more

00:07:50.559 --> 00:07:52.260 
just go out there and look at some more
comparisons<00:07:51.339> and<00:07:51.759> make<00:07:51.939> your<00:07:52.089> better

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:52.270 
comparisons and make your better

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.619 
comparisons and make your better
judgment<00:07:52.719> but<00:07:53.129> so<00:07:54.129> far<00:07:54.399> I<00:07:54.729> was<00:07:55.389> really

00:07:55.619 --> 00:07:55.629 
judgment but so far I was really

00:07:55.629 --> 00:07:58.799 
judgment but so far I was really
surprised<00:07:56.080> and<00:07:57.210> satisfied<00:07:58.210> with<00:07:58.360> this<00:07:58.449> figure

00:07:58.799 --> 00:07:58.809 
surprised and satisfied with this figure

00:07:58.809 --> 00:08:02.879 
surprised and satisfied with this figure
so<00:07:59.080> I<00:07:59.999> recommend<00:08:01.439> thank<00:08:02.439> you<00:08:02.559> for<00:08:02.710> watching
