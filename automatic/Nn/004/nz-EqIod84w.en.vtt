00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.070 
mistaken though that means a deeper skip
and<00:02:28.410> where<00:02:28.950> we<00:02:29.070> go<00:02:29.190> again<00:02:29.459> if<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.510> find<00:02:30.780> that

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
and where we go again if you find that

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.560 
and where we go again if you find that
this<00:02:31.200> recipe<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.680> little<00:02:31.890> bit<00:02:32.010> small<00:02:32.540> what<00:02:33.540> I

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
this recipe is a little bit small what I

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.840 
this recipe is a little bit small what I
tend<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.959> do<00:02:34.110> sometimes<00:02:34.350> when<00:02:34.950> you're<00:02:35.610> putting

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
tend to do sometimes when you're putting

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.050 
tend to do sometimes when you're putting
the<00:02:36.030> coffee<00:02:36.239> in<00:02:36.709> this<00:02:37.709> spreads<00:02:37.980> dough<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:38.940> can

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
the coffee in this spreads dough you can

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.000 
the coffee in this spreads dough you can
run<00:02:39.239> them<00:02:39.329> through<00:02:39.450> twice<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:40.140> do<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:40.829> quite

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
run them through twice I do that quite

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.690 
run them through twice I do that quite
often<00:02:41.660> because<00:02:42.660> they<00:02:42.840> are<00:02:42.989> quite<00:02:43.260> small<00:02:43.700> what

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
often because they are quite small what

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.590 
often because they are quite small what
I<00:02:44.760> do<00:02:44.850> is<00:02:45.299> I'll<00:02:46.110> put<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.440> coffee<00:02:46.709> disc<00:02:47.010> in<00:02:47.600> let

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
I do is I'll put the coffee disc in let

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.350 
I do is I'll put the coffee disc in let
it<00:02:48.630> recycle<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.560> finish<00:02:50.000> take<00:02:51.000> open<00:02:51.269> the

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
it recycle and finish take open the

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.630 
it recycle and finish take open the
basket<00:02:51.750> but<00:02:51.930> not<00:02:52.019> all<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.380> way<00:02:52.459> to<00:02:53.459> pick<00:02:53.610> it

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
basket but not all the way to pick it

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.830 
basket but not all the way to pick it
open<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:53.970> little<00:02:54.000> bit<00:02:54.239> then<00:02:54.480> click<00:02:54.630> it<00:02:54.720> back

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
open a little bit then click it back

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.060 
open a little bit then click it back
down<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.290> will<00:02:55.380> read<00:02:55.590> set<00:02:55.829> and<00:02:55.950> it'll

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
down and it will read set and it'll

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.710 
down and it will read set and it'll
think<00:02:56.250> it's<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.459> new<00:02:56.579> T<00:02:56.760> disc<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.150> then<00:02:57.450> run<00:02:57.630> it

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
think it's a new T disc and then run it

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.800 
think it's a new T disc and then run it
through<00:02:57.750> again<00:02:59.120> that<00:03:00.120> just<00:03:00.239> gives<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.630> like

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
through again that just gives you like

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.380 
through again that just gives you like
an<00:03:00.900> equal<00:03:01.739> amount<00:03:02.280> of<00:03:02.400> water<00:03:02.579> for<00:03:02.940> two<00:03:03.120> shots

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
an equal amount of water for two shots

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.090 
an equal amount of water for two shots
of<00:03:03.510> coffee<00:03:03.690> but<00:03:04.019> your<00:03:04.200> knees<00:03:04.380> in<00:03:04.530> want<00:03:04.680> T<00:03:04.860> discs

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
of coffee but your knees in want T discs

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.940 
of coffee but your knees in want T discs
and<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.549> don't<00:03:05.610> find<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.060> makes<00:03:06.209> it<00:03:06.329> that<00:03:06.450> week

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
and I don't find it makes it that week

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.620 
and I don't find it makes it that week
three<00:03:07.950> times<00:03:08.220> maybe<00:03:08.459> you<00:03:09.060> probably<00:03:09.390> find<00:03:09.510> it

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
three times maybe you probably find it

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.080 
three times maybe you probably find it
was<00:03:09.750> too<00:03:09.900> weak<00:03:10.049> at<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:10.320> point<00:03:10.560> but<00:03:10.829> um<00:03:11.090> anyway

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
was too weak at that point but um anyway

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.050 
was too weak at that point but um anyway
and<00:03:12.600> there<00:03:12.750> we<00:03:12.840> go<00:03:12.989> we<00:03:13.260> now<00:03:13.440> have<00:03:13.879> just<00:03:14.879> get

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
and there we go we now have just get

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.149 
and there we go we now have just get
ourselves

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.670 

there<00:03:22.159> we<00:03:22.250> go

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
there we go

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.709 
there we go
so<00:03:24.680> that's<00:03:24.980> your<00:03:25.129> average<00:03:25.250> sized<00:03:25.609> cup<00:03:25.939> got

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:26.719 
so that's your average sized cup got

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:31.959 
so that's your average sized cup got
there<00:03:27.280> like<00:03:29.109> average<00:03:30.109> size<00:03:30.609> and<00:03:31.609> he's<00:03:31.700> made<00:03:31.849> it

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:31.969 
there like average size and he's made it

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:37.360 
there like average size and he's made it
pretty<00:03:32.090> full<00:03:32.769> and<00:03:33.769> total<00:03:34.430> cost<00:03:34.909> I'd<00:03:35.450> say<00:03:36.370> he'd

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
pretty full and total cost I'd say he'd

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.530 
pretty full and total cost I'd say he'd
break<00:03:37.609> it<00:03:37.760> down<00:03:37.849> you'd<00:03:38.060> probably<00:03:38.209> be<00:03:38.510> looking

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
break it down you'd probably be looking

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
break it down you'd probably be looking
at<00:03:38.870> about<00:03:38.959> 80<00:03:39.290> pence<00:03:40.870> 1882<00:03:41.870> a<00:03:42.049> pound

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
at about 80 pence 1882 a pound

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.860 
at about 80 pence 1882 a pound
it<00:03:43.040> depends<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:43.489> a<00:03:43.549> pound<00:03:43.790> when<00:03:44.510> I<00:03:44.540> talk<00:03:44.689> of<00:03:44.780> a

it depends to a pound when I talk of a

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.869 
it depends to a pound when I talk of a
mocker<00:03:45.049> furnace<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:45.769> a<00:03:45.829> pound<00:03:46.010> I'd<00:03:46.219> say<00:03:46.430> after

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
mocker furnace and a pound I'd say after

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:47.890 
mocker furnace and a pound I'd say after
