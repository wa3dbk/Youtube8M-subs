thick<00:00:40.510> mounts<00:00:40.840> we<00:00:40.960> slightly<00:00:41.260> modify<00:00:41.800> the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
thick mounts we slightly modify the

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.490 
thick mounts we slightly modify the
alternator<00:00:42.489> bit<00:00:42.760> and<00:00:43.000> then<00:00:43.660> we<00:00:43.780> supply<00:00:44.140> a<00:00:44.170> long

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
alternator bit and then we supply a long

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.560 
alternator bit and then we supply a long
bolt<00:00:44.860> with<00:00:45.130> it<00:00:45.310> so<00:00:45.850> that<00:00:46.030> the<00:00:46.149> thick<00:00:46.360> mount

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
bolt with it so that the thick mount

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.569 
bolt with it so that the thick mount
goes<00:00:46.750> in<00:00:46.960> like<00:00:47.110> normal<00:00:47.320> on<00:00:47.590> this<00:00:47.770> side<00:00:48.040> like

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
goes in like normal on this side like

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.729 
goes in like normal on this side like
this<00:00:48.760> one<00:00:48.970> does<00:00:49.210> but<00:00:49.840> then<00:00:50.020> this<00:00:50.350> side<00:00:50.559> where

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
this one does but then this side where

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.500 
this one does but then this side where
you<00:00:50.829> have<00:00:50.860> a<00:00:50.980> thinner<00:00:51.309> threaded<00:00:51.760> mount<00:00:51.940> it's

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
you have a thinner threaded mount it's

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.819 
you have a thinner threaded mount it's
gonna<00:00:52.660> be<00:00:52.809> a<00:00:52.840> thick<00:00:53.079> mount<00:00:53.290> over<00:00:53.410> here<00:00:53.710> where

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
gonna be a thick mount over here where

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.319 
gonna be a thick mount over here where
you<00:00:53.890> put<00:00:54.070> the<00:00:54.160> bolt<00:00:54.399> through<00:00:54.640> the<00:00:54.880> only

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
you put the bolt through the only

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.590 
you put the bolt through the only
difference<00:00:55.660> is<00:00:55.840> on<00:00:56.140> the<00:00:56.950> CS<00:00:57.489> 130<00:00:57.910> requires<00:00:58.450> a

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
difference is on the CS 130 requires a

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.630 
difference is on the CS 130 requires a
threaded<00:00:59.200> bolt<00:00:59.440> in<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.710> back<00:00:59.890> of<00:01:00.100> us<00:01:00.219> right<00:01:00.520> at

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
threaded bolt in the back of us right at

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.840 
threaded bolt in the back of us right at
all<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:01.420> 144<00:01:02.260> cannot<00:01:02.649> use<00:01:03.040> that<00:01:03.340> mount<00:01:03.610> but

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
all the 144 cannot use that mount but

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.719 
all the 144 cannot use that mount but
the<00:01:03.969> 144<00:01:04.689> is<00:01:04.869> a<00:01:04.989> much<00:01:05.350> more<00:01:05.680> stable<00:01:06.159> out<00:01:06.490> there

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
the 144 is a much more stable out there

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.520 
the 144 is a much more stable out there
all<00:01:07.329> the<00:01:07.479> way<00:01:07.630> this<00:01:07.780> hole<00:01:07.990> together<00:01:08.200> with

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
all the way this hole together with

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.109 
all the way this hole together with
three<00:01:08.770> through<00:01:09.039> bolts<00:01:09.429> they<00:01:09.609> have<00:01:09.759> a<00:01:09.789> tendency

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
three through bolts they have a tendency

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.649 
three through bolts they have a tendency
to<00:01:10.299> fall<00:01:10.630> apart<00:01:10.959> the<00:01:11.590> 144<00:01:12.280> it<00:01:13.030> snaps<00:01:13.420> together

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
to fall apart the 144 it snaps together

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.359 
to fall apart the 144 it snaps together
in<00:01:13.959> the<00:01:14.020> front<00:01:14.200> housing<00:01:14.469> the<00:01:14.770> center<00:01:15.069> stator

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
in the front housing the center stator

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.219 
in the front housing the center stator
and<00:01:15.549> the<00:01:15.639> rear<00:01:15.819> housing<00:01:15.969> they<00:01:16.810> all<00:01:16.990> snap

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
and the rear housing they all snap

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.289 
and the rear housing they all snap
together<00:01:17.709> much<00:01:17.920> better<00:01:17.950> and<00:01:18.369> it<00:01:18.459> has<00:01:18.609> four

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
together much better and it has four

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.389 
together much better and it has four
through<00:01:19.659> bolts<00:01:19.990> on<00:01:20.139> it<00:01:20.319> which<00:01:20.770> is<00:01:20.950> much<00:01:21.219> better

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
through bolts on it which is much better

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:24.929 
through bolts on it which is much better
deal<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:22.590> bracket<00:01:23.590> for<00:01:23.889> the<00:01:23.979> 130<00:01:24.399> goes<00:01:24.670> right

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
deal the bracket for the 130 goes right

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:26.519 
deal the bracket for the 130 goes right
about<00:01:25.179> here<00:01:25.539> where<00:01:25.689> the<00:01:25.810> bowl<00:01:26.020> would<00:01:26.229> go<00:01:26.380> in

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:26.529 
about here where the bowl would go in

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:28.739 
about here where the bowl would go in
there<00:01:26.740> is<00:01:26.859> no<00:01:27.039> bolt<00:01:27.399> hole<00:01:27.639> for<00:01:28.029> it<00:01:28.240> so<00:01:28.659> the

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:28.749 
there is no bolt hole for it so the

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:30.090 
there is no bolt hole for it so the
altar<00:01:29.049> would<00:01:29.229> drop<00:01:29.439> right<00:01:29.649> in<00:01:29.799> without

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
altar would drop right in without

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.879 
altar would drop right in without
changing<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.729> bracket<00:01:31.149> all<00:01:31.299> but<00:01:32.200> you<00:01:32.380> just

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:32.889 
changing the bracket all but you just

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:35.789 
changing the bracket all but you just
end<00:01:33.099> up<00:01:33.219> with<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:33.490> two<00:01:34.079> two<00:01:35.079> front<00:01:35.380> bolts<00:01:35.679> the

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
end up with the two two front bolts the

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.289 
end up with the two two front bolts the
thick<00:01:36.039> bolt<00:01:36.279> on<00:01:36.459> this<00:01:36.639> side<00:01:36.880> and<00:01:37.090> where<00:01:37.209> you

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
thick bolt on this side and where you

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.300 
thick bolt on this side and where you
would<00:01:37.389> normally<00:01:37.810> have<00:01:37.929> a<00:01:37.990> thin<00:01:38.829> mount<00:01:39.099> over

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
would normally have a thin mount over

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.160 
would normally have a thin mount over
here<00:01:39.490> you<00:01:39.579> end<00:01:39.759> up<00:01:39.849> with<00:01:39.969> two<00:01:40.209> double<00:01:40.959> thick

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
here you end up with two double thick

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
eliminated rear bracket and as I said

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.749 
eliminated rear bracket and as I said
this<00:01:58.029> is<00:01:58.090> going<00:01:58.299> on<00:01:58.389> a<00:01:58.419> 95<00:01:58.990> Chevy<00:01:59.349> Suburban<00:01:59.950> the

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
this is going on a 95 Chevy Suburban the

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.510 
this is going on a 95 Chevy Suburban the

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.639 
GEMA has snow plow this is a 200 mm dual

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
rectifier so not only does he run his

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.130 
rectifier so not only does he run his
snow<00:02:05.950> plow<00:02:06.159> but<00:02:06.399> he<00:02:06.459> also<00:02:06.609> pulls<00:02:07.569> a<00:02:07.719> trailer

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.580 
with charging batteries and things like
that<00:02:09.810> that's<00:02:10.810> gonna<00:02:10.989> kill<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.319> bridge

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
that that's gonna kill a bridge

that that's gonna kill a bridge
rectifier<00:02:11.800> that's<00:02:12.520> why<00:02:12.730> this<00:02:12.790> runs<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.480> bridge

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
rectifier that's why this runs to bridge

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.930
