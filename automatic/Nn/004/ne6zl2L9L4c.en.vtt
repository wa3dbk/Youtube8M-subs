00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.340
 hello hello to you 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.000
 oxalate transfer evening for the world of 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.939
 tanks 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.450
 and in this case we have on the monitor t29 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:23.640
 I already passed so it turns out that the tank 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.439
 this one just got in my way not because 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.329
 that shake something but because i just 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.599
 wanted this tank in the hangar wanted 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:33.899
 make it elite because be or 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.790
 then it is elite well that's what you are like 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.649
 understood the cause of cast tanks there all that 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.770
 than freedom then captain titan is comfortable 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.200
 potato maza forget it today 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.540
 the story about the tank and breakdown on it 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.240
 accordingly you hit the map 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.240
 polar region as you may have noticed though i 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.680
 I confuse it with shit constantly because 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.380
 new sunk me very much not 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.870
 like but for this tank card in 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.310
 just right because he can become on 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.500
 such a headache for 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.409
 opponents from the fact that he had like you 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.450
 see here it is a huge cast iron but 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.720
 not iron probably it is still steel 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.090
 in any case, it is made of some kind 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.390
 creepy from a minimum or something out there her 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.150
 Nothing punches a tower in the forehead 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.100
 that's great noggin head whatever 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.680
 tadpole cheburashka nickname this 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.540
 tank's pretty funny but when its 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.270
 the tower is shown due to a hillock of enemies 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.400
 cry tank body is very weak with him 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.350
 only 102 millimeters by my 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.840
 frontal armor i'm not exactly sure because 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.790
 that the sky still makes its way at all 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.100
 all whom he sees is possible only 5 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.320
 level some 5 levels and do not break 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.180
 She of course there at an angle all that 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.400
 very rare and even kvass and does not break through 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.710
 if you get right here is absolutely creepy 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.280
 but there is still a machine gun in any 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.590
 case 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.299
 frontal part and the lower and upper they 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.780
 all very weak tank them as 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.299
 rule can not but the tower to 270 9 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.340
 millimeters in the forehead considering the mask mask 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.159
 this is the screen so she hawala also 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.229
 cumulative is great because gold 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.350
 for you will be thrashed often in this tower in 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.030
 really it happened so well you 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.799
 vertical pickup helps you play 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.580
 from the tower and there in my opinion I don't know 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.340
 how much exactly 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.890
 either -10 or -12 i'm not learning these 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.109
 boring tsiferki test car always on 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.060
 In this case, I was lucky to us 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:22.170
 managed to get to the bottom of the gorge 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.910
 for tyazhy 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.470
 no one gave us anything at all 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.390
 damage while we roll though this 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.099
 quite dangerous well because tanks 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.290
 far not the slowest come out as 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.140
 The usual heavy and in time has time everywhere 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.760
 which can manage to catch on a regular strand 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.319
 well, probably because he just doesn't 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.590
 overloaded armor here we kill them 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.360
 point and stumble on and site game by 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.400
 now we will see another feature 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.590
 this gun cannon us by the way very much 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.410
 not bad at her second break at level 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.560
 among all tyazhey probably and maybe even 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.120
 no 2 may be now second dan 3 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.090
 because I still forgot 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.400
 take into account the frenchman in any way pierce and 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.140
 198 you do enough for all purposes 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.410
 sometimes even nines make their way with 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.269
 breaking through 198 without gold and very often 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.890
 this can be done with almost everyone 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.260
 nines only when you see something 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.180
 very severe type of st1 then charge 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.530
 she also punches gold 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.959
 in the meantime, we have sparring with 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.420
 classmates and as you can see groups 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.910
 aiming gun at close range 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.739
 the turret is not always selling melteshit but 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.720
 you can do it on a gun put 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.180
 quite a stabilizer that improves and 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.549
 stabilization no doubt by the way tiger p 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.109
 hit us in the turret is the vulnerable part 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.900
 so you need to turn the tower here 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.370
 a little forgot about this here ap so about 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.290
 cannon and can say that when you will 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.570
 shoot him for long distances you 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.459
 will we be tyrians so your neighbors 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.700
 will knock on the door to call the police 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:48.180
 or the police or what have you folk 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.070
 the militia don't know anyway on 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.320
 long range gun does not get it 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.730
 American and oblique course 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.500
 stabilized not bad start up on 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.880
 its ultimate accuracy is very bad 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.560
 so even if you are fully connected 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.320
 projectile can send anywhere 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.910
 often to the extent that you are in someone 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.739
 shoot here and masterfully returned 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.780
 tig diag you contribute and shoot 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.609
 when he stands still you are completely 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.400
 reduced and three or four shells 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:14.190
 fly horseradish understand where the damage gun too 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.510
 a decent 320 about the same gun 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.419
 standing on t32 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.919
 but rather there just a little change 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:23.310
 other parameters but by and large 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:25.560
 there is no difference therefore the tank is enough 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.210
 serious and he certainly has not the most armor 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.160
 simple when you try to tank on 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.289
 him like ordinary bowls you remember mine 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.599
 words because he doesn't break through 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.610
 okay, well nld, yes you can heal 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:38.479
 just so with that information but I with that 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:41.969
 could not succeed 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:45.180
 trade because the tracks are wide not 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:47.789
 always punch i say so 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.580
 optimistic because itâ€™s still better 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:52.560
 do not do but sometimes keeps track damage 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.629
 exactly if you are caterpillars you stand to 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.129
 board was not visible at all well, you probably 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:58.379
 already understood that the caterpillar such here 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:00.810
 wide abortion is something between them 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:02.430
 sometimes it is useful to know whether you know the geometry 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.560
 tank to know what to substitute 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.000
 here I know that there is no goal of Ferdinand and 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.400
 need ferdinand overweight scoring 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.620
 score because it's easier for me 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.139
 punch of course I caught the damage here tiger 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.610
 who punches me straight vld but 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.259
 In this case, just a little dance 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.199
 spread out on the shot the more our 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:21.870
 ally is already selected from below here all 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.669
 very simple tactic due to the angles we 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.330
 flank sneak up on distracting ourselves 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:30.659
 opponents they somehow get confused 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:34.800
 under the fire of our forces and everything but for now 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:36.810
 4000 tapped us and it would seem not 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.779
 then straight to quite a lot to have seven 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.539
 god i think the master is on this tank 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:44.539
 it will be very difficult to take but no how are you 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:47.250
 ok quite a bit gone 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:50.639
 although it seems like tank papal him there 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:54.240
 promised wargaming and terrible terrible 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:56.370
 second add to q ever can 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.770
 it will happen i don't know i don't have such 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.810
 information but I will survive if not add 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.509
 second code or something like that 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.680
 I think tank is quite a level 7 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:06.990
 the level is generally one of my most 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.939
 favorite and most balanced and therefore 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.779
 ride American tanks further 

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:14.669
 I will not go so sorry for the guns there shit 

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:16.319
 now minas choir need to score well and 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:18.659
 The battle ends on this course 

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:20.639
 At the end you will see the outcome of the battle but for now 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:23.759
 can have time to subscribe to my channel 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:26.339
 put like well and here i am with you 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:29.900
 saying goodbye to you was acc with all the luck 

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:29.900
 goodbye
