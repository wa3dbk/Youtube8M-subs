video of it to see you know what it
looked<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.829> everything<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.910> couldn't

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
looked like in everything and I couldn't

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.779 
looked like in everything and I couldn't
find<00:00:45.390> one<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:45.960> was<00:00:46.140> hoping<00:00:46.530> maybe<00:00:46.789> this

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
find one so I was hoping maybe this

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.110 
find one so I was hoping maybe this
video<00:00:48.030> could<00:00:48.570> show<00:00:49.340> anyone<00:00:50.340> who<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.730> going<00:00:51.030> to

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
video could show anyone who is going to

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.729 
video could show anyone who is going to
buy<00:00:51.270> one<00:00:51.539> exactly<00:00:51.960> what<00:00:52.379> you're<00:00:52.530> getting

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
buy one exactly what you're getting

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.330 
buy one exactly what you're getting
aside<00:00:53.309> from<00:00:53.520> just<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.850> know<00:00:53.969> written<00:00:54.180> reviews

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
aside from just you know written reviews

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.540 
aside from just you know written reviews
so<00:00:56.340> basically<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.780> slot<00:00:58.289> machine<00:00:58.550> Bank

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
so basically this is a slot machine Bank

I bought this

kind of stuff

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.980 
kind of stuff
and<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:37.110> thought<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.500> would<00:01:37.650> be<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:38.600> fun<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:39.840> him

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
and I thought it would be a fun for him

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.429 
and I thought it would be a fun for him
not<00:01:40.890> only<00:01:41.250> because<00:01:42.180> my<00:01:42.210> parents<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.409> know

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
not only because my parents you know

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.770 
not only because my parents you know
everyone<00:01:44.100> has<00:01:44.310> kind<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.790> like<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.060> coin<00:01:45.450> jar

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
everyone has kind of like a coin jar

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.280 
everyone has kind of like a coin jar
that<00:01:46.140> they<00:01:46.259> put<00:01:46.530> their<00:01:47.369> coins<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:48.259> so<00:01:49.259> I

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
that they put their coins in so I

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.810 
that they put their coins in so I
thought<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.619> would<00:01:49.770> be<00:01:49.799> fun<00:01:49.890> for<00:01:50.310> him<00:01:50.520> I

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
thought this would be fun for him I

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.380 
thought this would be fun for him I
didn't<00:01:51.540> want<00:01:51.570> something<00:01:52.049> super<00:01:52.640> big<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.939> huge

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
didn't want something super big and huge

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.080 
didn't want something super big and huge
just<00:01:54.869> because<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:56.579> know<00:01:56.700> they<00:01:56.790> live<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.030> a

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
just because and you know they live in a

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.090 
just because and you know they live in a
smaller<00:01:57.420> house<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.439> there's<00:01:58.649> really<00:01:58.799> not<00:01:59.040> room

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
smaller house so there's really not room

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.370 
smaller house so there's really not room
for<00:01:59.369> like<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.119> know<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.240> full<00:02:00.630> size<00:02:00.930> slot

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
for like you know a full size slot

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.499 
for like you know a full size slot
machine<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.520> thought<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.180> one<00:02:03.360> was

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
machine so I thought this one was

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.899 
machine so I thought this one was
perfect<00:02:04.020> because<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:04.590> just<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.189> bigger

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
perfect because it's just it's bigger

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.460 
perfect because it's just it's bigger
than<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.990> know<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.140> typical<00:02:07.799> kind<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.459> small

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
than you know a typical kind of small

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.070 
than you know a typical kind of small
replica

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
replica

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.280 
replica
but<00:02:11.380> it's<00:02:11.620> still<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:13.180> know<00:02:13.210> not<00:02:13.600> overly<00:02:14.110> huge

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
but it's still you know not overly huge

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.080 
but it's still you know not overly huge
so<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.680> can<00:02:14.830> sit<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.070> on<00:02:15.100> a<00:02:15.220> table<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:15.880> then

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
so you can sit it on a table and then

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.820 
so you can sit it on a table and then
put<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:16.450> away<00:02:16.540> when<00:02:16.870> you're<00:02:17.020> done<00:02:17.200> with<00:02:17.410> it<00:02:17.590> um

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830

put it away when you're done with it um
but<00:02:18.760> anyway<00:02:19.030> I<00:02:19.060> thought<00:02:19.420> this<00:02:19.540> would<00:02:19.720> be<00:02:19.750> cute

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
but anyway I thought this would be cute

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.950 
but anyway I thought this would be cute
for<00:02:20.110> him<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.970> put<00:02:21.970> his<00:02:22.090> money<00:02:22.360> in<00:02:22.570> and

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
for him to put his money in and

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.080 
for him to put his money in and
especially<00:02:23.230> during<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.190> summer<00:02:24.490> when<00:02:24.790> we<00:02:24.850> go

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
especially during the summer when we go

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.330 
especially during the summer when we go
to<00:02:25.150> yard<00:02:25.600> sales<00:02:25.990> he's<00:02:26.410> always<00:02:26.590> getting<00:02:26.920> change

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
to yard sales he's always getting change

to yard sales he's always getting change
out<00:02:27.640> for<00:02:28.630> yard<00:02:28.810> sales<00:02:29.080> so<00:02:29.320> I<00:02:29.350> thought<00:02:29.590> this

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
out for yard sales so I thought this
