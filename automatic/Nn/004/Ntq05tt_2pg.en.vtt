the game of the show who's really

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.210 
the game of the show who's really
impressed<00:00:28.260> with<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.500> I'd<00:00:28.619> gotten<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.010> copy

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
impressed with it I'd gotten a copy

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.099 
impressed with it I'd gotten a copy
myself<00:00:29.460> but<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.150> hadn't<00:00:30.810> thought<00:00:30.900> much<00:00:30.990> about

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
myself but I hadn't thought much about

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.900 
myself but I hadn't thought much about
it<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.650> thought<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.279> was<00:00:32.369> neat<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.610> was<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
it I thought it was neat that was in the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.060 
it I thought it was neat that was in the
tin<00:00:33.090> box<00:00:33.239> with<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.570> really<00:00:33.870> neat<00:00:34.079> lid<00:00:34.800> that

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
tin box with a really neat lid that

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.430 
tin box with a really neat lid that
closes<00:00:35.640> rather<00:00:35.880> than<00:00:36.090> some<00:00:36.300> tin<00:00:36.510> boxes<00:00:36.899> but<00:00:37.170> I

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
closes rather than some tin boxes but I

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.340 
closes rather than some tin boxes but I
notice<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.280> game<00:00:38.430> comes<00:00:38.730> with<00:00:39.050> dry<00:00:40.050> erase

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
notice the game comes with dry erase

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.520 
notice the game comes with dry erase
markers<00:00:40.800> which<00:00:41.610> seems<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.239> be<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.719> all<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
markers which seems to be the all the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.830 
markers which seems to be the all the
rage<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.070> games<00:00:44.250> these<00:00:44.430> days<00:00:44.489> some<00:00:45.329> dice<00:00:45.570> with

symbols on them and some boards and
that's<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:48.230> this<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.559> game<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.129> Faire

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
that's it this is the game of the Faire

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.330 
that's it this is the game of the Faire
let's<00:00:51.719> look<00:00:51.930> at<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.199> each<00:00:52.500> player<00:00:52.890> gets<00:00:52.920> their

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
let's look at it each player gets their

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.830 
let's look at it each player gets their
own<00:00:53.370> player<00:00:53.699> board<00:00:54.000> which<00:00:54.210> shows<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> grid<00:00:54.719> of

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
own player board which shows a grid of

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.840 
own player board which shows a grid of
squares<00:00:54.989> here<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:56.129> has<00:00:56.250> one<00:00:56.550> simple

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
squares here and it has one simple

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.000 
squares here and it has one simple
filled<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.809> everyone<00:00:58.230> starts<00:00:58.590> with<00:00:58.770> a

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
filled in so that everyone starts with a

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.860 
filled in so that everyone starts with a
little<00:00:59.489> bit<00:00:59.730> different<00:00:59.760> of<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.329> playing<00:01:00.570> field

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
little bit different of a playing field

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.720 
little bit different of a playing field
for<00:01:01.649> dice<00:01:01.920> then<00:01:02.219> show<00:01:02.430> three<00:01:02.699> different

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
for dice then show three different

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.329 
for dice then show three different
symbols<00:01:03.270> X's<00:01:03.690> circles<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.500> triangles<00:01:04.920> each

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
symbols X's circles and triangles each

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.940 
symbols X's circles and triangles each
player<00:01:06.060> takes<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.390> turn<00:01:06.420> they<00:01:07.170> roll<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.740> four

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
player takes a turn they roll the four

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.310 
player takes a turn they roll the four
dice<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.430> then<00:01:08.970> they<00:01:09.210> place<00:01:09.510> these<00:01:09.750> dice<00:01:10.049> in

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
dice and then they place these dice in

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.719 
dice and then they place these dice in
any<00:01:10.500> kind<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.890> formation<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.430> they<00:01:11.549> want

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
any kind of formation that they want

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.890 
any kind of formation that they want
basically<00:01:14.729> they're<00:01:15.119> building<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.509> Tetris

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
basically they're building a Tetris

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.539 
basically they're building a Tetris
shape<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.799> they<00:01:16.920> could<00:01:17.070> put<00:01:17.250> them<00:01:17.369> like<00:01:17.400> this

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
shape so they could put them like this

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.999 
shape so they could put them like this
and<00:01:18.890> ask<00:01:19.890> where<00:01:20.100> they<00:01:20.610> could<00:01:20.790> do<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.689> L

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
and ask where they could do the the L

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.399 
and ask where they could do the the L
the<00:01:23.009> T<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:24.360> funky-ass<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:25.080> doesn't<00:01:25.290> really

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
the T the funky-ass it doesn't really

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.880 
the T the funky-ass it doesn't really
matter<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.950> then<00:01:26.400> each<00:01:26.549> player<00:01:26.759> can<00:01:27.150> put<00:01:27.360> that

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
matter and then each player can put that

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.620 
matter and then each player can put that
that's<00:01:28.890> simple<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.729> shape<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.299> any

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
that's simple of that shape in any

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.440 
that's simple of that shape in any
formation<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:32.340> they<00:01:32.549> want<00:01:32.909> somewhere

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
formation that they want somewhere

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.469 
formation that they want somewhere
within<00:01:34.290> their<00:01:34.829> squares<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.850> let's<00:01:36.060> say<00:01:36.210> here

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
within their squares so let's say here

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.030 
within their squares so let's say here
blue<00:01:36.750> decide<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.290> do<00:01:37.409> this<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:39.650> the<00:01:40.650> circle

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
blue decide to do this and the circle

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.830 
blue decide to do this and the circle
decides<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.119> do<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:44.090> now<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.119> don't<00:01:45.479> have<00:01:45.659> to

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
decides to do this now you don't have to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.230 
decides to do this now you don't have to
put<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> whole<00:01:46.320> thing<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.890> your<00:01:47.090> formation<00:01:48.090> as

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
put the whole thing in your formation as

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.760 
put the whole thing in your formation as
long<00:01:48.390> as<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.570> put<00:01:48.720> one<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.110> dice<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.560> so

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
long as you put one of the dice in so

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.319 
long as you put one of the dice in so
for<00:01:49.920> example<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.520> could<00:01:50.850> have<00:01:51.000> just<00:01:51.180> put<00:01:51.299> a

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
for example I could have just put a

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.819 
for example I could have just put a
triangle<00:01:51.810> here<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.229> edge<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.619> but<00:01:52.710> you

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
triangle here the edge of it but you

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.560 
triangle here the edge of it but you
have<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.009> put<00:01:53.130> at<00:01:53.220> least<00:01:53.280> one<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.000> them<00:01:54.119> on<00:01:54.329> and

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
have to put at least one of them on and

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.109 
have to put at least one of them on and
we<00:01:54.960> keep<00:01:55.140> going<00:01:55.380> until<00:01:55.530> everyone<00:01:56.399> has<00:01:56.790> their

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
we keep going until everyone has their

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.700 
we keep going until everyone has their
board<00:01:57.329> filled<00:01:57.509> up<00:01:57.689> where<00:01:57.869> they<00:01:57.960> or<00:01:58.200> they<00:01:58.469> can't

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
board filled up where they or they can't

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.440 
board filled up where they or they can't
one<00:01:58.920> person<00:01:59.280> can't<00:01:59.490> put<00:01:59.700> any<00:01:59.850> more<00:01:59.880> shapes<00:02:00.270> on

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
one person can't put any more shapes on

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:09.990 
one person can't put any more shapes on
their<00:02:00.689> board

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.300 

now<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.060> saw<00:02:11.360> as<00:02:11.600> I<00:02:11.780> wrote<00:02:12.470> down<00:02:12.860> all<00:02:12.920> those

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
now you saw as I wrote down all those

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.070 
now you saw as I wrote down all those
symbols<00:02:13.850> and<00:02:14.090> then<00:02:14.180> what<00:02:14.630> I<00:02:14.660> get<00:02:14.840> at<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:14.959> end

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
symbols and then what I get at the end

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.990 
symbols and then what I get at the end
now<00:02:15.740> let's<00:02:15.950> look<00:02:16.069> a<00:02:16.130> little<00:02:16.250> bit<00:02:16.550> closer<00:02:16.760> at

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
now let's look a little bit closer at

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.040 
now let's look a little bit closer at
this<00:02:17.180> one<00:02:17.330> board<00:02:17.690> here<00:02:17.959> is<00:02:18.080> I<00:02:18.800> divided<00:02:19.280> each

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
this one board here is I divided each

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.980 
this one board here is I divided each
place<00:02:21.050> into<00:02:22.360> sections<00:02:23.360> that<00:02:23.480> contain<00:02:23.660> the

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
place into sections that contain the

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.990 
place into sections that contain the
same<00:02:24.140> symbol<00:02:24.650> so<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:25.430> can<00:02:25.520> see<00:02:25.610> in<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.790> one

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
same symbol so you can see in the one

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.490 
same symbol so you can see in the one
corner<00:02:26.240> you<00:02:26.450> have<00:02:26.570> four<00:02:26.780> triangles<00:02:27.080> and<00:02:27.440> the

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
corner you have four triangles and the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.410 
corner you have four triangles and the
other<00:02:27.650> corner<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:28.040> have<00:02:28.130> five<00:02:28.340> circles<00:02:28.880> all

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
other corner you have five circles all

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.270 
other corner you have five circles all
these<00:02:29.720> sections<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.410> have<00:02:30.590> five<00:02:31.010> or<00:02:31.040> more

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
these sections that have five or more

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.130 
these sections that have five or more
shapes<00:02:31.700> are<00:02:31.880> going<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.120> score<00:02:32.480> any<00:02:32.690> points<00:02:32.780> at

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
shapes are going to score any points at

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.620 
shapes are going to score any points at
all<00:02:33.320> at<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.280> bottom<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:35.060> count<00:02:35.360> how<00:02:35.570> many

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
all at the bottom you count how many

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.570 
all at the bottom you count how many
sections<00:02:36.140> have<00:02:36.380> at<00:02:36.500> least<00:02:36.709> five<00:02:37.160> of<00:02:37.489> that

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
sections have at least five of that

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.360 
sections have at least five of that
shape<00:02:38.150> so<00:02:38.959> for<00:02:39.140> example<00:02:39.530> this<00:02:39.680> one<00:02:39.890> I<00:02:39.920> had<00:02:40.130> two

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
shape so for example this one I had two

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.729 
shape so for example this one I had two
sections<00:02:40.970> that<00:02:41.540> had<00:02:41.750> at<00:02:41.840> least<00:02:41.959> five<00:02:42.230> circles

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
sections that had at least five circles

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.199 
sections that had at least five circles
the<00:02:43.040> one<00:02:43.160> in<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.340> corner<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.850> one<00:02:43.970> in<00:02:44.120> the

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
the one in the corner and the one in the

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.560 
the one in the corner and the one in the
middle<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.630> then<00:02:45.320> how<00:02:45.530> many<00:02:45.910> spaces<00:02:46.910> in<00:02:47.360> those

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
middle and then how many spaces in those

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.600 
middle and then how many spaces in those
sections<00:02:47.989> contain<00:02:48.290> circles<00:02:48.739> so<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.430> one<00:02:49.519> up

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
sections contain circles so the one up

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.310 
sections contain circles so the one up
at<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.760> corner<00:02:50.030> at<00:02:50.120> five<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.630> night<00:02:50.780> six<00:02:51.050> seven

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
at a corner at five the night six seven

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.449 
at a corner at five the night six seven
eight<00:02:51.440> nine<00:02:51.620> ten<00:02:51.920> eleven<00:02:52.220> twelve<00:02:52.250> thirteen

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.810 
eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen
fourteen<00:02:52.870> so<00:02:53.870> it's<00:02:54.290> two<00:02:54.530> times<00:02:54.560> 14<00:02:55.370> is<00:02:55.400> 28

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
fourteen so it's two times 14 is 28

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.090 
fourteen so it's two times 14 is 28
points<00:02:56.450> I<00:02:56.630> continue<00:02:57.380> doing<00:02:57.620> that<00:02:57.739> got<00:02:57.980> my

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
points I continue doing that got my

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.560 
points I continue doing that got my
total<00:02:58.459> of<00:02:58.550> 70<00:02:58.970> points<00:02:59.530> you<00:03:00.530> can<00:03:00.650> see<00:03:00.709> here<00:03:01.570> this

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
total of 70 points you can see here this

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.030 
total of 70 points you can see here this
player<00:03:02.840> did<00:03:03.050> not<00:03:03.170> do<00:03:03.350> quite<00:03:03.530> as<00:03:03.709> well<00:03:03.860> because

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
player did not do quite as well because

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.560 
player did not do quite as well because
they<00:03:04.130> only<00:03:04.250> got<00:03:04.310> one<00:03:04.610> section<00:03:04.970> of<00:03:05.060> circles<00:03:05.450> and

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
they only got one section of circles and

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.479 
they only got one section of circles and
even<00:03:06.200> though<00:03:06.290> that<00:03:06.440> section<00:03:06.800> at<00:03:06.920> seven<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.370> at

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
even though that section at seven and at

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.250 
even though that section at seven and at
one<00:03:07.670> times<00:03:07.940> seven<00:03:08.150> is<00:03:08.390> still<00:03:08.630> only<00:03:08.900> seven

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
one times seven is still only seven

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.860 
one times seven is still only seven
points<00:03:09.560> so<00:03:10.130> they<00:03:10.250> got<00:03:10.400> a<00:03:10.430> total<00:03:10.820> of<00:03:10.940> 59<00:03:11.239> points

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
points so they got a total of 59 points

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.360 
points so they got a total of 59 points
so<00:03:12.380> it's<00:03:12.500> important<00:03:12.860> to<00:03:12.920> get<00:03:13.010> a<00:03:13.070> lot<00:03:13.250> of

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
so it's important to get a lot of

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.979 
so it's important to get a lot of
sections<00:03:13.760> it's<00:03:14.000> really<00:03:14.299> neat<00:03:14.480> if<00:03:14.630> you<00:03:14.750> can<00:03:14.870> get

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
sections it's really neat if you can get

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.780 
sections it's really neat if you can get
three<00:03:15.350> of<00:03:15.470> one<00:03:15.620> section<00:03:15.890> because<00:03:16.250> multiplying

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
three of one section because multiplying

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.650 
three of one section because multiplying
three<00:03:17.180> times<00:03:17.480> let's<00:03:18.079> say<00:03:18.260> 15<00:03:18.820> circles<00:03:19.820> is<00:03:20.209> 45

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
three times let's say 15 circles is 45

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.470 
three times let's say 15 circles is 45
points<00:03:21.140> while<00:03:21.320> two<00:03:21.590> times<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.459> same<00:03:22.700> 15<00:03:23.239> is

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
points while two times the same 15 is

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.890 
points while two times the same 15 is
only<00:03:23.870> 30<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:26.150> player<00:03:26.390> with<00:03:26.570> the<00:03:26.600> most<00:03:26.690> points

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
only 30 the player with the most points

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.720 
only 30 the player with the most points
is<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.650> winner<00:03:27.680> does<00:03:28.400> this<00:03:28.519> seem<00:03:28.700> like

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
is the winner does this seem like

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:29.949 
is the winner does this seem like
something<00:03:29.209> that<00:03:29.239> would<00:03:29.450> be<00:03:29.570> in<00:03:29.630> Gabe's

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
something that would be in Gabe's

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.690 
something that would be in Gabe's
magazine<00:03:30.620> puzzle<00:03:31.070> well<00:03:31.280> that's<00:03:31.519> probably

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
magazine puzzle well that's probably

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.520 
magazine puzzle well that's probably
because<00:03:31.970> if<00:03:32.239> you<00:03:32.360> turn<00:03:32.570> the<00:03:32.720> board's<00:03:33.230> over

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
because if you turn the board's over

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.259 
because if you turn the board's over
you'll<00:03:34.100> see<00:03:34.220> this<00:03:34.340> gray<00:03:34.579> side<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.150> it's

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
you'll see this gray side and it's

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.000 
you'll see this gray side and it's
basically<00:03:35.600> a<00:03:35.720> solitaire<00:03:36.260> area<00:03:36.620> that<00:03:36.769> you<00:03:36.890> can

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
basically a solitaire area that you can

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.870 
basically a solitaire area that you can
play<00:03:37.870> it's<00:03:38.870> not<00:03:38.989> solid<00:03:39.829> there<00:03:39.980> because<00:03:40.370> you

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
play it's not solid there because you

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.150 
play it's not solid there because you
get<00:03:41.060> to<00:03:41.180> pick<00:03:41.420> how<00:03:41.959> the<00:03:42.019> shape<00:03:42.380> is<00:03:42.590> on<00:03:42.829> your

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
get to pick how the shape is on your

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.350 
get to pick how the shape is on your
turn<00:03:43.370> and<00:03:43.489> then<00:03:43.579> the<00:03:43.640> other<00:03:43.790> player<00:03:44.000> picks<00:03:44.269> a

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
turn and then the other player picks a

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.030 
turn and then the other player picks a
shape<00:03:44.540> and<00:03:44.630> you<00:03:44.720> can<00:03:44.780> deal<00:03:45.079> with<00:03:45.140> that<00:03:45.440> so<00:03:46.010> you

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
shape and you can deal with that so you

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.699 
shape and you can deal with that so you
could<00:03:46.549> conceivably<00:03:47.239> pick<00:03:47.630> a<00:03:47.660> shape<00:03:47.959> that<00:03:48.560> you

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
could conceivably pick a shape that you

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.080 
could conceivably pick a shape that you
know<00:03:48.829> hurts<00:03:49.070> your<00:03:49.220> opponent<00:03:49.640> although<00:03:49.850> most

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
know hurts your opponent although most

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.340 
know hurts your opponent although most
of<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.269> time<00:03:50.420> you're<00:03:50.600> simply<00:03:50.900> going<00:03:51.079> to<00:03:51.170> pick

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
of the time you're simply going to pick

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.940 
of the time you're simply going to pick
one<00:03:51.560> that<00:03:52.100> best<00:03:52.430> helps<00:03:53.000> your<00:03:53.299> cells<00:03:53.600> and<00:03:54.049> so<00:03:54.680> I

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
one that best helps your cells and so I

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.530 
one that best helps your cells and so I
found<00:03:55.280> each<00:03:55.549> time<00:03:55.760> sitting<00:03:56.090> here<00:03:56.209> desperately

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
found each time sitting here desperately

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.410 
found each time sitting here desperately
trying<00:03:57.019> to<00:03:57.079> get<00:03:57.260> three<00:03:57.890> groups<00:03:58.310> I<00:03:58.640> guess<00:03:59.180> four

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
trying to get three groups I guess four

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.940 
trying to get three groups I guess four
is<00:03:59.540> possible<00:04:00.019> although<00:04:00.170> I've<00:04:00.410> never<00:04:00.440> really

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
is possible although I've never really

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.949 
is possible although I've never really
had<00:04:01.100> a<00:04:01.130> chance<00:04:01.400> to<00:04:01.610> get<00:04:01.730> four<00:04:02.060> groups<00:04:02.720> but<00:04:02.930> you

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
had a chance to get four groups but you

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.810 
had a chance to get four groups but you
get<00:04:03.110> three<00:04:03.440> groups<00:04:03.739> you<00:04:04.190> might<00:04:04.489> have<00:04:04.640> a<00:04:04.700> good

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
get three groups you might have a good

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.550 
get three groups you might have a good
chance<00:04:04.880> at<00:04:05.239> winning<00:04:05.420> and<00:04:05.750> each<00:04:06.230> time<00:04:06.530> you

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
chance at winning and each time you

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.110 
chance at winning and each time you
score<00:04:06.950> differently<00:04:07.310> bit<00:04:07.489> depending<00:04:07.940> on<00:04:08.030> how

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120
