00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.860 
do believe that this is one in addition
but<00:06:23.290> any<00:06:23.530> coral<00:06:24.070> colored<00:06:24.400> lip<00:06:25.330> gloss<00:06:25.540> will<00:06:25.780> be

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
but any coral colored lip gloss will be

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.210 
but any coral colored lip gloss will be
fine<00:06:26.520> ok<00:06:27.520> so<00:06:27.630> that<00:06:28.630> is<00:06:28.660> it<00:06:29.110> so<00:06:29.680> it's<00:06:29.950> basically

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
fine ok so that is it so it's basically

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:36.630 
fine ok so that is it so it's basically
just<00:06:31.740> sort<00:06:32.740> of<00:06:32.830> a<00:06:33.010> a<00:06:33.790> lighter<00:06:34.360> smokey<00:06:35.020> eye<00:06:35.640> just

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:36.640 
just sort of a a lighter smokey eye just

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.690 
just sort of a a lighter smokey eye just
with<00:06:36.820> the<00:06:36.940> coral<00:06:37.270> lip<00:06:37.510> and<00:06:37.870> that's<00:06:38.620> it<00:06:38.950> um<00:06:39.190> I

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700 
with the coral lip and that's it um I

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.780 
with the coral lip and that's it um I
like<00:06:40.450> this<00:06:40.720> the<00:06:41.620> way<00:06:41.740> I<00:06:41.770> did<00:06:42.010> the<00:06:42.040> eye<00:06:42.160> because

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:42.790 
like this the way I did the eye because

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.760 
like this the way I did the eye because
um<00:06:42.970> it<00:06:43.240> really<00:06:43.780> just<00:06:44.020> kind<00:06:44.260> of<00:06:44.350> keeps<00:06:44.560> them

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.770 
um it really just kind of keeps them

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.740 
um it really just kind of keeps them
open<00:06:45.160> up<00:06:45.370> compared<00:06:45.940> to<00:06:46.090> do<00:06:46.180> in<00:06:46.270> a<00:06:46.360> smoky<00:06:46.720> eye

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750 
open up compared to do in a smoky eye

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.500 
open up compared to do in a smoky eye
where<00:06:47.169> you<00:06:47.260> have<00:06:47.440> it<00:06:47.680> dark<00:06:48.430> all<00:06:48.700> over<00:06:49.240> the<00:06:49.330> lid

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.510 
where you have it dark all over the lid

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.380 
where you have it dark all over the lid
and<00:06:49.810> then<00:06:49.840> like<00:06:50.080> a<00:06:50.110> lighter<00:06:50.410> color<00:06:50.500> up<00:06:51.400> top<00:06:51.850> so

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:52.390 
and then like a lighter color up top so

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:56.000 
and then like a lighter color up top so
I<00:06:52.919> like<00:06:53.919> it<00:06:54.130> it's<00:06:54.310> a<00:06:54.640> little<00:06:54.940> bit<00:06:55.030> more<00:06:55.240> fresh

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.010 
I like it it's a little bit more fresh

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.409 
I like it it's a little bit more fresh
compared<00:06:57.010> to<00:06:57.130> the<00:06:57.250> traditional<00:06:57.400> smokey<00:06:58.390> eye

00:06:58.409 --> 00:06:58.419 
compared to the traditional smokey eye

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:01.740 
compared to the traditional smokey eye
that<00:06:59.200> you<00:06:59.380> see<00:06:59.590> a<00:06:59.620> lot<00:06:59.710> of<00:06:59.860> the<00:07:00.070> time<00:07:00.280> and<00:07:00.750> I

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:01.750 
that you see a lot of the time and I

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.380 
that you see a lot of the time and I
think<00:07:02.350> this<00:07:02.500> is<00:07:02.560> a<00:07:02.890> great<00:07:03.100> smoky<00:07:03.669> eye<00:07:03.700> for
