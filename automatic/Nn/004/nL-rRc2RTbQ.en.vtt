00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
especially compared to the old 9800 then

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.200 
especially compared to the old 9800 then
on<00:01:10.860> top<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.220> there's<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.490> new<00:01:11.820> chassis

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
on top of that there's a new chassis

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.320 
on top of that there's a new chassis
which<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:12.960> anodized<00:01:13.770> aluminum<00:01:14.490> instead<00:01:15.119> of

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
which is anodized aluminum instead of

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.870 
which is anodized aluminum instead of
the<00:01:15.479> older<00:01:15.990> plastic<00:01:16.470> with<00:01:17.220> new<00:01:17.580> lighting

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
the older plastic with new lighting

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.499 
the older plastic with new lighting
scheme<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:19.560> kind<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.979> ridge<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.580> top<00:01:21.330> of

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
scheme and a kind of a ridge on top of

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.690 
scheme and a kind of a ridge on top of
the<00:01:21.600> LCD<00:01:21.750> lid<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.619> it's<00:01:23.009> similar<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.549> old

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
the LCD lid so it's similar to the old

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.810 
the LCD lid so it's similar to the old
systems<00:01:24.090> but<00:01:24.450> it's<00:01:24.780> basically<00:01:25.560> revamp<00:01:26.220> so

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
systems but it's basically revamp so

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.130 
systems but it's basically revamp so
it's<00:01:26.939> kind<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.240> exciting<00:01:27.360> although<00:01:27.960> we

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
it's kind of exciting although we

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.420 
it's kind of exciting although we
haven't<00:01:28.320> gotten<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.650> hands<00:01:28.829> on<00:01:28.920> yet<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.310> we'll

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
haven't gotten a hands on yet so we'll

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.280 
haven't gotten a hands on yet so we'll
see<00:01:29.610> how<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.060> holds<00:01:30.119> up<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.509> future<00:01:30.810> it's

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
see how it holds up in the future it's

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.319 
see how it holds up in the future it's
still<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.530> 17<00:01:31.950> inch<00:01:32.100> notebook<00:01:32.280> with<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.030> same

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
still a 17 inch notebook with the same

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.840 
still a 17 inch notebook with the same
1920<00:01:33.930> by<00:01:34.079> 1200<00:01:34.439> display<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.700> hasn't

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
1920 by 1200 display so that hasn't

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.550 
1920 by 1200 display so that hasn't
changed<00:01:36.000> what<00:01:36.659> did<00:01:36.840> change<00:01:36.990> with<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.259> display

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
changed what did change with the display

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.740 
changed what did change with the display
is<00:01:37.710> now<00:01:37.920> it's<00:01:38.159> an<00:01:38.310> edge<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.759> edge<00:01:38.909> display

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
is now it's an edge to edge display

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.170 
is now it's an edge to edge display
which<00:01:40.200> means<00:01:40.439> there's<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.740> bezel<00:01:41.549> list<00:01:41.729> if<00:01:42.030> you

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
which means there's a bezel list if you

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.969 
which means there's a bezel list if you
want<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.390> call<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.780> other<00:01:43.140> news<00:01:43.530> in
