00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.270

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.460
 I bought for this puff pastry I know 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.510
 what usually exactly traditionally makes it 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:31.500

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:22.110
 It creates the effect of such an ulta 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:24.270
 small kitchen so I can still tell you 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.630
 a gift that my mother gave me 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.770

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.560
