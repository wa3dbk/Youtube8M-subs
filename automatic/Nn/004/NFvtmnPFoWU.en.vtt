00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
they undersea surgery really when we got

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.729 
they undersea surgery really when we got
him<00:00:40.750> we<00:00:41.530> were<00:00:41.770> so<00:00:42.010> affected<00:00:42.550> by<00:00:42.760> the<00:00:42.820> place

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
him we were so affected by the place

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.960 
him we were so affected by the place
with<00:00:44.739> the<00:00:44.949> you<00:00:45.160> know<00:00:45.220> the<00:00:45.370> mining<00:00:45.790> landscape

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
with the you know the mining landscape

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.939 
with the you know the mining landscape
the<00:00:46.570> effect<00:00:46.930> that<00:00:47.110> that's<00:00:47.500> had<00:00:47.710> on<00:00:47.830> the

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
the effect that that's had on the

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.920 
the effect that that's had on the
environment<00:00:48.100> and<00:00:48.760> then<00:00:48.940> and<00:00:49.210> then<00:00:49.780> the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
environment and then and then the

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.950 
environment and then and then the
natural<00:00:50.110> environment<00:00:50.830> which<00:00:51.040> is<00:00:51.280> there<00:00:51.610> so

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
natural environment which is there so

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.210 
natural environment which is there so
contrasting<00:00:52.960> and<00:00:53.080> and<00:00:53.710> that's<00:00:53.949> quite<00:00:54.190> a

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
contrasting and and that's quite a

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.400 
contrasting and and that's quite a
moving<00:00:54.730> thing<00:00:54.970> like<00:00:55.630> I<00:00:55.780> found<00:00:56.170> that<00:00:56.350> very

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
moving thing like I found that very

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.170 
moving thing like I found that very
effective<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.750> the<00:00:58.960> isolation<00:00:59.440> is<00:01:00.040> also<00:01:00.399> very

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
effective and the isolation is also very

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.090 
effective and the isolation is also very
affecting<00:01:01.600> and<00:01:01.780> seeing<00:01:02.020> the<00:01:02.500> effect<00:01:02.590> that<00:01:02.860> the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
affecting and seeing the effect that the

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.520 
affecting and seeing the effect that the
isolation<00:01:03.579> has<00:01:03.969> on<00:01:04.270> a<00:01:04.300> community<00:01:04.960> we

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
isolation has on a community we

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.770 
isolation has on a community we
essentially<00:01:06.009> just<00:01:06.340> went<00:01:06.550> okay<00:01:06.790> let's<00:01:07.390> let

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
essentially just went okay let's let

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.740 
essentially just went okay let's let
this<00:01:07.960> place<00:01:08.290> seep<00:01:09.040> into<00:01:09.310> us<00:01:09.610> and<00:01:09.880> and<00:01:10.330> see<00:01:10.570> what

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
this place seep into us and and see what

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.320 
this place seep into us and and see what
comes<00:01:10.990> of<00:01:11.140> that

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.850 

art-making<00:01:16.310> for<00:01:17.310> me<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:18.740> process<00:01:19.740> of

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
art-making for me is a process of

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.330 
art-making for me is a process of
discovery<00:01:19.980> it's<00:01:20.910> really<00:01:21.420> about<00:01:21.660> searching<00:01:22.380> so

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
discovery it's really about searching so

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
discovery it's really about searching so
while<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.360> can<00:01:24.780> have<00:01:25.110> some<00:01:25.350> idea<00:01:25.740> about<00:01:25.770> where<00:01:26.250> I

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
while I can have some idea about where I

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.890 
while I can have some idea about where I
want<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.510> get<00:01:27.660> to<00:01:27.920> actually<00:01:29.750> enjoy<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
want to get to actually enjoy the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.830 
want to get to actually enjoy the
process<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.500> just<00:01:31.940> going<00:01:32.940> on<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.150> journey<00:01:33.390> and

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
process of just going on the journey and

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.660 
process of just going on the journey and
when<00:01:34.320> you're<00:01:34.470> an<00:01:34.620> artist<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.160> you<00:01:35.280> come<00:01:35.490> into

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
when you're an artist and you come into

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.780 
when you're an artist and you come into
a<00:01:35.850> new<00:01:36.090> context<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:37.830> way<00:01:38.010> you<00:01:38.070> worked<00:01:38.520> before

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
a new context the way you worked before

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.850 
a new context the way you worked before
the<00:01:39.330> way<00:01:39.480> you<00:01:39.540> approach<00:01:40.020> things<00:01:40.260> before<00:01:40.740> it

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
the way you approach things before it

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.730 
the way you approach things before it
doesn't<00:01:41.010> always<00:01:41.370> hold<00:01:41.880> true<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:43.320> where<00:01:43.590> you

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
doesn't always hold true to where you

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.280 
doesn't always hold true to where you
are<00:01:43.770> now<00:01:44.240> so<00:01:45.240> there's<00:01:45.600> always<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.930> certain

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
are now so there's always a certain

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.380 
are now so there's always a certain
amount<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.770> reinventing<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.700> has<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.210> go<00:01:48.360> on

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
amount of reinventing that has to go on

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.090 
amount of reinventing that has to go on
and<00:01:49.310> that's<00:01:50.330> what<00:01:51.330> has<00:01:51.720> been<00:01:52.080> going<00:01:52.410> on<00:01:52.530> here<00:01:52.920> I

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
and that's what has been going on here I

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.630 
and that's what has been going on here I

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
some of the stories that they've been

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.280 
some of the stories that they've been
talking<00:03:25.010> about<00:03:25.360> so<00:03:26.360> that<00:03:26.510> it's<00:03:26.660> not<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.870> foreign

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
talking about so that it's not a foreign

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.530 
talking about so that it's not a foreign
experience<00:03:27.920> to<00:03:28.370> themselves<00:03:28.790> and<00:03:29.030> so<00:03:29.210> that<00:03:29.420> the

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
experience to themselves and so that the

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:52.950 
experience to themselves and so that the
art<00:03:29.720> that<00:03:29.930> gets<00:03:30.140> made<00:03:30.400> still<00:03:31.400> reflects<00:03:31.820> them

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.360 

when<00:03:53.960> they<00:03:54.110> came<00:03:54.290> in<00:03:54.500> we'd<00:03:54.620> always<00:03:54.830> have<00:03:54.980> ideas

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
when they came in we'd always have ideas

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.980 
when they came in we'd always have ideas
about<00:03:55.400> what<00:03:55.640> we<00:03:55.880> were<00:03:56.000> going<00:03:56.240> to<00:03:56.390> do<00:03:56.510> and<00:03:56.780> then

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
about what we were going to do and then

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.790 
about what we were going to do and then
if<00:03:57.650> that<00:03:57.920> wasn't<00:03:58.160> sort<00:03:58.790> of<00:03:59.320> feeling<00:04:00.320> like<00:04:00.530> it

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
if that wasn't sort of feeling like it

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.140 
if that wasn't sort of feeling like it
was<00:04:00.830> really<00:04:01.160> going<00:04:01.460> anywhere<00:04:01.550> we'd<00:04:01.970> always

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
was really going anywhere we'd always

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.960 
was really going anywhere we'd always
change<00:04:02.780> tact<00:04:03.110> that's<00:04:04.070> been<00:04:04.370> a<00:04:04.400> bit<00:04:04.580> of<00:04:04.670> a<00:04:04.760> new

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
change tact that's been a bit of a new

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.000 
change tact that's been a bit of a new
thing<00:04:05.630> for<00:04:05.660> them<00:04:05.960> that<00:04:06.170> you<00:04:06.350> can<00:04:06.590> come<00:04:06.770> into<00:04:06.920> a

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
thing for them that you can come into a

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.340 
thing for them that you can come into a
space<00:04:07.130> and<00:04:07.310> go<00:04:07.720> that's<00:04:08.720> not<00:04:08.840> working<00:04:09.050> let's

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
space and go that's not working let's

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.110 
space and go that's not working let's
try<00:04:09.590> this<00:04:09.650> we<00:04:10.010> can<00:04:10.160> play<00:04:10.340> with<00:04:10.700> those<00:04:10.880> ideas

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
try this we can play with those ideas

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.380 
try this we can play with those ideas
and<00:04:11.720> then<00:04:12.200> it<00:04:12.350> turns<00:04:12.590> into<00:04:12.770> something

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.849 

it<00:04:15.990> was<00:04:16.200> good<00:04:16.920> to<00:04:17.220> be<00:04:17.340> able<00:04:17.579> to<00:04:18.380> just<00:04:19.380> have<00:04:19.680> a

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
it was good to be able to just have a

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.620 
it was good to be able to just have a
say<00:04:20.190> in<00:04:20.220> what<00:04:20.370> you're<00:04:20.760> going<00:04:21.030> to<00:04:21.060> do<00:04:21.329> and<00:04:21.510> what

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
say in what you're going to do and what

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.440 
say in what you're going to do and what
you're<00:04:21.780> going<00:04:21.959> to<00:04:22.049> draw<00:04:23.010> and<00:04:23.370> you<00:04:24.120> kind<00:04:24.390> of

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
you're going to draw and you kind of

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.420 
you're going to draw and you kind of
forget<00:04:24.600> everything<00:04:25.500> else<00:04:25.680> and<00:04:25.950> you<00:04:26.070> just<00:04:26.280> know

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
forget everything else and you just know

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.600 
forget everything else and you just know
this<00:04:26.700> is<00:04:26.940> kind<00:04:27.390> of<00:04:27.450> the<00:04:27.630> moment<00:04:27.870> and<00:04:28.430> this<00:04:29.430> is

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
this is kind of the moment and this is

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.270 
this is kind of the moment and this is
just<00:04:29.850> like<00:04:30.200> what<00:04:31.200> you<00:04:31.230> remember<00:04:31.950> all<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.250> fun

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
just like what you remember all the fun

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.110 
just like what you remember all the fun
stuff<00:04:32.880> we<00:04:33.060> did<00:04:33.270> with<00:04:33.450> everyone<00:04:33.780> just<00:04:34.790> make<00:04:35.790> not

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
stuff we did with everyone just make not

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.710 
stuff we did with everyone just make not
I<00:04:38.060> thought<00:04:39.060> it<00:04:39.150> would<00:04:39.240> have<00:04:39.330> been<00:04:39.419> a<00:04:39.450> bit<00:04:39.600> more

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
I thought it would have been a bit more

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.780 
I thought it would have been a bit more
structured<00:04:40.169> but<00:04:41.040> then<00:04:41.190> at<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.400> same<00:04:41.490> time

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
structured but then at the same time

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.270 
structured but then at the same time
it's<00:04:41.970> fun<00:04:42.180> because<00:04:42.810> you're<00:04:43.169> thinking<00:04:43.590> oh<00:04:43.800> it

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
it's fun because you're thinking oh it

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.920 
it's fun because you're thinking oh it
might<00:04:44.430> be<00:04:44.580> like<00:04:44.700> this<00:04:44.910> but<00:04:45.120> I'm<00:04:45.480> told<00:04:45.660> it<00:04:45.750> might

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
might be like this but I'm told it might

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.020 
might be like this but I'm told it might
be<00:04:46.080> like<00:04:46.200> that<00:04:46.260> and<00:04:46.800> it's<00:04:47.400> not<00:04:47.580> definitely

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
be like that and it's not definitely

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.490 
be like that and it's not definitely
going<00:04:48.240> to<00:04:48.270> be<00:04:48.390> the<00:04:48.480> one<00:04:48.600> thing<00:04:48.930> it<00:04:49.110> could<00:04:49.290> just

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
going to be the one thing it could just

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.960 
going to be the one thing it could just
turn<00:04:49.680> in<00:04:49.919> instance<00:04:50.370> so<00:04:51.140> life<00:04:52.140> isn't<00:04:52.680> just<00:04:52.980> a

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
turn in instance so life isn't just a

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.420 
turn in instance so life isn't just a
straightforward<00:04:54.480> path<00:04:54.960> that<00:04:55.260> has<00:04:55.470> deviations

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
straightforward path that has deviations

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.640 
straightforward path that has deviations
you<00:04:57.270> might<00:04:57.419> do<00:04:57.600> one<00:04:57.780> thing<00:04:58.020> which<00:04:58.200> leads<00:04:58.440> to

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
you might do one thing which leads to

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.320 
you might do one thing which leads to
another<00:04:58.830> thing<00:04:59.190> but<00:04:59.430> then<00:04:59.580> that<00:04:59.760> next<00:05:00.060> thing

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
another thing but then that next thing

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.400 
another thing but then that next thing
could<00:05:00.510> lead<00:05:00.540> you<00:05:00.840> to<00:05:00.990> something<00:05:01.230> completely

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
could lead you to something completely

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.770 
could lead you to something completely
different<00:05:04.640> when<00:05:05.640> you<00:05:05.850> wake<00:05:06.210> up<00:05:06.510> in<00:05:06.690> the

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
different when you wake up in the

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.030 
different when you wake up in the
morning<00:05:07.110> at<00:05:07.260> something<00:05:07.770> to<00:05:07.980> look<00:05:08.040> forward<00:05:08.370> to

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
morning at something to look forward to

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.250 
morning at something to look forward to
isn't<00:05:11.040> just<00:05:11.280> painting<00:05:11.850> a<00:05:11.970> picture<00:05:12.260> ended

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
isn't just painting a picture ended

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.170 
isn't just painting a picture ended
being<00:05:14.000> spectacular<00:05:15.000> it's<00:05:16.580> it's<00:05:17.580> more<00:05:17.970> than

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
being spectacular it's it's more than

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.110 
being spectacular it's it's more than
that

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
that

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.900 
that
we<00:05:20.690> always<00:05:20.840> look<00:05:21.050> forward<00:05:21.320> to<00:05:21.560> it<00:05:21.680> we<00:05:22.580> didn't

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
we always look forward to it we didn't

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.310 
we always look forward to it we didn't
look<00:05:23.030> forward<00:05:23.330> to<00:05:23.419> school<00:05:23.540> that<00:05:23.720> much<00:05:23.900> spent

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
look forward to school that much spent

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.850 
look forward to school that much spent
on<00:05:24.770> the<00:05:25.100> days<00:05:25.280> that<00:05:25.310> we<00:05:25.699> had<00:05:25.910> this<00:05:26.750> program<00:05:27.230> we

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
on the days that we had this program we

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.560 
on the days that we had this program we
always<00:05:28.100> wanted<00:05:28.370> to<00:05:28.430> come<00:05:28.610> so<00:05:29.000> if<00:05:29.150> you<00:05:29.240> do<00:05:29.389> that

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
always wanted to come so if you do that

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.050 
always wanted to come so if you do that
I<00:05:29.810> just<00:05:30.440> realized<00:05:31.160> that<00:05:31.310> it<00:05:31.639> can<00:05:31.760> be<00:05:31.850> anything

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
I just realized that it can be anything

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.180 
I just realized that it can be anything
it<00:05:32.960> doesn't<00:05:33.139> have<00:05:33.320> to<00:05:33.470> be<00:05:33.620> drawing<00:05:33.830> or

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
it doesn't have to be drawing or

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.969 
it doesn't have to be drawing or
painting<00:05:34.550> it<00:05:34.910> can<00:05:35.060> be<00:05:37.060> movement<00:05:38.060> light

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
painting it can be movement light

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.640 
painting it can be movement light
pictures<00:05:39.979> anything<00:05:40.960> they<00:05:41.960> have<00:05:42.080> often<00:05:42.229> talked

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
pictures anything they have often talked

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.250 
pictures anything they have often talked
to<00:05:43.070> take<00:05:43.160> afraid<00:05:43.520> in<00:05:43.940> quite<00:05:44.210> detail<00:05:44.419> about<00:05:44.990> a

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
to take afraid in quite detail about a

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.680 
to take afraid in quite detail about a
variety<00:05:45.919> of<00:05:45.949> things<00:05:46.190> and<00:05:46.880> we've<00:05:47.300> learned<00:05:47.540> a

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
variety of things and we've learned a

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.780 
variety of things and we've learned a
lot<00:05:47.720> about<00:05:48.130> well<00:05:49.130> I've<00:05:49.280> learned<00:05:49.460> a<00:05:49.610> lot<00:05:49.669> about

through their conversations this
opportunity<00:05:58.460> has<00:05:58.639> really<00:05:58.970> just<00:05:59.180> been<00:05:59.990> a<00:06:00.410> way

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
opportunity has really just been a way

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.240 
opportunity has really just been a way
of<00:06:01.460> opening<00:06:01.669> up<00:06:02.120> all<00:06:02.690> those<00:06:02.960> new<00:06:03.229> little<00:06:03.919> paths

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
of opening up all those new little paths

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.810 
of opening up all those new little paths
and<00:06:04.760> now<00:06:05.150> I<00:06:05.180> feel<00:06:05.510> like<00:06:05.570> when<00:06:06.350> we<00:06:06.500> leave<00:06:06.770> and<00:06:07.490> we

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 
and now I feel like when we leave and we

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.020 
and now I feel like when we leave and we
get<00:06:07.970> our<00:06:08.090> own<00:06:08.120> studio<00:06:08.750> again<00:06:09.050> that<00:06:09.290> we<00:06:09.940> that<00:06:10.940> we

get our own studio again that we that we

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.760 
get our own studio again that we that we
just<00:06:11.210> continue<00:06:11.720> on<00:06:11.750> all<00:06:12.200> those<00:06:12.470> little

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
just continue on all those little

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:18.879 
just continue on all those little
openings<00:06:16.270> the<00:06:17.270> relationships<00:06:18.110> that<00:06:18.740> have

been built here have been really
significant<00:06:22.460> I<00:06:22.639> think<00:06:22.820> in<00:06:23.300> terms<00:06:23.539> of<00:06:23.720> my<00:06:23.870> own
