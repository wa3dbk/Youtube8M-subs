system and show you some speed tests and
benchmarks<00:00:12.059> that<00:00:12.120> sort<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.570> thing<00:00:12.710> but<00:00:13.710> we're

going to start off here first with just

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.420 
going to start off here first with just
some<00:00:15.780> basic<00:00:16.139> familiarization<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.190> what's

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
some basic familiarization of what's

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.420

going<00:00:17.609> on<00:00:17.820> here<00:00:18.090> with<00:00:18.240> Bill<00:00:18.449> sxy<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.590> it's

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
going on here with Bill sxy and it's

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.070 
going on here with Bill sxy and it's
actually<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.880> same<00:00:20.910> thing<00:00:21.330> as<00:00:21.449> snow<00:00:21.660> leopard

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
actually the same thing as snow leopard

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.390 
actually the same thing as snow leopard
is<00:00:22.260> really<00:00:22.500> not<00:00:22.650> much<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:23.039> difference

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
is really not much of a difference

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.250 
is really not much of a difference
except<00:00:23.730> these<00:00:23.880> two<00:00:24.119> icons<00:00:24.300> down<00:00:24.779> here<00:00:25.080> your

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
launch pad Mission Control and you got

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.089 
launch pad Mission Control and you got
this<00:00:30.000> launch<00:00:30.720> pad<00:00:31.050> takes<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.590> directly<00:00:31.769> to

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
gotten into it a lot but it's pretty

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.110 
gotten into it a lot but it's pretty
easy<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.890> navigate<00:00:41.100> through<00:00:41.640> here<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.030> don't

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
easy to navigate through here you don't

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.910 
easy to navigate through here you don't
have<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.420> keep<00:00:42.600> going<00:00:42.780> into<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.230> applications

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
have to keep going into the applications

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.860 
have to keep going into the applications
drawer<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.430> messing<00:00:44.730> around<00:00:44.820> there<00:00:45.270> so

we're<00:01:59.070> at<00:01:59.750> again<00:02:00.750> I'm<00:02:00.869> still<00:02:01.110> suffering<00:02:01.439> from

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
we're at again I'm still suffering from

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:11.809 
we're at again I'm still suffering from
a<00:02:01.740> cold<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.310> bear<00:02:03.090> with<00:02:03.119> my<00:02:03.420> nasally<00:02:04.020> voice

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.000 

and<00:02:12.359> geekbench<00:02:13.049> is<00:02:13.260> still<00:02:13.499> running<00:02:13.769> about

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
and geekbench is still running about

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:22.800 
and geekbench is still running about
halfway<00:02:14.249> done

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.660 

and<00:02:23.410> there<00:02:23.560> we<00:02:23.620> go<00:02:23.650> a<00:02:23.950> result<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:25.800> 5421<00:02:26.800> on<00:02:27.459> the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
and there we go a result of 5421 on the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.650 
and there we go a result of 5421 on the
geekbench<00:02:28.150> score<00:02:30.239> so<00:02:32.880> definitely<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:34.239> major

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
geekbench score so definitely a major

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.910 
geekbench score so definitely a major
improvement<00:02:35.050> over<00:02:35.560> my<00:02:35.860> last<00:02:36.250> mini<00:02:37.770> thank<00:02:38.770> you

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
improvement over my last mini thank you

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.740 
improvement over my last mini thank you
bench<00:02:39.340> will<00:02:39.550> close<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:39.790> one<00:02:40.150> out<00:02:40.300> get<00:02:41.110> in<00:02:41.230> the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
bench will close that one out get in the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.220 
bench will close that one out get in the
World<00:02:43.750> Wide<00:02:43.959> Web<00:02:43.989> here<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.680> go<00:02:44.769> to<00:02:44.830> speed<00:02:45.130> test

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
World Wide Web here and go to speed test

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.600 
World Wide Web here and go to speed test
now<00:02:47.230> another<00:02:47.410> thing<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.709> noticed<00:02:48.040> here<00:02:48.280> on<00:02:48.459> this

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
now another thing I noticed here on this

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.780 
now another thing I noticed here on this
one<00:02:49.019> I'm<00:02:50.019> still<00:02:50.410> using<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.860> same<00:02:50.890> connection

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
one I'm still using the same connection

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.220 
one I'm still using the same connection
that<00:02:52.750> I<00:02:52.780> used<00:02:53.440> when<00:02:54.430> I<00:02:54.489> had<00:02:54.819> my<00:02:55.299> old<00:02:55.690> Mac<00:02:55.959> which

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
that I used when I had my old Mac which

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.860 
that I used when I had my old Mac which
is<00:02:56.410> Roadrunner<00:02:57.160> lightning<00:02:57.640> through<00:02:58.569> bright

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
is Roadrunner lightning through bright

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.420 
is Roadrunner lightning through bright
house<00:02:59.049> networks<00:02:59.530> here<00:02:59.739> in<00:02:59.860> Florida<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.870> the

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
house networks here in Florida and the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.160 
house networks here in Florida and the
download<00:03:03.430> speeds<00:03:04.120> that<00:03:04.600> I'm<00:03:04.750> getting<00:03:04.959> with

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
download speeds that I'm getting with

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.100 
download speeds that I'm getting with
this<00:03:05.380> new<00:03:05.650> system<00:03:05.950> are<00:03:06.370> almost<00:03:07.269> twice<00:03:07.569> as<00:03:07.720> much

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
this new system are almost twice as much

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.309 
this new system are almost twice as much
as<00:03:08.170> what<00:03:08.349> i<00:03:08.500> was<00:03:08.680> getting<00:03:09.000> with<00:03:10.049> the<00:03:11.049> other

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
as what i was getting with the other

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.539 
as what i was getting with the other
system<00:03:12.810> so<00:03:13.810> let's<00:03:14.049> run<00:03:14.260> a<00:03:14.290> current<00:03:14.860> speed<00:03:15.250> test

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
system so let's run a current speed test

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.000 
system so let's run a current speed test
here<00:03:15.940> and<00:03:16.120> see<00:03:16.630> where<00:03:16.810> we're<00:03:16.989> at<00:03:17.019> a<00:03:17.440> 9

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
here and see where we're at a 9

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.300 
here and see where we're at a 9
millisecond<00:03:18.700> ping<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.920> right<00:03:20.920> now<00:03:21.069> that's

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
millisecond ping and right now that's

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.600 
millisecond ping and right now that's
running<00:03:21.549> the<00:03:21.700> download<00:03:22.180> speed<00:03:22.360> test<00:03:22.840> which

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
running the download speed test which

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:30.150 
running the download speed test which
hovered<00:03:24.610> right<00:03:24.760> around<00:03:24.819> 39<00:03:28.440> so<00:03:29.440> we're<00:03:29.590> at<00:03:29.680> 39

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
hovered right around 39 so we're at 39

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.479 
hovered right around 39 so we're at 39
megabits<00:03:30.940> for<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.750> download<00:03:32.320> speed<00:03:32.500> upload

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
megabits for the download speed upload

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:44.280 
megabits for the download speed upload
speed<00:03:33.760> should<00:03:33.910> be<00:03:33.970> right<00:03:34.239> around<00:03:34.390> four

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.280 

that's<00:03:45.040> what<00:03:45.159> we<00:03:45.250> got<00:03:45.400> 4.31<00:03:46.269> megabits<00:03:47.079> for

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
that's what we got 4.31 megabits for

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.920 
that's what we got 4.31 megabits for
upload<00:03:47.650> speed<00:03:48.010> that's<00:03:48.819> pretty<00:03:49.510> darn<00:03:49.750> good

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
upload speed that's pretty darn good

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.750 
upload speed that's pretty darn good
considering<00:03:50.709> this<00:03:50.920> as<00:03:51.069> a<00:03:51.099> Wi-Fi<00:03:51.700> connection

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
considering this as a Wi-Fi connection

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.929 
considering this as a Wi-Fi connection
is<00:03:52.480> I'm<00:03:52.689> not<00:03:52.870> wired<00:03:53.230> in<00:03:53.560> so<00:03:54.459> I'm<00:03:54.640> pretty

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:54.939 
is I'm not wired in so I'm pretty

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:58.500 
is I'm not wired in so I'm pretty
impressed<00:03:55.150> with<00:03:55.629> that<00:03:55.659> result<00:03:57.239> when<00:03:58.239> I<00:03:58.269> go

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
impressed with that result when I go

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.330 
impressed with that result when I go
back<00:03:58.689> and<00:03:58.870> I<00:03:58.930> do<00:03:58.989> a<00:03:59.109> comparison<00:03:59.680> for<00:04:00.099> some<00:04:00.250> of

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
back and I do a comparison for some of

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.710 
back and I do a comparison for some of
the<00:04:00.430> other<00:04:00.579> results<00:04:01.090> that<00:04:01.209> I<00:04:01.239> brand<00:04:01.510> you<00:04:01.599> can

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
the other results that I brand you can

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.270 
the other results that I brand you can
obviously<00:04:01.870> see<00:04:02.379> the<00:04:02.500> graph<00:04:02.739> here<00:04:02.950> this<00:04:03.159> is

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
obviously see the graph here this is

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.699 
obviously see the graph here this is
when<00:04:03.430> I<00:04:03.459> got<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.879> new<00:04:04.540> one<00:04:04.750> this<00:04:05.379> is<00:04:05.500> where<00:04:05.680> I

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
when I got the new one this is where I

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.449 
when I got the new one this is where I
was<00:04:05.890> running<00:04:06.250> with<00:04:06.579> the<00:04:06.640> other<00:04:06.909> mac<00:04:07.409> now<00:04:08.459> the

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
was running with the other mac now the

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:10.860 
was running with the other mac now the
average<00:04:09.640> speeds<00:04:10.120> and<00:04:10.269> you<00:04:10.329> can't<00:04:10.569> I<00:04:10.689> don't

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
average speeds and you can't I don't

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.589 
average speeds and you can't I don't
expect<00:04:11.019> you<00:04:11.230> to<00:04:11.319> see<00:04:11.500> any<00:04:11.620> of<00:04:11.769> these<00:04:11.920> here<00:04:12.280> on

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
expect you to see any of these here on

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.199 
expect you to see any of these here on
my<00:04:13.599> older<00:04:13.989> mac<00:04:14.170> was<00:04:14.500> one<00:04:15.040> at<00:04:15.579> eighteen<00:04:15.939> point

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
my older mac was one at eighteen point

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.589 
my older mac was one at eighteen point
22<00:04:16.570> megabit<00:04:17.349> download<00:04:17.530> and<00:04:18.340> a<00:04:18.400> four<00:04:18.789> megabit

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:19.599 
22 megabit download and a four megabit

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:23.520 
22 megabit download and a four megabit
upload<00:04:20.109> so<00:04:20.769> it<00:04:21.160> was<00:04:21.780> this<00:04:22.780> is<00:04:22.930> almost<00:04:23.169> twice<00:04:23.410> as

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
upload so it was this is almost twice as

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.350 
upload so it was this is almost twice as
fast<00:04:23.949> on<00:04:24.220> the<00:04:24.340> download<00:04:24.789> although<00:04:25.210> the

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
fast on the download although the

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.350 
fast on the download although the
uploads<00:04:25.750> still<00:04:26.020> about<00:04:26.259> the<00:04:26.289> same<00:04:26.460> so<00:04:27.460> it's

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
uploads still about the same so it's

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.510 
uploads still about the same so it's
definitely<00:04:29.110> a<00:04:29.199> lot<00:04:29.380> faster<00:04:29.680> internet<00:04:30.340> wise

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
definitely a lot faster internet wise

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.029 
definitely a lot faster internet wise
and<00:04:31.419> you<00:04:31.479> can<00:04:31.630> see<00:04:31.780> I<00:04:31.810> got<00:04:32.050> some<00:04:32.229> really<00:04:32.620> crappy

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
and you can see I got some really crappy

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.100 
and you can see I got some really crappy
scores<00:04:33.639> here<00:04:33.940> I<00:04:34.000> mean<00:04:34.210> I<00:04:34.300> got<00:04:34.449> there's<00:04:34.930> some

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
scores here I mean I got there's some

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.980 
scores here I mean I got there's some
 ones<00:04:35.590> here<00:04:36.300> now<00:04:37.300> I<00:04:37.330> was<00:04:37.449> having<00:04:37.690> internet

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
 ones here now I was having internet

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.510 
 ones here now I was having internet
connection<00:04:38.440> problems<00:04:38.830> I<00:04:38.979> think<00:04:39.160> during<00:04:39.310> that

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
connection problems I think during that

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.659 
connection problems I think during that
time<00:04:39.789> but<00:04:40.630> that<00:04:41.590> was<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:41.889> best<00:04:42.130> score<00:04:42.759> was<00:04:43.060> the

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
time but that was the best score was the

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.710 
time but that was the best score was the
actually<00:04:45.669> the<00:04:45.729> best<00:04:45.880> score<00:04:46.210> I<00:04:46.240> ever<00:04:46.419> got<00:04:46.690> off

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
actually the best score I ever got off

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.310 
actually the best score I ever got off
the<00:04:47.080> other<00:04:47.199> mac<00:04:47.440> was<00:04:47.620> a<00:04:47.650> 22.5<00:04:48.490> 7<00:04:49.120> megabit<00:04:49.570> and<00:04:49.720> a

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
the other mac was a 22.5 7 megabit and a

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.850 
the other mac was a 22.5 7 megabit and a
4.8<00:04:51.099> for<00:04:51.460> megabit<00:04:52.289> so<00:04:53.289> that<00:04:53.470> was<00:04:53.590> pretty<00:04:53.740> good

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
4.8 for megabit so that was pretty good

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.360 
4.8 for megabit so that was pretty good
but<00:04:54.729> again<00:04:55.300> the<00:04:56.289> best<00:04:56.560> score<00:04:56.889> that<00:04:57.010> I<00:04:57.070> was<00:04:57.190> able

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
but again the best score that I was able

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.040 
but again the best score that I was able
to<00:04:57.490> get<00:04:57.669> out<00:04:57.820> that<00:04:57.849> one<00:04:58.270> is<00:04:59.430> definitely<00:05:01.050> almost

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
to get out that one is definitely almost

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.279 
to get out that one is definitely almost
twice<00:05:02.470> as<00:05:02.500> good<00:05:02.979> on<00:05:03.039> the<00:05:03.370> download<00:05:04.050> with<00:05:05.050> a<00:05:05.080> new

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
twice as good on the download with a new

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.210 
twice as good on the download with a new
one<00:05:05.500> so<00:05:06.010> anyway<00:05:06.940> that's<00:05:07.120> uh<00:05:07.889> those<00:05:08.889> are<00:05:09.070> some

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
one so anyway that's uh those are some

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.790 
one so anyway that's uh those are some
basic<00:05:09.550> tests<00:05:10.360> that<00:05:10.449> I've<00:05:10.570> run<00:05:10.810> so<00:05:11.110> far<00:05:11.349> just<00:05:11.620> to

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
basic tests that I've run so far just to

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.439 
basic tests that I've run so far just to
show<00:05:11.979> the<00:05:12.190> performance<00:05:12.340> difference<00:05:13.090> between

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
show the performance difference between

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.920 
show the performance difference between
the<00:05:13.570> two<00:05:13.780> systems<00:05:14.320> and<00:05:15.120> again<00:05:16.120> there's<00:05:16.570> not<00:05:16.870> a

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
the two systems and again there's not a

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.600 
the two systems and again there's not a
lot<00:05:17.229> of<00:05:17.260> change<00:05:17.680> here<00:05:18.099> between<00:05:18.280> the<00:05:19.180> old<00:05:20.610> snow

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
lot of change here between the old snow

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.700 
lot of change here between the old snow
leopard<00:05:22.030> and<00:05:22.620> this<00:05:23.620> mac<00:05:24.070> lion<00:05:25.110> there's<00:05:26.110> a<00:05:26.260> few

leopard and this mac lion there's a few

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.000 
leopard and this mac lion there's a few
little<00:05:26.979> minor<00:05:27.400> changes<00:05:28.030> when<00:05:28.210> it<00:05:28.300> comes<00:05:28.510> to

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
little minor changes when it comes to

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.430 
little minor changes when it comes to
navigating<00:05:30.010> around<00:05:30.520> in<00:05:31.389> your<00:05:31.449> pictures

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
navigating around in your pictures

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.320 
navigating around in your pictures
folder<00:05:32.710> your<00:05:33.039> music<00:05:33.400> folder<00:05:33.789> and<00:05:33.970> everything
