00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:16.390
 I guarantee you at any point 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.390
 everything just goes wrong 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:24.140
 and then you say that which is mine 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.880
 The End 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.880
 we have to leave immediately 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:38.220
 You can either accept it or you can 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.810
 go to work that will be my crew 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.120
 quite surprising and the nasa and 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:51.530
 the whole world 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:54.120
 but i still live a surprise 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.510
 the hook is it takes four years that 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.350
 reached me another mission and 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.390
 this station is designed for 31 days 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.689
 So I need water and food 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.770
 a planet on which nothing grows 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.970
 but if i can not make it the nasa 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.630
 It does not matter to contact 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.730
 more 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:16.210
 we received a video message 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:20.579
 my god is still alive here and i have 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:23.710
 still ask here you will learn a problem 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:26.109
 ok now through i have enough food for 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.939
 50 days will be long before we starve 

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:29.469
 can help him 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.550
 that means i have to deal with science 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.080
 out of the shit goal 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.120
 50 million miles away from 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.250
 home perfect investment grade 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.500
 I am the biggest botanist on this 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.880
 planet 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.930
 I never know who can save but we 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.040
 the hans need clever 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.870
 There is a high probability 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.480
 that a new book or a small one 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.740
 that six stars i set their lives 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:53.110
 not at stake this is more important than 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.110
 a person no it is not 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.510
 NASA had rejected the mission 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.990
 So when we do that, we talk about it 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.910
 mutiny if something goes wrong 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.390
 he knows how crazy this is 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.170
 is 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.170
 we have no other choice 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.500
 no matter what happens 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.560
 says the world 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.250
 says my family 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.940
 which I never stopped fighting for 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.940
 to come home 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.450
 The storm became more violent and we 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:57.650
 knew the missions were canceled 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:01.420
 but during the evacuation can 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.420
 astronaut markwort nee ums life
