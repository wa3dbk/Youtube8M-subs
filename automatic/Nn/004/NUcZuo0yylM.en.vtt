last thing is and as you'll see when I

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.170

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.050 
fan of big challengers but you know why
I<00:01:48.200> was<00:01:48.500> surprised<00:01:48.890> when<00:01:49.100> this<00:01:49.220> car<00:01:49.460> first<00:01:49.759> as

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
I was surprised when this car first as

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.309 
I was surprised when this car first as
we<00:01:50.270> go<00:01:50.420> off<00:01:50.569> ec<00:01:51.020> this<00:01:51.619> car<00:01:51.920> has<00:01:52.100> speed<00:01:53.200> left<00:01:54.200> a

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
we go off ec this car has speed left a

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:57.130 
we go off ec this car has speed left a
cloud<00:01:54.560> of<00:01:54.590> smoke<00:01:55.240> for<00:01:56.240> being<00:01:56.420> a<00:01:56.509> big<00:01:56.690> car<00:01:56.929> it

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
cloud of smoke for being a big car it

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.870 
cloud of smoke for being a big car it
actually<00:01:57.440> felt<00:01:57.679> pretty<00:01:57.740> light<00:01:58.159> I<00:01:58.190> have<00:01:58.640> no

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
actually felt pretty light I have no

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.760 
actually felt pretty light I have no
problems<00:01:59.330> with<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.690> handling<00:02:00.110> as<00:02:00.350> compared

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
problems with the handling as compared

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.380 
problems with the handling as compared
to<00:02:00.830> violently<00:02:01.220> I<00:02:01.280> thought<00:02:01.610> it<00:02:01.880> would<00:02:02.030> be<00:02:02.240> like

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
to violently I thought it would be like

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.380 
to violently I thought it would be like
the<00:02:02.600> Bentley<00:02:02.959> slow<00:02:03.740> to<00:02:03.799> turn<00:02:04.100> but<00:02:04.280> no<00:02:04.490> this<00:02:05.060> car

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
the Bentley slow to turn but no this car

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.300 
the Bentley slow to turn but no this car
you<00:02:05.869> put<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.140> gas<00:02:06.440> on<00:02:06.649> it<00:02:06.830> it<00:02:07.039> will<00:02:07.130> start

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
you put the gas on it it will start

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.279 
you put the gas on it it will start
drifting<00:02:07.610> and<00:02:08.060> it's<00:02:08.269> actually<00:02:08.569> a<00:02:08.600> lot<00:02:08.929> of<00:02:09.080> fun

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
drifting and it's actually a lot of fun

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.370 
drifting and it's actually a lot of fun
and<00:02:09.530> it's<00:02:10.190> not<00:02:10.340> that<00:02:10.489> hard<00:02:10.700> to<00:02:10.759> control<00:02:11.180> and<00:02:11.600> as

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
and it's not that hard to control and as

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.229 
and it's not that hard to control and as
you<00:02:12.500> see<00:02:12.650> here<00:02:12.950> I'm<00:02:13.160> already<00:02:13.459> taking<00:02:13.730> all<00:02:14.120> the

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
you see here I'm already taking all the

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.330 
you see here I'm already taking all the
lines<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.690> lot<00:02:15.019> quicker<00:02:15.319> than<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:16.010> Bentley<00:02:16.340> did

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
lines a lot quicker than the Bentley did

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.039 
lines a lot quicker than the Bentley did
style<00:02:19.340> wise<00:02:19.459> I<00:02:20.000> think<00:02:20.359> it<00:02:20.450> looks<00:02:20.630> pretty<00:02:20.720> good

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
style wise I think it looks pretty good

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.319 
style wise I think it looks pretty good
i<00:02:21.079> mean<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:22.160> rims<00:02:22.370> are<00:02:22.640> might<00:02:22.880> be<00:02:23.000> over<00:02:23.209> the

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
i mean the rims are might be over the

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:25.690 
i mean the rims are might be over the
top<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.870> kind<00:02:24.320> of<00:02:24.470> big<00:02:24.709> but<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.430> know<00:02:25.519> that's

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
top and kind of big but you know that's

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.220 
top and kind of big but you know that's
the<00:02:25.820> point<00:02:26.030> of<00:02:26.150> muscle<00:02:26.450> cars<00:02:26.690> are<00:02:26.840> supposed<00:02:27.170> to

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
the point of muscle cars are supposed to

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.140 
the point of muscle cars are supposed to
be<00:02:27.440> like<00:02:27.620> that<00:02:28.359> and<00:02:29.359> so<00:02:30.130> here<00:02:31.130> we<00:02:31.250> go<00:02:31.280> entering

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
be like that and so here we go entering

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.860 
be like that and so here we go entering
this<00:02:32.420> one

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.140 

knocked<00:02:37.590> over<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.950> cone<00:02:38.159> that<00:02:38.700> was<00:02:38.849> kind<00:02:39.090> of

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
knocked over the cone that was kind of

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.630 
knocked over the cone that was kind of
bad<00:02:39.330> turn<00:02:39.569> I<00:02:39.690> took<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:40.110> too<00:02:40.260> fast<00:02:40.500> but<00:02:40.950> actually

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
bad turn I took it too fast but actually

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.640 
bad turn I took it too fast but actually
I<00:02:41.700> felt<00:02:42.120> pretty<00:02:42.269> confident<00:02:42.780> driving<00:02:43.140> this<00:02:43.379> car

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
I felt pretty confident driving this car

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.100 
I felt pretty confident driving this car
which<00:02:43.830> is<00:02:43.860> something<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.640> thought<00:02:45.480> was<00:02:45.930> really

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
which is something I thought was really

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:54.950 
which is something I thought was really
cool<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:48.170> also<00:02:49.170> has<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.470> lot<00:02:49.709> of<00:02:49.739> speed

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.920
