 can affect valuable productivity 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.440
 and washing repeatedly introduces moisture that favors oxidation 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.009
 premature conjunction 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.529

 If your cabin is not new with this recent entry 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.670
 it is necessary to prepare the surface in the following way to be repeated alderman 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:51.189
 of compliance with the walls of the cabin should be removed the texture 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:52.569
 rough wall 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.259
 leaving quickly with 320 grit sandpaper 500 opté 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:02.879
 Ferrer removed dirt and dust caused by a listing a solution 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.769
 soft soap and a rag 1 / washington the floor to remove loose dirt 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.699
 rafi clean glass surfaces 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.759
 allow the wall of the floor windows to dry completely 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.379
 keep in mind that this could be the last cleaning and preparation cycle 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.059
 that will perform 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:26.189
 from now on the interior surfaces of your booth to paint

 can be fully protected with the 3m system traps dust now your cabin 

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:36.059
 to paint is ready to apply protective materials dust traps 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:38.469
 starting with the walls 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:40.409
 its installation will be easier 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:45.219
 If as many objects are removed as possible with air hose support 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:49.870
 for pistol and for hoses place the one of magnetic thinker only one wall 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.559
 of the cabin near the floor 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:54.179
 I pulled the material along the wall 

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:58.129
 figel material in the far corner and he and he eats it slowly 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:03.079
 I worked in the direction of the dispenser and limia and alice the film on the wall 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.839
 avoid intended for during installation especially if it is covered 

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:07.839
 a corner 

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:10.329
 cut the thinker's material 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.179
 made the final alignment adjustments 

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:17.039
 and alicia the material for the last time keep in mind that they can not be avoided 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.009
 all items but this will not affect the performance of the film 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:25.490
 you can think up and repeat the process for the second and third 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.879
 fed section 

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:30.180
 after fishing the new session with the current selection 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.199
 on average each one inch 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.280
 usually it is only necessary to add transactions to offer a 

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:41.360
 adequate protection the wall then used a counter to trim another 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.740
 of the windows and lights the cut-outs can be used to protect another 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.639
 part of the cabin including 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.330
 laporta around objects in the cabin and to cover the scales by the 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.970
 painting 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.500
 Be sure to straighten any loose ends the cut areas after 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.189
 complete the first couple 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:04.479
 repeat the process for the remaining wall now is the time for 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:09.929
 protect the monterde floor thought on the wall the closest still inactive 

00:05:09.929 --> 00:05:10.870
 of the material 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.969
 and if you get to the other extreme 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:17.439
 framing and alice material installed cuts the defense material doria is 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:18.629
 cover the corner 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:21.479
 make the final alignment adjustments 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:26.319
 and alice for the last time for the floor with short cross sections 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:29.379
 the thinker can be placed on a side wall 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:34.239
 As on the floor as shown I pulled the material to the length it is true that 

00:05:34.239 --> 00:05:38.059
 extend the material so that the next long floor session 

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:42.619
 cover the exams that says cover the area of ​​the ribs ensures the cut and 

00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:45.330
 alicia the material like this then 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.810
 apply the material in the last long design session 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.050
 after the pampa the previously installed actions in cross the final step is 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.920
 cover windows and lamps 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.440
 with transparent protective film and dust traps thinker cables the 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.580
 transparent protective film 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.969
 covers the edge of the spatula with the material traps dust 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:07.619
 this helps reduce the drag on the film 

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:10.279
 monterde thinker under it 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:15.289
 never above I'll go from the movie and cover the glass and that the movie in the 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:16.469
 upper part 

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:21.509
 and alice of the half to the sides I put a slight pressure at the beginning followed 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:25.449
 of more pressure to eliminate wrinkles the hamburg do not cut the part 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:29.709
 upper and lower sides the film can be installed in the 

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:31.860
 sector with an implement them 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.350
 or with a solution of water and isopropyl alcohol 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.190
 using a solution will facilitate the application 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.970
 When a solution is used the film may appear fogged by 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.020
 the humidity usually disappears completely 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.619
 after one to two baking cycles 

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:52.219
 your cabin to paint this one now protected with the 3m system to fraport 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.370
 the dust trap system will help you trap contaminants in the air 

00:06:58.059 --> 00:07:00.960
 and protect the fresh paint of society
