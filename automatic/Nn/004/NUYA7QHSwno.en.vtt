00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:14.280
 I am in agreement again today 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.500
 second calorie consumption 1 2 know that 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.949
 maybe the least and that is it 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.900
 is about the etf thermik effect of food 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.400
 You may notice when it comes to 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.170
 the metabolism is about the 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.719
 calorie consumption is going to be great then 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:36.180
 Often the word thermodynamics tomodynamic 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:38.940
 genesis what do i have to enter or what 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.969
 or happens because it is still 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.620
 A few things are called ours 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.210
 metabolism our body has to be yes 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.100
 our body on a particular 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.210
 body temperature hold somewhere 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.460
 in between, that he is fine that is 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.559
 Of course, always the loss of heat 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.469
 bz there is always one 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.620
 loss of heat or to an advertising campaign in 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.610
 some kind of thermic 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.049
 Effect now tells you how much calories 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.150
 consumed 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.280
 if we eat something so in the end 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.619
 it costs our calories 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.299
 costs to eat that at all 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.640
 body that processes that he 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.290
 energy from these nutrients or 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.380
 excuse them from outside 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.900
 pull out food that costs in 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.000
 in a certain way energy is not in a certain way 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.520
 wise that costs energy 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.430
 It is such that these thermal effects 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.520
 Food at for example calories from fat 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.650
 or when fat is two to three percent 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.259
 in carbohydrates this six to eight 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.920
 percent and in corn it is quite 20 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.689
 maybe up to 35 percent has one 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.850
 or others already noticed 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.110
 this thermal effects food senses 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.000
 you yourself if you go to 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.860
 i am very much in a big crowd 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.380
 Protein is a large amount of meat 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.200
 for example, for the meat eaters 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.360
 received accordingly among us iv 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.020
 which may even sweat a lot 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.510
 very fast 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.830
 or if you are very many cups 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.350
 that has quite a lot of stages 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.090
 bodybuilders after their match the 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.100
 then somewhere almost always in the almost 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.650
 seems to jump in and then 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.120
 what are purely then catch on 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.280
 a tip on alone by the 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.260
 carbs already because they are all this 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.760
 heat production no longer used 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:29.190
 So thermic effect are often natural 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.430
 you see a link under here again 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.420
 the whole a bit further 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.850
 that means we already have it 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:41.520
 two things our calorie consumption 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.780
 determine and one time just ours 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.030
 Body itself depends on 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.170
 body fat percentage genetics is with 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.320
 safety as well as the must 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.090
 genetics the muscle mass and so on 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.130
 clearly on what sport or just if 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.959
 are overweight which is always a 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.700
 all around in what has the 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.989
 Basic sales is not so I do not know if 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.250
 I said last time 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.110
 naturally hormonal things 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.459
 thyroid function over 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.780
 that is, thyroid hypofunction 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.790
 of course in this kilogram or 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.640
 body weight times 24 history not 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.920
 established that can not know you 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.360
 that needs the endocrinologist has the in 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.100
 be measured 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.750
 Of course this is the first of the first 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.880
 part of our pillar the first part of the 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.019
 calorie consumption second of the thermics 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:29.400
 effect of food as I said falls two to 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.890
 three percent karl 6 to 81 20 to 35 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.780
 percent 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.390
 that is, if we are accordingly 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.500
 our quirks of their substances are changing too 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:43.080
 example, too much protein on the 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.390
 body more energy these calories out 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.370
 another from the household 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.209
 to get out food 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:55.610
 again, for example, a reason why 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:58.250
 locally moderate fat and protein 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.320
 for example, work better because 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.080
 the deficit gets bigger because I just 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.670
 about the protein and the tf in certain 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.700
 have a bit more calories 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:14.000
 lose because of my calorie deficit 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:16.549
 higher is larger so that was part two 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.590
 No , I have one more thing 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.260
 Thermal effect is actually in the 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.910
 practice always somewhere between eight and 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.740
 ten percent 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.630
 It also likes digestive loss 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.730
 called completely no matter 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.620
 it is about the matter of the 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.260
 Things effect obhut normally 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.120
 is about eight to ten percent 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.400
 Of course, if you have low carbs 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.350
 has little fat but has just great 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.700
 super super much protein then it can 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.520
 Of course , that happen well 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.470
 these ten are usually added 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.260
 one actually has such a mixed diet 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.590
 always eight to ten percent 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:54.370
 That was part of two calorie consumption 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.370
 need us again next time
