00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.820
 channel and today I would like to announce 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.920
 the beginning of a new rubric on our channel in 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.650
 which were themselves watching Easter eggs and 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.839
 various secrets of games for pilot 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.520
 video i chose a toy borderlands 2 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.320
 outside we'll see a few 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.510
 easter eggs and if this rubric takes root 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.390
 that match I will do more 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.250
 video about the same collection garland itself and there 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.130
 yes and let's move on to other games 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.070
 Well let's go first for Easter eggs 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.170
 located in caustic caves after 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.880
 how do you beat the blue cross lizka 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.370
 his darling is on the left 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.469
 losers will need to move in 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.550
 direction tree tree was serve 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.590
 your guideline 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.120
 need to run across this lake 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.650
 incomprehensible green slurry which is very 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.440
 very very . 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.870
 But itâ€™s the same that hides the first from us. 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.480
 easter eggs for today the most important thing is 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.660
 interferes clearly right neither right nor left 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.990
 because there is a chance that you just 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.000
 die immediately without spending a life on it 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.710
 island sit nobody else like a knight 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.780
 Soler from dark souls 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.420
 it's not clear what he forgot in the world 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.250
 borderlands can't talk at all 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.730
 our attempts to talk to her about just 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.730
 laughs 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.850
 after you talk or rather 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.680
 laugh with the knight of salt ram 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.050
 such a white phantom appears 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.540
 who personifies the player in dark souls 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.729
 look at nothing but bonfire 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.210
 here it is presented exactly the same in dark 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.360
 souls 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.010
 that is, the sword in one you in the fire we can 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.520
 of course still try to talk to 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.920
 by the lake being in a position above top 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.800
 but nothing comes of it 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.170
 soria continues on 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.850
 they just giggle can question about 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.310
 interact with to astrologers no 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.240
 gave nothing with time by the way whites 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.970
 want it disappears 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.220
 such a paschalochka following jumped 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.130
 today is also in the children's cave 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.200
 but before it will need to run a little further 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.369
 need will be approaching danger 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:14.000
 which hope and get to the very 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.810
 edges to the very end of this location this is 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.190
 will wait for us 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.190
 very interesting easter eggs 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:58.740
 in this place you need to be jump over 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:02.000
 block and what awaits us and waiting for you here 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.730
 Minecraft cubes mined easter eggs 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.440
 I know only the laziest, I am sincere and 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.590
 I wanted to find her for a long time 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.020
 but I could not but finally 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.680
 I got it Lomaeva 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:19.970
 You have these cuticles broke easily these already 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.490
 break much harder but still later 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.280
 blood, we make our way as if to find 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.110
 here the creeper battle with them is necessary 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.660
 be very neat these crackers 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.030
 illogical creeper minecraft that is they 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.030
 approach you starts to sizzle and 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.580
 explode scripters gets pretty 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.239
 valuable cartoss modifications come out on 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.880
 appearance 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.430
 and also there is a chance that with arms 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.680
 of minecraft also need to be extremely 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.810
 attentive now panicked 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.550
 especially warming which drove its world 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.200
 trap 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.540
 We see him bombanulo due to the fact that I 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.870
 didn't listen or did he account us for that 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.480
 the light here is the action live weapon of 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.910
 minecraft which shoots a kind 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.430
 by 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.070
 we decided now I would not raise but 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.880
 later I came back for him also here 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.890
 have them say so on tape 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.890
 which first tried to break it then 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.200
 take this iridium cube from him 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.720
 matched my you get and 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.360
 ready to shoot as far as I can remember 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.000
 assembled five pieces or six pieces 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.890
 Erin Dedok I made my way thought there was something 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.470
 there let me demons 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.180
 let you see what i have there 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.280
 punched actually thought that here 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.110
 will be the continuation of the cave take here 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.280
 the cave is over it makes sense to break at 3 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.040
 yellow shabby gold 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.530
 with them falling money but the money falls to 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.660
 so much so that you can time for them 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.150
 in general, and we spend the most important thing 10 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.010
 learn go to the cube and pray and 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.080
 hope that you will fall 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.170
 slime or clean can fall out like 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.150
 look and iridium I was lucky I fell 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:00.660
 quite a large number of leride I and 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:03.940
 on this I decided to return to the guns and 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:08.200
 inspect and closer I was lucky for bob 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.220
 turned out to be a minecraft weapon 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:14.370
 was not to miss 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:19.990
 Now I choose a long search 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:23.850
 put on take care of their own weapons and here 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.850
 so that 's it and she shoots 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:33.080
 ricochet very good ricochet weapons 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:36.150
 which will help you in a difficult struggle 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.840
 world of the borderlands and after reloading 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.910
