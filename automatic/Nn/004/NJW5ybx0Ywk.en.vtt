people<00:01:47.790> everything<00:01:48.509> turned<00:01:49.380> around<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.950> it

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
people everything turned around and it

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.800 
people everything turned around and it
all<00:01:50.220> began<00:01:50.430> with<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.030> book<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.540> know<00:01:51.600> that

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
all began with that book I know that

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.319 
all began with that book I know that
sounds<00:01:52.079> like<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.200> big<00:01:52.439> claim<00:01:52.860> but<00:01:53.759> if<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.119> wasn't

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
sounds like a big claim but if it wasn't

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.030 
sounds like a big claim but if it wasn't
for<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.689> science<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.079> getting<00:01:55.200> rich<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.710> would

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
for the science of getting rich I would

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.100 
for the science of getting rich I would
not<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.340> gone<00:01:56.820> through<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.270> transformation

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
not have gone through the transformation

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.700 
not have gone through the transformation
that<00:01:58.320> i<00:01:58.500> did<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.360> i<00:02:00.360> know<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.530> what
