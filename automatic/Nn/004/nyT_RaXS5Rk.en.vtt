 horse chestnuts we have 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.230

 category it's true we know them 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.010
 still relatively well in this 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.550
 category and it's a lot anyway from 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.149
 quality of which we should from the east 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.579
 quarterly in 5 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.079

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.780

 the 5 very good the 7 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.520
 hugh orde of beauvoisin 14 to in that 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.340
 sax leucate conrad fredrik on the 13th 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.190
 joker stirk the 3 unite of guez and 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.899
 finally the 1 church orione is very very 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.610
 strong because on the sheet I have 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.940
 prepared for the number two I the 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.219
 called maga while it's mana and 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.420
 you are not deceived 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:08.640
 number two number two led 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.869
 the inter know them well treat them 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.340
 because I would have fallen into the 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.070
 trap but directly which precisely this 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.909
 number 2 traveling man 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.030
 impressive during his debut at 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.189
 vincennes since ben go it's a 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.740
 master stroke victory in a quinté + 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.290
 5 5 it was a price guy lux had 2700 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.520
 meters there his 2100 it was a stranger 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.049
 it should not bother him 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.790
 yes but it's true that he was starting to 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.740
 vincennes in addition to 10 years so we 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.259
 was not very confident before the shot 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.770
 and he really has to win this 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.909
 race 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.430
 so it's a horse that still has 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.310
 placed big bread in his country Sweden 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.259
 so a speed horse obviously he 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.040
 prevailed on the 2700 meters 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.780
 a priori nothing goes against the fact 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.090
 that they can do the 2100 it's 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.950
 that he has a good number and more associated 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.520
 with a man in great shape well 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.100
 to the group 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.110
 it's a bit of a scarecrow of the race 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.290
 so for I did not invent anything to put it 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.070
 on your mind 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.909
 we still have the feeling that 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.590
 could double the stake 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.649
 on occasion it lights up wanted 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.690
 contrast however number 5 very good 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.780
 confirmed to vincennes second of the price 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.220
 jean rené gougeon late january good on 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.750
 this race there they come down category 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.849
 that makes sense the whole place in 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.250
 opposition it's true no more I have 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.970
 really took the price line guy lux 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.090
 one but five first clashed 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.560
 that day there very beautiful he had delayed 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.489
 to be able to speak last 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.190
 so it's true we still had 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.349
 noticed his end of race before that you 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.920
 the 10 ranked second of hindi plays 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.780
 on this course he was walking an 11.8 there 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.120
 a priori the body was to create a 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.590
 against them said here it is that it 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.819
 attracted the number 5 which is a very good 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.220
 number at the autostart 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.989
 it seems to be a solid foundation this is the 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.209
 confidence in third position 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.099
 number 7 of beauvoisin butter that has 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.100
 pleased us by winning at the same 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.690
 level 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.030
 in the mid- granville price 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.440
 january it was 2500 meters there its 2100 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.150
 meters but before giving you the 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.920
 say we will find at the top the account 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.270
 and especially alexandre abrivard who will 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.710
 tell us about the chances of this number 7 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.520
 hugh orde beauvoisin is the moment 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.870
 of our mini field we listen to them 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.340
 alexandre is the partner of the gore 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.720
 or Beauvoisin en quinté from Thursday to 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.000
 vincennes number 7 is that what you 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.090
 satisfied it's a little bit largely 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.920
 good draw we will take our 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.660
 revenge on traveling man but hey I 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.890
 do not think about the days before the mans very 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.690
 well but mid May with a departure and 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.360
 in a race he will be in the same 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.680
 town 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.850
 but to approach difficult despite that 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.070
 the 2100 it can benefit him 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.740
 yes this summer he did it very well 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.200
 give me on a speed course 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:46.370
 it's better or worse than the big 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.760
 distance this is a little bit my 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.950
 question 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.270
 returning to 2100 meters that 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.730
 it's worrying for Alexandre abrivard 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.560
 no for you either no I do not think so 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.630
 in addition I noticed that déferré of 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.200
 later on 2100 meters he ran 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.390
 twice he was 2nd and 3rd then 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.680
 alexander nothing to say it indeed he 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.480
 think he's going to be in the right 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.220
 combination would be that on its two 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.730
 last races anyway it was 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.900
 very well take revenge on very 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.670
 bling man it's true that it seems 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.609
 complicated especially that he has the number 7 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.890
 outermost days but in all 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.019
 case it's a pretty solid foundation too 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.610
 it is clear in 4th position we will pass 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.840
 a little bit of poker especially by his 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.960
 number behind the car on the 14th 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.880
 terrific size figo sax who owns 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.270
 titles at this level even in the second 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.130
 line 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.419
 you have to keep it for yourself, I think 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.370
 that it must be kept where he still 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.020
 shown a very beautiful regularity this 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.940
 winter 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.290
 it's true that ultimately in the 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.850
 price guy lux again he was 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.970
 galloped after he had left 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.080
 still a lot of regrets he does 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.880
 so much evidence of a good regularity 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.650
 that for me he would have deserved anyway 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.660
 won a race it's true that suddenly 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.260
 there is the disadvantage of having this number 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.630
 14 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.710
 it's clear but good with franck ouvrie 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.419
 it should be fine 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.460
 a good race course and will be 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.590
 the finish and finally the number 4 conrad 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.919
 fredericks fifth of the jean rené prize 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.720
 gougeon 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.890
 so it's a horse that's not all 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.870
 the days but who owns 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.270
 undeniable means a good number 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.410
 in the car if the horse makes his 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.090
 race he has every right to enter 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.640
 in the five here is quite suspect 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.870
 on this course the same last 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.240
 he really delayed a power 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.510
 to express himself it was very good he has a good 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.040
 number 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.050
 basel it's a horse that I'm that 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.630
 I like it so it's true that 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.030
 the device or hold it ben 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.580
 understood I really put the line of 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.530
 price of luxury bidding why withdrawal 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.120
 look for something else but we'll get you 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.590
 trust as usual good 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.050
 that she tell you the quinté more 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.080
 the 5 5 in 5 see them in style we will do 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.720
 attention number 13 joker stoxx I think 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.770
 that everything is said or almost 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.280
 send enough foundation this bike to 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.570
