00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.635
Diablo was defeated.

00:00:29.975 --> 00:00:31.485
For a time, it seemed

00:00:32.605 --> 00:00:34.755
we would know peace.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.280
But it was not to be.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.020
For Diablo's essence lingers in the black soulstone.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.560
I can not destroy the stone.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.680
Nor allow it's evil to remain within the heavens.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.400
And so it must be hidden.

00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:00.035
Even from the angels.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.540
I pray

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.060
that it will be

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.140
enough.

00:01:40.925 --> 00:01:42.995
You have done well, Horadrim.

00:01:44.095 --> 00:01:46.475
Your service here is finished.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.840
You should all-

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.060
run.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Malthael.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.140
Go.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.740
Go!

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.060
Find the Nephalem!

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.720
Brother...

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.840
Why?...

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.020
The Nephalem

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.160
will

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.160
stop you.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.960
No one

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.820
can stop

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:59.720
death.
