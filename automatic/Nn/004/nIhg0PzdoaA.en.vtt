00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.160
 I will show you the procedure to make this store 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.890
 with the cloisonné and porcelain black 157 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.570
 and the colors apply a mattress you can work on this support 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:14.479
 enamelled like this 

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:17.210
 from china to china 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.210
 the important thing is to have a very clean and dry support 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.210
 with which product 2 going to work 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.520
 and well at first with the fleeting felt 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.159
 who's facing him at the om 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:33.160
 then we will trace 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
 with the cloisonné porcelaine 105 45 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.870
 and then we do not use the colors applied with the brush 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.480
 in these spaces 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.760
 the cloisonné 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.760
 so he is equipped but a cannula 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.670
 before starting on the chat is always this is an essay 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.130
 here 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.450
 on a paper 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.450
 an employee who refines regular 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.640
 then beating the drying half an hour 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.640
 before applying inside surfaces defined 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.080
 smart always first and the colors but never the rescuers of samu 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.159
 under help created cuts 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.020
 but then to the ps that spirits with us 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.020
 during the application 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.570
 see you have such a color palette that 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.690
 inzaghi apply here we will fill 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.550
 the space is finished 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.370
 I go to the next color 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.110
 hoyer that does not draw too much on the color that poses but as long as I charge in 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.720
 colors 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.710
 so it's important to work 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.340
 roughly on the same horizontal surface like that that's why 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.720
 what do we do if I turn my store is what turns it a lot 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.589
 the colors of yesteryear but because I was heavily loaded 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:29.599
 now 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.809
 this tender green twenty-four drying 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:35.779
 now my colors are dry 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:38.779
 I will be able to make clear even 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.630
 he returns but ps in the fiery 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.199
 and I think to put an end to even fake 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:52.339
 to properly check the temperature why 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:54.979
 it's the temperature of surrounding me too high 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:56.909
 the colors may change 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.769
 if for example the temperature and both are 50 degrees free 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.309
 they will be at least two dishwasher-safe once the 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.989
 temperature will be stable it counts not five minutes 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.769
 but we have traits 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.339
 I can use it 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:13.790
 and microwave pastel
