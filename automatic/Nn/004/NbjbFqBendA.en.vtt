00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
for so you're going to mix this all

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.450 
for so you're going to mix this all
together<00:01:57.330> so<00:01:58.330> as<00:01:58.600> you<00:01:58.750> can<00:01:58.840> see<00:01:58.900> this<00:01:59.259> is<00:01:59.470> still

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
together so as you can see this is still

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.280 
together so as you can see this is still
not<00:02:00.700> totally<00:02:00.940> coming<00:02:01.330> together<00:02:01.540> which<00:02:01.960> is<00:02:02.110> why

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
not totally coming together which is why

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:10.490 
not totally coming together which is why
I<00:02:02.650> usually<00:02:03.220> an<00:02:03.310> add<00:02:03.460> an<00:02:03.640> egg<00:02:03.850> is<00:02:04.060> a<00:02:04.090> nice<00:02:04.300> binder

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.660 

so<00:02:11.500> you're<00:02:11.620> going<00:02:11.739> to<00:02:11.770> just<00:02:11.830> stir<00:02:12.250> that<00:02:12.280> in
