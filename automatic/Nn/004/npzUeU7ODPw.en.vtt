00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 For all mafia genre fans is definitely 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.270
 listen up then after a 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.220
 series sons of anarchy or sopranos 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.660
 So a new one comes out of this one 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.820
 home netflix is ​​once again with 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.160
 mafia structures and drugs busy 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.160
 and that's about kos now 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.100
 Imagine they are coming out 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.910
 poor relations born in one 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.380
 poor city in a poor country at 28 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.100
 you have so much money that it is not 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.100
 can count once 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:49.920
 but I do not want anything in advance I am 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:54.540
 Steve Nash the drug enforcement agency 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.540
 In 1979 , the bad guys were hunting live 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.820
 when I started the ea was the 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.860
 Fund of a kilo of grass already a reason 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.330
 to celebrate 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.930
 suddenly we seized on one 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.450
 day 60 kilo cocaine and the place of 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.920
 hippies fanny columbianer kicked and 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.420
 drugs no flip flops nor did we know 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.750
 not that we witness the founding of the 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.460
 notorious medicine cartel was there 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:27.550
 also very regular sascha ditsch brothers 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.409
 and last but not least pablo escobar 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.730
 suddenly the narcos deserve 5 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.100
 billion dollars a year 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.100
 and america could not do that 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:45.820
 whatever sent here 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:48.369
 I'm always there, I hope you know 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:53.189
 What that means in the war is good and evil 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.189
 question that was my war 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.040
 her party has received money from asco 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.160
 have accepted money 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.420
 By the way, the American is 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.520
 when i get one out of the world after it 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.020
 then learned that life 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.020
 more complicated than you think 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.120
 we had no idea what we were talking about 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.120
 had been admitted 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.920
 markus kopp with ten followers has about 50 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.350
 minutes longer since 28 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.760
 august 2015 netflix look at 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.140
 Age approval is unknown 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.510
 but I would also type something like that 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.580
 the fsk 16 or maybe even 18 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.870
 some follow are relatively essex let 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.760
 but above all, violent 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.850
 but he has fsk 16 to classify and 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.380
 nahkauf deals with the 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.060
 drugbaron finally pablo escobar 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.340
 his handlers around the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.320
 media group quasi the media cartel 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.270
 but from the moment he is himself 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.040
 televisions and grass are still starting 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.240
 Smuggle smaller things and first 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.160
 this is brought to the funnel 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.840
 Cocaine is definitely a product on the market 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.459
 have asked the world market and always with 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.690
 can rake a lot of money and mad 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.500
 that would be alone in the first one 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.580
 follow clearly 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.290
 and I think that's nice too 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.760
 does not get in a train in the middle 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.860
 inside, where everybody is on 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.300
 your peak of being no here is that 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.310
 pablo escobar even if you are with 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.540
 discovered that one may witness in the 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.950
 You also realize that he is not just one 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.020
 businessman but that he too at 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.400
 the population gradually something 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.320
 must go again and be celebrated 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.910
 he himself even tried as 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.320
 candidate for colombia 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.880
 then it's on the other side 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.470
 Of course, this story is not 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.670
 that is why they are glorifying 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.769
 but still, that was certain 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.540
 fascination for the evil organized 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.459
 crime causes the other 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.650
 story of a conductor played by 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.660
 board mr brok at the end of the 70s 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.190
 the beginning of the 80s in miami just 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.080
 against drug use and against 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.180
 At that time one has rather drug-tolerant means 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.590
 surfer boys in miami hunted in flipflops 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.030
 but he had to run too 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.070
 realize that with the introduction of 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.600
 Cocaine specifically in Miami at once 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.700
 everything gets a lot more violent because 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.170
 where more money in circulation is that 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.850
 gladly ready to go further and 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.040
 forgetting human limitations and 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.420
 this results in a series after anna kos 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.310
 after a series the sopranos 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.050
 forest paths breaking bad or above all 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.430
 on sand on energy back into this 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.019
 I stuck it in. I love that 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.300
 smartphone genre in addition to these series in 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.250
 film like casinos goodfellas godfather 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.930
 trilogy or many others one man 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.489
 ever enjoy over and over again 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.169
 may or even series boardwalk empire 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.669
 So she was there about this 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.830
 again finds the area could with 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.269
 nacorde have great pleasure with and that 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.100
 is a very important factor for me 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.810
 I was incredibly critical of that 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.370
 Regard if this series so a bit 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.080
 succinctly comes therefore and whether they are right in 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.850
 the full ones go from the first episode 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.400
 you realize that this series no 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.889
 captives make that beautiful 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.270
 then you would often be 345 in series 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.830
 to come in weeks and the 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.150
 you have to understand whole figures 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.710
 almost croos after the first episode 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.720
 already the feeling yes that's what for me 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.400
 or honest and I do not say that it 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.229
 the best series is this time in 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.669
 this area is in any case 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.650
 her incredibly strong game is coming too 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.139
 at the moment with pure sound therefore where one 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.850
 quasi spanish spoken or headlined 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.800
 passages have a little bit of everything 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.240
 makes it look more authentic and it is 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.039
 above all, the mother dare to do so 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.660
 brazilian megastars that creates 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.340
 this pablo escobar was easy then 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.050
 to look fixedly looks at the one 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.560
 subtle but almost a little bit of fear and 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.270
 is afraid 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.830
 and Markus is a series where I 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.810
 hope that there is a continuation because 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.000
 It is fine because it is elaborate 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.830
 done that I know, above all, very 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.449
 gloomy look at some moments throws 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.190
 that also creates evil figures 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:16.880
 nice to draw because so is the 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.320
 world 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.630
 she just does not always let herself 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.460
 in good and bad part and right there must 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.380
 then land a good mafia format 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.970
 and that's why I think it's very cool or 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.470
 definitive recommendation from me serie 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.630
 against it with me no points evaluation 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.370
 but still one here anyway 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.599
 recommendation and thus can 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.190
 I just say thank you for that 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:35.990
 Turn on in this review and read 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.370
 like a thumb there if you like this video 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.500
 Let's not let it stay 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.180
 otherwise that you know there is still one 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.160
 few left around me and tomorrow at 15 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.169
 Watch, of course, at the latest a new video 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:49.690
 and by then I hope again 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:49.690
 with of course on the 3rd
