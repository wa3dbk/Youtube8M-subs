park<00:00:35.020> the<00:00:35.170> tanker<00:00:35.590> somewhere<00:00:35.980> and<00:00:36.219> be<00:00:36.850> like

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
park the tanker somewhere and be like

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.200 
park the tanker somewhere and be like
okay<00:00:38.469> uh<00:00:38.770> who'd<00:00:39.100> like<00:00:39.280> to<00:00:39.309> buy<00:00:39.489> this<00:00:39.550> oil<00:00:39.820> going

once<00:00:40.390> going<00:00:40.899> twice<00:00:41.019> I<00:00:41.620> guess<00:00:42.039> it's<00:00:42.309> gonna

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:42.609 
once going twice I guess it's gonna
