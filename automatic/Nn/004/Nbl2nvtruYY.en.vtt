reverse thing I'm going to start on the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.450 
reverse thing I'm going to start on the
second<00:00:42.390> note<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.690> pattern<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.500> then<00:00:44.250> hit

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
second note of the pattern and then hit

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.590 
second note of the pattern and then hit
the<00:00:44.550> open<00:00:44.670> string<00:00:46.370> groups<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.550> two<00:00:47.730> here<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.480> my

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600

next group of 2 i'm going to hit the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.790 
next group of 2 i'm going to hit the
third<00:00:50.190> fret<00:00:50.550> then<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.780> second<00:00:52.140> friends<00:00:52.559> you

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
that now let's turn around to do it

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.110 
that now let's turn around to do it
backwards<00:01:24.100> so<00:01:24.400> let's<00:01:24.550> start<00:01:24.760> on<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:24.940> higher

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
backwards so let's start on the higher

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:38.520 
backwards so let's start on the higher
strings<00:01:25.510> and<00:01:25.780> go<00:01:25.840> backwards

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.390

okay want to be able to play scales
forwards<00:01:55.329> and<00:01:55.450> backwards<00:01:55.659> inside<00:01:56.350> now<00:01:56.619> at<00:01:56.799> any

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
forwards and backwards inside now at any

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.529 
forwards and backwards inside now at any
different<00:01:57.340> direction<00:01:57.640> any<00:01:57.939> different<00:01:58.359> move

let's start on the second note of the

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:23.559 
let's start on the second note of the
pattern<00:02:58.980> from<00:02:59.129> where<00:02:59.340> you<00:02:59.400> originally<00:02:59.790> were

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.020 

you

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.000 

there<00:03:28.480> you<00:03:28.569> go<00:03:28.720> takes<00:03:29.380> a<00:03:29.500> little<00:03:29.620> getting<00:03:29.740> used

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
there you go takes a little getting used

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.470 
there you go takes a little getting used
to<00:03:30.130> it's<00:03:30.550> going<00:03:30.700> to<00:03:30.790> take<00:03:30.940> you<00:03:31.060> a<00:03:31.090> while<00:03:31.209> to<00:03:31.270> get

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
to it's going to take you a while to get

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.850 
to it's going to take you a while to get
it<00:03:31.630> right<00:03:31.810> and<00:03:31.990> to<00:03:32.080> get<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:32.350> up<00:03:32.440> to<00:03:32.470> speed<00:03:32.590> but

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
it right and to get it up to speed but

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.559 
it right and to get it up to speed but
eventually<00:03:33.580> it<00:03:33.880> becomes<00:03:34.120> second<00:03:34.540> nature

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
eventually it becomes second nature

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.750 
eventually it becomes second nature
these<00:03:35.500> are<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.740> kind<00:03:35.980> of<00:03:36.040> things<00:03:36.100> you<00:03:36.370> can<00:03:36.520> sit

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
these are the kind of things you can sit

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.160 
these are the kind of things you can sit
there<00:03:36.790> watching<00:03:37.150> a<00:03:37.360> movie<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:37.780> doing<00:03:37.930> this

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
there watching a movie and doing this

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.860 
there watching a movie and doing this
stuff<00:03:38.470> and<00:03:38.709> it<00:03:39.610> just<00:03:39.640> it'll<00:03:40.300> just<00:03:40.540> start<00:03:40.690> to

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
stuff and it just it'll just start to

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.360 
stuff and it just it'll just start to
flow<00:03:41.200> after<00:03:41.440> you've<00:03:41.680> worked<00:03:41.800> on<00:03:42.040> it<00:03:42.160> for<00:03:42.190> a

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
flow after you've worked on it for a

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.840 
flow after you've worked on it for a
while<00:03:42.840> okay<00:03:43.840> exercise<00:03:44.380> 3<00:03:44.550> we're<00:03:45.550> going<00:03:45.730> to

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
while okay exercise 3 we're going to

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.850 
while okay exercise 3 we're going to
play<00:03:46.060> groups<00:03:46.690> of<00:03:46.870> five<00:03:47.140> this<00:03:47.560> is<00:03:47.680> where<00:03:47.800> it

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
play groups of five this is where it

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.110 
play groups of five this is where it
starts<00:03:48.069> to<00:03:48.100> get<00:03:48.250> tricky<00:03:48.640> but<00:03:48.790> hopefully

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
starts to get tricky but hopefully

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.479 
starts to get tricky but hopefully
you'll<00:03:49.330> be<00:03:49.840> excited<00:03:50.170> by<00:03:50.410> the<00:03:50.470> challenge<00:03:50.590> I'm

play<00:03:53.110> up<00:03:53.319> five<00:03:53.739> notes

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:13.410 

you

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:36.250 

you<00:04:14.420> want<00:04:14.570> to<00:04:14.630> play<00:04:14.720> it<00:04:14.750> backwards<00:04:34.870> this<00:04:35.870> five

you want to play it backwards this five
grouping<00:04:36.920> really<00:04:37.250> gets<00:04:37.430> a<00:04:37.520> little<00:04:37.640> bit<00:04:37.820> tricky

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
grouping really gets a little bit tricky

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.640 
grouping really gets a little bit tricky
sometimes<00:04:38.450> if<00:04:38.840> I<00:04:38.930> haven't<00:04:39.200> been<00:04:39.260> doing<00:04:39.380> it<00:04:39.560> for

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
sometimes if I haven't been doing it for

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.500 
sometimes if I haven't been doing it for
a<00:04:39.680> while<00:04:39.770> it<00:04:39.920> really<00:04:40.100> messes<00:04:40.310> me<00:04:40.550> up<00:04:40.580> to<00:04:40.910> but

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
a while it really messes me up to but

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.450 
a while it really messes me up to but
once<00:04:41.690> you<00:04:41.810> get<00:04:41.930> the<00:04:42.110> flow<00:04:42.350> of<00:04:42.380> it<00:04:42.590> it<00:04:42.800> goes<00:04:43.040> all

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
once you get the flow of it it goes all

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.370 
once you get the flow of it it goes all
right<00:04:43.520> and<00:04:43.820> there's<00:04:44.360> times<00:04:44.900> when<00:04:45.260> you're

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
right and there's times when you're

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.690 
right and there's times when you're
playing<00:04:45.560> lead<00:04:45.740> guitar<00:04:45.770> when<00:04:46.190> the<00:04:46.280> group<00:04:46.550> of

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
playing lead guitar when the group of

playing lead guitar when the group of
five<00:04:46.970> has<00:04:47.300> a<00:04:47.330> very<00:04:47.660> cool<00:04:47.990> sound<00:04:48.380> to<00:04:48.620> it<00:04:48.650> so<00:04:48.980> you

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
five has a very cool sound to it so you

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.560 
five has a very cool sound to it so you
want<00:04:49.310> to<00:04:49.400> get<00:04:49.580> this<00:04:49.700> kind<00:04:49.910> of<00:04:49.970> thing<00:04:50.120> going<00:04:50.390> all

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
want to get this kind of thing going all

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.180 
want to get this kind of thing going all
right<00:04:50.720> there<00:04:51.290> we<00:04:51.380> go<00:04:51.500> there's<00:04:51.710> those<00:04:51.920> three
