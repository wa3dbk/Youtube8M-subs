00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
see how far along it's come since the

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:32.160 
see how far along it's come since the
beginning<00:02:58.090> of<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.330> month

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.000 

it<00:03:32.620> seems<00:03:33.099> to<00:03:33.340> have<00:03:33.520> grown<00:03:33.940> um<00:03:34.599> a<00:03:35.080> fourth<00:03:35.709> of<00:03:35.890> an

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
it seems to have grown um a fourth of an

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.940 
it seems to have grown um a fourth of an
inch<00:03:36.280> since<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:37.000> beginning<00:03:37.330> of<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:37.540> month<00:03:37.810> so

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.250 

so<00:03:41.950> now<00:03:42.220> if<00:03:42.520> four<00:03:43.090> inches<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:43.720> a<00:03:44.050> fourth<00:03:44.790> ok

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
so now if four inches and a fourth ok

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.840
