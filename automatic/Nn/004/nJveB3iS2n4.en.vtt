00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
your battle style as we all know battle

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.650 
your battle style as we all know battle
type<00:00:14.309> limits<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.730> only<00:00:15.000> doing<00:00:15.360> one<00:00:15.630> thing

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
type limits you to only doing one thing

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.260 
type limits you to only doing one thing
whether<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.680> being<00:00:16.859> awakening<00:00:17.460> ultimate<00:00:18.150> or

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
whether it being awakening ultimate or

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.090 
whether it being awakening ultimate or
drive<00:00:18.660> type<00:00:18.930> all<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.439> them<00:00:19.560> have<00:00:19.740> their<00:00:19.890> pros

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
drive type all of them have their pros

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.189 
drive type all of them have their pros
and<00:00:20.160> cons<00:00:20.609> so<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.539> kind<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.779> puts<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:22.080> a

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
and cons so it kind of puts you on a

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.990 
and cons so it kind of puts you on a
spot<00:00:22.470> on<00:00:22.619> which<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:22.920> want<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.130> choose<00:00:23.340> being

spot on which you want to choose being

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000 
spot on which you want to choose being
restricted<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.600> only<00:00:24.630> doing<00:00:25.050> one<00:00:25.260> thing<00:00:25.289> will

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
restricted to only doing one thing will

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.470 
restricted to only doing one thing will
change<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.519> way<00:00:26.640> how<00:00:26.789> we<00:00:26.849> play<00:00:27.210> naruto

forever<00:00:28.260> now<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.740> know<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:29.070> there<00:00:29.220> are<00:00:29.250> some

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
forever now I know that there are some

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.040 
forever now I know that there are some
of<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.580> saying<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.269> drive<00:00:30.510> type<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.990> the

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
of you saying that the drive type is the

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.170 
of you saying that the drive type is the
most<00:00:31.439> powerful<00:00:31.769> style<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.460> maybe<00:00:32.969> you're

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
most powerful style and maybe you're

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.030 
most powerful style and maybe you're
right<00:00:33.360> but<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:34.140> got<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.290> keep<00:00:34.380> in<00:00:34.590> mind<00:00:34.620> what

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
right but you got to keep in mind what

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.740 
right but you got to keep in mind what
the<00:00:35.100> ultimate<00:00:35.340> type<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:35.969> awakening<00:00:36.510> types

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
the ultimate type and awakening types

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.660 
the ultimate type and awakening types
can<00:00:36.960> do<00:00:37.140> for<00:00:37.649> example<00:00:38.160> when<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.399> use<00:00:38.520> your

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
can do for example when you use your

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.639 
can do for example when you use your
team<00:00:38.850> ultimate<00:00:39.270> now<00:00:39.660> your<00:00:39.870> support<00:00:40.260> runs<00:00:40.469> out

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
team ultimate now your support runs out

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.740 
team ultimate now your support runs out
first<00:00:40.920> instead<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.460> all<00:00:41.700> free<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.000> them<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.690> you

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
first instead of all free of them so you

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.900 
first instead of all free of them so you
have<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.440> second<00:00:44.040> chance<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.370> connect<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.789> or

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
have a second chance to connect it or

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.299 
have a second chance to connect it or
maybe<00:00:45.239> even<00:00:45.390> perhaps<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.960> third<00:00:46.170> chance<00:00:46.440> not<00:00:47.160> to

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
maybe even perhaps a third chance not to

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.500 
maybe even perhaps a third chance not to
mention<00:00:47.460> about<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> first<00:00:47.969> one<00:00:48.149> can<00:00:48.390> break

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
mention about the first one can break

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.060 
mention about the first one can break
your<00:00:48.660> guard<00:00:48.870> leaving<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.289> open<00:00:49.680> for<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
your guard leaving you open for the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.770 
your guard leaving you open for the
other<00:00:50.219> character<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.730> rush<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.539> can't

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
other character to rush in and I can't

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.389 
other character to rush in and I can't
confirm<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.260> yet<00:00:52.469> but<00:00:52.500> i<00:00:52.620> think<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
confirm this yet but i think that the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.010 
confirm this yet but i think that the
ultimate<00:00:53.789> type<00:00:54.000> will<00:00:54.300> be<00:00:54.420> able<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.629> use<00:00:54.719> less

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
ultimate type will be able to use less

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.630 
ultimate type will be able to use less
chakra<00:00:55.500> when<00:00:55.739> using<00:00:55.920> their<00:00:56.160> ultimate<00:00:56.430> jutsus

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
chakra when using their ultimate jutsus

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.760 
chakra when using their ultimate jutsus
and<00:00:57.120> then<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.690> have<00:00:57.840> your<00:00:57.870> awakening<00:00:58.289> type

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
and then you have your awakening type

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.650 
and then you have your awakening type
which<00:00:59.070> can<00:00:59.340> be<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.609> strongest<00:01:00.030> one<00:01:00.270> actually

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
which can be the strongest one actually

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.900 
which can be the strongest one actually
because<00:01:01.050> before<00:01:01.530> back<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.010> previous<00:01:02.699> storm

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
because before back in previous storm

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.539 
because before back in previous storm
games<00:01:03.180> awakenings<00:01:04.140> could<00:01:04.559> be<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> taboo<00:01:05.070> for

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549

games awakenings could be a taboo for
some<00:01:06.000> characters<00:01:06.540> but<00:01:06.869> now<00:01:07.110> since<00:01:07.770> Awakening

can<00:03:03.510> be<00:03:03.540> really<00:03:03.870> tough<00:03:04.019> to<00:03:04.079> beat<00:03:04.349> so<00:03:04.680> we'll

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
can be really tough to beat so we'll

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.800 
can be really tough to beat so we'll
have<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.370> wait<00:03:05.489> and<00:03:05.549> see<00:03:05.700> even<00:03:06.390> vote<00:03:06.569> drive

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
have to wait and see even vote drive

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.900 
have to wait and see even vote drive
type<00:03:07.079> seems<00:03:07.379> to<00:03:07.560> be<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:08.010> strongest<00:03:08.400> one<00:03:08.640> so

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
type seems to be the strongest one so

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.819 
type seems to be the strongest one so
far<00:03:09.150> we<00:03:09.599> don't<00:03:09.720> know<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.019> true<00:03:10.170> extent<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.680> the

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
far we don't know the true extent to the

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.559 
far we don't know the true extent to the
other<00:03:10.950> two<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.400> we<00:03:11.579> also<00:03:11.730> don't<00:03:11.970> know<00:03:12.180> if<00:03:12.390> the

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
other two and we also don't know if the

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.110 
other two and we also don't know if the
guard<00:03:12.810> support<00:03:13.260> will<00:03:13.500> be<00:03:13.530> bad<00:03:14.280> like<00:03:14.670> how<00:03:14.849> it<00:03:15.000> is

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
guard support will be bad like how it is

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.050 
guard support will be bad like how it is
right<00:03:15.390> now<00:03:15.569> in<00:03:15.840> storm<00:03:16.260> 3<00:03:16.470> so<00:03:16.980> do<00:03:17.549> I<00:03:17.609> like<00:03:18.030> the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.599 
system will be ass I don't know I need
to<00:03:33.959> see<00:03:34.049> some<00:03:34.230> hard<00:03:34.470> information<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:35.250> perhaps

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
to see some hard information and perhaps

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.160 
to see some hard information and perhaps
play<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.000> game<00:03:36.269> before<00:03:36.450> I<00:03:36.569> can<00:03:36.720> really<00:03:36.900> judge
