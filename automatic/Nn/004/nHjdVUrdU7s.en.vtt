00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.650
 be cool do not demolish anything very well 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.739
 cristian you are an expert in this league and 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:38.680
 it's good 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:40.600
 unless it is firm on the tail 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.830
 have your head when we buy them 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.980
 with head 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.710
 the head and the balls exactly in 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.309
 the eyes but now 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.620
 firm that is firm to the touch should not 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.780
 to be watery when it is very watery is 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.699
 to learn what frozen and 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.010
 thawed frozen today welcomes a lot 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.420
 to know my heart so it is firm 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:07.859
 not what happens here 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:10.090
 and it's absolutely nothing 

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:12.490
 We are adding the tomatoes in this 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.409
 instantly and what easier recipe and more 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.119
 easy of this we can not give them for 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.189
 Of course, this recipe can be 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.990
 change not only for shrimp but 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.329
 also for chicken can use 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.799
 Cooked chick fry it and they do the same 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:26.409
 procedure ok 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.149
 very well I do not want of course 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.399
 I was caused on the slope of the tomato 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.950
 I think the tomato trying to see 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:35.350
 consume it be for tomato not as 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.079
 I had beautiful tomatoes out there I 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.630
 I have previously cooked cooked pasta and 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.189
 it is very important very important as 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.649
 with being the pasta but first I want to 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.689
 say that it is always sewn in water 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.360
 boiling in boiling water with 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.009
 enough salt before I told them with the 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.140
 another day that the thing I with a lot of salt 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.060
 because my family that has a part 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.129
 Italian always said my grandfather is like 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.069
 be swimming in the mediterranean very very 

00:01:57.129 --> 00:02:01.569
 salty then the people saying 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:03.789
 well but how are we also avoiding 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.890
 So much sodium, let's go down a little bit and nothing 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.750
 more let's put the s put what 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.940
 necessary let's bake the pasta 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.260
 directly in boiling water and I 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.610
 when example in this case use 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.920
 prawns 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.440
 when oregano I'm using the best 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.140
 nothing more to perfume my water I'm going to 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.000
 put a better fat shaker and tanque 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.490
 depending on the quality of the pasta is 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.890
 the need to put grease or not 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.350
 put on fat that's very important to me 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.210
 I suggest that you the only way to 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.520
 know how the pasta is al dente 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.740
 it is environment al dente is that it is 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.490
 doradita centers to be hard on 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:42.490
 center exactly before and encourage 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.870
 tooth and a slightly richer the 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.380
 center is on credit so that when 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.000
 one put the sauce on it is finished 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.400
 of costs are the great tips that we are going 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.560
 us learning mayor of doctors 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.630
 we have together through time and the 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.940
 another that also that I forgot time 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.560
 of cooking the cooking time varies 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.000
 very much depending on the pasta that 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.430
 more there is not a final time of a time 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.440
 fixed can be the time for a pasta 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.210
 short that are vital are the rifles 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.580
 ties 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.380
 n the pen the screws are pasta 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.170
 short that are called pasta 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.180
 short and these short pastas and in a 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.880
 cooking time much less than that of 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.330
 spaghetti for example and here from cases 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:29.260
 using a capelli d angelo is slim 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:31.450
 call this then what we do is cooked 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.370
 very good avocado if I do not occupy it in 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.570
 This moment is very important to give a 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.690
 cold water shock to the palate 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.340
 Let's put the cooking oil tantito 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.260
 the one you have at home for the cabbage 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.960
 cook olive oil or oil in 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.360
 spray and what do you think if you leave it 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.160
 rest a little while and it's going to be like this 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.040
 It is going to get stuck and is not going to stick 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.320
 very important super sic but let's 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.450
 so let him eat our cream 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.910
