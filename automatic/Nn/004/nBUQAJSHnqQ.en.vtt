the JHS guys brought us a brand new
pedal<00:00:07.710> that<00:00:07.830> hasn't<00:00:07.950> even<00:00:08.069> been<00:00:08.189> released<00:00:08.280> yet

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
pedal that hasn't even been released yet

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.190 
pedal that hasn't even been released yet
that<00:00:08.970> we<00:00:09.059> got<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.300> take<00:00:09.480> an<00:00:09.599> early<00:00:09.870> look<00:00:09.990> at

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
that we got to take an early look at

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.240

clone<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.740> basically<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:21.300> thing

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
clone and basically this thing

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.960 
clone and basically this thing
supposedly<00:00:22.769> can<00:00:22.980> do<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.130> lot<00:00:23.400> it's<00:00:23.640> supposed<00:00:23.910> to

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
supposedly can do a lot it's supposed to

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.910 
supposedly can do a lot it's supposed to
get<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.570> amp<00:00:24.840> sound<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.470> can<00:00:25.619> kind<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.800> get

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
get that amp sound you can kind of get

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.859 
get that amp sound you can kind of get
like<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.099> speaker<00:00:26.519> blown<00:00:26.760> really<00:00:27.180> like<00:00:27.330> huge

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
and yeah we're going to try it out here

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.390 
and yeah we're going to try it out here
a<00:00:43.559> second<00:00:43.920> see<00:00:44.040> how<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.190> sounds

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
a second see how it sounds

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
it literally just sounds like a little

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.160 
it literally just sounds like a little
crappy<00:03:45.100> old<00:03:45.130> amplifier<00:03:45.880> cranked<00:03:46.570> tools<00:03:46.900> like

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
crappy old amplifier cranked tools like

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.380 
crappy old amplifier cranked tools like
exploding<00:03:47.920> except<00:03:48.700> that<00:03:48.790> you<00:03:48.850> could<00:03:49.000> put<00:03:49.150> that

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
exploding except that you could put that

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.650 
exploding except that you could put that
in<00:03:49.660> front<00:03:50.290> of<00:03:50.650> your<00:03:51.430> actual<00:03:51.850> big<00:03:52.090> amplifier

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
in front of your actual big amplifier

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.110 
in front of your actual big amplifier
and<00:03:52.960> it<00:03:53.020> just<00:03:53.200> magnifies<00:03:53.470> that<00:03:54.160> awesome<00:03:54.850> gooey

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
and it just magnifies that awesome gooey

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.140 
and it just magnifies that awesome gooey
warm<00:03:55.510> ridiculousness<00:03:56.580> it<00:03:57.580> kind<00:03:57.910> of<00:03:57.970> does

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
warm ridiculousness it kind of does

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.940 
warm ridiculousness it kind of does
everything<00:03:58.630> I<00:03:59.580> mean<00:04:00.580> I<00:04:00.670> guess<00:04:00.880> it's

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
everything I mean I guess it's

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.260 
everything I mean I guess it's
internally<00:04:02.950> runs<00:04:03.190> on<00:04:03.280> a<00:04:03.370> normal<00:04:03.580> 9-volt<00:04:04.120> but

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
internally runs on a normal 9-volt but

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.820 
internally runs on a normal 9-volt but
internally<00:04:04.690> it's<00:04:04.810> 18<00:04:05.200> volts<00:04:05.560> so<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:05.710> can

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
internally it's 18 volts so you can

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.500 
internally it's 18 volts so you can
literally<00:04:06.070> just<00:04:06.310> like<00:04:06.490> smash<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.180> front<00:04:07.390> end

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
literally just like smash the front end

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.240 
literally just like smash the front end
of<00:04:07.570> your<00:04:07.690> amplifier<00:04:08.080> with<00:04:08.350> this<00:04:08.560> is<00:04:08.710> one<00:04:09.190> of

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
of your amplifier with this is one of

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.570 
of your amplifier with this is one of
the<00:04:09.340> best<00:04:09.550> boost<00:04:09.910> pedals<00:04:10.300> have<00:04:10.390> ever<00:04:10.570> heard<00:04:11.580> on

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
the best boost pedals have ever heard on

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.340 
the best boost pedals have ever heard on
its<00:04:12.820> own<00:04:13.000> in<00:04:13.150> front<00:04:13.360> of<00:04:13.420> a<00:04:13.480> crystal<00:04:13.840> clean<00:04:14.080> amp

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
its own in front of a crystal clean amp

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.690 
its own in front of a crystal clean amp
it's<00:04:14.500> incredible<00:04:14.980> and<00:04:15.160> then<00:04:15.280> you<00:04:15.370> could<00:04:15.520> dime

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
it's incredible and then you could dime

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.280 
it's incredible and then you could dime
out<00:04:15.850> that<00:04:16.090> gain<00:04:16.330> like<00:04:16.570> I<00:04:16.660> said<00:04:16.870> it<00:04:16.960> has<00:04:17.110> that

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
out that gain like I said it has that

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.220 
out that gain like I said it has that
crazy<00:04:17.770> like<00:04:18.130> sag<00:04:18.580> that<00:04:18.850> bloom<00:04:19.210> where<00:04:19.900> you<00:04:19.989> hit

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
crazy like sag that bloom where you hit

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.170 
crazy like sag that bloom where you hit
a<00:04:20.470> chord<00:04:20.890> and<00:04:21.100> it<00:04:21.220> just<00:04:21.400> like<00:04:21.550> kind<00:04:22.150> of

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
a chord and it just like kind of

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.880 
a chord and it just like kind of
collapses<00:04:22.750> in<00:04:22.900> on<00:04:22.960> itself<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:23.530> it<00:04:23.620> sounds

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
collapses in on itself and it sounds

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.400 
collapses in on itself and it sounds
like<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:24.130> grounds<00:04:24.580> just<00:04:24.640> like<00:04:25.320> exploding<00:04:26.320> on

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
like the grounds just like exploding on

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.930 
like the grounds just like exploding on
your<00:04:26.620> feet<00:04:26.860> it's<00:04:27.070> pretty<00:04:27.370> ridiculous

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
your feet it's pretty ridiculous

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.940 
your feet it's pretty ridiculous
it's<00:04:28.180> it's<00:04:28.660> one<00:04:29.200> of<00:04:29.260> the<00:04:29.320> best<00:04:29.470> OverDrive's

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
it's it's one of the best OverDrive's

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.530 
it's it's one of the best OverDrive's
maybe<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.310> best<00:04:30.460> overdrive<00:04:30.940> pedal<00:04:31.210> I've<00:04:31.300> just

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
maybe the best overdrive pedal I've just

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.000 
maybe the best overdrive pedal I've just
for<00:04:31.720> me<00:04:31.810> personally<00:04:31.840> for<00:04:32.500> what<00:04:32.590> I<00:04:32.620> like<00:04:32.860> an
