 install the aluminum profiles for 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.279
 delimiting area to cover this 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.460
 profile will spread 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.870
 correctly the thickness of the coating 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.090
 cut the aluminum profiles to good 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.570
 measure using a box a tab and 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.970
 a hacksaw had the profile 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.350
 on the edge of the terrace to check 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.350
 measuring and cutting 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.000
 in caux.les the back of the aluminum profile 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.130
 and place it flush with the edge 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.570
 and so on to border all your 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.180
 small terrace tip for big 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.939
 terrace for expansion joints 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.310
 existing aluminum profile to 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.979
 the plumb of existing joints a few 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.259
 used checks make sure to bring 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.689
 adapted equipment long clothes 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.310
 gloves and glasses 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.670
 pour soil in 50 the primary 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.619
 hanging in a paint tray 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.009
 evenly soaked the lacker roll and 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:41.080
 drain the well applied to the roll on 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:43.959
 the entire surface and leave 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.220
 to dry two hours now 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:50.560
 aggregates 2,5 5 mm wash dry and 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.890
 of soul years 300 transparent resin 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.110
 for coating decorative gravel for 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.799
 calculate the material need nothing of 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.399
 easier 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:03.549
 two bags of gravel 25 kg more 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.520
 cans of resin equal three meters 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.429
 square for 1 cm thick 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.560
 these dosages must be strictly adhered to 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.019
 1600-watt mortar mixer 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.880
 pour two bags of gravel first 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:20.829
 the tray is added a resin can 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.130
 to achieve three square meters of 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.130
 terrace 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.810
 knead together for two minutes 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.489
 until the gravels take 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.269
 their colors wet and be well 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:36.130
 coated you can also realize the 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.660
 preparation using a concrete mixer 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.160
 for this to his two bags of gravel 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.880
 to which must be added a can of 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.440
 resin operate the concrete mixer for 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.980
 that she mixes everything for two 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.650
 minutes 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.799
 the resulting mixture cover at 3 meters 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.769
 square the completed operation pour a 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:59.260
 little pile on your terrace and use 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:07.780
 your aluminum profile to spot and 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:10.299
 keep the cm thick for 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.420
 start spreading the material with a 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:16.269
 reading to side and in a second 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.000
 time and go and smooth the surface with 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.889
 a stainless steel trowel with rounded edge 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.959
 matter must be very uniform 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:25.060
 you can also help yourself from a 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.870
 aluminum mason ruler to adjust the 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.910
 small board surface clean the 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.829
 trowel with acetone all 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.729
 four preparation for her to slide 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:38.470
 perfectly on the matter and continue 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:41.549
 so on to cover the whole

 from your terrace 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.400
 to realize the construction site in several 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.990
 steps it will take then finished your 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.130
 application against a profile of 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:55.080
 tiler before resuming work 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.480
 after 48 hours of drying your 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:02.000
 terrace has recovered from its superb with 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.000
 a modern and easy to install coating
