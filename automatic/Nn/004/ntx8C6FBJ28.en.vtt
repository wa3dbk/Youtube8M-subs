to look and see where the bulk of the
hair<00:00:10.820> is<00:00:11.000> there's<00:00:11.450> a<00:00:11.540> few<00:00:11.599> places<00:00:11.870> where<00:00:12.320> we're

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
hair is there's a few places where we're

hair is there's a few places where we're
looking<00:00:12.889> through<00:00:13.280> the<00:00:13.400> hair<00:00:13.580> I<00:00:13.610> don't<00:00:13.820> want<00:00:14.450> to

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
looking through the hair I don't want to

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.990 
looking through the hair I don't want to
miss<00:00:14.750> that<00:00:14.780> and<00:00:15.349> so<00:00:16.009> I<00:00:16.040> want<00:00:16.610> to<00:00:16.640> make<00:00:16.790> sure<00:00:16.970> I

miss that and so I want to make sure I

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.760 
miss that and so I want to make sure I
don't<00:00:17.239> make<00:00:17.390> that<00:00:17.570> real<00:00:17.779> solid<00:00:18.230> either<00:00:18.380> and<00:00:18.710> I

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
don't make that real solid either and I

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.609 
don't make that real solid either and I
want<00:00:19.009> to<00:00:19.099> usually<00:00:19.460> add<00:00:19.610> these<00:00:19.939> on<00:00:20.500> you<00:00:21.500> know

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
want to usually add these on you know

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.130 
want to usually add these on you know
later<00:00:22.250> but<00:00:23.119> I<00:00:23.149> want<00:00:23.480> to<00:00:23.599> go<00:00:23.689> ahead<00:00:23.809> and<00:00:24.050> give

later but I want to go ahead and give

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.720 
later but I want to go ahead and give
myself<00:00:24.290> a<00:00:24.559> little<00:00:24.770> indication<00:00:25.160> to<00:00:25.399> where<00:00:25.579> they

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
myself a little indication to where they

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:32.200 
myself a little indication to where they
are<00:00:28.960> okay<00:00:29.960> so<00:00:30.649> let's<00:00:30.829> go<00:00:30.980> ahead<00:00:31.009> and<00:00:31.250> put<00:00:32.029> a<00:00:32.059> few

are okay so let's go ahead and put a few

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.330 
are okay so let's go ahead and put a few
strokes<00:00:32.450> on<00:00:32.719> there<00:00:32.899> where's<00:00:33.680> my<00:00:33.890> highlight

count on so let's go ahead and say now I
better<00:00:41.420> turn<00:00:41.660> this<00:00:41.780> a<00:00:41.840> little<00:00:42.020> bit<00:00:43.420> trying<00:00:44.420> to

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
better turn this a little bit trying to

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.860 
better turn this a little bit trying to
keep<00:00:44.690> this<00:00:44.840> big<00:00:45.080> one<00:00:45.230> in<00:00:45.380> the<00:00:45.500> picture<00:00:46.040> for<00:00:46.370> you

keep this big one in the picture for you
and<00:00:47.870> I<00:00:47.930> want<00:00:48.110> to<00:00:48.170> get<00:00:48.260> it<00:00:48.410> too<00:00:49.630> far<00:00:50.630> out<00:00:50.870> or

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
and I want to get it too far out or

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.890 
and I want to get it too far out or
we're<00:00:51.380> not<00:00:51.680> going<00:00:51.829> to<00:00:51.920> see<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:52.190> detail<00:00:55.900> glide

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
we're not going to see the detail glide

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.790 
we're not going to see the detail glide
on<00:00:57.140> glide<00:00:57.800> off<00:00:58.040> I<00:00:59.290> need<00:01:00.290> to<00:01:00.410> know<00:01:00.530> where<00:01:00.680> this

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
on glide off I need to know where this

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.840 
on glide off I need to know where this
is<00:01:01.100> it<00:01:01.910> will<00:01:02.149> always<00:01:02.810> look<00:01:03.040> coarser<00:01:04.040> at<00:01:04.670> the

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
is it will always look coarser at the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:17.310 
is it will always look coarser at the
beginning

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.719 

I<00:01:19.590> don't<00:01:20.590> want<00:01:20.740> to<00:01:20.800> take<00:01:20.979> too<00:01:21.190> many<00:01:21.340> strokes

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
I don't want to take too many strokes

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.690 
I don't want to take too many strokes
and<00:01:22.120> fill<00:01:22.540> it<00:01:22.659> in<00:01:22.780> that's<00:01:23.590> where<00:01:23.860> that<00:01:24.010> solid

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
and fill it in that's where that solid

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.270 
and fill it in that's where that solid
hair<00:01:24.940> comes<00:01:25.270> in<00:01:25.510> that<00:01:25.690> we<00:01:25.750> just<00:01:26.590> have<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:26.920> real

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
hair comes in that we just have a real

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:37.700 
hair comes in that we just have a real
hard<00:01:27.580> time<00:01:27.790> with

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.280 

can<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.370> see<00:01:38.610> why<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.090> wanted<00:01:39.480> you<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.720> fade<00:01:40.020> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
can you see why I wanted you to fade the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.880 
can you see why I wanted you to fade the
hair<00:01:40.910> into<00:01:41.910> the<00:01:42.210> scalp<00:01:42.540> let<00:01:42.990> me<00:01:43.110> feed<00:01:43.410> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
hair into the scalp let me feed the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.760 
hair into the scalp let me feed the
values<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.490> forehead<00:01:44.730> into<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.330> scalp

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
values in the forehead into the scalp

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.260 
values in the forehead into the scalp
it's<00:01:46.770> really<00:01:47.070> important<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.880> we<00:01:48.090> don't

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
it's really important that we don't

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.700 
it's really important that we don't
create<00:01:49.080> this<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:50.190> edge<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.550> a<00:01:51.300> value<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.290> here

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
create this this edge to a value in here

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.070 
create this this edge to a value in here
it<00:01:52.920> will<00:01:53.100> show<00:01:53.400> through<00:01:53.760> our<00:01:53.970> hair<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.870> many

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
it will show through our hair in many

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.140 
it will show through our hair in many
cases<00:01:55.530> if<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.100> doesn't<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.670> particular

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
cases if it doesn't on this particular

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.700 
cases if it doesn't on this particular
one<00:01:57.300> it<00:01:57.570> would<00:01:57.780> be<00:01:57.810> probably<00:01:58.260> if<00:01:58.590> you're

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
one it would be probably if you're

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.850 
one it would be probably if you're
changing<00:01:59.160> the<00:01:59.550> color<00:01:59.790> of<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.090> hair<00:02:03.380> now<00:02:04.380> even

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
changing the color of the hair now even

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.490 
changing the color of the hair now even
though<00:02:05.100> I'm<00:02:05.369> not<00:02:05.610> using<00:02:05.820> my<00:02:06.240> compass<00:02:07.080> stroke

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
though I'm not using my compass stroke

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.870 
though I'm not using my compass stroke
it's<00:02:08.190> closely<00:02:09.179> related<00:02:09.440> so<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.770> really<00:02:11.459> want<00:02:11.670> to

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
it's closely related so I really want to

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.870 
it's closely related so I really want to
be<00:02:12.000> able<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.420> have<00:02:12.630> that<00:02:12.890> opportunity<00:02:13.890> to

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
be able to have that opportunity to

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.910 
be able to have that opportunity to
think<00:02:15.300> about<00:02:15.570> my<00:02:15.750> my<00:02:18.230> taper<00:02:19.230> stroke<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.830> how

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
think about my my taper stroke and how

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.229 
think about my my taper stroke and how
I'm<00:02:20.040> landing<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.800> I'm<00:02:23.220> making<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.640> shorter<00:02:24.120> in

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
I'm landing and I'm making it shorter in

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.070 
I'm landing and I'm making it shorter in
some<00:02:24.480> cases<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.739> I'm<00:02:25.890> making<00:02:26.130> it<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:27.080> little

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
some cases and I'm making it a little

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.490 
some cases and I'm making it a little
longer<00:02:28.380> in<00:02:29.150> some<00:02:30.150> cases<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.870> I'm<00:02:30.989> making<00:02:31.230> it

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
longer in some cases and I'm making it

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.590 
longer in some cases and I'm making it
much<00:02:31.680> more<00:02:31.739> curved<00:02:32.340> in<00:02:33.260> most<00:02:34.260> cases<00:02:35.540> now<00:02:36.540> you

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
much more curved in most cases now you

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:42.219 
don't want to do lines that are all just

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:45.940 
don't want to do lines that are all just
parallel<00:03:43.219> in<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.549> same<00:03:43.760> gap<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.590> I<00:03:45.590> hope<00:03:45.829> you

part that goes around behind so you want

part that goes around behind so you want

it creates that that edge of the hair
