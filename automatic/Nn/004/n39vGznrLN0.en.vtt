00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
bubble first and it might take a lot

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.400 
bubble first and it might take a lot
more<00:02:05.000> practice<00:02:05.210> because<00:02:05.720> it's<00:02:05.960> a<00:02:06.050> lot<00:02:06.200> harder

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.949 
the bubble from sinking so yeah look at
that<00:02:51.920> first<00:02:52.160> step<00:02:52.430> where<00:02:53.300> you<00:02:53.390> chew<00:02:53.570> off<00:02:53.750> the

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
that first step where you chew off the

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.840 
that first step where you chew off the
bubble<00:02:54.230> so<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.250> bubble<00:02:55.459> doesn't<00:02:55.580> get<00:02:55.730> any

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
bubble so the bubble doesn't get any

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.530 
bubble so the bubble doesn't get any
bigger<00:02:56.180> or<00:02:56.300> smaller<00:02:56.800> stays<00:02:57.800> the<00:02:57.920> same

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
bigger or smaller stays the same

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
bigger or smaller stays the same
and<00:02:59.540> then<00:03:00.070> when<00:03:01.070> you<00:03:01.250> um<00:03:01.480> have<00:03:02.480> that<00:03:02.900> like<00:03:03.170> ball

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
and then when you um have that like ball

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.949 
and then when you um have that like ball
