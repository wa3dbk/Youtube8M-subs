vegetable<00:00:12.429> oil<00:00:12.550> so<00:00:13.050> let's<00:00:14.050> go<00:00:14.740> on<00:00:14.860> the<00:00:14.950> console

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.370 
vegetable oil so let's go on the console

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.950 
vegetable oil so let's go on the console
here<00:00:15.580> open<00:00:16.000> up<00:00:16.119> a<00:00:16.150> little<00:00:17.130> panel<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:19.480> we've<00:00:19.720> got

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
here open up a little panel so we've got

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.630 
here open up a little panel so we've got
the<00:00:20.320> veggie<00:00:21.040> switch<00:00:21.430> my<00:00:22.180> indicator<00:00:22.779> lights

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
the veggie switch my indicator lights

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.490 
the veggie switch my indicator lights
vacuum<00:00:24.640> gauge<00:00:24.880> temperature<00:00:25.360> gauge<00:00:25.840> and<00:00:26.200> over

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
vacuum gauge temperature gauge and over

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.210 
vacuum gauge temperature gauge and over
here<00:00:26.860> is<00:00:27.009> a<00:00:27.579> return<00:00:28.390> to<00:00:28.540> tanks<00:00:28.869> which<00:00:29.079> that<00:00:29.950> so

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
here is a return to tanks which that so

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.400 
here is a return to tanks which that so
that<00:00:30.369> on<00:00:30.579> vegetable<00:00:31.119> oil<00:00:31.239> i<00:00:31.480> can<00:00:31.660> send<00:00:32.079> the<00:00:32.259> veg

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
that on vegetable oil i can send the veg

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.900 
that on vegetable oil i can send the veg
fold<00:00:32.649> back<00:00:32.860> to<00:00:33.040> the<00:00:33.130> tank<00:00:33.309> and<00:00:33.489> set<00:00:33.640> it<00:00:33.760> back

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
fold back to the tank and set it back

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.130 
fold back to the tank and set it back
into<00:00:34.149> the<00:00:34.210> fuel<00:00:34.480> loop<00:00:34.719> and<00:00:34.870> we're<00:00:34.989> going<00:00:35.109> to

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
into the fuel loop and we're going to

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.599 
into the fuel loop and we're going to
want<00:00:35.350> to<00:00:35.440> do<00:00:35.559> that<00:00:35.769> when<00:00:35.949> we<00:00:36.100> first<00:00:36.370> start

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:36.609 
want to do that when we first start

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:37.680 
want to do that when we first start
because<00:00:36.820> there's<00:00:36.969> bound<00:00:37.179> to<00:00:37.239> be<00:00:37.300> some<00:00:37.539> air

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
because there's bound to be some air

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.770 
because there's bound to be some air
bubbles<00:00:38.019> so<00:00:38.670> let's<00:00:39.670> flip<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.149> switch<00:00:40.359> and<00:00:40.570> see

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
bubbles so let's flip the switch and see

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.529 
bubbles so let's flip the switch and see
how<00:00:40.899> it<00:00:41.019> goes<00:00:41.579> I'll<00:00:42.579> get<00:00:42.730> the<00:00:42.850> revs<00:00:43.059> up<00:00:43.239> a<00:00:43.359> bit

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:43.539 
how it goes I'll get the revs up a bit

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.030 
how it goes I'll get the revs up a bit
here

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.660 

there<00:00:48.250> we<00:00:48.340> go<00:00:48.600> there<00:00:49.600> we<00:00:49.750> go<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:51.190> green

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
there we go there we go so green

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.520 
there we go there we go so green
indicator<00:00:52.120> light<00:00:52.360> means<00:00:52.690> that<00:00:52.960> e<00:00:53.110> to<00:00:53.140> switch

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
indicator light means that e to switch

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.040 
indicator light means that e to switch
to<00:00:53.710> vegetable<00:00:54.220> oil<00:00:54.310> the<00:00:55.300> yellow<00:00:55.600> over<00:00:55.810> here

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
to vegetable oil the yellow over here

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.630 
to vegetable oil the yellow over here
indicates<00:00:56.500> that<00:00:56.650> it's<00:00:56.890> going<00:00:57.070> back<00:00:57.370> to<00:00:57.550> the

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
indicates that it's going back to the

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:05.180 
indicates that it's going back to the
tank<00:00:58.110> get<00:00:59.110> some<00:00:59.350> air<00:00:59.530> bubbles<00:00:59.890> here

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:14.820 

but<00:01:05.520> it's<00:01:05.820> going

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:22.310 

nice<00:01:15.430> having<00:01:15.820> engine<00:01:19.620> idling<00:01:20.620> beautifully

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
nice having engine idling beautifully

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.100 
nice having engine idling beautifully
but<00:01:23.320> five<00:01:23.830> inches<00:01:24.370> of<00:01:24.550> vacuum<00:01:24.700> there

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:02:00.800 

don't<00:01:30.500> mind<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.830> mess<00:01:30.860> in<00:01:31.160> the<00:01:31.220> garage

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:27.410 

say<00:02:01.810> that's<00:02:01.990> a<00:02:02.200> success

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.809 

so<00:02:28.020> there<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.230> have<00:02:28.349> it<00:02:28.470> on<00:02:28.740> vegetable<00:02:29.580> oil

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
so there you have it on vegetable oil

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.749 
so there you have it on vegetable oil
sounds<00:02:31.569> good
