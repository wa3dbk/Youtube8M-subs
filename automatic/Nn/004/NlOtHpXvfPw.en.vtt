we're<00:00:06.100> gonna<00:00:06.190> talk<00:00:06.430> a<00:00:06.460> little<00:00:06.730> bit<00:00:06.910> about

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.090 
we're gonna talk a little bit about

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.020 
we're gonna talk a little bit about
Capo's<00:00:07.600> here<00:00:08.050> and<00:00:08.680> this<00:00:08.860> applies<00:00:09.219> to<00:00:09.250> cords

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.030 
Capo's here and this applies to cords

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.449 
Capo's here and this applies to cords
because<00:00:10.500> oftentimes<00:00:11.500> you<00:00:12.010> want<00:00:12.280> to<00:00:12.370> be

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:12.459 
because oftentimes you want to be

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.209 
because oftentimes you want to be
rolling<00:00:12.760> with<00:00:13.330> chord<00:00:13.929> progressions<00:00:14.500> and<00:00:14.769> if

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
rolling with chord progressions and if

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.040 
rolling with chord progressions and if
you<00:00:15.309> if<00:00:15.580> you're<00:00:15.790> using<00:00:16.029> shapes<00:00:16.480> up<00:00:16.689> the<00:00:16.840> neck

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
you if you're using shapes up the neck

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.800 
you if you're using shapes up the neck
it<00:00:17.320> just<00:00:17.560> doesn't<00:00:18.130> quite<00:00:18.250> sound<00:00:18.610> as<00:00:18.939> cool<00:00:19.450> and

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
it just doesn't quite sound as cool and

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.659 
it just doesn't quite sound as cool and
open<00:00:20.230> as<00:00:20.439> it<00:00:20.590> does<00:00:20.770> when<00:00:21.040> you're<00:00:21.189> using<00:00:21.430> an

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:21.669 
open as it does when you're using an

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:24.300 
open as it does when you're using an
open<00:00:22.090> chord<00:00:23.020> situation<00:00:23.680> and<00:00:23.829> rolling<00:00:24.189> over

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
open chord situation and rolling over

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.990 
open chord situation and rolling over
over<00:00:25.239> open<00:00:25.570> stuff<00:00:25.840> so<00:00:26.259> and<00:00:27.130> I<00:00:27.610> can<00:00:27.790> kind<00:00:27.939> of

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
over open stuff so and I can kind of

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.999 
over open stuff so and I can kind of
give<00:00:28.149> you<00:00:28.239> an<00:00:28.360> example<00:00:28.660> of<00:00:28.869> that<00:00:29.020> like<00:00:29.410> this

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
give you an example of that like this

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.069 
give you an example of that like this
this<00:00:30.520> roll<00:00:30.820> right<00:00:31.059> here<00:00:33.660> sounds<00:00:34.660> pretty<00:00:34.899> good

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
this roll right here sounds pretty good

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.290 
this roll right here sounds pretty good
it<00:00:35.320> rings<00:00:35.530> really<00:00:35.800> cleanly<00:00:36.070> if<00:00:36.700> I<00:00:36.820> used<00:00:37.030> it<00:00:37.180> up

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
it rings really cleanly if I used it up

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.570 
it rings really cleanly if I used it up
here<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:41.170> just<00:00:41.230> not<00:00:41.500> as<00:00:41.620> punchy<00:00:42.100> as<00:00:42.280> it<00:00:42.460> is

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
here it's just not as punchy as it is

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.110 
here it's just not as punchy as it is
down<00:00:42.760> here<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.860> let's<00:00:45.610> say<00:00:45.760> we<00:00:45.910> were<00:00:46.030> gonna

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
down here so let's say we were gonna

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.530 
down here so let's say we were gonna
play<00:00:47.020> in<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.230> key<00:00:47.380> of<00:00:47.410> a<00:00:47.740> rather<00:00:48.610> than<00:00:48.820> then

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
play in the key of a rather than then

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.510 
play in the key of a rather than then
finding<00:00:49.990> the<00:00:50.050> a<00:00:50.140> chord<00:00:50.560> up<00:00:50.710> here<00:00:50.980> and<00:00:51.160> rolling

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
finding the a chord up here and rolling

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.400 
finding the a chord up here and rolling
over<00:00:51.610> that<00:00:51.880> should<00:00:52.150> at<00:00:52.270> one<00:00:52.480> force<00:00:52.780> v<00:00:53.020> shape

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
over that should at one force v shape

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.860 
over that should at one force v shape
there<00:00:53.740> I'm<00:00:54.460> just<00:00:54.700> gonna<00:00:54.820> start<00:00:55.180> by<00:00:55.420> putting<00:00:55.810> a

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
there I'm just gonna start by putting a

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.670 
there I'm just gonna start by putting a
capo<00:00:56.230> on<00:00:56.380> the<00:00:56.410> neck<00:00:56.680> and<00:00:57.570> banjos<00:00:58.570> if<00:00:59.530> you

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
capo on the neck and banjos if you

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.200 
capo on the neck and banjos if you
haven't<00:00:59.980> figured<00:01:00.130> it<00:01:00.370> out<00:01:00.489> already<00:01:00.550> are

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
haven't figured it out already are

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.540 
haven't figured it out already are
really<00:01:01.690> finicky<00:01:02.230> with<00:01:02.500> tuning<00:01:02.950> they<00:01:03.160> get<00:01:03.310> they

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
really finicky with tuning they get they

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.950 
really finicky with tuning they get they
come<00:01:03.730> in<00:01:03.850> and<00:01:04.000> out<00:01:04.059> of<00:01:04.180> tune<00:01:04.329> really<00:01:04.629> easily

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
come in and out of tune really easily

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.899 
come in and out of tune really easily
depending<00:01:05.320> on<00:01:05.560> all<00:01:05.710> sorts<00:01:06.009> of<00:01:06.070> things<00:01:06.310> and<00:01:06.520> a

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
depending on all sorts of things and a

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.270 
depending on all sorts of things and a
capo<00:01:07.270> can<00:01:07.450> really<00:01:07.750> can<00:01:08.530> really<00:01:08.800> make<00:01:09.130> that

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
capo can really can really make that

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.760 
capo can really can really make that
even<00:01:09.580> worse<00:01:09.760> so<00:01:10.360> I<00:01:10.659> learned<00:01:10.900> a<00:01:11.260> little<00:01:11.620> while

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
even worse so I learned a little while

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.730 
even worse so I learned a little while
ago<00:01:11.950> that<00:01:12.390> when<00:01:13.390> I'm<00:01:13.479> putting<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.110> capo<00:01:14.500> on

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
ago that when I'm putting the capo on

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.920 
ago that when I'm putting the capo on
the<00:01:14.920> neck<00:01:15.159> there's<00:01:15.970> really<00:01:16.180> kind<00:01:16.450> of<00:01:16.600> a<00:01:16.690> right

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
the neck there's really kind of a right

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.480 
the neck there's really kind of a right
way<00:01:17.140> to<00:01:17.200> do<00:01:17.470> that<00:01:17.650> you've<00:01:17.890> got<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.250> front

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
way to do that you've got the front

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.700 
way to do that you've got the front
ridge<00:01:18.880> of<00:01:19.150> the<00:01:19.180> capo<00:01:19.659> and<00:01:19.930> this<00:01:20.140> is<00:01:20.260> actually<00:01:20.680> a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
ridge of the capo and this is actually a

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.700 
ridge of the capo and this is actually a
guitar<00:01:21.100> capo<00:01:21.490> and<00:01:22.390> you've<00:01:23.290> got<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.530> front

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
guitar capo and you've got the front

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.140 
guitar capo and you've got the front
Ridge<00:01:23.950> of<00:01:24.130> it<00:01:24.220> and<00:01:24.370> instead<00:01:24.610> of<00:01:24.760> just<00:01:24.940> putting

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
Ridge of it and instead of just putting

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.370 
Ridge of it and instead of just putting
it<00:01:25.299> here<00:01:25.659> like<00:01:25.870> that

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
it here like that

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.830 
it here like that
halfway<00:01:26.770> down<00:01:27.190> behind<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:27.790> fret<00:01:28.060> I<00:01:28.270> put<00:01:28.750> it

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
halfway down behind the fret I put it

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.250 
halfway down behind the fret I put it
right<00:01:28.870> on<00:01:29.350> top<00:01:29.890> of<00:01:30.159> the<00:01:30.580> fret<00:01:30.850> itself<00:01:31.390> not<00:01:32.080> in

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
right on top of the fret itself not in

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.570 
right on top of the fret itself not in
front<00:01:32.440> of<00:01:32.590> it<00:01:32.680> if<00:01:32.770> you<00:01:32.830> get<00:01:32.979> any<00:01:33.220> of<00:01:33.310> it<00:01:33.490> in

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
front of it if you get any of it in

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.920 
front of it if you get any of it in
front<00:01:33.820> of<00:01:33.909> it<00:01:34.000> it's<00:01:34.119> not<00:01:34.240> gonna<00:01:34.450> really<00:01:34.659> help

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
front of it it's not gonna really help

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.510 
front of it it's not gonna really help
you<00:01:35.049> very<00:01:35.229> much<00:01:35.409> but<00:01:35.680> if<00:01:35.770> you<00:01:35.799> get<00:01:36.040> the<00:01:36.159> capo

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
you very much but if you get the capo

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.760 
you very much but if you get the capo
right<00:01:37.119> on<00:01:37.270> top<00:01:37.510> of<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:37.750> fret<00:01:38.020> you<00:01:38.500> end<00:01:38.650> up

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
right on top of the fret you end up

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.219 
right on top of the fret you end up
having<00:01:39.040> to<00:01:39.070> tune<00:01:39.400> it<00:01:39.580> up<00:01:39.700> less

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.050 

my<00:01:42.530> impression<00:01:43.009> of<00:01:43.070> guitar<00:01:43.430> players<00:01:43.700> is<00:01:43.939> they

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
my impression of guitar players is they

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.120 
my impression of guitar players is they
have<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.360> luxury<00:01:44.539> of<00:01:44.840> not<00:01:45.409> really<00:01:45.680> having<00:01:45.950> to

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
have the luxury of not really having to

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.920 
have the luxury of not really having to
tune<00:01:46.340> all<00:01:46.670> that<00:01:46.909> much<00:01:47.119> when<00:01:47.360> they<00:01:47.450> use<00:01:47.600> a<00:01:47.630> capo

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
tune all that much when they use a capo

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.649 
tune all that much when they use a capo
certainly<00:01:48.469> not<00:01:48.619> as<00:01:48.740> much<00:01:48.770> as<00:01:49.039> a<00:01:49.070> banjo<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.789> and

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
certainly not as much as a banjo and and

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.690
