00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Attention, please. 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Welcome to Anum Baya,
Dance School. 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I hope you practiced
during the week. 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Now...you did not practice? 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
(Students laugh) No way! 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Okay. Music!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
My name is Luis Navarro.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I am from Santo Domingo,
Dominican Republic.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And my wife is from Honduras. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Look! Wow!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Ah!!!

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's a camera, honey. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Not like that, hon.
Clean it! 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Very, very clean. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
My name is Nubia Mejía

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
My wife is short.
I love it.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But when taking pictures,
I always say

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
"please make it so that
I look tall and thin."

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Here, in our country, the
economy gets worse all the time. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
That is why my wife and
I have worked 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
to earn the extra
that we need. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We have a printing shop,
which is the most recent project, 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
the branding company, 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and the dance school.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The dance classes
were born out of the desire 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
to teach at home 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
to make some extra money
to help my family. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The bachata is like this...

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And salsa is more like...
tan ta ra ran

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Ah...Tango!

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
When I was 13 years of age,
my parents were divorced 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
so I had to face two fears. 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
First, I wondered if my marriage
would end up the same way. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And the second was whether I would
be able to provide for a family.  

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I have learned in The Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
the meaning of faith in Christ. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
When I was making the
decision to be married 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
in that moment I felt like God assured me
that I did not have to worry. 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
That if I did what He said,
everything would be fine.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It has been fine.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I love being a mom. 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
No matter how restless
they might get. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.500
Come here...

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.000
Here, here, here...a fish. 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
My name is Luis Navarro. 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I am Nubia Mejía.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I am an entrepreneur.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I am the mother of two earthquakes.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I am a husband.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I am a wife and I am a Mormon.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And I am a Mormon.
