00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
going to be doing an app per vehicle for

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.210 
going to be doing an app per vehicle for
the<00:00:16.730> app<00:00:16.850> called<00:00:17.210> slow<00:00:17.630> pro<00:00:17.930> so<00:00:18.710> let's<00:00:19.100> get

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
the app called slow pro so let's get

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.720 
the app called slow pro so let's get
stuck<00:00:19.460> in<00:00:19.810> so<00:00:20.810> here's<00:00:21.200> my<00:00:21.260> home<00:00:21.619> my<00:00:22.550> lock

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
stuck in so here's my home my lock

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.929 
stuck in so here's my home my lock
screen<00:00:22.760> so<00:00:23.449> I'll<00:00:23.720> just<00:00:23.750> go<00:00:24.050> into<00:00:24.289> my<00:00:24.670> see<00:00:25.670> I've

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
screen so I'll just go into my see I've

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.359 
screen so I'll just go into my see I've
already<00:00:26.090> had<00:00:26.269> it<00:00:26.420> up<00:00:26.509> and<00:00:26.599> running<00:00:26.890> for<00:00:27.890> a<00:00:27.949> bit

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
already had it up and running for a bit

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.610 
already had it up and running for a bit
so<00:00:29.289> his<00:00:30.289> his<00:00:30.769> the<00:00:31.009> app<00:00:31.099> the<00:00:32.060> app<00:00:32.090> like<00:00:32.900> logo<00:00:33.350> and

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
so his his the app the app like logo and

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.280 
so his his the app the app like logo and
it's<00:00:34.610> so<00:00:35.090> it's<00:00:35.270> called<00:00:35.450> slow<00:00:35.660> pro<00:00:35.900> I've<00:00:36.110> never

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
it's so it's called slow pro I've never

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.770 
it's so it's called slow pro I've never
actually<00:00:36.560> seen<00:00:36.740> it<00:00:36.890> in<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:37.880> charts<00:00:38.420> of<00:00:38.570> the

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
actually seen it in the charts of the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.580 
actually seen it in the charts of the
app<00:00:38.870> store<00:00:39.700> but<00:00:40.700> I<00:00:40.969> really<00:00:41.870> like<00:00:42.110> it<00:00:42.410> i<00:00:42.530> think

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
app store but I really like it i think

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.860 
app store but I really like it i think
it's<00:00:42.920> really<00:00:43.399> good<00:00:43.579> at<00:00:43.730> for<00:00:44.030> slow<00:00:44.239> motion<00:00:44.719> uh

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
it's really good at for slow motion uh

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.279 
it's really good at for slow motion uh
it<00:00:45.860> doesn't<00:00:46.280> work<00:00:46.730> as<00:00:46.940> well<00:00:46.969> as<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:47.570> iphone<00:00:48.079> on

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
it doesn't work as well as the iphone on

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:51.580 
it doesn't work as well as the iphone on
the<00:00:48.410> ipod<00:00:48.800> i'm<00:00:49.010> doing<00:00:49.309> on<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.610> ipod<00:00:50.000> but<00:00:50.590> yeah

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
the ipod i'm doing on the ipod but yeah

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.670 
the ipod i'm doing on the ipod but yeah
so<00:00:52.239> i'm<00:00:53.239> not<00:00:53.420> sure<00:00:53.510> or<00:00:53.780> too<00:00:53.960> sure<00:00:54.289> about<00:00:54.320> the

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
so i'm not sure or too sure about the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.520 
so i'm not sure or too sure about the
ipad<00:00:55.039> but<00:00:55.789> let's<00:00:56.030> launch<00:00:56.329> it<00:00:56.660> and<00:00:56.809> i'll<00:00:57.289> go

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
ipad but let's launch it and i'll go

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.069 
ipad but let's launch it and i'll go
back<00:00:57.859> this<00:00:58.219> is<00:00:58.370> one<00:00:58.489> of<00:00:58.519> my<00:00:58.699> videos<00:00:58.879> which<00:00:59.510> I

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
back this is one of my videos which I

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.580 
back this is one of my videos which I
did<00:01:00.260> but<00:01:00.440> i'll<00:01:00.980> show<00:01:01.519> you<00:01:01.579> that<00:01:01.789> bit<00:01:02.120> later<00:01:02.590> so

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
did but i'll show you that bit later so

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.040 
did but i'll show you that bit later so
if<00:01:03.739> you<00:01:03.859> go<00:01:03.980> back<00:01:04.129> to<00:01:04.309> camera<00:01:04.550> so<00:01:05.420> it<00:01:05.449> wouldn't

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
if you go back to camera so it wouldn't

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.760 
if you go back to camera so it wouldn't
it<00:01:06.230> first<00:01:06.650> it<00:01:06.860> will<00:01:06.920> load<00:01:07.220> and<00:01:08.080> so<00:01:09.080> you<00:01:09.140> hurt

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
it first it will load and so you hurt

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.789 
it first it will load and so you hurt
you'll<00:01:09.980> get<00:01:10.220> the<00:01:10.370> camera<00:01:10.880> it<00:01:11.299> records<00:01:12.290> in

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
you'll get the camera it records in

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.130 
you'll get the camera it records in
normal<00:01:13.340> motion<00:01:13.549> and<00:01:13.880> start<00:01:14.210> doesn't<00:01:14.540> record

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
normal motion and start doesn't record

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.940 
normal motion and start doesn't record
in<00:01:15.350> slow<00:01:15.619> motion<00:01:15.830> that<00:01:16.070> star<00:01:16.369> but<00:01:17.140> it<00:01:18.140> went

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
in slow motion that star but it went

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.130 
in slow motion that star but it went
when<00:01:19.280> you<00:01:19.490> finish<00:01:20.119> recording<00:01:20.420> it'll<00:01:20.840> go<00:01:20.960> it'll

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
when you finish recording it'll go it'll

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.560 
when you finish recording it'll go it'll
go<00:01:21.530> into<00:01:21.740> a<00:01:21.920> selected<00:01:22.579> air<00:01:22.729> it'll<00:01:23.060> go<00:01:23.210> into<00:01:23.360> an

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
go into a selected air it'll go into an

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.440 
go into a selected air it'll go into an
area<00:01:23.780> within<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:24.890> like<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.460> icon<00:01:25.850> like<00:01:26.150> a<00:01:26.180> you

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
area within the like the icon like a you

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.060 
area within the like the icon like a you
see<00:01:26.509> it<00:01:26.689> would<00:01:26.869> see<00:01:27.049> in<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:27.409> normal<00:01:27.710> camera<00:01:27.890> on

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
see it would see in the normal camera on

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.240 
see it would see in the normal camera on
the<00:01:28.159> ipod<00:01:28.549> or<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:28.970> iphone<00:01:29.390> or<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.720> ipad<00:01:30.250> and

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
the ipod or the iphone or the ipad and

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.840 
the ipod or the iphone or the ipad and
then<00:01:31.520> it<00:01:31.640> will<00:01:31.729> convert<00:01:32.000> itself<00:01:32.329> into<00:01:33.850> slow

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
then it will convert itself into slow

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.109 
then it will convert itself into slow
motion<00:01:34.880> so<00:01:35.780> basically<00:01:36.530> basically<00:01:37.040> there's<00:01:37.759> um

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
motion so basically basically there's um

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.210 
motion so basically basically there's um
there's<00:01:39.549> three<00:01:40.549> three<00:01:41.149> frames<00:01:41.659> of<00:01:41.930> motion<00:01:42.590> or

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
there's three three frames of motion or

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.690 
there's three three frames of motion or
motion<00:01:44.000> are<00:01:44.390> there<00:01:44.810> slow<00:01:45.170> slower<00:01:45.799> and<00:01:46.130> slowest

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
motion are there slow slower and slowest

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.340 
motion are there slow slower and slowest
and<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:48.369> the<00:01:49.369> best<00:01:49.640> one<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.390> ipod<00:01:50.869> works<00:01:51.110> on

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
and and the best one the ipod works on

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.499 
and and the best one the ipod works on
is<00:01:51.530> slower<00:01:51.860> it<00:01:52.700> probably<00:01:53.000> works<00:01:53.119> a<00:01:53.270> bit<00:01:53.390> when

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
is slower it probably works a bit when

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:54.999 
is slower it probably works a bit when
on<00:01:53.689> slow<00:01:54.020> bomb<00:01:54.259> not<00:01:54.500> too<00:01:54.680> sure<00:01:54.799> i<00:01:54.860> haven't

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
on slow bomb not too sure i haven't

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.940 
on slow bomb not too sure i haven't
tried<00:01:55.189> slow<00:01:55.549> out<00:01:55.850> but<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.930> slowest<00:01:57.530> is<00:01:57.740> a<00:01:57.770> bit

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
tried slow out but the slowest is a bit

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.609 
tried slow out but the slowest is a bit
clunky<00:01:58.219> and<00:01:58.520> it<00:01:58.850> doesn't<00:01:59.180> work<00:01:59.329> as<00:01:59.540> well<00:01:59.619> but

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
clunky and it doesn't work as well but

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.260 
clunky and it doesn't work as well but
so<00:02:01.549> then<00:02:01.820> there's<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.119> paid<00:02:02.479> version<00:02:02.750> as<00:02:03.049> well

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
so then there's a paid version as well

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.730 
so then there's a paid version as well
which<00:02:05.270> is<00:02:05.299> which<00:02:05.990> is<00:02:06.020> 149<00:02:06.680> and<00:02:07.340> it<00:02:07.820> it<00:02:08.740> exports

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
which is which is 149 and it it exports

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.010 
which is which is 149 and it it exports
its<00:02:09.860> camera<00:02:10.280> roll<00:02:10.460> and<00:02:10.490> email<00:02:11.360> videos<00:02:11.780> it's

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
its camera roll and email videos it's

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.430 
its camera roll and email videos it's
got<00:02:12.170> few<00:02:12.410> other<00:02:12.530> features<00:02:12.770> as<00:02:13.220> well<00:02:13.360> but<00:02:14.360> um<00:02:14.630> so

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
got few other features as well but um so

across my front room so as you see it is

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.020 
across my front room so as you see it is
ok<00:02:33.109> but<00:02:33.620> sometimes<00:02:34.189> it<00:02:34.400> goes<00:02:34.549> a<00:02:34.609> bit<00:02:34.969> like

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
ok but sometimes it goes a bit like

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.330 
ok but sometimes it goes a bit like
flashy<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:38.750> also<00:02:38.959> called<00:02:39.439> sound<00:02:39.739> in<00:02:39.980> slow

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
flashy it also called sound in slow

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.990 
flashy it also called sound in slow
motions<00:02:40.790> so<00:02:41.299> so<00:02:42.170> that's<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:42.829> and<00:02:44.409> so<00:02:46.000> basically

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
motions so so that's it and so basically

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.149 
motions so so that's it and so basically
it<00:02:48.069> sometimes<00:02:49.069> takes<00:02:50.409> takes<00:02:51.409> quite<00:02:51.739> a<00:02:51.799> bit<00:02:51.859> to

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 
it sometimes takes takes quite a bit to

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.250 
it sometimes takes takes quite a bit to
convert<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:52.939> depending<00:02:53.540> how<00:02:53.689> long<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.139> video

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
convert it depending how long the video

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:02.080 
convert it depending how long the video
is<00:02:54.489> but<00:02:55.489> I<00:02:56.319> say<00:02:58.299> it<00:02:59.299> if<00:03:00.049> it<00:03:00.459> down<00:03:01.459> quite<00:03:01.819> short

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
is but I say it if it down quite short

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.420 
is but I say it if it down quite short
and<00:03:02.269> it<00:03:02.450> was<00:03:02.480> it<00:03:02.930> was<00:03:02.989> owes<00:03:03.620> better<00:03:04.099> than<00:03:04.280> I

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
and it was it was owes better than I

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.759 
and it was it was owes better than I
actually<00:03:05.000> expected<00:03:05.299> it<00:03:05.900> when<00:03:06.109> I<00:03:06.139> recorded<00:03:06.530> it

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
actually expected it when I recorded it

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.179 
actually expected it when I recorded it
because<00:03:07.069> I'm<00:03:07.250> it's<00:03:08.150> usually<00:03:08.629> if<00:03:08.870> it's<00:03:09.469> long<00:03:09.829> if

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:10.189 
because I'm it's usually if it's long if

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.490 
because I'm it's usually if it's long if
it's<00:03:10.459> too<00:03:10.669> long<00:03:10.879> it<00:03:11.090> will<00:03:11.150> go<00:03:11.329> slower<00:03:11.780> it'll<00:03:12.260> go

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
it's too long it will go slower it'll go

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.849 
it's too long it will go slower it'll go
like<00:03:12.680> really<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.599> conky<00:03:14.599> and<00:03:14.840> it<00:03:14.959> won't<00:03:15.200> do<00:03:15.650> is

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
like really a conky and it won't do is

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:20.649 
like really a conky and it won't do is
better<00:03:16.629> recording<00:03:17.629> quality<00:03:17.870> but<00:03:18.829> I<00:03:19.510> would<00:03:20.510> say

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:20.659 
better recording quality but I would say

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:22.780 
better recording quality but I would say
this<00:03:20.810> is<00:03:20.870> really<00:03:21.169> good<00:03:21.409> really<00:03:22.099> good<00:03:22.219> up<00:03:22.489> so

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790
