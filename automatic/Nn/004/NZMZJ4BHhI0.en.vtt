00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
see what happens but I think one thing

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.830 
see what happens but I think one thing
to<00:01:56.250> look<00:01:56.369> out<00:01:56.520> for<00:01:56.670> sure<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.060> Duke<00:01:57.329> obviously

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
to look out for sure is Duke obviously

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.719 
to look out for sure is Duke obviously
looks<00:01:58.170> for<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.500> 3-ball<00:01:58.890> they<00:01:59.250> didn't<00:01:59.520> do<00:01:59.610> that

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
looks for the 3-ball they didn't do that

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.340 
looks for the 3-ball they didn't do that
well<00:01:59.939> last<00:02:00.149> time<00:02:00.390> against<00:02:00.659> NC<00:02:00.810> State

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
well last time against NC State

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.929 
well last time against NC State
well<00:02:01.500> they<00:02:01.619> didn't<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.340> they're<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.670> team

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
well they didn't and they're a team

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.190

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
confidence right now they're playing

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.399 
confidence right now they're playing
smaller<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.210> there's<00:02:06.420> more<00:02:06.630> space<00:02:07.049> on<00:02:07.229> the

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
smaller so there's more space on the

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.680 
smaller so there's more space on the
court<00:02:07.680> very<00:02:08.250> few<00:02:08.520> times<00:02:08.759> do<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.060> see<00:02:09.300> Okafor

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690
