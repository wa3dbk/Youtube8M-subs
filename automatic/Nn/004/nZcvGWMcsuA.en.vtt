foods awful talk about protein because

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.050 
foods awful talk about protein because
everyone<00:00:04.319> says<00:00:04.350> oh<00:00:04.890> you<00:00:05.730> want<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:05.940> be

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910 
vegetarian where do you get your protein

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
thing as protein the only thing that

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.720 
thing as protein the only thing that
we're<00:00:18.090> interested<00:00:18.240> in<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.480> amino<00:00:18.840> acids<00:00:19.350> I

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
we're interested in is amino acids I

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.429 
we're interested in is amino acids I
Minister<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.850> end<00:00:20.970> did<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.210> get<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.810> spectrum

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
Minister the end did I get the spectrum

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.769 
Minister the end did I get the spectrum

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
according to its biological design I'd

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.730 
according to its biological design I'd
according<00:02:02.780> my<00:02:02.810> biological<00:02:03.140> dining<00:02:03.649> on

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
according my biological dining on

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.889 
according my biological dining on
extreme<00:02:04.009> variety<00:02:04.750> interested<00:02:05.750> in

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
extreme variety interested in

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.279 
extreme variety interested in
intelligence<00:02:06.740> quality<00:02:07.579> not<00:02:07.610> quantity<00:02:08.289> okay

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
intelligence quality not quantity okay

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.740

so<00:02:09.769> this<00:02:10.280> stuff<00:02:10.549> is<00:02:10.610> what<00:02:10.880> I<00:02:10.910> call<00:02:11.150> a<00:02:11.180> primary

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
so this stuff is what I call a primary

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.509 
so this stuff is what I call a primary
everything<00:02:12.170> else<00:02:12.319> we<00:02:12.410> use<00:02:12.560> just<00:02:12.799> for<00:02:12.830> fun<00:02:13.190> that

everything else we use just for fun that
I<00:02:13.549> call<00:02:13.819> the<00:02:13.940> supplement<00:02:14.450> yeah<00:02:15.380> which<00:02:15.799> is<00:02:15.950> a

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
I call the supplement yeah which is a

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.520 
I call the supplement yeah which is a
bit<00:02:16.190> of<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.430> juxtaposition<00:02:17.330> for<00:02:18.230> what<00:02:18.350> most

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
bit of a juxtaposition for what most

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.410 
bit of a juxtaposition for what most
people<00:02:18.799> see<00:02:18.980> when<00:02:19.100> they<00:02:19.160> see<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.459> little<00:02:19.760> bottle

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
people see when they see a little bottle

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.990 
people see when they see a little bottle
of<00:02:20.540> stuff<00:02:20.840> yeah<00:02:21.170> this<00:02:21.980> stuff<00:02:22.220> is<00:02:22.250> in<00:02:22.489> capsule

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
drink green you build blood because of

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.830 
drink green you build blood because of
that<00:03:12.860> ability<00:03:13.860> that<00:03:14.220> very<00:03:14.610> mystical<00:03:15.360> ability

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
of transmutation where the body can take

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.970 
of transmutation where the body can take
the<00:03:18.270> Claudine<00:03:18.660> i'm<00:03:18.930> using<00:03:19.200> out<00:03:19.350> put<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.680> iron

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
the Claudine i'm using out put the iron

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:29.340 
the Claudine i'm using out put the iron
in<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.430> move<00:03:20.850> on<00:03:21.320> okay

pesticide yeah so be very careful
pesticides<00:03:32.950> for<00:03:33.220> sure<00:03:33.460> pesticides<00:03:34.090> are<00:03:34.090> very

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
pesticides for sure pesticides are very

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.910 
pesticides for sure pesticides are very
dangerous<00:03:35.520> to<00:03:36.520> wash<00:03:36.820> your<00:03:37.150> food<00:03:37.450> well<00:03:37.720> if<00:03:38.710> it's

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
dangerous to wash your food well if it's

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.560 
dangerous to wash your food well if it's
a<00:03:39.070> fruit<00:03:39.280> of<00:03:39.460> the<00:03:39.520> skin<00:03:39.970> that<00:03:40.120> you<00:03:40.150> meet<00:03:40.390> the

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
a fruit of the skin that you meet the

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.590 
a fruit of the skin that you meet the
skin<00:03:40.870> wash<00:03:41.200> it<00:03:41.440> very<00:03:41.830> very<00:03:42.190> well<00:03:42.600> pesticides

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
skin wash it very very well pesticides

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.200 
skin wash it very very well pesticides
are<00:03:44.010> amazingly<00:03:45.010> dangerous<00:03:45.610> they<00:03:45.790> really

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.210 
are amazingly dangerous they really

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.270 
are amazingly dangerous they really
really<00:03:46.750> are<00:03:46.990> because<00:03:47.620> they<00:03:47.770> mimic<00:03:48.100> your

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
really are because they mimic your

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.980 
really are because they mimic your
hormones<00:03:48.730> which<00:03:49.300> is<00:03:49.390> one<00:03:49.480> of<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.600> reasons<00:03:49.870> why

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
hormones which is one of the reasons why

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.980 
hormones which is one of the reasons why
sewing<00:03:50.440> looks<00:03:50.620> not<00:03:50.830> so<00:03:50.860> good<00:03:51.280> that<00:03:51.850> soy<00:03:52.210> milk

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
sewing looks not so good that soy milk

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.230 
sewing looks not so good that soy milk
not<00:03:53.470> tofu<00:03:53.800> took<00:03:54.070> was<00:03:54.220> pretty<00:03:54.430> good<00:03:54.580> but<00:03:55.000> soy

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
not tofu took was pretty good but soy

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.120 
not tofu took was pretty good but soy
milk<00:03:55.630> is<00:03:55.870> such<00:03:56.050> a<00:03:56.080> concentrated<00:03:56.650> form<00:03:56.740> that

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
milk is such a concentrated form that

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.530 
milk is such a concentrated form that
soy<00:03:57.700> milk<00:03:58.320> so<00:03:59.320> I<00:03:59.350> has<00:03:59.800> any<00:04:00.330> molecule<00:04:01.330> that

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
soy milk so I has any molecule that

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.760 
soy milk so I has any molecule that
mimics<00:04:02.020> estrogen<00:04:02.260> as<00:04:03.090> an<00:04:04.090> estrogen<00:04:04.540> mimic<00:04:04.900> so

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
mimics estrogen as an estrogen mimic so

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.400 
mimics estrogen as an estrogen mimic so
it's<00:04:06.490> not<00:04:06.730> impossible<00:04:07.180> that<00:04:07.570> if<00:04:07.780> you<00:04:07.870> overdo

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
it's not impossible that if you overdo

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.440 
it's not impossible that if you overdo
soils<00:04:09.010> you<00:04:09.100> can<00:04:09.280> confuse<00:04:09.730> your<00:04:10.030> body's

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
soils you can confuse your body's
