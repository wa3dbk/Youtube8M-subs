00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.799
 hey my friends king roger but small 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.450
 that is too hot and wants to come more 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.480
 welcome video in a channel 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.820
 our what are you doing in our 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.680
 The lawn is running at the celica 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.400
 that makes you a deaf or dove 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.400
 provided that 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.670
 the birds of today no respect anymore 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.400
 no shit what we shortly socks him 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:37.080
 Wear and then continue right now 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.400
 and yes people get the video on here 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.930
 the idyllic garden at it is a 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:46.380
 Last time as is the weather or 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.770
 How do you really appreciate what you are? 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.870
 actually the problem so that is 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.030
 that's why I have my video 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.620
 out there and today, come on 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.700
 hire the to undress bring it 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.320
 There are not many things that affect me 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.900
 really really aggressive then you have to 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.520
 i do not say so much but if this 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.670
 things that were aggressive to me 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.070
 happen that I is then passed 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.170
 simply things do not happen 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.060
 make sense and if that happens then 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:19.530
 just think so why is that 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.990
 Now what happens is something like that 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:29.250
 For example , I have been a mobile phone sometimes 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:32.510
 I just want to write when I write 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.799
 open words here I open whatsapp 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.930
 and then sometimes that works 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.370
 keyboard just not me but I can 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.590
 can send the audio 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.080
 but it can not write just like that 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.600
 without reason and I just think something 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.700
 is your problem handy there it is with me 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.860
 then quickly over if things 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.229
 they just do not make sense 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.150
 surrendered and just forgave 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.920
 what is now the whole thing is a mark of 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.840
 after five minutes or so works 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:06.260
 just smc just that again 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:06.260
 just makes little old ones 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:36.439
 that 's it with the video for this 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.439
 now will 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.810
 these 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:57.650
 that is also what you have again 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:03:00.150
 totally exciting why the day has 24 24 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.860
 hours 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:09.970
 24 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:12.250
 Now that I know the video does not fit 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.260
 quite atmospheric now she stops because 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.120
 the construction work is all the way to loud 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.650
 casting calculator an increased left 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.140
 right combination the copper towns 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.850
 but it will be short to say 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.690
 a look at the last video I 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.550
 link this around in the video 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.500
 description has given a lot of effort 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.390
 I sat there really really long so me 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.950
 would be really cool but i was sitting there 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.300
 really long but when I have a video 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.670
 really long to sit then already 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.170
 what do I think the more active ones 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.550
 and older subscribers among you 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.900
 have been around longer know that too 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.320
 if your tip does not exist 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.850
 know 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.500
 that made us mega bock that we ourselves 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.760
 still really elaborately designed so I 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.800
 would be happy if only just once 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.510
 arrival strip bizarre situation the 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.830
 you so incredibly aggressive man because 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.180
 they just do not make sense now 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.920
 not if you are playing somehow 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.020
 strengthens or so but if anything 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:04:00.160
 literal situations do not make sense 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:01.930
 results and simply rated absurd 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.709
 do not forget to comment and until 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.350
 next video now if you are on me 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.700
 tell me they've heard me say 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.440
 you who have heard me the 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.709
 stealth that make them 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.390
 deliberately I am was inside you 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.480
 that you did moderation and 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.480
 now 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.280
 it does not itch at all 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.140
 you still 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:33.350
 All right, I know current 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.680
