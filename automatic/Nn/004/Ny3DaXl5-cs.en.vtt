00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.440 
these bolts which they might be a little
bit<00:02:30.350> hard<00:02:31.340> let<00:02:31.580> me<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:31.910> we<00:02:31.970> go<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.210> put<00:02:32.330> this

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
bit hard let me and we go to put this

00:02:32.450 --> 00:03:01.830 
bit hard let me and we go to put this
down<00:02:32.630> again

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.540 

yeah<00:03:02.840> that<00:03:03.050> this<00:03:03.319> is<00:03:03.500> brick<00:03:03.800> this<00:03:03.980> is<00:03:04.040> really

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
yeah that this is brick this is really

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.860 
yeah that this is brick this is really
really<00:03:04.760> really<00:03:05.150> stuck<00:03:05.540> on<00:03:05.660> there

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:20.100 

okay

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.940 

okay<00:03:21.110> so<00:03:21.170> I<00:03:21.319> removed<00:03:21.739> a<00:03:21.980> remove<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.819> module<00:03:23.950> if

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
okay so I removed a remove the module if

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.690 
okay so I removed a remove the module if
you<00:03:25.099> need<00:03:25.310> help<00:03:26.230> torquing<00:03:27.230> it<00:03:27.319> this<00:03:27.530> is<00:03:27.680> a<00:03:27.709> 13

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
you need help torquing it this is a 13

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.300 
you need help torquing it this is a 13
millimeter<00:03:28.970> wrench<00:03:29.739> that<00:03:30.739> could<00:03:31.040> help<00:03:31.129> you

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
millimeter wrench that could help you

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.220 
millimeter wrench that could help you
torque<00:03:31.610> it<00:03:34.239> what<00:03:35.239> I<00:03:35.269> have<00:03:35.480> here<00:03:35.690> is<00:03:35.900> from

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
torque it what I have here is from

torque it what I have here is from
RadioShack<00:03:36.709> some<00:03:37.129> heat<00:03:37.340> sink<00:03:37.640> compound<00:03:37.819> which

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
RadioShack some heat sink compound which

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.000 
RadioShack some heat sink compound which
I'm<00:03:38.390> going<00:03:38.569> to<00:03:38.629> rub<00:03:38.840> back<00:03:39.769> here<00:03:40.129> and<00:03:41.830> to<00:03:42.830> go

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
I'm going to rub back here and to go

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.780 
I'm going to rub back here and to go
inside<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:45.500> go<00:03:45.650> when<00:03:45.860> it<00:03:45.980> goes<00:03:46.129> back<00:03:46.370> in<00:03:46.549> I<00:03:46.670> had

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
inside to go when it goes back in I had

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.180 
inside to go when it goes back in I had
to<00:03:46.970> move<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.269> distributor<00:03:47.810> at<00:03:47.989> to<00:03:48.290> turn<00:03:48.860> it<00:03:49.010> a

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
to move the distributor at to turn it a

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.550 
to move the distributor at to turn it a
little<00:03:49.790> bit<00:03:50.090> but<00:03:50.510> make<00:03:50.690> sure<00:03:50.720> you<00:03:51.019> have<00:03:51.290> all

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
little bit but make sure you have all

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.000 
little bit but make sure you have all
your<00:03:52.150> markings<00:03:53.230> to<00:03:54.230> remember<00:03:54.560> where<00:03:54.709> it's<00:03:54.829> at

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
your markings to remember where it's at

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:03.910 
your markings to remember where it's at
I<00:03:58.150> did<00:03:59.150> lose<00:03:59.450> the<00:03:59.480> original<00:03:59.950> compounds<00:04:02.650> but<00:04:03.650> I

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
I did lose the original compounds but I

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.369 
I did lose the original compounds but I
do<00:04:04.010> have<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.519> heat<00:04:04.700> shrink<00:04:04.879> the<00:04:05.299> heat<00:04:05.780> feet

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
do have the heat shrink the heat feet

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:11.280 
do have the heat shrink the heat feet
sink<00:04:07.720> that<00:04:08.720> I<00:04:08.780> will<00:04:09.349> use<00:04:09.620> let<00:04:10.340> me<00:04:10.430> go<00:04:10.549> ahead<00:04:10.670> and

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
sink that I will use let me go ahead and

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:21.240 
sink that I will use let me go ahead and
sit<00:04:12.290> this<00:04:12.440> right<00:04:12.500> here

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:33.839 

it<00:04:22.250> was<00:04:22.430> it<00:04:22.640> was<00:04:22.700> $5.99<00:04:23.150> at<00:04:23.600> RadioShack

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:33.849 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:37.419 

so<00:04:34.849> this<00:04:35.029> is<00:04:35.209> a<00:04:35.240> heat<00:04:35.569> sink<00:04:35.929> solution<00:04:36.919> and<00:04:37.249> you

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:37.429 
so this is a heat sink solution and you

00:04:37.429 --> 00:04:44.980 
so this is a heat sink solution and you
ought<00:04:37.610> to<00:04:39.099> cover<00:04:40.099> it<00:04:43.389> and<00:04:44.389> just<00:04:44.569> spread<00:04:44.959> it

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
ought to cover it and just spread it

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.519 
ought to cover it and just spread it
spread<00:04:45.649> it<00:04:45.949> as<00:04:46.279> much<00:04:46.639> as<00:04:47.509> you<00:04:48.050> can<00:04:48.229> you<00:04:48.289> might

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:48.529 
spread it as much as you can you might

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:50.199 
spread it as much as you can you might
even<00:04:48.679> have<00:04:48.860> to<00:04:48.889> take<00:04:49.099> some<00:04:49.249> yeah<00:04:49.459> that<00:04:49.819> takes<00:04:50.089> a

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:50.209

carry<00:06:29.750> a<00:06:29.810> 13<00:06:30.350> inch<00:06:31.300> wrench<00:06:32.300> as<00:06:32.720> well<00:06:33.460> you<00:06:34.460> will

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 
carry a 13 inch wrench as well you will

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.280 
carry a 13 inch wrench as well you will
need<00:06:34.910> this<00:06:35.180> I<00:06:35.360> had<00:06:35.510> this<00:06:35.660> laying<00:06:35.930> around<00:06:36.080> the

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:36.290 
need this I had this laying around the

work you could remove the distributor

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:48.330 
work you could remove the distributor
bolt<00:06:44.420> to<00:06:45.200> loosen<00:06:45.560> it<00:06:45.680> so<00:06:45.860> you<00:06:46.340> could<00:06:46.490> move

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:48.340 
bolt to loosen it so you could move

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:55.060 
bolt to loosen it so you could move
you're<00:06:49.340> going<00:06:49.460> to<00:06:49.550> want<00:06:49.700> your<00:06:49.850> old<00:06:50.000> module<00:06:54.070> so
