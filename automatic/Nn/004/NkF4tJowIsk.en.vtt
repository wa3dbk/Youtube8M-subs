about each one and point out what i

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.420 
about each one and point out what i
consider<00:00:26.140> to<00:00:26.230> be<00:00:26.439> some<00:00:26.770> pretty<00:00:27.160> big

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
consider to be some pretty big

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.630 
consider to be some pretty big
differences<00:00:28.090> between<00:00:28.390> the<00:00:28.869> two<00:00:29.310> now<00:00:30.310> i

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
differences between the two now i

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.210 
differences between the two now i
understand<00:00:31.330> that<00:00:31.510> all<00:00:31.720> BB<00:00:32.439> creams<00:00:32.739> are<00:00:33.010> not

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
understand that all BB creams are not

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.390 
understand that all BB creams are not
created<00:00:33.790> equal<00:00:33.790> and<00:00:34.420> that<00:00:34.510> each<00:00:35.140> one<00:00:35.590> can<00:00:36.340> be

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
created equal and that each one can be

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.189 
created equal and that each one can be
completely<00:00:37.059> different<00:00:37.480> than<00:00:37.629> the<00:00:37.720> next<00:00:37.989> one

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
completely different than the next one

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.560 
completely different than the next one
but<00:00:38.739> I<00:00:38.769> think<00:00:39.100> for<00:00:39.309> somebody<00:00:39.820> who<00:00:40.120> has<00:00:40.299> never

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
but I think for somebody who has never

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.500 
but I think for somebody who has never
used<00:00:40.900> BB<00:00:41.379> creams<00:00:41.650> before<00:00:42.809> there<00:00:43.809> can<00:00:44.140> be<00:00:44.199> some

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
used BB creams before there can be some

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.270 
used BB creams before there can be some
some<00:00:46.510> big<00:00:46.690> differences<00:00:46.930> from<00:00:47.739> what<00:00:47.949> I<00:00:47.979> can<00:00:48.129> see

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
some big differences from what I can see

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.140 
some big differences from what I can see
from<00:00:48.940> one<00:00:49.269> to<00:00:49.510> the<00:00:49.540> next<00:00:49.659> I<00:00:50.339> went<00:00:51.339> to<00:00:51.670> both

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
from one to the next I went to both

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.009 
from one to the next I went to both

Misha<00:01:03.760> today<00:01:04.210> and<00:01:04.510> I<00:01:05.409> read<00:01:05.680> all<00:01:05.830> the

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
Misha today and I read all the

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.710 
Misha today and I read all the
information<00:01:06.130> and<00:01:06.820> I<00:01:06.970> looked<00:01:07.210> at<00:01:07.360> all<00:01:07.510> the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
information and I looked at all the

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.649 
information and I looked at all the
different<00:01:07.840> products<00:01:08.650> that<00:01:08.890> they<00:01:09.070> had<00:01:09.340> and<00:01:09.670> I

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
different products that they had and I

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.890 
different products that they had and I
think<00:01:11.530> after<00:01:12.150> reading<00:01:13.150> the<00:01:13.450> things<00:01:13.690> on<00:01:13.870> the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
think after reading the things on the

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.430 
think after reading the things on the
website<00:01:14.440> and<00:01:14.740> using<00:01:15.550> them<00:01:15.700> myself<00:01:15.970> I<00:01:16.690> think

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
website and using them myself I think

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.230 
website and using them myself I think
it's<00:01:17.590> really<00:01:17.920> important<00:01:18.670> that<00:01:18.700> if<00:01:19.030> you're

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
it's really important that if you're

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.950 
it's really important that if you're
going<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.600> buy<00:01:19.990> a<00:01:20.020> BB<00:01:20.680> cream<00:01:20.890> that<00:01:21.850> you<00:01:21.880> get<00:01:22.780> all

this information up front because until

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.420

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.339 
one was for oily skin now you guys all
know<00:03:07.900> that<00:03:08.109> I<00:03:08.139> have<00:03:08.349> dry<00:03:08.590> skin<00:03:08.949> however<00:03:09.959> it<00:03:10.959> was

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
know that I have dry skin however it was

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.539 
know that I have dry skin however it was
very<00:03:11.919> moisturizing<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:13.359> I<00:03:13.859> can't<00:03:14.859> really<00:03:15.189> see

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
very moisturizing and I can't really see

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:17.919 
that working on somebody with oily skin

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:19.229 
that working on somebody with oily skin
because<00:03:18.489> I<00:03:18.579> think<00:03:18.669> it<00:03:18.879> would<00:03:19.030> have<00:03:19.120> been<00:03:19.180> a

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
because I think it would have been a

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.300 
because I think it would have been a
problem<00:03:19.540> for<00:03:19.780> them<00:03:20.549> so<00:03:21.549> it's<00:03:22.049> very<00:03:23.049> very

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
problem for them so it's very very

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.899 
problem for them so it's very very

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.270 
applying it the first thing i noticed
about<00:04:06.759> this<00:04:07.329> is<00:04:07.629> that<00:04:08.049> it<00:04:08.469> was<00:04:08.650> more<00:04:08.949> like<00:04:09.250> a

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
about this is that it was more like a

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.899 
about this is that it was more like a
traditional<00:04:09.750> foundation<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:11.439> skin<00:04:11.739> 79<00:04:12.129> one

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
traditional foundation the skin 79 one

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:16.670 
traditional foundation the skin 79 one
was<00:04:13.719> had<00:04:14.169> a<00:04:14.199> very<00:04:14.439> thick<00:04:14.829> consistency<00:04:15.069> to<00:04:15.879> it<00:04:15.909> I

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
was had a very thick consistency to it I

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.899 
was had a very thick consistency to it I
wasn't<00:04:17.680> all<00:04:18.099> that<00:04:18.130> easy<00:04:18.669> to<00:04:20.039> blend<00:04:21.039> because<00:04:21.430> of

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:21.909 
wasn't all that easy to blend because of

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:26.040 
wasn't all that easy to blend because of
that<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.870> Misha<00:04:23.199> is<00:04:24.509> very<00:04:25.509> much<00:04:25.750> like<00:04:25.990> a

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
that the Misha is very much like a

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.399 
that the Misha is very much like a
liquid<00:04:26.370> foundation<00:04:27.370> and<00:04:27.639> the<00:04:27.900> coverage<00:04:28.900> on<00:04:29.199> it

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:29.409

was shocked because

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.350 
was shocked because
I<00:04:35.080> wasn't<00:04:35.919> expecting<00:04:36.160> that<00:04:36.550> I<00:04:36.970> didn't<00:04:37.270> even

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
I wasn't expecting that I didn't even

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.420 
I wasn't expecting that I didn't even
