00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.150
 hello and welcome reports 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.309
 they are here on the ifa innovation- 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.189
 media briefing in berlin in advance of the 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.349
 ifa and have the opportunity and sat lg 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.869
 4c have to look 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:26.630
 probably in the third 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:29.779
 quarter on the german market in july 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.789
 by the way, the lg g4s is coming 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.860
 not the LG 4c on the market this 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.930
 model of largely identical with 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.159
 the lg gpc what we have in front of us 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.370
 only difference is that we are here 

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:42.229
 when lg gtc no reader autofocus and 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.390
 no color sensor would have that today 

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:46.729
 still a recess left of the 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.070
 main camera this is the lg 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:52.710
 gps available but for this model 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.739
 there is no official price yet 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.780
 the lg gpc what we have here if 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.370
 one of this device we hire here 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.050
 Of course, they also have this 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.000
 optional we also have the 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.470
 Possibility to double-click the device 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.390
 unlock all features love too 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.300
 other devices know as well 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.979
 This LG 4C is powered by one 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.020
 1.2 gigahertz fast quad core 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.310
 Processor as we see is natural 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.070
 also the screen of less than 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.070
 In fact, large LGG 4 would have to be in the 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.720
 diagonal 5 inches and the resolution up 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.460
 lower namely only hd resolution that 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.130
 means 1280 x 720 pixel which corresponds to 2 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.910
 194 g 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.250
 Of course there are more 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.200
 Differences to the big lgg four the ltg 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.759
 Of course, 4c also has the option 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.200
 to expand the memory by 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.619
 micro sd card, however, is the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.030
 internal memory lower with only 8 gb 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.720
 the memory is also only one 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.759
 gigabyte big as well which of course 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.710
 also a difference is the size of the 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.330
 We also see these batteries manually 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.460
 swaps as with the lg 4 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.720
 however, the lg becomes 14 o'clock of one 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.620
 2540 milliamp hours strong 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.810
 powered by energy storage 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.850
 worse equipped is the ltg 4c 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.590
 Also in terms of camera this one has 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.030
 resolution of 8 megapixel becomes 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.910
 supported by autofocus and of course 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.280
 a 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.110
 led lightning we see here as well 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.810
 Control over the riki too 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.160
 We know from various LG models 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.510
 also available in this model 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.310
 then we have the second camera 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.430
 on the front, the one since 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.960
 resolution of five megapixels and also 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.260
 an interval 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.240
 which we see here runs the lg 4c 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.660
 android 5.2 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.160
 in contrast to the lg g4s what soon 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.700
 also come to the market that has me 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.069
 android 5.1 point 1 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.720
 As we can see, the LG g14 also has it 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.780
 about those of other LG models 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.950
 announced the known dropdown menu 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.300
 the whole interfaces the one 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.920
 just turn it on and off 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.450
 Among other things, there is of course wlan 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.380
 on board as we see here and indeed 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.950
 on the versions bg and n bluetooth 4.1 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.170
 nfc and a-gps here on board the 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.840
 Russian loo wet can be found at the lg 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:13.489
 gtc on the internet the lg gtc surfs via lte 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.959
 the colors we have available here 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.540
 I can show here for a short time 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.549
 metallic silver as well there is this 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.560
 is still in gold and in the 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.560
 so-called ceramic white
