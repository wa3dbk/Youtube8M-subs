00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.519
 I greet you on the channel itself girls 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.269
 today we will make puppet ice cream in 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.449
 cup 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:48.199
 we will need a small size 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:51.289
 corks napkins and toilet paper or 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:55.039
 kitchen paper towels small 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.930
 small piece of sandpaper 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.410
 amount of water 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.920
 pva glue 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.979
 paint color paint 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.140
 depend on what we want to water 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.930
 our ice cream if chocolate only 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.690
 color brown if cream 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.090
 the paint should be white if any thread 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.400
 and jam then it should be maroon 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.400
 or red paint of course to us 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.680
 need a brush besides if we 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.960
 we want to later decorate the glass 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.110
 this can be done with a small 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.470
 size stickers or any and 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.170
 cuttings from magazines to start working 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.080
 small amount of paper can 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.890
 use wipes of any color well 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.080
 white color does not look very pretty 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:49.960
 so I decided to use yellow 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:53.830
 color a lot of water should not be 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:58.780
 fashion should just soften our mix 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:01.649
 now add klip va well 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.649
 mix 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.140
 if your cork smooth edge you 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.690
 do not need to do anything and if there are such 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:18.080
 notches then they can be sanded when 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:21.320
 sandpaper aid now edge 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:27.190
 cup turned out to be flat on the bottom 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:30.560
 cup tightly fill the paper 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.110
 so tight to practically 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.730
 there was no liquid now form 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:51.200
 small balls need to do 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:55.090
 quite plump resulting 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:03:00.230
 glass with ice cream dry when 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:02.840
 a mixture of napkin or paper will dry our 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.870
 ice cream will turn out absolutely firm 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.940
 he will not be threatened 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:13.730
 but for insurance it can be covered with a layer 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:17.060
 pva glue and now when our ice cream 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.050
 completely dried up decorate it with chocolate 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.050
 or cream 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.350
 a glass of ice cream can be decorated 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.290
 sticker that's all 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.180
 ice cream is ready sticks for him 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.180
 cut out of cardboard or 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.310
 from plastic for example white in color to all 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.820
 have a nice creativity and see you in 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.820
