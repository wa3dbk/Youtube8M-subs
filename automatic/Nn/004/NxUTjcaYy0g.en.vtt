 only for men and for women 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.900
 strictly speaking women's shirts 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:32.009
 resembling men's shirts 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.190
 this is the basis of any female wardrobe they 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.070
 absolutely necessary on the trap is 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.320
 that this shirt must be perfect 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.180
 the final one here she really cut 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.720
 rather, it should be cut, of course 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.330
 feminine but by the presence of decorative 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.390
 elements it should resemble masculine 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:55.410
 shirt is not necessary there to be ryushechki 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.870
 some curls 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.970
 elements on the fabric 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.490
 extra it buttons and so on 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.979
 etc. white shirt is good that 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.469
 she is a white shirt and no longer in it 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.920
 there must be nothing but a cut 

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:13.700
 good fit and quality materials 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.590
 here you can see the quality of cotton and 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.049
 bad cheap paws u turn white 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.429
 shirt in dirty gray or dirty 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.920
 yellow after two washes 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:26.249
 avoid this this shirt which for 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.280
 you have forever legs for many years except 

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:32.009
 this when you believe the shirt move 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.219
 hands you can not move if 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.140
 can it then yours if you can't 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:41.130
 take a cup of coffee without pulling 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.409
 all the muscles this shirt is not yours find it 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.240
 in fact the city ​​is very difficult in general 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.270
 much more difficult than some even 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.219
 little black dress 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.950
 besides this shirt 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:54.630
 fairly free or truly 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.939
 men's shirt or shirt that 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.039
 great great item very 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.229
 sexy very erotic element in 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.659
 woman's wardrobe because we start 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.280
 play the game masculine and feminine why 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.250
 she i put on where she slept 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.979
 and when we have this question where is she 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.400
 spent the night at women decently and it seems even 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.170
 as 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.780
 not good this question even think in this 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.790
 side of minds nonetheless can be everything 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.670
 did she spend the night somewhere why she 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.230
 this big shirt and this shirt 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.019
 really must be big she 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.700
 should be free to under it 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.640
 contrast, the woman looked the most 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.370
 fragile and here we have one very 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.980
 significant limitation a woman should 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.970
 be fragile in order for this big 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.189
 the shirt on her looked beautiful and 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.519
 besides this she must be feminine 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:46.349
 essentially because we can play 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.750
 male female game just on 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.790
 the contrast when a woman is very feminine 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.069
 then her male experience will be 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.510
 emphasize her femininity and this 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.099
 femininity may be different is 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.359
 maybe very femininity 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:03.150
 puffy savory well I mean 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:05.579
 skater spicy Italians maybe 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.379
 be such a girl a boy with a few 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.909
 angular and stiff femininity 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.900
 but still this femininity should 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:15.900
 read and even if the woman learned 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.940
 wear a simple men's shirt for her 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.889
 there is the most beautiful male 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.900
 shirts let her buy for a few 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:26.790
 sizes more tuxedo shirt there 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.889
 just yes there are decorative elements but 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.019
 men's tough enough she's in this 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:35.940
 the shirt can wrap the smell of nats 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:38.549
 put on a belt fill it up let it go 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.199
 the bottom line is that tuxedo shirt 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.329
 nothing is supposed at all except 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:45.840
 like for a tuxedo yes and if i can afford 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.819

 it's easy for me to play this game and 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.989
 In general, yes, I bought a lot of things, if I 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.319
 went and bought a tuxedo shirt 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.150
 it means that I have a lot of things even if 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.650
 it's not true 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.280
