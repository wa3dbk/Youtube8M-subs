match which is a really good sauce from

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.850 
match which is a really good sauce from
me<00:01:28.420> poaching<00:01:29.420> in<00:01:29.539> the<00:01:29.630> oil<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:30.229> roasted

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
me poaching in the oil and roasted

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.130 
me poaching in the oil and roasted
garlic<00:01:31.039> would<00:01:31.369> also<00:01:31.520> be<00:01:31.880> very<00:01:32.240> soft<00:01:32.689> and<00:01:32.930> easy

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.249 
garlic would also be very soft and easy
to<00:01:33.710> match<00:01:34.399> both<00:01:35.180> these<00:01:35.359> techniques<00:01:35.840> either

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
to match both these techniques either

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:37.870 
to match both these techniques either
poaching<00:01:36.710> in<00:01:36.829> the<00:01:36.920> oil<00:01:37.100> or<00:01:37.340> roasting<00:01:37.729> in<00:01:37.850> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.389 
poaching in the oil or roasting in the
oven<00:01:37.969> really<00:01:38.960> mellows<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:39.680> flavor<00:01:39.979> of<00:01:40.159> the

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
oven really mellows the flavor of the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.450 
oven really mellows the flavor of the
garment<00:01:40.670> so<00:01:41.390> it'll<00:01:41.570> be<00:01:41.600> afraid<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.530> use<00:01:43.219> so

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
garment so it'll be afraid to use so

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.609 
garment so it'll be afraid to use so
much<00:01:43.700> garlic<00:01:44.149> you<00:01:44.930> could<00:01:45.049> use<00:01:45.170> a<00:01:45.229> potato

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
much garlic you could use a potato

masher<00:01:45.799> for<00:01:46.369> this<00:01:46.490> too<00:01:46.789> but<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:48.079> fort<00:01:48.380> works

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
masher for this too but the fort works

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.880 
masher for this too but the fort works
very<00:01:49.700> well<00:01:49.899> and<00:01:50.899> I<00:01:51.020> don't<00:01:51.229> mind<00:01:51.409> a<00:01:51.500> little<00:01:51.679> bit

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
of texture you could also process and if

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.819 
of texture you could also process and if
