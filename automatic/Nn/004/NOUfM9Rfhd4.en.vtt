game<00:01:38.720> it<00:01:39.720> looks<00:01:40.079> like<00:01:40.350> they're<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.070> eraser

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
game it looks like they're the eraser

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.940

noticeable<00:01:42.119> difference<00:01:42.540> however<00:01:42.780> what<00:01:43.740> I

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
noticeable difference however what I

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.859 
noticeable difference however what I

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
would have liked to see was bigger and I

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.499 
would have liked to see was bigger and I
guess<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.380> could<00:01:49.649> be<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:50.159> bit<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:51.329> could

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
guess this could be a bit of this could

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.590 
guess this could be a bit of this could
be<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> bit<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.670> preference<00:01:53.670> thing<00:01:54.060> but<00:01:54.540> you

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
be a bit of a preference thing but you

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.330 
be a bit of a preference thing but you
can<00:01:54.720> see<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.079> there<00:01:55.320> there<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.860> lot<00:01:56.040> more

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.619 
stuff like that the blood from Pike's
being<00:02:16.829> poked<00:02:17.129> in<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.549> pulled<00:02:17.760> out<00:02:17.909> was

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
being poked in and pulled out was

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.179 
being poked in and pulled out was
something<00:02:19.019> and<00:02:19.409> of<00:02:19.500> course<00:02:19.709> I<00:02:19.829> know<00:02:19.890> that's

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
something and of course I know that's

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:21.860 
something and of course I know that's
not<00:02:20.340> something<00:02:20.549> radius<00:02:21.060> can<00:02:21.239> do

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
not something radius can do

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.539 
not something radius can do
that's<00:02:22.379> not<00:02:22.560> something<00:02:22.769> radius<00:02:23.250> can<00:02:23.430> do

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
that's not something radius can do

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.849 
that's not something radius can do
anything<00:02:23.790> about<00:02:24.000> so<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:25.019> is<00:02:25.170> not<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.439> him<00:02:25.620> the

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:25.859 
anything about so this is not to him the

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:28.550 
anything about so this is not to him the
his<00:02:26.189> mod<00:02:26.640> definitely<00:02:27.510> makes<00:02:27.750> this<00:02:28.170> look

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
his mod definitely makes this look

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.339 
his mod definitely makes this look
better<00:02:28.829> so<00:02:29.219> try<00:02:30.030> radius<00:02:30.450> is<00:02:30.599> mod<00:02:30.810> oh<00:02:31.019> there<00:02:31.260> we

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
better so try radius is mod oh there we

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.289 
better so try radius is mod oh there we
go<00:02:31.379> yeah<00:02:31.829> that<00:02:32.069> was<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.280> was<00:02:32.549> a<00:02:32.730> better

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
go yeah that was that was a better

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.539 
go yeah that was that was a better
effect<00:02:33.629> so<00:02:34.500> there<00:02:34.680> might<00:02:34.829> be<00:02:34.859> an<00:02:35.099> issue<00:02:35.219> here

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
effect so there might be an issue here

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.649 
effect so there might be an issue here
with<00:02:35.730> pikes<00:02:36.889> as<00:02:37.889> well<00:02:38.159> that<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.700> pike<00:02:39.060> effects

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
with pikes as well that the pike effects

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.349 
with pikes as well that the pike effects
or<00:02:40.040> horrible<00:02:41.040> because<00:02:41.219> the<00:02:41.730> sword<00:02:41.969> effects

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
or horrible because the sword effects

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:43.910 
or horrible because the sword effects
I've<00:02:42.480> tested<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.930> sword<00:02:43.170> effects<00:02:43.530> in<00:02:43.620> vanilla

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
I've tested the sword effects in vanilla

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.710 
I've tested the sword effects in vanilla
the<00:02:44.430> sort<00:02:44.670> effects<00:02:44.909> are<00:02:45.060> better<00:02:45.239> but<00:02:45.510> with

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
the sort effects are better but with

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.000 
the sort effects are better but with
radius<00:02:46.169> as<00:02:46.319> mod<00:02:46.470> they<00:02:46.680> are<00:02:46.859> just<00:02:47.480> insanely

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
radius as mod they are just insanely

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.440 
radius as mod they are just insanely
exaggerated<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.639> think<00:02:51.090> they<00:02:51.209> kind<00:02:51.389> of

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
exaggerated and I think they kind of

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.330 
exaggerated and I think they kind of
have<00:02:51.569> to<00:02:51.689> be<00:02:51.810> you<00:02:51.989> look<00:02:52.139> at<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.349> game<00:02:52.530> from<00:02:52.919> a

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
have to be you look at the game from a

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.920 
have to be you look at the game from a
distance<00:02:53.700> most<00:02:53.939> of<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.180> time<00:02:54.359> at<00:02:54.540> least<00:02:54.599> I<00:02:54.870> do

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
distance most of the time at least I do

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.240 
distance most of the time at least I do
I<00:02:55.200> think<00:02:56.189> it<00:02:56.970> looks<00:02:57.180> fairly<00:02:57.870> good<00:02:58.230> with<00:02:59.040> the

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
I think it looks fairly good with the

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.309 
I think it looks fairly good with the
exaggerated<00:02:59.790> blood<00:03:00.180> when<00:03:00.780> you're<00:03:00.930> buying<00:03:01.109> a

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
exaggerated blood when you're buying a

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.009 
exaggerated blood when you're buying a
blood<00:03:01.549> blood<00:03:02.549> and<00:03:02.879> burning<00:03:03.239> DLC<00:03:03.599> you<00:03:03.750> want<00:03:03.930> to

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
blood blood and burning DLC you want to

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.479 
blood blood and burning DLC you want to
see<00:03:04.169> some<00:03:04.349> blood<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.709> don't<00:03:04.739> just<00:03:05.159> want<00:03:05.400> to

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
see some blood you don't just want to

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.750 
see some blood you don't just want to
see<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.150> few<00:03:06.389> specs<00:03:06.780> on<00:03:07.049> the<00:03:07.139> unit<00:03:07.379> so

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
see a few specs on the unit so

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.069 
see a few specs on the unit so
definitely<00:03:08.760> recommend<00:03:09.209> getting<00:03:09.359> radius<00:03:09.930> this

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
definitely recommend getting radius this

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.619 
definitely recommend getting radius this
version<00:03:10.319> of<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:10.799> if<00:03:11.519> you<00:03:12.000> are<00:03:12.150> going<00:03:12.359> to<00:03:12.480> get

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
version of this if you are going to get

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.050 
version of this if you are going to get
the<00:03:12.840> DLC<00:03:13.370> in<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.519> first<00:03:14.730> place

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
the DLC in the first place

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.199 
the DLC in the first place
which<00:03:15.389> I<00:03:15.659> really<00:03:15.930> wouldn't<00:03:16.530> recommend<00:03:16.799> I<00:03:17.790> am

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
which I really wouldn't recommend I am

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.289 
which I really wouldn't recommend I am
kind<00:03:18.510> of<00:03:18.859> not<00:03:19.859> too<00:03:19.889> happy<00:03:20.159> with<00:03:20.639> having<00:03:20.940> bought

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
kind of not too happy with having bought

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.759 
kind of not too happy with having bought
this<00:03:22.940> having<00:03:23.940> both<00:03:24.090> this<00:03:24.299> DLC<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:25.019> there<00:03:25.680> you

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
this having both this DLC so there you

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:26.180 
this having both this DLC so there you
have<00:03:25.799> it

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190
