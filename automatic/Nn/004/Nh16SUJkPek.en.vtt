00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.550
 these bell-like sounds are 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.490
 they call harmonics the harmonics more 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.539
 strong occur in the fifth fret 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.539
 seventh fret 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.460
 and twelfth fret when normally the 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.000
 guitar joins him 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:40.070
 with the body does not have a double mark 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.230
 two dots two dots to where 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.829
 the dynamics are stronger is the 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:50.320
 half between a bridge and the other part and 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.320
 other than seven after itself 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.670
 the technique is quite simple the only thing 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:59.620
 what you have to do is 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:01.890
 play on top of the fret of the bar of 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.890
 metal 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.980
 but not pressing that is important 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:16.420
 more touching as if he gave us a touch 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:20.040
 electric and then remove then no 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.040
 leave it there because the solid dies 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.780
 um 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.780
 Y 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.340
 above the metal bar and barely 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.340
 touching it 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.350
 Y 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.350
 ah 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.100
 and those are the natural harmonics 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.330
 the index finger is going to be the functions of 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.340
 the left hand the thumb will be the 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.730
 functions of the right hand is to say goes 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.730
 to attack 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.850
 and the index finger is the one that will touch 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.319
 above the metal barrier and barely 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.999
 touching this finger 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.390
 is the one that gets on top of the bar 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:23.720
 of metal 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.100
 and just touch the index and thumb 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.100
 attack behind 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.190
 is what 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.879
 makes the harmonic on the 12th fret and this 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.879
 is the one who attacks him 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.530
 and this can be done harmonics 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.650
 artificial can be made in relation 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.860
 of 12 frets stepping for example on the 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.540
 fret 1 then let's play with the 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.409
 fret 13 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.310
 if it's the fret 2 stepped on the harmonic it 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:31.470
 gives on the bar of the fret 14 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:36.680
 what is the strong harmonic as if it were 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.680
 12 open to the air 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:45.000
 first 13 seconds 14 third 15 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.750
 and then if we put a nut in the 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.530
 fret 3 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.530
 for this 15 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.870
 fret 2 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.870
 for this 14
