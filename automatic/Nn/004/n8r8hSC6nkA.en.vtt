all right this is the Ergo Tron triple I
am<00:00:49.260> able<00:00:49.470> to<00:00:49.740> monitor<00:00:50.280> three<00:00:51.270> different

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
am able to monitor three different

monitors of the 21 inches on this device

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.010 
monitors of the 21 inches on this device
the<00:00:56.220> one<00:00:56.400> thing<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.760> we've<00:00:56.970> seen<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.540> this<00:00:57.750> is

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
the one thing that we've seen on this is

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.740 
the one thing that we've seen on this is
constructed<00:00:58.830> well<00:00:59.090> but<00:01:00.090> there<00:01:00.240> one<00:01:00.480> key

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
constructed well but there one key

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.960 
constructed well but there one key
difference<00:01:00.960> here<00:01:01.470> is<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.770> base<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.310> concave

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
difference here is the base is a concave

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.660 
difference here is the base is a concave
base<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:04.050> good<00:01:04.559> luck<00:01:04.770> trying<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.130> put<00:01:05.370> anything

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
base so good luck trying to put anything

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.670 
base so good luck trying to put anything
on<00:01:06.000> here<00:01:06.300> it<00:01:06.420> will<00:01:06.630> take<00:01:06.870> up<00:01:07.050> your<00:01:07.170> real<00:01:07.380> estate

screws that can be put in and you have

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.040 
screws that can be put in and you have
to<00:01:24.960> lock<00:01:25.710> these<00:01:26.280> down<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.090> they<00:01:27.270> are<00:01:27.300> basically

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
to lock these down so they are basically

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.030 
to lock these down so they are basically
locked<00:01:28.800> in<00:01:29.070> place<00:01:29.550> as<00:01:29.850> what<00:01:30.090> they<00:01:30.270> are<00:01:31.040> putting

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
locked in place as what they are putting

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.550 
locked in place as what they are putting
the<00:01:32.310> pole<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.090> no<00:01:33.270> big<00:01:33.510> deal<00:01:33.720> it's<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.050> clamp<00:01:34.350> on

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
the pole and no big deal it's a clamp on

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.150 
the pole and no big deal it's a clamp on
the<00:01:34.680> back<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:36.570> next<00:01:37.080> major<00:01:37.410> thing<00:01:37.619> so

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
the back the next major thing so

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.630

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
know a nice sized monitor on there and

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.220 
know a nice sized monitor on there and
then<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:36.030> screw<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.430> back<00:02:38.610> and

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
then you screw that to the back and

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.100 
then you screw that to the back and
therefore<00:02:40.230> you're<00:02:40.739> you're<00:02:41.310> ready<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.760> roll

device<00:04:50.669> that<00:04:51.450> you<00:04:51.690> had<00:04:51.900> to<00:04:52.200> probably<00:04:52.650> have<00:04:52.770> a

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
device that you had to probably have a

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.490 
device that you had to probably have a
buddy<00:04:53.099> there<00:04:53.370> long<00:04:53.669> to<00:04:53.940> put<00:04:54.150> that<00:04:54.330> long<00:04:54.630> this

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
buddy there long to put that long this

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
buddy there long to put that long this
one<00:04:55.860> has<00:04:56.720> little<00:04:57.720> Pistons<00:04:58.260> on<00:04:58.470> the<00:04:58.560> back<00:04:58.740> and

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
one has little Pistons on the back and

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.820 
one has little Pistons on the back and
you<00:04:59.639> will<00:04:59.729> notice<00:05:00.000> that<00:05:00.150> this<00:05:00.599> here<00:05:01.289> which

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
you will notice that this here which

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.969 
you will notice that this here which
gets<00:05:02.070> attached<00:05:02.490> to<00:05:02.700> the<00:05:03.060> monitor<00:05:03.570> it<00:05:04.050> pants<00:05:04.650> it

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
gets attached to the monitor it pants it

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.990 
gets attached to the monitor it pants it
tilts<00:05:05.550> it<00:05:05.970> swivels<00:05:06.660> so<00:05:07.190> as<00:05:08.190> I'm<00:05:08.460> putting<00:05:08.729> these

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
tilts it swivels so as I'm putting these

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.879 
tilts it swivels so as I'm putting these
on<00:05:10.160> very<00:05:11.160> very<00:05:11.280> snappy<00:05:12.030> very<00:05:12.240> easy<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:13.200> once<00:05:13.740> I

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
on very very snappy very easy and once I

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.730 
on very very snappy very easy and once I
so<00:05:14.190> I<00:05:14.220> can<00:05:14.460> probably<00:05:14.639> do<00:05:15.000> that<00:05:15.180> by<00:05:15.360> myself<00:05:15.740> the

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
so I can probably do that by myself the

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.950 
so I can probably do that by myself the
other<00:05:16.830> thing<00:05:17.130> is<00:05:17.310> these<00:05:17.520> will<00:05:18.000> rotate<00:05:18.479> around

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
other thing is these will rotate around

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.239 
other thing is these will rotate around
so<00:05:19.560> if<00:05:19.919> this<00:05:20.190> if<00:05:20.460> you<00:05:20.639> want<00:05:20.880> to<00:05:20.940> have

so if this if you want to have

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:23.429 
so if this if you want to have
that<00:05:21.369> monitor<00:05:21.819> and<00:05:21.999> an<00:05:22.119> angle<00:05:22.479> whatsoever

that monitor and an angle whatsoever

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:28.409 
that monitor and an angle whatsoever
these<00:05:24.189> will<00:05:24.819> easily<00:05:26.069> handle<00:05:27.069> that<00:05:27.269> one<00:05:28.269> of<00:05:28.359> the

much quicker than what we could

this<00:07:00.909> one<00:07:01.179> will<00:07:01.329> probably<00:07:01.569> be<00:07:01.899> around<00:07:02.259> 20%

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:02.829 
this one will probably be around 20%
