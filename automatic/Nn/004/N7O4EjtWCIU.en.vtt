00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:08.750
 This is what a box looks like. 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:11.880
 with a set where is the chandelier and that 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.210
 let us see how it all 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.940
 looks in real inside and again 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.510
 it took two of my house 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.550
 chandeliers 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.920
 well, and therefore it turns out that I 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.109
 there will be two sets of curtains which will go to 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.330
 what is not the living room to the kitchen there you can see 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:34.800
 will be 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:38.180
 let us open it and see 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.340
 what do we have here 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:46.020
 I really like how much 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:48.300
 packs up all sorts of dropped miniatures 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.090
 very thoroughly you feel right 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.440
 why do you give such 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.440
 hard earned money it p 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.949
 or whoever there is such a plastic 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.960
 the thing did not show the chandelier 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:07.350
 if lack of it is visible that in 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.810
 As a result, this microcircuit is green but 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.400
 when the chandelier is hanging like this 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.150
 you will watch your house as you would 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.400
 don't see 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.830
 accordingly, then you observe 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.240
 in all its glory 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.090
 chandeliers made very interesting that is 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:26.369
 it is very noble such a chandelier 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:29.880
 gold rim even gold or copper 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.110
 to mean between this sign sport 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.310
 clear glass and here is the same 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:40.200
 gold or copper as it will be more 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.630
 whatever tip is interesting here 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.409
 you can change the battery itself to here 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.189
 the batteries already stand by default and 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:52.110
 there is such a stub 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.549
 which blocks the battery says then 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.100
 that nobody used the chandelier before you 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:02.149
 it is very important and pulling it out only 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.750
 pulling out her chandelier will earn you 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:08.690
 here such choose and turn on oh my god 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.400
 my it burns you just look 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:17.050
 so yellow cool or 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:21.310
 for your house it's the same fire 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:24.849
 In the truest sense of the word Zdorovskaya 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.620
 chandelier and 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:34.290
 from more nishtyak who already 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.290
 directly and the value here is curtains 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.380
 such here 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:47.680
 curtains it is more like a small 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.599
 the tulle do n't even know on the body falls short 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.829
 still a miracle on something longer 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:59.890
 thoroughly and in an amicable way and of course in 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:03:00.190
 pat before you hang and here are 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.519

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:07.260
 curtains same curtains 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:10.360
 they have stickies here that you can 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:14.650
 dissolve and then you succeed here 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:17.769
 such a full curtain 1 and 2 and if 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:22.150
 you want to assemble them and make your window 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:25.560
 lighter then you spin 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.829
 You take away you get here such here 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.230
 2 bonded curtains 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:36.430
 mean as regards how to fasten them 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.829

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.630
 focus focus on what 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:44.739
 need to 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:49.620

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:51.730
 hare here and so and the parties and 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.040
 glue on and here it is scotch 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.260

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.299

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:03.790

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.980
 look a nice bonus to the chandelier in 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.919
 farm as they say useful 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.870
 nobody needs curtains everyone needs curtains 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:16.410
 but of course some rooms are by the day 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.019
 grass and better still the most 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:23.150
 search for some version of the plan curtains 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:25.350
 because all the same here is very 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.380
 non-standard color range 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.970
 oral yellow yellow flowers 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.010
 that is, for example in a room with pink 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:37.460
 wallpaper it will look a lot 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:40.890
