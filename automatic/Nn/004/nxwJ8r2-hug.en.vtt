physics is a corporate or football and
we<00:00:07.950> will<00:00:08.069> not<00:00:08.250> ignore<00:00:08.610> this<00:00:09.120> aspect<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:09.780> the

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
we will not ignore this aspect of the

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.980 
we will not ignore this aspect of the
game<00:00:10.219> but<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.519> isn't<00:00:12.120> wise<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.780> try<00:00:12.960> to

Ian<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:17.100> can't<00:00:17.130> totally<00:00:18.119> ignore<00:00:18.660> physics<00:00:19.080> and

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
Ian you can't totally ignore physics and

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.740 
Ian you can't totally ignore physics and
here<00:00:19.980> are<00:00:20.070> some<00:00:20.160> examples<00:00:20.699> where<00:00:20.970> your<00:00:21.359> NFL
