whatever you want to call the other

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.869 
whatever you want to call the other
thing<00:02:04.379> is<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.530> when<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:04.979> play<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.489> if<00:02:05.670> you

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:05.879 
thing is that when you play it if you

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:07.999 
thing is that when you play it if you
want<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.119> calibrate<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.750> be<00:02:06.989> there<00:02:07.739> are<00:02:07.890> also

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
want to calibrate to be there are also

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.729 
want to calibrate to be there are also
for<00:02:08.340> example<00:02:08.729> RGB<00:02:09.149> filters<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:10.229> can<00:02:10.259> switch

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
for example RGB filters you can switch

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.619 
for example RGB filters you can switch
off<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.039> red<00:02:11.190> channel<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.090> can<00:02:12.269> switch<00:02:12.510> out

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
off the red channel and I can switch out

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.479 
off the red channel and I can switch out
the<00:02:12.750> blue<00:02:12.930> channel<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:13.890> can<00:02:14.040> see<00:02:14.280> like

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
the blue channel and you can see like

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:15.920 
the blue channel and you can see like
with<00:02:14.700> this<00:02:14.819> test<00:02:15.090> better<00:02:15.299> that<00:02:15.629> color

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
with this test better that color

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.410 
with this test better that color
decoding<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.590> correct<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.670> sad<00:02:17.910> when<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.180> means

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
decoding is correct so sad when I means

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.110 
decoding is correct so sad when I means

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
colors on the screen you can check this

colors on the screen you can check this
you<00:02:28.319> can<00:02:28.470> set<00:02:28.709> up<00:02:28.829> color<00:02:29.040> situation<00:02:29.670> know<00:02:29.790> all

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
you can set up color situation know all

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.699 
you can set up color situation know all
these<00:02:30.120> blue<00:02:30.390> filter<00:02:30.750> things<00:02:31.019> you<00:02:31.590> normally

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
these blue filter things you normally

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.289 
these blue filter things you normally
look<00:02:32.129> through<00:02:32.370> just<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.760> set<00:02:33.000> up<00:02:33.090> color

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
look through just to set up color

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.120 
look through just to set up color
saturation<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:34.470> don't<00:02:34.650> need<00:02:34.769> this<00:02:34.950> because

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
saturation you don't need this because

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.890 
saturation you don't need this because
there<00:02:35.459> is<00:02:35.549> a<00:02:35.579> like<00:02:35.880> like<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.209> blue<00:02:36.450> only<00:02:36.750> mode

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
there is a like like a blue only mode

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.229 
there is a like like a blue only mode
you<00:02:37.739> just<00:02:37.980> switch<00:02:38.130> everything<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.730> blue<00:02:38.910> only

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
you just switch everything to blue only

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.360 
you just switch everything to blue only
and<00:02:39.690> with<00:02:39.900> this<00:02:40.079> I<00:02:40.319> just<00:02:40.680> can<00:02:41.069> go<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.250> a

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
and with this I just can go to a

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.520 
and with this I just can go to a
saturation<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.480> look<00:02:42.989> at<00:02:43.079> the<00:02:43.170> blue<00:02:43.349> what

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
saturation and look at the blue what

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.559 
saturation and look at the blue what
happens<00:02:43.799> if<00:02:43.919> I<00:02:44.010> turn<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.310> out<00:02:44.459> you<00:02:45.180> see<00:02:45.389> it's

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
happens if I turn it out you see it's

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.780 
happens if I turn it out you see it's
way<00:02:45.810> over<00:02:46.139> saturated<00:02:46.739> I<00:02:46.889> don't<00:02:47.340> need<00:02:47.489> any

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
way over saturated I don't need any

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.780 
way over saturated I don't need any
tools<00:02:48.180> anymore<00:02:49.040> also<00:02:50.040> for<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.370> people<00:02:50.400> that

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
tools anymore also for the people that

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.909 
tools anymore also for the people that
know<00:02:50.970> how<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.209> set<00:02:51.569> up<00:02:51.599> the<00:02:51.780> TV<00:02:51.930> which<00:02:52.739> is<00:02:52.889> a

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:52.919 
know how to set up the TV which is a

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:55.309 
know how to set up the TV which is a
very<00:02:53.099> neat<00:02:53.370> thing<00:02:53.669> so<00:02:54.329> all<00:02:54.660> these<00:02:54.989> kind<00:02:55.260> of

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
very neat thing so all these kind of

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.440 
very neat thing so all these kind of
things<00:02:55.380> we<00:02:55.739> put<00:02:55.950> in<00:02:56.099> also<00:02:56.760> patterns<00:02:57.209> for

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
things we put in also patterns for

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.629 
things we put in also patterns for
calibration<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:58.650> if<00:02:58.799> you<00:02:58.889> want<00:02:59.099> to<00:02:59.220> do<00:02:59.370> some

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
calibration so if you want to do some

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.750 
calibration so if you want to do some
display<00:03:00.239> calibration<00:03:00.930> professional<00:03:01.560> one<00:03:01.799> or

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
display calibration professional one or

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.759 
display calibration professional one or
professional<00:03:03.419> wise<00:03:03.599> there's<00:03:04.290> like<00:03:04.530> white

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
professional wise there's like white

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.039 
professional wise there's like white
balance<00:03:05.190> you<00:03:05.430> can<00:03:05.910> see<00:03:06.209> I<00:03:06.239> just<00:03:06.780> want<00:03:06.989> to

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
balance you can see I just want to

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.500 
balance you can see I just want to
calibrate<00:03:07.260> my<00:03:07.650> TV<00:03:08.010> with<00:03:08.549> 10<00:03:08.819> different<00:03:08.940> points

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
calibrate my TV with 10 different points

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.770 
calibrate my TV with 10 different points
so<00:03:10.310> maybe<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.609> want<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:11.940> check<00:03:12.150> her<00:03:12.359> temperature

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
so maybe I want to check her temperature

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.220 
so maybe I want to check her temperature
at

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.690 

at<00:03:18.500> 60<00:03:19.459> or<00:03:19.550> 50<00:03:19.760> percent<00:03:20.569> of<00:03:20.860> signal<00:03:21.860> so<00:03:22.280> all<00:03:22.549> the

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
at 60 or 50 percent of signal so all the

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.970 
at 60 or 50 percent of signal so all the
tests<00:03:22.970> pendants<00:03:23.330> are<00:03:23.450> integrated<00:03:24.019> so<00:03:24.769> for

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
tests pendants are integrated so for

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.500 
tests pendants are integrated so for
someone<00:03:25.340> who<00:03:25.489> wants<00:03:25.519> to<00:03:25.760> set<00:03:26.030> up<00:03:26.060> to<00:03:26.390> be

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
someone who wants to set up to be

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.960 
someone who wants to set up to be
professionally<00:03:27.170> no<00:03:27.680> problem<00:03:28.129> everybody<00:03:28.760> can

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
do just as a side note so you can see

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.650 
do just as a side note so you can see
there's<00:03:32.810> a<00:03:32.870> lot<00:03:32.989> of<00:03:33.019> stuff<00:03:33.319> going<00:03:33.349> on<00:03:33.769> and<00:03:34.660> this

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
there's a lot of stuff going on and this

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.970 
there's a lot of stuff going on and this
is<00:03:35.750> very<00:03:35.900> neat<00:03:36.200> but<00:03:37.420> going<00:03:38.420> back<00:03:38.690> to<00:03:38.930> my<00:03:39.110> final

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
is very neat but going back to my final

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.100 
is very neat but going back to my final
presentation<00:03:42.940> there's<00:03:43.940> a<00:03:44.030> problem<00:03:44.209> there<00:03:44.989> are

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
presentation there's a problem there are

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.479 
presentation there's a problem there are
people<00:03:45.349> that<00:03:45.440> know<00:03:45.620> how<00:03:45.769> to<00:03:45.799> calibrate<00:03:46.099> it<00:03:46.310> to

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
people that know how to calibrate it to

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
how it looks like it's us Ichiro and

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.490 
how it looks like it's us Ichiro and
there's<00:05:01.970> one<00:05:02.210> difficult<00:05:03.050> thing<00:05:03.260> in

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
there's one difficult thing in

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.250 
there's one difficult thing in
calibration<00:05:04.070> is<00:05:04.630> normally<00:05:05.630> the<00:05:05.660> two<00:05:05.930> he<00:05:06.080> needs

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
calibration is normally the two he needs

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.379 
calibration is normally the two he needs
to<00:05:06.560> know<00:05:06.710> where<00:05:07.010> it<00:05:07.130> is<00:05:07.250> so<00:05:07.880> to<00:05:07.940> know<00:05:08.150> how<00:05:08.330> to

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
to know where it is so to know how to

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.170 
to know where it is so to know how to
calibrate<00:05:08.690> itself<00:05:09.260> right<00:05:09.669> this<00:05:10.669> is<00:05:10.790> that<00:05:10.970> we

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
calibrate itself right this is that we

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.420 
calibrate itself right this is that we
have<00:05:11.750> this<00:05:11.930> kind<00:05:12.080> of<00:05:12.260> problems<00:05:12.800> just<00:05:13.220> turn<00:05:13.400> it

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
have this kind of problems just turn it

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.870 
have this kind of problems just turn it
around<00:05:13.610> like<00:05:13.880> this<00:05:14.090> and<00:05:15.010> then<00:05:16.010> all<00:05:16.580> you<00:05:16.850> need

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
around like this and then all you need

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.650 
around like this and then all you need
to<00:05:17.030> do<00:05:17.350> soup<00:05:18.350> it<00:05:18.440> up<00:05:18.530> by<00:05:18.710> USB<00:05:19.070> one<00:05:19.639> just<00:05:20.449> hear<00:05:20.630> us

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
to do soup it up by USB one just hear us

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:27.610 
to do soup it up by USB one just hear us
bewafa<00:05:21.229> example<00:05:23.380> you<00:05:24.380> say<00:05:24.560> okay<00:05:26.440> let's<00:05:27.440> have

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
counsel wait just put it somewhere where

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.360 
counsel wait just put it somewhere where
it<00:05:30.139> really<00:05:30.290> belongs<00:05:31.810> as<00:05:32.810> an<00:05:32.960> example<00:05:33.229> so<00:05:34.100> and

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
it really belongs as an example so and

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.450 
it really belongs as an example so and
