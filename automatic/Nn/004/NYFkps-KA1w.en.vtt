I<00:01:59.070> don't<00:01:59.280> know<00:01:59.369> but<00:01:59.579> there's<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.450> teleporter

opinion she's gonna stop her stop group

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.119 
opinion she's gonna stop her stop group
935<00:02:05.969> from<00:02:06.659> doing<00:02:06.960> what<00:02:07.079> they've<00:02:07.259> done<00:02:07.500> by

935 from doing what they've done by

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.430 
935 from doing what they've done by

you<00:02:10.560> don't<00:02:10.739> know<00:02:10.920> she<00:02:10.979> switches<00:02:11.489> places<00:02:11.819> with

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
you don't know she switches places with

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.610 
you don't know she switches places with
Richtofen<00:02:12.959> because

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
Richtofen because

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.440 
Richtofen because
she<00:02:14.010> controls<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.459> zombies<00:02:14.879> on<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.269> moon<00:02:15.420> and

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
she controls the zombies on the moon and

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.720 
she controls the zombies on the moon and
she<00:02:15.780> controls<00:02:16.170> all<00:02:16.349> the<00:02:16.379> zombies<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:17.430> what<00:02:17.580> he

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
she controls all the zombies and what he

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.430 
she controls all the zombies and what he
does<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.000> he<00:02:18.209> switches<00:02:18.629> bodies<00:02:18.930> with<00:02:19.319> her

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
does is he switches bodies with her

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.369 
does is he switches bodies with her
Souls<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.129> he<00:02:20.790> takes<00:02:21.000> over<00:02:21.150> her<00:02:21.480> I'm<00:02:21.780> soul<00:02:22.110> and

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
Souls and he takes over her I'm soul and

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.380 
Souls and he takes over her I'm soul and
now<00:02:22.500> he<00:02:22.560> controls<00:02:23.069> it<00:02:23.190> but<00:02:23.670> what<00:02:23.790> she<00:02:23.970> did<00:02:24.150> will

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
now he controls it but what she did will

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.300 
now he controls it but what she did will
I<00:02:24.659> think<00:02:25.319> he<00:02:25.379> was<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.500> MPD<00:02:25.890> or<00:02:26.010> something<00:02:26.250> like

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
I think he was the MPD or something like

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.030 
I think he was the MPD or something like
that<00:02:26.370> they<00:02:26.700> blew<00:02:27.659> missiles<00:02:28.110> into<00:02:28.349> Earth<00:02:28.620> that

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
that they blew missiles into Earth that

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.039 
that they blew missiles into Earth that
killed<00:02:29.370> like<00:02:29.670> destroyed<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.329> atmosphere<00:02:30.840> so

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
killed like destroyed the atmosphere so

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.569 
killed like destroyed the atmosphere so
there's<00:02:31.260> no<00:02:31.409> way<00:02:31.560> for<00:02:31.620> Richtofen<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.250> get<00:02:32.400> back

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
there's no way for Richtofen to get back

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:36.170 
there's no way for Richtofen to get back
on<00:02:32.790> there<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:33.900> my<00:02:34.290> theory<00:02:34.739> is<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.190> well

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
on there so my theory is that well

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.670 
on there so my theory is that well
another<00:02:36.390> youtuber<00:02:36.930> action-packed<00:02:37.500> he

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
another youtuber action-packed he

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.140 
another youtuber action-packed he
actually<00:02:37.799> has<00:02:38.099> a<00:02:38.129> similar<00:02:38.430> theory<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:38.849> think

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
actually has a similar theory I think

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.270 
actually has a similar theory I think
mine's<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.450> little<00:02:39.480> bit<00:02:39.720> different<00:02:40.140> but<00:02:41.040> if<00:02:41.190> you

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
mine's a little bit different but if you

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.680 
mine's a little bit different but if you
don't<00:02:41.430> know<00:02:41.579> there<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:41.879> a<00:02:41.909> song<00:02:42.150> coming<00:02:42.450> home

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
don't know there is a song coming home

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.960 
don't know there is a song coming home
not<00:02:42.930> consider<00:02:43.260> lyrics<00:02:43.620> but<00:02:44.340> yes<00:02:44.489> coming<00:02:44.790> home

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
not consider lyrics but yes coming home

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.759 
not consider lyrics but yes coming home
does<00:02:45.269> have<00:02:45.480> resembles<00:02:45.930> because<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.230> lot<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.620> the

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
does have resembles because a lot of the

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.349 
does have resembles because a lot of the
lyrics<00:02:46.980> could<00:02:47.340> be<00:02:47.459> symbols<00:02:47.879> for<00:02:48.060> something

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
lyrics could be symbols for something

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:49.699 
lyrics could be symbols for something
than<00:02:48.450> black<00:02:48.629> ops<00:02:48.810> 2<00:02:49.019> but<00:02:49.230> we<00:02:49.379> really<00:02:49.620> don't

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
than black ops 2 but we really don't

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.369 
than black ops 2 but we really don't
know<00:02:49.890> until<00:02:50.040> Trek<00:02:51.000> will<00:02:51.299> get<00:02:51.569> make<00:02:51.750> maybe<00:02:52.170> have

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
know until Trek will get make maybe have

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:53.960 
know until Trek will get make maybe have
a<00:02:52.410> trailer<00:02:52.739> or<00:02:52.890> something<00:02:53.280> wood<00:02:53.609> or<00:02:53.790> something

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
a trailer or something wood or something

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.710 
a trailer or something wood or something
like<00:02:54.209> that<00:02:54.319> but<00:02:55.549> my<00:02:56.549> theory<00:02:56.819> like<00:02:57.239> said<00:02:57.510> is

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
like that but my theory like said is

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.940 
like that but my theory like said is
that<00:02:57.930> they're<00:02:58.049> going<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.230> go<00:02:58.349> back<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:58.829> the

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
that they're going to go back in the

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.949 
that they're going to go back in the
past<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.549> she's<00:02:59.909> going<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.180> go<00:03:00.329> I<00:03:00.629> don't<00:03:00.810> know

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
past and she's going to go I don't know

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.630 
past and she's going to go I don't know
where<00:03:01.230> but<00:03:01.260> maybe<00:03:01.769> to<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:03.090> head<00:03:03.299> of<00:03:03.420> group<00:03:03.690> 935

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
where but maybe to the head of group 935

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.399 
where but maybe to the head of group 935
lab<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:06.180> that's<00:03:06.599> what<00:03:06.810> is<00:03:06.870> always<00:03:07.140> going<00:03:07.290> to

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
lab and that's what is always going to

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.369 
lab and that's what is always going to
take<00:03:07.530> place<00:03:07.739> and<00:03:08.420> obviously<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:10.019> super

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
take place and obviously the super

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.580 
take place and obviously the super
soldiers<00:03:10.709> nicolai<00:03:11.099> and<00:03:12.260> Dimitri<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.440> guys

soldiers nicolai and Dimitri you guys

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.869 
soldiers nicolai and Dimitri you guys
know<00:03:13.769> their<00:03:13.920> names<00:03:14.129> I'm<00:03:14.370> sorry<00:03:14.609> I'm<00:03:14.700> really

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
know their names I'm sorry I'm really

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.089 
know their names I'm sorry I'm really
bad<00:03:15.030> with<00:03:15.060> names<00:03:15.299> and<00:03:15.890> they'll<00:03:16.890> probably

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
bad with names and they'll probably

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.220 
bad with names and they'll probably
fight<00:03:17.400> there<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.030> kill<00:03:18.239> zombies<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.989> stuff

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
and that's really where I think the

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.839 
and that's really where I think the

they're going to be coming back for

they're going to be coming back for
