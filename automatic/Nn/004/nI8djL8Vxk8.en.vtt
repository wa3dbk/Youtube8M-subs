 dwarf tutorial of photoshop lightroom 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.529
 today we are going to learn how to make this 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:17.480
 photographic effect that we see on the screen 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:19.850
 The first thing I'm going to do is restore 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.700
 the photograph 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:27.100
 I'm going to basic in the presence part 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.100
 in clarity I will put 60 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.700
 now in effects 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.600
 take care of a small bullet in quantity 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:41.330
 I will put minus 23 remember if 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.020
 we put a positive number the pretty 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.390
 it is white 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.770
 if we are going to leave the negative point 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:53.820
 half 1 057 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.740
 in roundness we are going to put minus 13 and in 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.250
 fade in fade 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.860
 leave in 50 and illuminations too 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.080
 now we're going to tone curve we're going to 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.090
 find with this graphic 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.070
 in this area we have what are the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.080
 shines 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.640
 in this area we have what is the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.580
 gamma lighting the gamma light of the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.220
 photography and in this area we have what 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.050
 it is the contrast of the image 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.280
 let's notice that if we move 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.260
 the anchor point up 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.170
 or down or to any of the 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.730
 sides will appear some numbers in 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:36.240
 the top of this area 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:39.480
 and they will not indicate the position of the point 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.090
 that we are editing the first one is going to 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.170
 say the movements that we make of 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.170
 horizontal shape 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.990
 the second one is going to tell us in the 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.600
 movements that we do in a way 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.299
 vertical said this we're going to start 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.939
 edit the points first thing we're going to 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.549
 to do is go to this area that is the 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.360
 shine as I told them and we're going to look for the 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:07.700
 number 73 horizontally and the 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.700
 number 86 vertically 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.160
 you do not need to have the precise numbers 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.540
 against the whole numbers that 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.909
 we need is enough 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.569
 now we 're going to the area of the ma let's go 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:30.109
 to look for number 49 horizontally and 56 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.109
 in vertical 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.760
 and now in contrast we're going to look for the 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.760
 number 22 horizontally and 19 vertically 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:47.060
 Now what we are going to do is go to 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.400
 red channel and at the first point that 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.890

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.110
 8 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.680
 remember that this is the area of ​​the 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.680
 contrast 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.349
 and here in the zone of brightness as I told you 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.069
 let's move the point to the number 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.069
 92 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.780
 now we go to the blue channel because the 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.940
 We are not going to see green , we are not going to 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.740

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.740
 move to number 31 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.440
 and the second point we are going to move 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.440
 up to number 76 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.180
 well with that the effect is finished 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.180
 Now what we can do is save it 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.150
 we do not go to the area where it says adjustments 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.390
