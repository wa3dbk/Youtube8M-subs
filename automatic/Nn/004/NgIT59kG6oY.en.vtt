and<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.720> suggest<00:00:16.139> two<00:00:16.320> handguns<00:00:16.620> or<00:00:16.950> machine

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.280 
and I suggest two handguns or machine

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.550 
and I suggest two handguns or machine
pistols<00:00:17.700> you<00:00:17.760> so<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.270> like<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.110> go<00:00:19.380> over<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
pistols you so I like to go over the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.230 
pistols you so I like to go over the
extended<00:00:20.130> mags<00:00:20.340> if<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.640> have<00:00:20.850> them<00:00:21.030> available

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
extended mags if I have them available

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.750 
extended mags if I have them available
otherwise<00:00:21.720> I'll<00:00:22.080> go<00:00:22.230> with<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.500> grip<00:00:22.800> if<00:00:23.610> you

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
otherwise I'll go with the grip if you

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.580 
otherwise I'll go with the grip if you
don't<00:00:24.000> like<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.360> iron<00:00:24.480> sights<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:25.140> suggest

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
don't like the iron sights I suggest

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.140 
don't like the iron sights I suggest
going<00:00:25.770> with<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.980> holographic<00:00:26.460> with<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.910> slight

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
going with a holographic with the slight

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.930 
going with a holographic with the slight
hand<00:00:27.420> stopping<00:00:27.780> power<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.170> steady<00:00:28.350> aim<00:00:28.940> this

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940 
hand stopping power and steady aim this

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.269 
hand stopping power and steady aim this
gun<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.180> a<00:00:30.420> lot<00:00:30.660> like<00:00:30.869> an<00:00:31.050> assault<00:00:31.410> rifle<00:00:31.470> but

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
gun is a lot like an assault rifle but

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.250 
gun is a lot like an assault rifle but
with<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.579> power<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.120> characteristics<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.050> an

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
with the power and characteristics of an

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.700 
with the power and characteristics of an
LMG<00:00:35.750> unfortunately<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.989> doesn't<00:00:37.200> quite<00:00:37.440> have

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
LMG unfortunately it doesn't quite have

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.330 
LMG unfortunately it doesn't quite have
the<00:00:37.739> ammo<00:00:38.040> capacity<00:00:38.550> as<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:40.200> normal<00:00:40.620> LMG<00:00:41.100> which

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
the ammo capacity as a normal LMG which

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.310 
the ammo capacity as a normal LMG which
is<00:00:41.520> why<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.790> suggest<00:00:42.360> putting<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:42.810> the<00:00:42.899> extended

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
is why I suggest putting on the extended

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.530 
is why I suggest putting on the extended
mag<00:00:43.470> CDF<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.160> reload<00:00:44.520> does<00:00:44.730> you'll<00:00:44.940> see<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.360> I

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
mag CDF the reload does you'll see it I

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.049 
mag CDF the reload does you'll see it I
have<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.140> do<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.470> fair<00:00:46.890> bit<00:00:47.130> here<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.640> this

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
have to do that a fair bit here in this

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.600 
have to do that a fair bit here in this
clip<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.320> be<00:00:49.470> quite<00:00:49.680> problematic<00:00:50.010> at

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
clip it can be quite problematic at

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.790 
clip it can be quite problematic at
times<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.300> definitely<00:00:51.750> suggest<00:00:52.110> trying<00:00:52.649> to

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
times so I definitely suggest trying to

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.250 
times so I definitely suggest trying to
keep<00:00:53.010> yourself<00:00:53.450> backed<00:00:54.450> up<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.960> case

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
keep yourself backed up in case

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.560 
keep yourself backed up in case
something<00:00:55.680> does<00:00:55.860> go<00:00:55.890> wrong<00:00:56.040> now<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.090> second

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
something does go wrong now the second

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.330 
something does go wrong now the second
one<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.750> would<00:00:57.899> pick<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.890> blinged<00:00:59.190> out

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
one I would pick is the blinged out

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.039 
one I would pick is the blinged out
ripon<00:01:00.290> FMJ<00:01:01.290> now<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.129> Oak<00:01:02.550> has<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.030> fairly<00:01:03.480> good

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
ripon FMJ now the Oak has a fairly good

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.309 
ripon FMJ now the Oak has a fairly good
bullet<00:01:04.859> penetration<00:01:05.339> through<00:01:05.880> objects<00:01:06.539> but

00:01:07.309 --> 00:01:07.319 
bullet penetration through objects but

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:09.679 
bullet penetration through objects but
it<00:01:07.439> can<00:01:07.770> be<00:01:08.069> a<00:01:08.100> lot<00:01:08.369> better<00:01:08.579> with<00:01:08.850> FMJ<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.569> on<00:01:09.659> a

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
it can be a lot better with FMJ and on a

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.199 
it can be a lot better with FMJ and on a
map<00:01:09.929> like<00:01:10.139> terminal<00:01:10.789> favela<00:01:11.789> where<00:01:11.999> there's<00:01:12.149> a

00:01:12.199 --> 00:01:12.209 
map like terminal favela where there's a

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:13.730 
map like terminal favela where there's a
lot<00:01:12.389> of<00:01:12.420> walls<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.899> stuff<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.229> good<00:01:13.469> to<00:01:13.619> have

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
lot of walls and stuff it's good to have

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.819 
lot of walls and stuff it's good to have
it<00:01:13.889> and<00:01:14.009> the<00:01:14.130> grip<00:01:14.399> reduces<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.090> recoil<00:01:15.270> to

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:15.829 
it and the grip reduces the recoil to

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:18.050 
it and the grip reduces the recoil to
practically<00:01:16.829> nothing<00:01:16.859> is<00:01:17.490> kind<00:01:17.819> of<00:01:17.880> like<00:01:17.999> a

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
practically nothing is kind of like a

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.469 
practically nothing is kind of like a
rigor<00:01:18.420> mortis<00:01:18.509> defray<00:01:19.319> I<00:01:19.590> suppose<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.479> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
rigor mortis defray I suppose and the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.629 
rigor mortis defray I suppose and the
third<00:01:21.899> one<00:01:22.109> is<00:01:22.259> an<00:01:22.409> unusual<00:01:22.560> one<00:01:23.039> because<00:01:23.100> I

00:01:23.629 --> 00:01:23.639 
third one is an unusual one because I

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:26.330 
third one is an unusual one because I
like<00:01:24.029> to<00:01:24.600> go<00:01:25.020> those<00:01:25.409> long<00:01:25.709> kill<00:01:25.950> streets<00:01:26.189> i'll

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
like to go those long kill streets i'll

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.480 
like to go those long kill streets i'll
usually<00:01:26.520> put<00:01:26.819> on<00:01:26.939> scavenger<00:01:27.380> but<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.439> like<00:01:29.369> to

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
usually put on scavenger but I like to

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.449 
usually put on scavenger but I like to
put<00:01:29.700> danger<00:01:30.270> close<00:01:30.539> on<00:01:30.810> as<00:01:30.959> my<00:01:31.109> secondary<00:01:31.740> not

00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:32.459 
put danger close on as my secondary not

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.879 
put danger close on as my secondary not
my<00:01:32.579> secondary<00:01:32.909> my<00:01:33.149> secretary<00:01:33.539> perk<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.139> put

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:34.889 
my secondary my secretary perk and put

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:37.730 
my secondary my secretary perk and put
like<00:01:35.090> RPGs<00:01:36.090> or<00:01:36.270> 80<00:01:36.389> fours<00:01:36.810> as<00:01:37.049> my<00:01:37.170> secondary

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
like RPGs or 80 fours as my secondary

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.089 
like RPGs or 80 fours as my secondary
and<00:01:38.779> it's<00:01:39.779> a<00:01:39.959> very<00:01:40.170> good<00:01:40.259> combination<00:01:41.039> because

00:01:41.089 --> 00:01:41.099 
and it's a very good combination because

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:43.399 
and it's a very good combination because
I<00:01:41.279> get<00:01:41.459> the<00:01:41.609> added<00:01:42.029> bonus<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.810> having<00:01:42.869> great

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
I get the added bonus of having great

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.440 
I get the added bonus of having great
air<00:01:43.590> support<00:01:44.039> and<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.369> usually<00:01:44.789> very<00:01:44.819> good

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
air support and it's usually very good

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.510 
air support and it's usually very good
hitting<00:01:46.259> those<00:01:46.409> high<00:01:46.469> killstreaks<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.459> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
hitting those high killstreaks and the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.929 
hitting those high killstreaks and the
odd<00:01:47.669> is<00:01:47.849> a<00:01:47.880> very<00:01:48.119> powerful<00:01:48.740> weapon<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.130> it's

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
odd is a very powerful weapon so it's

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.510 
odd is a very powerful weapon so it's
not<00:01:51.499> necessary<00:01:52.499> after<00:01:52.679> stopping<00:01:52.979> power<00:01:53.219> but

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
not necessary after stopping power but

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.999 
not necessary after stopping power but
with<00:01:53.669> it<00:01:53.849> you<00:01:53.939> get<00:01:54.090> 2<00:01:54.419> bullet<00:01:55.169> to<00:01:55.200> kill<00:01:55.380> which

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
with it you get 2 bullet to kill which

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.359 
with it you get 2 bullet to kill which
is<00:01:56.159> very<00:01:56.369> nice<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:57.560> that's<00:01:58.560> pretty<00:01:58.919> much<00:01:59.039> all

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
is very nice and that's pretty much all

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.300 
is very nice and that's pretty much all
I've<00:01:59.520> got<00:01:59.700> for<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.149> acaba<00:02:00.840> there<00:02:01.409> if<00:02:02.099> you're

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
I've got for the acaba there if you're

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.819 
I've got for the acaba there if you're
wondering<00:02:02.549> why<00:02:02.939> they<00:02:03.359> I<00:02:03.840> didn't<00:02:04.560> pick<00:02:04.709> the

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
wondering why they I didn't pick the

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.129 
wondering why they I didn't pick the
thermal<00:02:05.279> it's<00:02:05.399> because<00:02:05.789> this<00:02:06.299> guns<00:02:06.569> very<00:02:06.869> much

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:07.139 
thermal it's because this guns very much

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:08.600 
thermal it's because this guns very much
