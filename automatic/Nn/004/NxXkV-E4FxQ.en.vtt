00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.960
 ladies fingers cake 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.750
 for its preparation we will need 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:18.290
 for the dough a glass of water a glass of flour 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.500
 150 grams of margarine a little salt and 4 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:24.619
 eggs for impregnation half a liter of sour cream 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.390
 a glass of sugar and on top we will decorate the cake 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.490
 chocolate 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:32.320
 cake blanks are baked from custard 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.320
 dough let's make dough 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.480
 pan pour water 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:47.239
 add a pinch of salt 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:51.340
 and 150 grams of margarine put the pot on 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.340
 stove and bring it all to a boil 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.590
 when water boils 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.740
 quickly add flour here 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.740
 knead the dough 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:15.530
 kneaded dough let cool 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:23.079
 when the dough cools in one by one 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:25.939
 egg and quietly wash the eggs in the dough 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:30.009
 at first it will seem unreal 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:33.979
 try a little and everything will work out 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:36.770
 if the eggs are very large so that the dough does not 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.020
 it turned out liquid pay directly to this 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.829
 attention and maybe only need 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.789
 3 eggs 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:48.159
 the dough should be moderately so 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:48.159
 the soft Kamensk case lies 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.380
 here is such a stingy 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.030
 plastic dough should turn out like me 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.030
 talked about me gone 3 eggs 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.690
 shift dough into pastry bag 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.060
 and with the help of a straw 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.860
 we drop it on a greased baking sheet 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.930
 dough stiff 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.270
 and ask someone from the household 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.070
 help you cut with scissors right here 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:52.880
 these ladies fingers 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:56.680
 no wonder we have a cake so called scissors 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.680
 wetted with water 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.650
 set down the dough at a distance from each other 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:11.120
 friend since when baking we are very 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:15.760
 greatly increased in volume oven 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.760
 already set we warm up to 220 degrees 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.239
 while the oven is warming I want a little bit 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.280
 tell about how to bake choux 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.950
 the dough in principle is we will have such 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.110
 small eclairs and for successful baking 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.209
 eclairs need to make them drop 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.610
 temperatures and now we warmed up 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.130
 oven to 220 degrees 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.800
 the first five minutes we will bake eclairs 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.010
 at this temperature then temperature 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.800
 You will need to turn down to 180 degrees and 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.769
 bake eclairs until ready for another 10 minutes 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.410
 maybe even 15 eclairs are better 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.760
 what is not gapich values â€‹â€‹we fall 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.760
 and become pancakes 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.420
 the oven warmed up sending our 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.970
 baking fingers 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.210
 I repeat the first five minutes again 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.910
 and at a temperature of 220 degrees 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:10.370
 then switch to 180 and bake until 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.030
 full readiness eclairs oven 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.030
 can not open 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.650
 Here are such ruddy air cookies 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:23.780
 we should do it that way 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:26.230
 you need to re-bake all the dough cookies 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.230
 cool down 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.910
 until one billet and we cool 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:38.480
 others bake make cream for 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:47.720
 This take half a liter of sour cream and good 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:51.730
 beat with 1 cup of sugar if desired 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.730
 a little vanilla can be added to the cream 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.650
 need to beat until complete dissolution 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.650
 Sahara 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:17.289
 all the preparatory work is finished 

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:19.179
 it remains only to form a cake 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:23.429
 take cookies 

00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:28.889
 we dip them completely with flint and 

00:05:23.429 --> 00:05:28.889
 lay out a deep plate whether form 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.489
 make a cake 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:03.450
 we pour the rest of the cream on top of the cake 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:09.500
 fingers of ancestors swam in the wedge and this 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:09.500
 the cream thickens and will not be so liquid 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.300
 ready cake decorate with grated chocolate 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:26.890
 will need to put on the cold 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:30.930
 for at least 12 hours I usually remember 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:35.080
 evening on sometimes tiger his fridge 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:37.810
 when he's cool and soaked with cream he 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.060
 very well cut with a knife i hope not 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:43.110
 amenable to such a nice tea bag 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.110
 bye Bye
