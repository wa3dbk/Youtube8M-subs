00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:04.280
 an image is very easy very simple 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:07.479
 handle as you see from the left side here 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.159

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.540
 all our images all our 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.930
 information 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.940
 the images we want appear according to 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.670
 the selected folder on this side 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.870
 and they will appear in the front of the screen 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.120
 some of you already know it and we're going 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:31.690
 to 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:34.250
 to change the color this blue color 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:38.210
 turquoise that have the eyes of this one is 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:42.500
 we're going to change it for a violet 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.110
 ok we start let's go to object in the 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.170
 menu bar from the bottom and 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:51.560
 until below the option of the 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.700
 circle with filling the ellipse with 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.579
 stuffing we're going to click on there 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.710
 here below where it says tours appears 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:03.000
 the small box to choose the color that 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.240
 we want we want violet color 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.590
 and we can give you an opacity once 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:14.110
 in half or we eat let's insert 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.989
 over the eyes of the girl the ellipse 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:21.040
 for that we are going to increase the zoom to 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:24.610
 can easily work on the eyes 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:28.170
 of the girl and now we are going to create the 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.590
 ellipse nothing more simply 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.390
 chop in one place and drag 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.060
 as you see there is 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.670
 we have covered the eye to be able 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.680
 work with that circle that we have done 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.950
 with that ellipse we are going to give here in the 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.520
 arrow below top of the photo more 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.319
 object and as you see is selected so 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:55.969
 we can adjust 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:58.939
 to high and wide and applying once here 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:03:01.999
 we already have the arrow selected and 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:05.329
 we can move freely so that 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:08.510
 is covering the color of the eyes of 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:10.430
 the girl as you see is still the color 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.639
 very solid we need it to be a bit 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:17.299
 more opaque for that here they appear some 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:19.939
 little buttons to copy or change 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.639
 the attributes we can give you that 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:27.189
 little button we are going to give you and as you see here 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:30.800
 is the opacity 64 225 we are going to lower it 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:33.490
 more or less 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.520
 as 2 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:40.600
 us what 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:44.080
 130 will be fine we will not accept it 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.670
 As you can see, this one has been left 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.230
 return to that dialog box 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.760
 for more ease 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:54.960
 we double-click on the ellipse and 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.290
 appears we adjust all the management 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:03.610
 we will then insert the following 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:07.180
 in the other eye of the girl we have 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:12.120
 let's take the ellipse again 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:15.459
 we have the color since we put it on 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:19.299
 about its aso 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:22.260
 we left again 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.960
 the selection tool 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.500
 and move 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.380
 we adjust it to the size of your eye to 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.040
 that is totally 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:36.560
 covered 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.990
 trying to make it as fair as possible 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:44.800
 do not worry they are passed because we can 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:48.400
 always reduce trying to have about 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.919
 perfect as the eye covering see 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.879
 this we also have to lower the 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:57.310
 opacity was as it was before the other 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:05:02.190
 we put a 130 we will put the same 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:06.150
 the 130 and we will accept 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:09.000
 and ready we can give then in 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.480
 any part below 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.510
 we can use the zoom 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:18.689
 and now we see that the eyes of the girl 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:22.019
 they have changed we give that out of me 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:25.649
 picture of where is our picture 

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:27.529
 we take pictures more objects and we have the 

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:31.880
 change of eyes 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:34.360

 when they save an image in jpg format 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.930
 they do it 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:11.490
 according as it is and what 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:14.190
 from here this 95% down is from 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.410
 medium quality more or less than half 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.720
 down is of low quality is it 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:21.030
 they make their photos with the highest quality 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:24.000
