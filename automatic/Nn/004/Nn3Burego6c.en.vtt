long time ago around August 2014 to be

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.470 
long time ago around August 2014 to be
exact<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:12.280> was<00:00:12.640> just<00:00:12.790> cleaning<00:00:12.970> out<00:00:13.150> my<00:00:13.269> hard

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
exact I was just cleaning out my hard

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.589 
exact I was just cleaning out my hard
drive<00:00:13.780> and<00:00:14.110> found<00:00:14.560> this<00:00:15.029> so<00:00:16.029> now<00:00:16.180> it's<00:00:16.390> July

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:16.599 
drive and found this so now it's July

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.540 
drive and found this so now it's July
2015<00:00:17.079> and<00:00:17.499> Here<00:00:17.650> I<00:00:17.679> am<00:00:17.769> uploading<00:00:18.310> it<00:00:18.400> I

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.220 
2015 and Here I am uploading it I
figured<00:00:19.060> it'd<00:00:19.300> be<00:00:19.329> a<00:00:19.449> waste<00:00:19.630> if<00:00:19.839> I<00:00:19.929> spent<00:00:20.169> all

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
figured it'd be a waste if I spent all

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.989 
figured it'd be a waste if I spent all
this<00:00:20.259> time<00:00:20.380> recording<00:00:20.949> it<00:00:21.039> and<00:00:21.159> didn't<00:00:21.820> post

this time recording it and didn't post

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:25.079 
this time recording it and didn't post
it<00:00:22.119> somewhere<00:00:22.269> so<00:00:22.989> yeah<00:00:23.640> since<00:00:24.640> this<00:00:24.699> was<00:00:24.880> film

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:25.089

the<00:00:25.179> while<00:00:25.359> ago<00:00:25.659> things<00:00:25.960> could<00:00:26.169> have<00:00:26.259> changed

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
the while ago things could have changed

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.429

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
on the website like deals or prices or

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.390 
on the website like deals or prices or

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
them all of them become D percent off so

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.930 
them all of them become D percent off so
if<00:02:14.920> they're<00:02:15.100> originally<00:02:15.430> two<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:15.760> three

if they're originally two to three

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.280 
if they're originally two to three
dollars<00:02:16.620> each<00:02:17.620> one<00:02:17.800> became<00:02:18.070> one<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.580> two<00:02:18.760> so

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
dollars each one became one to two so

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.500 
dollars each one became one to two so
reasonably<00:02:20.290> priced<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:22.090> yeah<00:02:22.300> let<00:02:22.420> me<00:02:22.450> show

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
looks great but when you get up like

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.659 
looks great but when you get up like
obviously<00:04:18.959> my<00:04:19.139> lens<00:04:19.859> won't<00:04:20.070> focus<00:04:20.519> that

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
obviously my lens won't focus that

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.020 
obviously my lens won't focus that
closely<00:04:21.150> but<00:04:21.590> if<00:04:22.590> you<00:04:22.860> um<00:04:23.070> if<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:23.610> get<00:04:23.760> close

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
closely but if you um if you get close

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.659 
closely but if you um if you get close
so<00:04:24.330> this<00:04:24.720> is<00:04:24.870> just<00:04:25.139> being<00:04:25.289> picky<00:04:25.620> you<00:04:26.400> can<00:04:26.430> see

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
so this is just being picky you can see

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.279 
so this is just being picky you can see
that<00:04:26.789> there<00:04:26.910> is<00:04:27.000> like<00:04:27.150> some<00:04:27.180> blur<00:04:27.630> tool<00:04:27.930> use

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.219 
that there is like some blur tool use
just<00:04:28.800> to<00:04:29.060> so<00:04:30.060> it's<00:04:30.210> not<00:04:30.330> rough<00:04:30.599> and<00:04:30.990> you<00:04:31.080> could

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
just to so it's not rough and you could

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.439 
just to so it's not rough and you could
you<00:04:31.470> could<00:04:31.620> see<00:04:31.830> it<00:04:31.979> but<00:04:32.669> it's<00:04:32.970> not<00:04:33.150> really<00:04:33.419> a

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
you could see it but it's not really a

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.070

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:06.949 
that's all I really could think about

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:09.050 
that's all I really could think about
okay<00:05:07.949> so<00:05:07.979> it's<00:05:08.220> been<00:05:08.280> a<00:05:08.370> couple<00:05:08.550> days<00:05:08.820> now<00:05:09.030> I

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
okay so it's been a couple days now I

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.120 
okay so it's been a couple days now I
stuck<00:05:09.449> them<00:05:09.599> all<00:05:09.659> long<00:05:09.840> as<00:05:10.470> you<00:05:10.590> can<00:05:10.740> see<00:05:10.919> and

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
stuck them all long as you can see and

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.339 
stuck them all long as you can see and
the<00:05:11.849> thing<00:05:12.389> I<00:05:12.479> noticed<00:05:12.810> with<00:05:12.870> these<00:05:13.050> stickers

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
the thing I noticed with these stickers

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:15.879 
the thing I noticed with these stickers
as<00:05:13.530> I<00:05:13.650> was<00:05:13.740> putting<00:05:13.889> them<00:05:14.039> on<00:05:14.220> am<00:05:14.760> if<00:05:15.090> you<00:05:15.630> don't

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
as I was putting them on am if you don't

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.490 
as I was putting them on am if you don't
apply<00:05:16.889> pressure<00:05:17.250> as<00:05:17.639> you're<00:05:17.880> laying<00:05:18.090> it<00:05:18.240> on

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
apply pressure as you're laying it on

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.560 
apply pressure as you're laying it on
there<00:05:19.500> will<00:05:19.710> be<00:05:19.740> air<00:05:19.979> bubbles<00:05:20.370> but<00:05:20.760> there's<00:05:21.419> an

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
there will be air bubbles but there's an

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.220 
there will be air bubbles but there's an
easy<00:05:21.750> fix

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
easy fix

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.140 
easy fix
because<00:05:22.500> if<00:05:23.400> you<00:05:23.550> could<00:05:23.730> tell<00:05:23.880> I<00:05:23.910> have<00:05:24.120> a

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
because if you could tell I have a

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.540 
because if you could tell I have a
rubberized<00:05:24.570> case<00:05:24.870> on<00:05:25.110> here<00:05:25.320> so<00:05:25.980> let's<00:05:26.010> say<00:05:26.340> for

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
rubberized case on here so let's say for

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.070 
rubberized case on here so let's say for
this<00:05:26.640> stick<00:05:26.880> if<00:05:27.000> I<00:05:27.120> wanted<00:05:27.330> to<00:05:27.420> move<00:05:27.630> it<00:05:27.840> like<00:05:28.050> I

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
this stick if I wanted to move it like I

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.190 
this stick if I wanted to move it like I
peel<00:05:28.350> it<00:05:28.470> off<00:05:29.150> excuse<00:05:30.150> the<00:05:30.510> background<00:05:30.690> noise

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
peel it off excuse the background noise

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.690 
peel it off excuse the background noise
they're<00:05:31.530> doing<00:05:31.920> construction<00:05:32.010> the<00:05:32.550> house

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
they're doing construction the house

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.600 
they're doing construction the house
across<00:05:33.030> to<00:05:33.210> me<00:05:33.360> but<00:05:34.020> see<00:05:34.800> I<00:05:34.860> could<00:05:35.130> peel<00:05:35.310> it<00:05:35.400> off

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
across to me but see I could peel it off

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.010 
across to me but see I could peel it off
and<00:05:36.620> I<00:05:37.620> could<00:05:37.920> peel<00:05:38.490> it<00:05:38.640> back<00:05:38.730> on<00:05:38.970> and<00:05:39.210> it<00:05:39.750> still

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
and I could peel it back on and it still

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.050 
and I could peel it back on and it still
sticks<00:05:40.290> so<00:05:41.040> I<00:05:41.070> guess<00:05:41.250> it<00:05:41.400> depends<00:05:41.760> on<00:05:41.910> these

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
sticks so I guess it depends on these

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.430 
sticks so I guess it depends on these
surface<00:05:42.540> you<00:05:42.630> put<00:05:42.810> it<00:05:42.900> on<00:05:42.990> let's<00:05:43.200> say<00:05:43.320> if<00:05:43.380> you

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
surface you put it on let's say if you

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.800 
surface you put it on let's say if you
put<00:05:43.590> on<00:05:43.680> plywood<00:05:43.980> obviously<00:05:44.790> that<00:05:45.540> wouldn't

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
put on plywood obviously that wouldn't

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.260 
put on plywood obviously that wouldn't
work<00:05:46.070> but<00:05:47.070> if<00:05:47.370> you're<00:05:47.550> to<00:05:47.700> put<00:05:47.820> out<00:05:47.940> something

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
work but if you're to put out something

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.680 
work but if you're to put out something
like<00:05:48.390> this<00:05:48.500> rubberized<00:05:49.880> surface<00:05:50.880> or<00:05:51.510> maybe

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
like this rubberized surface or maybe

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.800 
like this rubberized surface or maybe
something<00:05:52.080> like<00:05:52.230> tile<00:05:52.920> or<00:05:53.850> some<00:05:54.150> smooth<00:05:54.510> wood

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
something like tile or some smooth wood

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.960 
something like tile or some smooth wood
or<00:05:55.050> something<00:05:55.260> or<00:05:55.560> a<00:05:55.590> window<00:05:56.010> like<00:05:56.730> it

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
or something or a window like it

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.220 
or something or a window like it
wouldn't<00:05:57.240> leave<00:05:57.360> any<00:05:57.450> residue<00:05:57.870> you<00:05:58.020> see

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230 
wouldn't leave any residue you see

wouldn't leave any residue you see
there's<00:05:58.410> no<00:05:58.560> residue<00:05:58.860> on<00:05:59.070> that<00:05:59.220> and<00:05:59.460> it<00:05:59.550> still

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 
there's no residue on that and it still

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.090
