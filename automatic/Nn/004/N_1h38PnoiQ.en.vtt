00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.090
 and 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.309
 the witnesses of jehova teach that they 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.410
 they are the only true religion because 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.930
 they only fulfill the mandate of 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.620
 jesus to go preach from house to house 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.780
 to give support to it the witnesses of 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.480
 jehova are covered in the texts of 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:00.260
 facts 542 and facts 2020 in order to 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.269
 support the preaching from house to house 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.890
 did you know that the Greek word that 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:09.770
 deals with that phrase is cac today with 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.270
 meeting the preposition tasting cac 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.930
 abbreviation of tasting in a way 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.780
 distributive what does this mean with 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.330
 this I mean the word of the house 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.539
 at home it is poorly translated because it is 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.210
 expressed in a consecutive way this 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.430
 bad translation if you can call it the 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.590
 better translation to the translation of 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.500
 new world gives the idea that when 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.729
 you preach raisins from a house and then to the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.090
 another like this consecutively however the 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.820
 Greek indicates distribution 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.579
 the idea of ​​a previous appointment as such a 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.909
 doctor would visit the patients prior 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:54.289
 quote this same thing makes it notice the same 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:57.380
 translation of the new world r &amp; b and 18 the 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:02.000
 which recognizes the distributive mode is 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.429
 interesting that in fact 246 is used 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.429
 the same word cat and with and without 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:10.280
 However, they translate it correctly as 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:13.760
 in the houses because they do not translate it as 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.640
 from house to house evidently because no 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.890
 it makes sense on the other hand I make them 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.530
 notice the warning that Mr. 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.890
 Jesus Christ for preaching and put 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:29.510
 attention to the final part of said text 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:31.970
 Lucas 10 7 reads as follows and pose in 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.879
 that same house eating and drinking 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.790
 what they give you because the worker is worthy 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:41.329
 of your salary do not go home from home 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.629
 house I repeat again do not miss out on 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:47.700
 home at home therefore here they would be 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:50.090
 falling in two errors 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.349
 interpretation error by 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.200
 ignorance of the interpretation of 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.300
 Greek since the witnesses of jehova not 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.660
 they have it and it is understandable to support 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.970
 his doctrines and two did not know you 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.090
 that the bible made under the argument 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.910
 that they give on the other hand all the 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.489
 apostolic fathers preached the kerygma 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.040
 or the gospel of the kingdom of God 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.170
 however witnesses preach 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.510
 jehova the gospel that announced the 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.900
 apostles and that is mentioned in the new 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.230
 testament the truth is that they do not preach 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.650
 a transposed maledicled profane gospel 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.230
 the witnesses of jehova preach topics of 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.290
 the watchtower wake up one or the other 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.440
 brochure and book preach paradise 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.080
 earthly they preached efe kerigma of a 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.800
 paradise the apostles 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.800
 undoubtedly that they do not 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:49.290
 they preached the kingdom of god so the 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.200
 witnesses of jehova is the only religion 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.590
 what is doing just what 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.870
 Jesus commanded not to make his disciples of 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.720
 being transferred unduly from 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.600
 house at home as we have already read there 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.780
 Luke chapter 10 verse 7 that reads 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.630
 as follows do not go transferring from 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.750
 Home at home or moving from home 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.390
 house this is the only biblical passage 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.420
 where the Greek word today with what 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:22.170
 means house appears repeated two 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:25.650
 times that is from house to house today with 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:28.080
 cat and with do not forget it and stop one 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.810
 once and for all of being cheating be 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.420
 yourselves arguing that Jesus 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.120
 He sent to preach from house to house because 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:39.150
 that statement is totally wrong 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.880
 may God illuminate them and open the blinders 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:45.920
 eyes of the witnesses of jehova up 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.920
 soon max baeza
