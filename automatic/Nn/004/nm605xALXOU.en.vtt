00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.259 
engineering kit for battlefield 4 if
you've<00:00:07.740> seen<00:00:07.950> my<00:00:08.099> previous<00:00:08.130> recon<00:00:08.910> mom<00:00:09.090> where

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
you've seen my previous recon mom where

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.240 
you've seen my previous recon mom where
I've<00:00:09.360> broken<00:00:09.599> down<00:00:09.780> guns<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.500> attachments<00:00:11.099> on

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
I've broken down guns the attachments on

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.270 
I've broken down guns the attachments on
those<00:00:11.460> guns<00:00:12.019> the<00:00:13.019> equipment<00:00:13.559> sidearms<00:00:14.160> and

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
those guns the equipment sidearms and

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.799 
those guns the equipment sidearms and
everything<00:00:14.639> else<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:14.940> use<00:00:15.120> for<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.540> then<00:00:15.719> the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
everything else I use for it then the

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.180 
everything else I use for it then the
formula<00:00:16.170> will<00:00:16.260> be<00:00:16.379> basically<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.890> same<00:00:16.980> for

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
formula will be basically the same for

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.960 
formula will be basically the same for
this<00:00:17.990> with<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.080> addition<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.560> basically<00:00:20.070> well

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
this with the addition of basically well

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.820 
this with the addition of basically well
the<00:00:21.090> differences<00:00:21.600> between<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.140> two<00:00:22.289> kits<00:00:22.590> and

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
the differences between the two kits and

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.200 
the differences between the two kits and
I'll<00:00:22.890> break<00:00:23.100> down<00:00:23.130> all<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.609> further<00:00:23.789> kits

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
I'll break down all the further kits

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.550 
I'll break down all the further kits
coming<00:00:24.539> up<00:00:24.630> in<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.840> future<00:00:24.990> today<00:00:25.410> obviously

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
coming up in the future today obviously

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.320 
coming up in the future today obviously
as<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.160> can<00:00:26.189> tell<00:00:26.310> as<00:00:26.609> I've<00:00:26.730> already<00:00:26.849> told<00:00:27.000> you

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
as you can tell as I've already told you

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.410 
as you can tell as I've already told you
will<00:00:27.449> be<00:00:27.599> engineer<00:00:28.340> the<00:00:29.340> very<00:00:29.580> first<00:00:30.000> thing

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
will be engineer the very first thing

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.939 
will be engineer the very first thing
I'll<00:00:30.599> do<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.779> break<00:00:31.080> down<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.439> guns<00:00:31.679> the

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
I'll do is break down the guns the

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.470 
I'll do is break down the guns the
carbines<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.640> like<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.059> use<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
carbines and that I like to use and the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.150 
carbines and that I like to use and the
the<00:00:33.690> one<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.899> use<00:00:34.050> primarily<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.710> most<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
the one I use primarily the most is the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.010 
the one I use primarily the most is the
one<00:00:35.280> you're<00:00:35.399> looking<00:00:35.430> at<00:00:35.670> here<00:00:35.880> at<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.020> ak5c

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
one you're looking at here at the ak5c

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.880 
one you're looking at here at the ak5c
and<00:00:37.200> that's<00:00:37.350> because<00:00:37.649> it's<00:00:37.800> a

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
and that's because it's a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.850 
and that's because it's a
middle-of-the-pack<00:00:38.340> carbine<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:40.440> fire<00:00:40.620> rate

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
middle-of-the-pack carbine the fire rate

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.069 
middle-of-the-pack carbine the fire rate
on<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.160> very<00:00:41.430> easy<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.450> handle<00:00:42.629> but<00:00:42.960> it's

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
on it's very easy to handle but it's

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.650 
on it's very easy to handle but it's
still<00:00:43.350> quite<00:00:43.739> good<00:00:44.059> when<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.180> look<00:00:45.360> at<00:00:45.510> it

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
still quite good when you look at it

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.900 
still quite good when you look at it
it's<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.870> when<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.680> look<00:00:46.860> at<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.309> actual<00:00:47.610> fire

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
it's a when you look at the actual fire

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.850 
it's a when you look at the actual fire
rate<00:00:48.120> here<00:00:48.390> listed<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.870> side<00:00:49.050> at<00:00:49.200> 700

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
rate here listed on the side at 700

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.290 
rate here listed on the side at 700
which<00:00:50.039> means<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.489> great<00:00:50.879> accuracy

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
which means it's great accuracy

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.610 
which means it's great accuracy
especially<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:52.050> bursts<00:00:53.090> and<00:00:54.090> it's<00:00:54.480> it's<00:00:54.960> like

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
especially in bursts and it's it's like

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.750 
especially in bursts and it's it's like
I<00:00:55.680> said<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.010> middle-of-the-pack<00:00:56.370> gun

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
I said it's a middle-of-the-pack gun

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.880 
I said it's a middle-of-the-pack gun
nothing<00:00:57.120> good<00:00:57.300> nothing<00:00:57.329> bad<00:00:57.719> very<00:00:58.559> middle<00:00:58.829> a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
nothing good nothing bad very middle a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.010 
nothing good nothing bad very middle a
pack<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.370> great<00:00:59.730> player<00:01:00.000> would<00:01:00.270> be<00:01:00.300> deadly<00:01:00.719> with

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
pack a great player would be deadly with

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.779 
pack a great player would be deadly with
this<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.440> even<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.710> person<00:01:02.280> that's<00:01:02.399> not<00:01:02.579> as

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
this and even a person that's not as

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.410 
this and even a person that's not as
skilled<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.359> still<00:01:03.600> be<00:01:03.750> quite<00:01:03.899> good<00:01:04.710> with<00:01:04.979> it

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
skilled can still be quite good with it

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.020 
skilled can still be quite good with it
the<00:01:06.420> other<00:01:06.570> two<00:01:06.750> guns<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.260> use<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.830> mo<00:01:08.030> not

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
the other two guns that I use the mo not

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.850 
the other two guns that I use the mo not
using<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.479> shotgun<00:01:09.720> which<00:01:10.080> would<00:01:10.229> be<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.470> at

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
using a shotgun which would be the at

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.490 
using a shotgun which would be the at
the<00:01:11.010> 870mcs<00:01:11.880> would<00:01:12.270> be<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.540> mtar<00:01:12.930> despite<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the 870mcs would be the mtar despite the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.560 
the 870mcs would be the mtar despite the
fact<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.799> I'm<00:01:13.979> not<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.460> haven't<00:01:15.090> used<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.420> much

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
fact that I'm not I haven't used it much

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.850 
fact that I'm not I haven't used it much
lately<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.049> don't<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.290> all<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.530> unlocks

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
lately and don't have all the unlocks

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.469 
lately and don't have all the unlocks
for<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.430> I'll<00:01:17.670> show<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:17.939> what<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.210> would

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
for it but I'll show you what I would

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.830 
for it but I'll show you what I would
use<00:01:18.689> for<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.369> PDW<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.180> choice<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.630> use

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
use for it and the PDW of choice I use

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.100 
use for it and the PDW of choice I use
is<00:01:22.020> obviously<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.619> mp7<00:01:23.240> because<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> mp7<00:01:24.630> has

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
is obviously the mp7 because the mp7 has

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.320 
is obviously the mp7 because the mp7 has
just<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.530> incredible<00:01:26.100> fire<00:01:26.369> rate<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.880> when

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
just that incredible fire rate and when

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.210 
just that incredible fire rate and when
is<00:01:27.689> throwing<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.170> laser<00:01:28.409> sight<00:01:28.710> on<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:28.920> just

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
is throwing a laser sight on it just

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.450 
is throwing a laser sight on it just
makes<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.030> accurate<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.689> close<00:01:30.930> quarters

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
makes it so accurate in close quarters

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.020 
makes it so accurate in close quarters
it's<00:01:32.460> extremely<00:01:33.270> good<00:01:34.009> the<00:01:35.009> ak5c<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:35.850> this

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
it's extremely good the ak5c in this

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.090 
it's extremely good the ak5c in this
would<00:01:36.630> pretty<00:01:36.869> much<00:01:36.990> be<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.470> same<00:01:37.710> loadout

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
would pretty much be the same loadout

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.310 
would pretty much be the same loadout
for<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.369> mtar<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:39.060> use<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> coyote<00:01:40.049> sight

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
for the mtar I use the coyote sight

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.499 
for the mtar I use the coyote sight
because<00:01:40.619> basically<00:01:40.890> that's<00:01:41.280> what<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.090> choose

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
because basically that's what I choose

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.620 
because basically that's what I choose
for<00:01:43.229> max<00:01:43.470> success<00:01:43.950> for<00:01:44.250> me<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:45.270> can<00:01:45.420> choose

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
for max success for me you can choose

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.999 
for max success for me you can choose
whatever<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.079> want<00:01:46.200> as<00:01:46.560> long<00:01:46.590> as<00:01:46.890> you're

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
whatever you want as long as you're

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.590 
whatever you want as long as you're
actually<00:01:47.460> being<00:01:47.790> effective<00:01:48.360> with<00:01:48.570> that

particular<00:01:49.049> site<00:01:49.530> subjectivity<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.399> a

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
particular site subjectivity is a

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.240 
particular site subjectivity is a
beautiful<00:01:50.939> thing<00:01:51.119> here<00:01:51.649> when<00:01:52.649> I'm<00:01:52.770> looking<00:01:53.130> at

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
beautiful thing here when I'm looking at

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.149 
beautiful thing here when I'm looking at
the<00:01:53.399> laser<00:01:53.640> sight<00:01:54.090> here<00:01:54.740> that's<00:01:55.740> basically

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
the laser sight here that's basically

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.160 
the laser sight here that's basically
because<00:01:56.399> while<00:01:57.000> it's<00:01:57.149> obvious<00:01:57.299> compared<00:01:57.990> to

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
because while it's obvious compared to

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.539 
because while it's obvious compared to
what<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.469> had<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.740> could<00:01:58.890> choose<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.219> canted

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
what you had you could choose the canted

have the flash hider on because it

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.260 
have the flash hider on because it

actually reduces the bullet speed

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
bullet drop that a Solera suppressor

bullet drop that a Solera suppressor
would<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:46.190> muzzle<00:02:46.520> brakes<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.940> nice<00:02:47.090> option<00:02:47.570> as

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
would the muzzle brakes a nice option as

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.000 
would the muzzle brakes a nice option as
well<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:48.170> reason<00:02:48.440> being<00:02:48.620> if<00:02:48.800> you're<00:02:48.920> gonna

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
well the reason being if you're gonna

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.310 
well the reason being if you're gonna
fire<00:02:49.310> this<00:02:49.520> gun<00:02:49.790> in<00:02:50.270> bursts<00:02:50.720> or<00:02:50.900> tap<00:02:51.080> fire

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
fire this gun in bursts or tap fire

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.840 
fire this gun in bursts or tap fire
anyway<00:02:51.740> then<00:02:51.920> you<00:02:52.010> won't<00:02:52.190> have<00:02:52.460> to<00:02:52.640> worry

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
anyway then you won't have to worry

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.810 
anyway then you won't have to worry
about<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.210> accuracy<00:02:53.510> penalty<00:02:54.640> this<00:02:55.640> gun

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
about the accuracy penalty this gun

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.220 
about the accuracy penalty this gun
doesn't<00:02:56.000> even<00:02:56.180> need<00:02:56.360> it<00:02:56.510> it's<00:02:56.660> a<00:02:56.780> laser<00:02:56.990> beam

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
doesn't even need it it's a laser beam

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.890 
doesn't even need it it's a laser beam
anyway<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:58.670> of<00:02:58.820> course<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.270> can<00:02:59.420> equip<00:02:59.750> the

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
anyway and of course you can equip the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.060 
anyway and of course you can equip the
suppressor<00:03:00.380> if<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:00.560> want<00:03:00.710> to<00:03:00.770> stay<00:03:00.920> off<00:03:01.040> the

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
suppressor if you want to stay off the

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.340 
suppressor if you want to stay off the
mini-map<00:03:01.480> decrease<00:03:02.480> your<00:03:02.630> sound<00:03:02.870> signature

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
mini-map decrease your sound signature

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.440 
mini-map decrease your sound signature
and<00:03:03.650> most<00:03:03.830> of<00:03:04.010> all<00:03:04.130> just<00:03:04.520> it's<00:03:05.180> a<00:03:05.300> great

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
and most of all just it's a great

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.960 
and most of all just it's a great
flanking<00:03:06.080> tool<00:03:06.290> so<00:03:07.250> that's<00:03:07.370> a<00:03:07.580> really<00:03:07.730> nice

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
flanking tool so that's a really nice

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.810 
flanking tool so that's a really nice
one<00:03:08.180> to<00:03:08.300> have<00:03:08.450> as<00:03:08.630> well<00:03:09.280> for<00:03:10.280> good<00:03:10.460> or<00:03:10.610> for<00:03:10.760> bad

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
one to have as well for good or for bad

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.610 
one to have as well for good or for bad
I<00:03:11.000> tend<00:03:11.420> to<00:03:11.480> shoot<00:03:11.660> on<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:11.870> run<00:03:12.020> a<00:03:12.050> lot<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:12.530> it

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
I tend to shoot on the run a lot and it

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.830 
I tend to shoot on the run a lot and it
does<00:03:12.800> affect<00:03:12.950> accuracy<00:03:13.730> but<00:03:13.910> putting<00:03:14.210> on<00:03:14.390> the

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
does affect accuracy but putting on the

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.660 
does affect accuracy but putting on the
ergonomic<00:03:15.350> grip<00:03:15.530> here<00:03:15.740> reduces<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.430> hip<00:03:16.610> fire

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
ergonomic grip here reduces the hip fire

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.770 
ergonomic grip here reduces the hip fire
penalty<00:03:17.770> by<00:03:18.770> up<00:03:18.890> to<00:03:18.920> 50%<00:03:19.400> so<00:03:20.000> it's<00:03:20.180> really<00:03:20.510> nice

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780

launcher I use basically because it's a

you can hit tanks quite a bit away and

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
fantastic launcher once you get used to

fantastic launcher once you get used to
the<00:04:33.410> practice<00:04:33.700> the<00:04:34.700> only<00:04:34.880> downside<00:04:35.330> being<00:04:35.570> is

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
the practice the only downside being is

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.330 
the practice the only downside being is
that<00:04:35.930> in<00:04:36.050> close<00:04:36.260> quarters<00:04:36.740> you<00:04:36.830> actually<00:04:37.190> have

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
that in close quarters you actually have

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.760 
that in close quarters you actually have
to<00:04:37.460> keep<00:04:37.639> the<00:04:37.760> loft<00:04:37.940> maintained<00:04:38.560> and<00:04:39.560> that's

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
to keep the loft maintained and that's

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.560 
to keep the loft maintained and that's
why<00:04:39.950> if<00:04:40.130> I'm<00:04:40.280> using<00:04:40.460> close<00:04:40.850> quarters<00:04:41.240> battles

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
why if I'm using close quarters battles

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.720 
why if I'm using close quarters battles
against<00:04:41.780> armored<00:04:42.230> infantry<00:04:42.470> or<00:04:43.220> are<00:04:43.370> mostly

against armored infantry or are mostly

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.640 
against armored infantry or are mostly
armored<00:04:44.090> I<00:04:44.150> guess<00:04:44.389> I'd<00:04:44.630> use<00:04:44.840> the<00:04:44.990> RPG<00:04:45.470> because

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
armored I guess I'd use the RPG because

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.250 
armored I guess I'd use the RPG because
it's<00:04:45.889> fire-and-forget<00:04:46.780> you<00:04:47.780> can<00:04:47.930> fire<00:04:48.110> it

it's fire-and-forget you can fire it

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.780 
it's fire-and-forget you can fire it

but<00:06:34.940> I<00:06:34.970> always<00:06:35.330> usually<00:06:35.570> stick<00:06:35.930> with<00:06:36.050> this

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
but I always usually stick with this

camouflages<00:06:37.580> of<00:06:37.700> course<00:06:37.940> up<00:06:38.120> to<00:06:38.150> the<00:06:38.330> map<00:06:38.539> it's

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:39.530 
camouflages of course up to the map it's

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.090 
camouflages of course up to the map it's
just<00:06:39.680> another<00:06:39.890> way<00:06:40.130> for<00:06:40.190> the<00:06:40.490> enemy<00:06:40.760> to<00:06:40.880> have

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100 
just another way for the enemy to have

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.560 
just another way for the enemy to have
for<00:06:41.250> miserable<00:06:41.640> time<00:06:41.790> trying<00:06:42.090> to<00:06:42.150> locate<00:06:42.510> you

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.570 
for miserable time trying to locate you

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.690 
for miserable time trying to locate you
so<00:06:42.930> try<00:06:43.110> to<00:06:43.140> speck<00:06:43.650> it<00:06:43.800> to<00:06:43.890> the<00:06:43.980> map<00:06:44.160> but<00:06:44.400> if<00:06:44.490> or

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:44.700 
so try to speck it to the map but if or

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.220 
so try to speck it to the map but if or
if<00:06:44.820> you<00:06:45.090> just<00:06:45.120> want<00:06:45.450> to<00:06:45.510> look<00:06:45.630> cool<00:06:45.780> with<00:06:46.020> a

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.230 
if you just want to look cool with a

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.470 
if you just want to look cool with a
certain<00:06:46.530> one<00:06:46.710> by<00:06:46.950> mean<00:06:47.160> power<00:06:47.340> to<00:06:47.580> you<00:06:47.730> I'm<00:06:48.210> not

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:48.480 
certain one by mean power to you I'm not

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.420 
certain one by mean power to you I'm not
gonna<00:06:48.660> stop<00:06:48.900> you<00:06:48.930> there<00:06:49.250> and<00:06:50.250> that's

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.430 
gonna stop you there and that's

basically<00:06:50.880> the<00:06:50.970> rundown<00:06:51.510> of<00:06:51.780> my<00:06:52.020> engineering

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
basically the rundown of my engineering

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.800 
basically the rundown of my engineering
kit<00:06:52.710> of<00:06:52.890> course<00:06:53.130> it<00:06:53.310> changes<00:06:53.760> map<00:06:54.000> to<00:06:54.240> map<00:06:54.390> it

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:54.810 
kit of course it changes map to map it

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.360 
kit of course it changes map to map it
might<00:06:55.020> change<00:06:55.290> has<00:06:55.620> the<00:06:55.770> ebb<00:06:55.860> and<00:06:55.890> flow<00:06:56.070> of<00:06:56.220> the

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.370 
might change has the ebb and flow of the

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.090 
might change has the ebb and flow of the
map<00:06:56.520> changes<00:06:57.000> per<00:06:57.330> time<00:06:57.600> I<00:06:57.630> play<00:06:57.990> but<00:06:58.800> that's

00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 
map changes per time I play but that's

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.820 
map changes per time I play but that's
my<00:06:59.520> average<00:07:00.060> if<00:07:00.240> you<00:07:00.270> told<00:07:00.600> me<00:07:00.720> to<00:07:01.020> pick<00:07:01.500> an

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
my average if you told me to pick an

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.950 
my average if you told me to pick an
engineering<00:07:02.490> kit<00:07:02.760> that's<00:07:03.480> what<00:07:03.660> I<00:07:03.690> would<00:07:03.930> use

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 
engineering kit that's what I would use

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.370 
engineering kit that's what I would use
hope<00:07:04.950> you<00:07:05.100> enjoy
