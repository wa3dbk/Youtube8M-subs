all<00:00:00.659> right<00:00:00.840> so<00:00:01.170> now<00:00:01.290> I'll<00:00:01.439> tell<00:00:01.680> you<00:00:01.709> a<00:00:01.829> little

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
all right so now I'll tell you a little

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.070 
all right so now I'll tell you a little
bit<00:00:02.100> about<00:00:02.460> how<00:00:02.669> I<00:00:02.700> built<00:00:03.030> this<00:00:03.179> Segway<00:00:03.600> it's

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
bit about how I built this Segway it's

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.369 
bit about how I built this Segway it's
about<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:04.470> mechanics<00:00:04.640> from<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:05.850> top

00:00:06.369 --> 00:00:06.379 
about the mechanics from the top

pipe goes down to this joint custom a

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.870 
pipe goes down to this joint custom a
joint<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:16.560> also<00:00:16.770> senses<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.600> the<00:00:18.600> angle<00:00:19.880> so

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
joint that also senses the the angle so

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.189 
joint that also senses the the angle so
you<00:00:20.970> know<00:00:21.060> which<00:00:21.240> direction<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.840> turn

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
you know which direction to turn

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.950 
you know which direction to turn

briefly when I move the Segway I can see

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.840 
briefly when I move the Segway I can see
on<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.630> screen<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.350> angle<00:01:52.710> actually<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.729> is

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
on the screen the angle actually this is

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.880 
on the screen the angle actually this is
the<00:01:54.060> filter<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.479> angle<00:01:55.170> from<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.500> gyro<00:01:55.770> and

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
the filter that angle from the gyro and

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.539 
the filter that angle from the gyro and
accelerometer<00:01:56.299> ok<00:01:57.299> that's<00:01:57.869> about<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.320> if<00:01:58.920> you

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
accelerometer ok that's about it if you

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.830 
accelerometer ok that's about it if you
want<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.759> know<00:01:59.969> more<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.390> can<00:02:00.420> find<00:02:00.719> more

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
want to know more you can find more
