happy with the results it took me about

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.140 
happy with the results it took me about
an<00:02:11.360> hour<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:12.340> do<00:02:13.340> so<00:02:13.610> there<00:02:13.880> were<00:02:13.940> some<00:02:14.090> things

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
an hour to do so there were some things

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.590 
an hour to do so there were some things
to<00:02:14.480> figure<00:02:14.660> out<00:02:15.459> I<00:02:16.459> look<00:02:17.000> how<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.209> do<00:02:17.360> it<00:02:17.510> on

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
to figure out I look how to do it on

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.620 
to figure out I look how to do it on
YouTube<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:18.489> know<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.640> HD<00:02:20.180> forums<00:02:20.660> but<00:02:21.020> I

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
YouTube you know the HD forums but I

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.059 
YouTube you know the HD forums but I
guess<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.780> best<00:02:23.959> way<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.170> do<00:02:24.410> it<00:02:24.560> is<00:02:24.709> trial<00:02:25.010> by

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
guess the best way to do it is trial by

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.339 
guess the best way to do it is trial by
air<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.610> mean<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:26.209> did<00:02:26.360> follow<00:02:26.599> some<00:02:26.840> protocols
