00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.559
 hi all guys i'm 0 35 for 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:16.400
 feed in awe and today I speak to you 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.470
 by ibrahimovic 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.300
 man of the match this player but it is 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.430
 was lent by the youtuber that maker 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.519
 find the link to his channel 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.800
 description that lent me bagged 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.310
 ibrahimovic 93 of general really a 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.859
 value 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.630
 absurd for this player who is 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.210
 now in its third version 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.170
 modified two in form and this is the 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.420
 first murphy the match 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.670
 let's see his in-game statistics on 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.640
 card immediately stand out the highest value 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.250
 96 shooting that and having a new one 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.329
 incredible where we find the 96 of 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.850
 finalization 92 of long 98 of power 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.710
 and 97 of shooting on the fly for which you understand 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.530
 really that this player's shot 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.600
 it is an amazing stuff to put apples 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.539
 inside everyone woke up some but 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.000
 most of the shots were dry 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.350
 sure enough even from afar they are 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.320
 managed to do something about it too 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.780
 punishment but then we are immediately al 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.479
 the player's main counter that the 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.950
 79 of speed that however you understand for 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.770
 a central striker is a very valuable one 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.500
 low especially in other teams where the 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.110
 speed practically fails 80 percent 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.149
 of a player above all I repeat you if 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.470
 he is an attacker so above all 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.210
 if you use it as an attacker 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.520
 central alone in a three-way attack 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.460
 as I did in this case speed 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.250
 79 with 76 of accelerations and eighty of 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.140
 however, speed is combined 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.759
 perfectly at this value value 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.579
 the scale low of speed 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.950
 perfectly the 93 dribbling where 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.409
 we see the ball control 97 and the 95 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.090
 of dry chills I succeeded in the strait 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.150
 to shoot any player 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.650
 then on the wolf 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.710
 even if the speed is low though 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:00.160
 defenders recover you thanks to his 92 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.830
 physical value with 99 of strength and 90 of 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.830
 positioning always grew to hold 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.259
 the ball and never managed to steal it 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.399
 is true ibra is a player that is me 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.260
 loved it 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.660
 we will then see the vote I have at the end 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.120
 given and you will understand then also from the clips 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.010
 as you can see now 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.870
 understand why of that emptiness and understand 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.410
 because how devastating this is 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.390
 player 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.540
 then the other two against that anyway 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.830
 we will see in the usual summary sheet 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.200
 will be the fact that it is on the market 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.020
 difficult to find it added again for 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.760
 one day they reached it in 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.800
 packages to make it find a little more 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.740
 because really nobody was found 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.630
 who if you who I find Veneto and there 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.480
 he doesn't want to sell it to keep it 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.310
 because it's really incredible player 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.560
 the data if you have the availability 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.209
 economic take it because how 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.180
 central striker in my opinion is the most 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.360
 strong of the game for the way I have of 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:59.290
 play up ie central attacker 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.720
 handsome physical shooter ie dribbler 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.519
 really the best player that me 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.250
 have tried strong ones and that 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:09.370
 which I liked the most we talk a little 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.290
 instead of the network work that medium low 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.060
 this too has this work rhythm 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.400
 let a little twist up your nose because 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.250
 ibra wants to use it as a 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.930
 striker standing there in front of that 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.700
 face department alone so that 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.040
 maybe the balls on the ball I do 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.680
 go up the team and then finish by 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.720
 just lean on the exterior or otherwise 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.030
 midfielders who rise to the value of 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.040
 medium-low left me a bit like that 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.040
 because often and ibra not willingly 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.440
 He was back on but that is for her 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.239
 low value because maybe I was going up 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.010
 those wings it is obvious that I want to throw it 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.720
 inside for him to 92 of physical strength 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.430
 instead ibra 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.560
 it entered the area indeed as 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.720
 see from the clips where cross effects 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.180
 more often than not I had to keep 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.770
 very ball with wings on the bottom for then 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.870
 go where you see the incredible 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.210
 cosas punishment also the value of 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.080
 very high punishment so if you are 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:04.840
 able to beat them will really release vi 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.090
 will surprise you for the ease of this 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.470
 player to go into the goal but really 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:13.420
 guys trust me is then another against 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.190
 it occurred to me now if I did 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.380
 so we want to give so is his 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.750
 difficulty putting it into a team that 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.210
 have a satisfactory understanding because i 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.820
 giving it is difficult because 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.560
 or someone we should use Swedish 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.680
 we find the Swedes the strong one 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.500
 or of the legal the only decent e 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.630
 cavani maybe matuidi but little stuff 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.280
 understand why or give up a little 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.430
 to the agreement or make a team 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.080
 around so much with him you win is in 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.120
 able to solve the game alone 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.740
 understand that it will happen but it is clearly a 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.780
 pop genre player 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.610
 summing up dribbling and physical shooting 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.850
 they spoke flop abundantly 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.590
 silk speed only 79 price yes 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.050
 is around 10 million per 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.940
 playstation around 7 for xbox but 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.729
 also the difficulty of finding it on 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.890
 market I leave you guys put a 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.780
