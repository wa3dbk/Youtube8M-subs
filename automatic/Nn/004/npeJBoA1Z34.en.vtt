00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.760 

so<00:00:00.510> we<00:00:00.630> talked<00:00:00.840> about<00:00:00.900> the<00:00:01.170> importance<00:00:01.650> of

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
so we talked about the importance of

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.260 
so we talked about the importance of
paddling<00:00:02.129> with<00:00:02.280> other<00:00:02.490> boaters<00:00:02.879> so<00:00:03.000> you<00:00:03.120> have

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
paddling with other boaters so you have

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.599 
paddling with other boaters so you have
support<00:00:03.720> on<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:03.959> river<00:00:04.140> it's<00:00:04.830> also<00:00:05.040> important

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
support on the river it's also important

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.190 
support on the river it's also important
to<00:00:05.670> have<00:00:05.730> a<00:00:05.850> standard<00:00:06.420> set<00:00:06.600> of<00:00:06.629> signals<00:00:07.109> that

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
to have a standard set of signals that

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.660 
to have a standard set of signals that
you<00:00:07.319> can<00:00:07.350> use<00:00:07.680> to<00:00:07.859> communicate<00:00:08.040> with<00:00:08.370> other

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
you can use to communicate with other

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.430 
you can use to communicate with other
boaters<00:00:09.030> on<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.240> river<00:00:09.450> whether<00:00:10.080> they're<00:00:10.290> in

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
boaters on the river whether they're in

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.860 
boaters on the river whether they're in
your<00:00:10.469> group<00:00:10.950> or<00:00:11.099> not<00:00:11.300> so<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.450> American

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
your group or not so the American

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.660 
your group or not so the American
whitewater<00:00:13.230> Association<00:00:13.920> has<00:00:14.130> developed<00:00:14.280> a

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
whitewater Association has developed a

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.970 
whitewater Association has developed a
series<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:15.059> signals<00:00:15.839> that<00:00:16.049> allow<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.740> to

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
series of signals that allow you to

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.470 
series of signals that allow you to
communicate<00:00:17.310> with<00:00:17.789> other<00:00:17.910> boaters<00:00:18.270> in<00:00:18.300> the

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
communicate with other boaters in the

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.689 
communicate with other boaters in the
river<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.930> pretty<00:00:19.650> much<00:00:19.859> everybody<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:20.400> the

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
river and pretty much everybody in the

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.630 
river and pretty much everybody in the
paddling<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.449> non-us<00:00:22.109> rivers<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.830> familiar

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
paddling of non-us rivers is familiar

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.130 
paddling of non-us rivers is familiar
with<00:00:23.699> these<00:00:23.910> signals<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.480> uses<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.930> same

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
with these signals and uses the same

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.950 
with these signals and uses the same
ones<00:00:25.430> if<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.519> do<00:00:26.789> get<00:00:27.090> one<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.359> these<00:00:27.480> signals

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
ones if you do get one of these signals

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.109 
ones if you do get one of these signals
give<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.560> signal<00:00:28.920> back<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.369> signal<00:00:29.849> or<00:00:29.939> so

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
give the signal back to the signal or so

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.820 
give the signal back to the signal or so
that<00:00:30.240> they<00:00:30.359> know<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.900> got<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.439> they

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
that they know that you got it and they

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.040 
that they know that you got it and they
know<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.009> you're<00:00:32.309> going<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.460> act<00:00:32.700> on<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
know that you're going to act on it the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.620 
know that you're going to act on it the
basic<00:00:34.440> signals<00:00:34.800> are<00:00:34.890> these<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:36.030> first<00:00:36.270> one<00:00:36.480> is

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
basic signals are these the first one is

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.869 
basic signals are these the first one is
a<00:00:36.660> paddle<00:00:37.079> straight<00:00:37.320> up<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.590> air<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.129> what

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
a paddle straight up in the air and what

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.630 
a paddle straight up in the air and what
that<00:00:39.030> means<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.540> go<00:00:39.809> ahead<00:00:40.140> it's<00:00:40.770> okay<00:00:41.160> you

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
that means is go ahead it's okay you

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.860 
that means is go ahead it's okay you
know<00:00:41.760> go<00:00:41.940> straight<00:00:42.210> down<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.570> middle

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
know go straight down the middle

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.220 
know go straight down the middle
if<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.129> paddle<00:00:44.460> goes<00:00:44.640> off<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.059> one<00:00:45.239> side<00:00:45.270> that

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
if the paddle goes off to one side that

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.410 
if the paddle goes off to one side that
means<00:00:46.410> go<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.920> way<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.879> means<00:00:47.969> head<00:00:48.210> over

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
means go that way so it means head over

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.729 
means go that way so it means head over
toward<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.780> side<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.260> river

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
toward that side of the river

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.250 
toward that side of the river
I<00:00:49.879> wouldn't<00:00:50.879> point<00:00:51.149> toward<00:00:51.539> an<00:00:51.660> obstruction

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
I wouldn't point toward an obstruction

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.479 
I wouldn't point toward an obstruction
so<00:00:52.500> for<00:00:52.710> instance<00:00:52.980> if<00:00:53.100> there<00:00:53.280> were<00:00:53.370> an

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
so for instance if there were an

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.580 
so for instance if there were an
obstruction<00:00:54.000> over<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.539> side<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:55.170> would

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
obstruction over on this side I would

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.139 
obstruction over on this side I would
point<00:00:55.920> my<00:00:56.129> paddle<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.760> opposite

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
point my paddle to the opposite

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.849 
point my paddle to the opposite
direction<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.690> encourage<00:00:58.109> people<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.440> go<00:00:58.590> away

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
direction to encourage people to go away

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.619 
direction to encourage people to go away
from<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.160> obstruction<00:00:59.520> so<00:01:00.359> we're<00:01:00.510> never

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
from the obstruction so we're never

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.389 
from the obstruction so we're never
going<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.840> point<00:01:01.109> toward<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.559> problem<00:01:02.160> or<00:01:02.309> an

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
going to point toward a problem or an

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.810 
going to point toward a problem or an
obstruction<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.600> go<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.080> way<00:01:04.260> or<00:01:04.610> go<00:01:05.610> that

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
obstruction so go that way or go that

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.179 
obstruction so go that way or go that
way<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:08.299> horizontal<00:01:09.299> paddle<00:01:09.689> means<00:01:10.500> stop<00:01:10.860> and

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
way a horizontal paddle means stop and

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.190 
way a horizontal paddle means stop and
that<00:01:11.880> usually<00:01:12.060> means<00:01:12.240> stop<00:01:12.720> right<00:01:12.990> where<00:01:13.020> you

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
that usually means stop right where you

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.020 
that usually means stop right where you
are<00:01:13.320> if<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:13.860> catch<00:01:14.010> an<00:01:14.220> eddy<00:01:14.369> stop<00:01:14.729> there

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
are if you can catch an eddy stop there

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.270 
are if you can catch an eddy stop there
if<00:01:15.479> you're<00:01:15.720> already<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.140> Internet<00:01:16.650> e<00:01:16.680> stay<00:01:17.159> in

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
if you're already in Internet e stay in

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.789 
if you're already in Internet e stay in
the<00:01:17.400> eddy<00:01:17.520> you're<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:18.320> maybe<00:01:19.320> something's

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
the eddy you're in maybe something's

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.800 
the eddy you're in maybe something's
going<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.189> downstream<00:01:20.670> maybe<00:01:21.420> there's<00:01:21.659> an

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
going on downstream maybe there's an

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.120 
going on downstream maybe there's an
obstruction<00:01:22.140> downstream<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.009> you

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
obstruction downstream that you

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.160 
obstruction downstream that you
shouldn't<00:01:23.430> be<00:01:23.520> paddling<00:01:23.909> through<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.390> so

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
shouldn't be paddling through and so

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.810 
shouldn't be paddling through and so
that<00:01:25.290> stop<00:01:25.590> signal<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.130> an<00:01:26.250> important<00:01:26.640> one<00:01:26.759> to

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
that stop signal is an important one to

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.870 
that stop signal is an important one to
know<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:28.350> final<00:01:28.710> signal<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.369> one<00:01:29.610> and

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
know the final signal is this one and

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.499 
know the final signal is this one and
this<00:01:30.840> signal<00:01:31.200> means<00:01:31.310> emergency<00:01:32.310> help<00:01:33.060> and

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
this signal means emergency help and

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.140 
this signal means emergency help and
this<00:01:34.110> means<00:01:34.350> come<00:01:34.710> toward<00:01:35.040> me<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.790> know<00:01:35.909> come

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
this means come toward me you know come

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.840 
this means come toward me you know come
I<00:01:36.450> need<00:01:36.720> help<00:01:36.930> here<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:38.189> that's<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.490> paddle

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
I need help here and that's a paddle

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.429 
I need help here and that's a paddle
waving<00:01:39.240> back<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.630> forth<00:01:39.720> vertically

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
waving back and forth vertically

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.639 
waving back and forth vertically
overhead

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
overhead

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.990 
overhead
there's<00:01:43.649> also<00:01:43.829> another<00:01:44.070> signal<00:01:44.610> which<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.850> not

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
there's also another signal which is not

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.670 
there's also another signal which is not
a<00:01:45.030> paddle<00:01:45.479> signal<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:45.930> which<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.200> also<00:01:46.380> pretty

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
a paddle signal but which is also pretty

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.130 
a paddle signal but which is also pretty
universally<00:01:47.340> known<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.909> used<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:49.079> is

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
universally known and used and that is

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.539 
universally known and used and that is
this<00:01:49.670> if<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:51.270> signal<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.869> another<00:01:52.049> boater<00:01:52.549> by

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
this if I signal to another boater by

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.639 
this if I signal to another boater by
patting<00:01:54.180> my<00:01:54.270> helmet<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.960> top<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.350> my<00:01:55.439> head

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
patting my helmet on the top of my head

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.340 
patting my helmet on the top of my head
that's<00:01:56.369> asking<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.969> question<00:01:57.420> are<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.659> okay<00:01:58.049> if

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
that's asking a question are you okay if

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.590 
that's asking a question are you okay if
the<00:01:59.040> throw<00:01:59.250> signals<00:01:59.700> back<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.909> me<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.360> way

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
the throw signals back to me this way

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.569 
the throw signals back to me this way
that's<00:02:01.200> meaning<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.740> means<00:02:01.979> there<00:02:02.219> they<00:02:02.430> are

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
that's meaning that means there they are

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.760 
that's meaning that means there they are
okay<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.210> doesn't<00:02:04.110> mean<00:02:04.229> go<00:02:04.380> ahead<00:02:04.530> it

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
okay that doesn't mean go ahead it

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.260 
okay that doesn't mean go ahead it
doesn't<00:02:04.979> mean<00:02:05.070> run<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.280> same<00:02:05.549> rapid<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.030> just

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
doesn't mean run the same rapid I just

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.150 
doesn't mean run the same rapid I just
ran<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.960> could<00:02:07.229> just<00:02:07.350> mean<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.920> voter

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
ran it could just mean that that voter

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.369 
ran it could just mean that that voter
is<00:02:08.280> okay<00:02:08.610> but<00:02:09.539> they<00:02:09.660> may<00:02:09.810> immediately<00:02:10.020> then

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
is okay but they may immediately then

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.199 
is okay but they may immediately then
put<00:02:10.560> up<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.770> stop<00:02:11.009> sign<00:02:11.280> telling<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.790> not<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.120> go

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
put up a stop sign telling you not to go

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.430 
put up a stop sign telling you not to go
ahead<00:02:12.360> because<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.780> thing<00:02:12.930> they<00:02:13.020> just<00:02:13.230> ran

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
ahead because the thing they just ran

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.880 
ahead because the thing they just ran
was<00:02:13.680> not

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
was not

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.790 
was not
not<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.550> good<00:02:14.760> rapid<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.210> run<00:02:15.440> but<00:02:16.440> either<00:02:16.560> way

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
not a good rapid to run but either way

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.800 
not a good rapid to run but either way
this<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.520> good<00:02:17.730> way<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:17.910> acknowledge<00:02:18.450> yes<00:02:18.630> I

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
this is a good way to acknowledge yes I

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.070 
this is a good way to acknowledge yes I
am<00:02:18.930> okay<00:02:19.610> again<00:02:20.610> use<00:02:21.000> those<00:02:21.209> basic<00:02:21.660> signals

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
am okay again use those basic signals

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.620 
am okay again use those basic signals
pass<00:02:22.680> them<00:02:22.980> back<00:02:23.160> when<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:23.580> win<00:02:23.819> ones<00:02:24.030> pass<00:02:24.330> to

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
pass them back when you win ones pass to

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.890 
pass them back when you win ones pass to
you<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.970> stay<00:02:26.970> together<00:02:27.120> as<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.450> group<00:02:27.569> so<00:02:27.870> you

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
you and stay together as a group so you

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.920 
you and stay together as a group so you
can<00:02:27.990> all<00:02:28.230> support<00:02:28.440> each<00:02:28.680> other
