00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello how about friends welcome to this 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.569
 new video and we are already here for 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.710
 show them what is the new hub of the 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.600
 server 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.940
 well he taught me to change it because 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.800
 obviously we already needed others 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.650
 because the one we had before 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.740
 we were the problems of life we 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.260
 make her tremendous when for example 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.720
 the users left the et hours 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.390
 we threw the gases 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.419
 because having so many people piled up 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.010
 in one place because it speaks instead 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.079
 here people have nowhere to run 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.510
 Look, it was quite far there to go 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:43.220
 and then they have by where more or less 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:46.250
 go and so that it is not done and well another 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.440
 thing that the game is pretty good the 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.950

 Well, I hope you're going to like the 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.630
 reform that we made in the service already 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.450

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.450

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.230
 announce that we have new things for 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.270
 for Christmas we have created a package 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.100
 also in the store a package for 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.510
 Christmas will be alone by Christmas 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.040

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.010
 limited time until then the 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.440
 server close that I believe that never 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.010
 it will close 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.010
 wood 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.020

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.300
 to look at the Christmas package in the 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.910
 store then the server has to point 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.000
 black after point is and here is a little 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:17.250
