00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.320 

the<00:00:28.800> challenge<00:00:29.160> first<00:00:29.340> was<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.850> convert<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
the challenge first was to convert the

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.400 
the challenge first was to convert the
SF<00:00:30.630> unwritten<00:00:31.080> into<00:00:31.770> two<00:00:31.950> different<00:00:32.149> concepts

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
SF unwritten into two different concepts

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.640 
SF unwritten into two different concepts
one<00:00:34.410> for<00:00:35.270> you<00:00:36.270> might<00:00:36.420> say<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.960> racetrack<00:00:37.470> and

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
one for you might say the racetrack and

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.180 
one for you might say the racetrack and
the<00:00:38.280> other<00:00:38.430> one<00:00:38.640> for<00:00:38.940> daily<00:00:39.270> commuting

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
the other one for daily commuting

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.690 
the other one for daily commuting
I'm<00:00:41.360> inspired<00:00:42.360> from<00:00:42.780> car<00:00:43.410> design<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.220> 60s

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
I'm inspired from car design of the 60s

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.540 
I'm inspired from car design of the 60s
like<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.630> Ford<00:00:46.470> Mustang<00:00:46.740> Fastback<00:00:47.579> from<00:00:49.190> 64-66

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
like a Ford Mustang Fastback from 64-66

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.490 
like a Ford Mustang Fastback from 64-66
think<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.210> Starsky<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.780> Hutch<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:51.989> Steve

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
think of Starsky and Hutch and Steve

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:18.320 
think of Starsky and Hutch and Steve
McQueen<00:00:52.650> for<00:00:53.160> example

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.500 

my<00:01:18.900> favorite<00:01:19.530> part<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.980> the<00:01:20.640> headlight<00:01:21.210> mask

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
my favorite part is the headlight mask

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
my favorite part is the headlight mask
because<00:01:22.140> there<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.400> can<00:01:23.780> see<00:01:24.780> all<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
because there you can see all the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.890 
because there you can see all the
techniques<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:26.400> use<00:01:26.430> when<00:01:27.270> creating<00:01:27.570> this

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
techniques we use when creating this

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.710 
techniques we use when creating this
bike<00:01:28.370> it<00:01:29.370> looks<00:01:29.610> very<00:01:29.760> smooth<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.330> clean<00:01:30.510> on

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
bike it looks very smooth and clean on

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.650 
bike it looks very smooth and clean on
the<00:01:30.840> outside<00:01:30.870> and<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:32.000> Explorer<00:01:33.000> really

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
the outside and this Explorer really

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:45.830 
the outside and this Explorer really
brackets<00:01:34.230> and<00:01:34.440> stuff<00:01:35.220> like<00:01:35.370> that<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:35.910> inside

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.440 

it<00:01:46.840> was<00:01:47.020> great<00:01:47.260> to<00:01:47.410> see<00:01:47.440> how<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:47.980> team<00:01:48.940> evolved

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
it was great to see how the team evolved

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.890 
it was great to see how the team evolved
during<00:01:49.840> this<00:01:50.140> build<00:01:50.440> process<00:01:51.010> we<00:01:51.760> learned<00:01:52.330> a

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
during this build process we learned a

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.030 
during this build process we learned a
lot<00:01:53.290> of<00:01:53.350> more<00:01:54.180> technologies<00:01:55.180> like<00:01:56.040> CNC

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
lot of more technologies like CNC

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:05.580 
lot of more technologies like CNC
milling<00:01:57.310> or<00:01:57.640> sand<00:01:58.210> casting<00:01:58.750> here<00:01:59.050> in<00:01:59.260> house

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.890 

taking<00:02:06.590> a<00:02:06.620> closer<00:02:07.070> look<00:02:07.220> at<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.900> stallion

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:08.900 
taking a closer look at the stallion

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.720 
taking a closer look at the stallion
which<00:02:09.080> is<00:02:09.260> a<00:02:09.290> good<00:02:09.560> example<00:02:10.070> I<00:02:10.160> think<00:02:10.370> for

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:10.730 
which is a good example I think for

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.810 
which is a good example I think for
classics<00:02:11.420> or<00:02:11.630> heritage<00:02:12.140> design<00:02:12.590> you<00:02:13.490> can<00:02:13.670> see

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
classics or heritage design you can see

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.330 
classics or heritage design you can see
we've<00:02:14.090> changed<00:02:14.480> so<00:02:15.110> much<00:02:15.350> but<00:02:15.770> you<00:02:15.950> can<00:02:16.100> still

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
we've changed so much but you can still

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:27.450 
we've changed so much but you can still
