00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.630

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.420
 killer and juri schmidt cellity of hama 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.160
 the radom keyboard kunz killer is 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.590
 completely made of black plastic 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.600
 the shiny surface looks chic 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.610
 out, however, draws dust and 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.500
 fingerprints on the 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.550
 handball rest lights up the killer 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.470
 emblem in blue 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.960
 a backlight of the buttons 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.839
 However, it does not come with it 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.750
 replaceable via sd and arrow keys and 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:54.000
 a small exchange tool 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.980
 beautiful addition to the one in this 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.379
 price range but better avoided 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.659
 the rubberized additional buttons of ours 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.400
 Test copies are partially damaged 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.920
 or even stay next to it 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.510
 lying keys depend on that 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.520
 stop when using the standard 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.590
 keys pleasantly light and allows 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.140
 play and write fast 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.420
 the highlight of art are always the ones 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.820
 20 keys on the left 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.590
 right and upper edge are located 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.420
 They offer fast access 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.939
 different multimedia and office 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.790
 applications and work thanks to plug 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.200
 and play without driver installation 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.180
 perfectly with the included 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.210
 Software you can use the key assignment 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.130
 individually programmed support 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.650
 will be up to ten different profiles 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.900
 create with three levels each 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.990
 by markus and the occupation with media 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.330
 internet or mouse functions in commerce 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.840
 is diakons killer from about 13 euro 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.840
 available 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.170
 the hammer keyboard juritsch cellity 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.450
 is also made of black plastic 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.570
 But thanks to the matte surface 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.670
 not so dirt prone to the wsd and 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.640
 Arrow keys are highlighted 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.050
 there are no illuminated elements 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.960
 Accessories is limited to the 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.640
 removable palm rest replacement 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.610
 buttons for the weir is the and 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.930
 Arrow keys are our test copy 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.650
 contrary to the product description not 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.870
 At the stroke of July is also 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.060
 pleasant not quite as easy as that 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.420
 but our comparison model for it 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.820
 relatively quiet and in this price range 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.440
 sufficiently precise the so-called anti 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.660
 ghosting effect ensures that 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.800
 any number of buttons simultaneously 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.740
 can be pressed 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.300
 besides the usual function keys the 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.370
 also on every birth asta tour too 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.200
 There are, however, no 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.600
 other special buttons or 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.300
 functions that you can use in the game 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:51.270
 for july cellity will be depending on 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.270
 traders between 17 and 20 euros due 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.720
 maybe the sharkoon keyboard is working 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.030
 not every gamer is one 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.830
 real scilla so a player with 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.860
 high can have the right thing on it 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.550
 but she is definitely a good one 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.560
 entry-level model for all those in it 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.420
 to become one and not work 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.550
 like an expensive high end keyboard 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.560
 Still not quite like that 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.840
 good workmanship is right here thanks to the 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.790
 numerous function keys and the 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.380
 possibility to change the key assignment 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.650
 the price performance ratio 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.880
 Hammer has another in reality 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.220
 priorities set 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.530
 The keyboard looks significantly higher quality 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.040
 but comes with very few features 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.440
 therefore 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.870
 basically an office keyboard with optical 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.150
 highlighted bsd and arrow keys and 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.860
 anti ghosting for real gamers 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.110
 probably not enough for that 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.470
 Nevertheless, Gamer is an opportunity 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.470
 kind
