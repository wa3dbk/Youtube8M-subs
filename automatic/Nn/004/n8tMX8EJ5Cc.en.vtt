00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:19.140
 used to transport 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.510
 goods over the immense territory 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.500
 Australian the road train is not the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.500
 ordinary carrier 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.420
 it has an impressive length 52 m 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.160
 75 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.230
 he is three feet fifty wide 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.230
 and 4 m 90 high 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.810
 these pioneers weigh 140 tons 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.810
 fidh 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.380
 with a 16-liter diesel engine and 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.380
 600 horses 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.580
 these road trains can carry 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.760
 almost 300 thousand kilograms of merchandise 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.770
 whether it's livestock or products 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.930
 mining 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.400
 finally Australian road features 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.030
 can beat the world record of 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.479
 length 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.490
 indeed with 20 km a delon they can 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.040
 easily block the traffic and 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.770
 fill a portion of highway their 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.040
 size equals 79 trailer is one thousand 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.040
 tons 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.390
 another world is there to measure itself against 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.930
 trucking world in australia ben that 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.580
 do not take a truck even time the 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.630
 brothers frank and john bella rates are 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.630
 owners of a road train 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.710
 he travels the Australian lands 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.710
 from a decade 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.830
 australia needs to create a tool 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.850
 because the distances are huge and 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.290
 cities widely spaced rather than 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.910
 to use a semi trailer 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.890
 we have one driver for one 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.460
 truck and three trailers so three 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.460
 times more freight 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.580
 it's huge train can reach 97 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.580
 kilometers per hour 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:18.860
 over a distance of 2100 kilometers and 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.860
 this with a single gas tank 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.870
 but here no highway paving lice 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.260
 it's rather the bumpy roads that 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.260
 are the norm 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.290
 most roads on which 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.420
 we're rolling are not even paved this 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.930
 are dirt roads very badly between 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.860
 blows these caravans must therefore be 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.860
 very resistant 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.080
 what impresses me most surely is 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.790
 very road is their robustness I 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.100
 drive them on roads in very 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.370
 bad condition and a worst supporter 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.370
 terms 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.070
 how are these behemoths coming to 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.700
 to be so resistant thanks to a high 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.700
 technology 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.920
 here is a standard vehicle c 501 from kent 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.920
 wells 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.480
 it has an aluminum fence 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.740
 extremely robust because there is 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.860
 a lot of cattle that can not be 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:29.390
 always avoided here the engine goes out 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.130
 4p russia thesis imported from the united states 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.390
 it has a huge radiator that 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.520
 cools the engine in large 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:40.080
 heats the fans works 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.910
 always when the truck rolls here are the 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.040
 three-axle diabolos from rome 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.100
 and as he left the road 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.900
 they are set at 20 tons so that's 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.280
 diabolo to receive a load of 20 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.280
 tons and carry it on the road 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.220
 where can we ride with this hard drive here 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:06.189
 on the most bumpy road 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.189
 from Australia which is 640 km la tan put 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.700
 his troops and incredibly badly 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.699
 serviced a lot of trucks survive 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.479
 at these conditions but not all we 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:19.760
 call this route 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.490
 the highway of hell and she deserves 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.900
 well her name she came to the end of 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.650
 many transmissions and many 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.520
 men or those who resisted him and 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.419
 michele dunne 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.340
 a trucker who at 20 years of service these 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.889
 machines are extraordinary and very 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.699
 powerful she pulls three trailers to the 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.699
 times without faltering 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.660
 truckers do not know all 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:46.550
 drive with three remarks 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.560
 some can do it but it takes 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.389
 nerve and know how to stand up for them 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.960
 do this day after day on of 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.220
 bad roads 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.220
 it's not for everyone 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.570
 the poor state of the roads does not represent 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.570
 not the only risk for these truckers 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.620
 if you follow one of these mega machines 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:12.820
 too close you risk the sphere 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:15.790
 faded the worst of engis this is the 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.620
 dust when driving on a road 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.840
 unpaved with heavy loads it gets 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.800
 creates a lot of dust visibility 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.990
 is reduced 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.990
 it's like driving in the fog 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.620
 but with a driver like michele 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.910
 dunne the road trains will continue 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:43.530
 to travel to remote areas 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:44.910
 to deliver goods people 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.590
 are amazed to see a person 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.590
 able to drive one of his trains 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.050
 giving'll not feel there many 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.759
 goods over long distances and 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.939
 on bad roads and they have 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:57.939
 style
