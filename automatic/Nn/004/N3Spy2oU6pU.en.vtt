is<00:00:15.360> our<00:00:15.509> second<00:00:15.839> bail<00:00:15.990> anchor<00:00:16.699> right<00:00:17.699> here<00:00:18.320> got

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
is our second bail anchor right here got

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.790 
is our second bail anchor right here got
a<00:00:19.529> couple<00:00:20.070> nuts<00:00:20.369> in<00:00:20.580> there<00:00:21.590> sling<00:00:22.590> in<00:00:22.740> a

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
climbing system this is due to we need

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.760 
climbing system this is due to we need
to<00:00:53.390> know<00:00:53.510> how<00:00:53.690> much<00:00:53.870> force<00:00:54.170> we're<00:00:54.440> gonna<00:00:54.560> put

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
to know how much force we're gonna put

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.680 
to know how much force we're gonna put
on<00:00:54.860> the<00:00:54.890> anchor<00:00:55.310> I<00:00:55.520> hear<00:00:56.180> many<00:00:56.360> teachers

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
anything that is safe and efficient so

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.220 
anything that is safe and efficient so
we<00:03:02.280> were<00:03:02.400> looking<00:03:02.730> at<00:03:02.820> anchor<00:03:03.209> strength<00:03:03.570> have

we were looking at anchor strength have

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.650 
we were looking at anchor strength have
been<00:03:04.410> safe<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:04.980> efficient<00:03:05.519> then<00:03:06.120> it<00:03:06.330> would<00:03:06.480> be

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
been safe and efficient then it would be

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.030 
been safe and efficient then it would be
within<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.470> bounds<00:03:07.950> of<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.130> AMG<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.610> way<00:03:10.040> this
