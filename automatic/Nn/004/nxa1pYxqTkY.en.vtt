00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.490
 so with you the portal virtuspro.org second 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.970
 interview for today 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.970
 and next to me is one of the most 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.380
 titled players in the CIS and in general 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.970
 all europe in principle 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:31.970
 happy from the import team and all you only 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.310
 that you finished your games in the group 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.720
 Basically you expect to win their 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:42.050
 the first two two games against in la verga of 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:45.320
 I do not remember I take confused where did I become 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.020
 but unexpectedly lost to aul why well 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.150
 in general there was one I say so chose not 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.210
 I knew beforehand that stratum 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.820
 play swam but I think I just need 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.010
 had to play 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.200
 impudent in general in a different way now I played 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.760
 let's say aggression so it was not 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.470
 I just do not mean by empty finish 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.650
 it is not enough what topic he will do and he 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.630
 played a very defense on the economy not 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.570
 was looking for a seat so he just me 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.340
 overtook initially then I could not 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.830
 catch up 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.170
 0 initially somehow refers to the amount to 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.600
 your group to a set of players about easy 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.909
 for myself it turned out or not 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.650
 someone more feared actually with 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.350
 any player who is here for the tournament 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.720
 I am generally comfortable but let's say not in 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.670
 insult verdi i think he's weaker here 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.620
 I will all be really surprised that he 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.170
 passed but like me personally with him 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.240
 easy enough to play I don't know why 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.030
 so it turns out so here's the first game 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.820
 passed without any special excesses then with 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.340
 titanium 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.090
 how could I think I was somewhat lucky 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.760
 so I won let's say so initially 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.760
 Viola from what I did him a fraction 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.710
 basic lost production and i couldn't 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.190
 ask hands to continue the game and 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.229
 there was no production , but in general I 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.960
 was pretty conceived by his group because 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.890
 what if I say thrown 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:11.250
 instead of titanium cream well, instead of lavli 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.160
 for sure here instead of a place 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:19.560
 verdi lider to this would be more difficult 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:22.440
 to me personally but to touch the cream you i think 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.190
 of course saw the first two of you lego in 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.560
 to your group 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.989
 and now he is waiting for his chance 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.280
 replay you somehow can it 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.170
 comment on why 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.209
 a player who is initially considered one 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.420
 from favorites suddenly lose to 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.280
 their first match but because there was one 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.040
 in one group who could anything there 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.720
 pass on just by this we played bo3 it 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.239
 would be a very long time off for taking into account 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.750
 is that there are only four Crump 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:51.510
 so in one random but by the way 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.000
 I want to note that the players play and 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.340
 scene on 2 landing is not on computers she 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.380
 on ducks with monitors somehow generally to 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.440
 this include 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.630
 does it somehow affect but don’t know 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.579
 the quality of that game may not be enough 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.380
 fps or something there RAM 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.150
 up to influence and because the comp and here 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.530
 To put it mildly, not much for starcraft ii 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.170
 at high limit strong lags 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.620
 start here about the internet this 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.019
 that's where internet monitors in this code 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.150
 only here is the powerful perfume itself weak 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.420
 I kind of played the other hottie 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.340
 There is a laptop and it is for him too 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.340
 monitors are well connected there naturally 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.370
 tani for an order of magnitude better than these let's say 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.780
 I played in the middle of the times and there configuration 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.320
 but it's better than my personal 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:42.380
 the company is like so therefore of course 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:45.000
 sadly everything is fine with the company 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.019
 we will be sick because of you 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.230
 actually ff 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:52.650
 I would like to discuss 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:57.989
 you draw skill and price rhythm xi 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:00.780
 myself a group of us i am not involved she 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.780
 reflection of the underwater ces you group 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.079
 caught mine with the camp to the station 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.449
 Arthur from 100 will give what for themselves the main 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.880
 rivals in this group and what are the expectations 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:13.680
 total of games but all about equal on 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.109
 in fact, I am more than satisfied with my 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.419
 group I think that I can do it and if 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.299
 no files will be made and the ball 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:23.730
 It should happen with the first place but 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.260
 the answer is still remember home store there 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.150
 unfortunately you could not go to the playoffs 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.699
 from the second group you became something 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.669
 then went wrong pike was a group 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:35.250
 as far as we remember, not particularly easy of course 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.750
 Well, just 2 Deniz is not particularly Levka on and 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.760
 not really heavy was actually 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.889
 pleased with the group because he said 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.949
 This is more than passable rival LIC 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.930
 of course strong so I do n’t seem to 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.530
 especially the shooting that he merged played 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.630
 not 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.729
 from here it was possible to win 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.620
 she to the balls and in r goal won but 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.990
 quite links impressed 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.690
 all in a little pressure it probably could 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.880
 cope even pass did not work 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:03.210
 there as far as was known 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.630
 some problems with the internet or it 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.070
 only on stream showed opinions 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.560
 no swear on this were because 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.180
 a lot of computers, I think so not a bunch 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.710
 whether the restart is completely internet 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.990
 after that new mines disappeared 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.350
 appeared as if someone is not behind it 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.830
 launched a massive download on everyone 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:24.920
 I started having problems with ping everything business 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:27.410
 I understand that we wish you good luck in 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.720
 playoff you understand you go out 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.870
 anyway from the first place with a group yes 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.090
 your opponent will be determined soon 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.830
 thank you for some interviews 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.020
