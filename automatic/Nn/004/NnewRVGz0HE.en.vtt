my one of my most problematic elements

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.509 
my one of my most problematic elements
is<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:58.049> parade<00:03:58.379> and<00:03:58.440> that<00:03:59.040> is<00:03:59.190> something<00:03:59.370> that

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
is the parade and that is something that

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.699 
is the parade and that is something that
came<00:03:59.819> up<00:03:59.849> and<00:04:00.180> she<00:04:00.299> was<00:04:00.359> doing<00:04:00.599> my<00:04:00.780> cards<00:04:01.260> and

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
came up and she was doing my cards and

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.610 
came up and she was doing my cards and
my<00:04:02.310> needs<00:04:02.579> to<00:04:02.790> kind<00:04:03.599> of<00:04:03.720> live<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:03.959> certain<00:04:04.199> life

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
my needs to kind of live a certain life

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.439 
my needs to kind of live a certain life
on<00:04:04.799> parade<00:04:05.129> and<00:04:05.400> on<00:04:05.519> show<00:04:05.879> but<00:04:06.090> I<00:04:06.150> think<00:04:06.389> that

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449 
on parade and on show but I think that

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.750 
on parade and on show but I think that
that<00:04:06.599> can<00:04:07.199> be<00:04:07.349> something<00:04:07.769> difficult<00:04:08.310> but<00:04:08.669> it

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
that can be something difficult but it

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.119 
that can be something difficult but it
is<00:04:08.849> also<00:04:09.030> something<00:04:09.599> that<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:09.930> do<00:04:10.349> enjoy<00:04:10.709> at
