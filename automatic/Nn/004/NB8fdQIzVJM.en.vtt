US history we have a vast and
interesting<00:01:45.669> history<00:01:45.899> much<00:01:46.899> of<00:01:46.929> it<00:01:47.139> is

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
interesting history much of it is

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.489 
interesting history much of it is
wonderful<00:01:47.799> but<00:01:48.249> we<00:01:48.520> are<00:01:48.639> flawed<00:01:48.909> and<00:01:49.349> I<00:01:50.349> don't

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:50.499 
wonderful but we are flawed and I don't

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:52.949 
wonderful but we are flawed and I don't
cover<00:01:50.799> that<00:01:51.039> up<00:01:51.099> and<00:01:51.520> one<00:01:52.240> of<00:01:52.329> the<00:01:52.419> things<00:01:52.659> that

00:01:52.949 --> 00:01:52.959 
cover that up and one of the things that

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:55.260 
cover that up and one of the things that
my<00:01:53.229> students<00:01:53.709> learn<00:01:53.950> in<00:01:54.189> class<00:01:54.429> is<00:01:54.819> that<00:01:55.119> we

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
my students learn in class is that we

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.389 
my students learn in class is that we
have<00:01:55.599> racism<00:01:56.349> and<00:01:56.619> it<00:01:56.709> started<00:01:57.130> with<00:01:57.249> the

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
have racism and it started with the

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.749 
have racism and it started with the
first<00:01:58.109> colonists<00:01:59.109> coming<00:01:59.499> to<00:01:59.770> the<00:01:59.889> New<00:02:00.009> World

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
first colonists coming to the New World

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.419 
first colonists coming to the New World
with<00:02:01.299> the<00:02:01.450> at<00:02:01.569> with<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:02.049> Native<00:02:02.889> Americans

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
with the at with the Native Americans

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.729 
with the at with the Native Americans
and<00:02:03.669> progressed<00:02:04.299> on<00:02:04.599> with<00:02:04.810> lots<00:02:05.109> of<00:02:05.289> different

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:05.739 
and progressed on with lots of different

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:09.510 
and progressed on with lots of different
ethnic<00:02:06.219> groups<00:02:06.789> and<00:02:07.119> racial<00:02:08.050> groups<00:02:08.470> so<00:02:08.739> we

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
ethnic groups and racial groups so we

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.310 
ethnic groups and racial groups so we
cover<00:02:09.729> it<00:02:09.849> all<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.209> I<00:02:10.780> would<00:02:10.899> agree<00:02:11.080> with<00:02:11.140> you

you can't brush the ugly history of
America<00:02:13.330> under<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.750> rug<00:02:13.930> but<00:02:14.290> when<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.040> come

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
America under the rug but when you come

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.820 
America under the rug but when you come
to<00:02:15.310> school<00:02:15.610> and

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
to school and

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.410 
to school and
morning<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.370> see<00:02:16.580> it<00:02:16.670> walking<00:02:16.910> down<00:02:17.270> the

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
morning and you see it walking down the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.330 
morning and you see it walking down the
hallway<00:02:17.810> that's<00:02:18.380> that's<00:02:18.830> something<00:02:19.160> totally

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
hallway that's that's something totally

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.590 
hallway that's that's something totally
different<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.820> I<00:02:19.880> believe<00:02:20.180> that's<00:02:20.300> where<00:02:20.510> the

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
different and I believe that's where the

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.600 
different and I believe that's where the
shock<00:02:20.780> factor<00:02:20.960> came<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.560> absolutely<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.490> it

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
shock factor came and absolutely and it

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.190 
shock factor came and absolutely and it
was<00:02:22.880> not<00:02:23.090> my<00:02:23.270> intention<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:23.960> it<00:02:24.080> was

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
was not my intention and it was

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.840 
was not my intention and it was
certainly<00:02:24.620> wasn't<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.040> intention<00:02:25.550> of<00:02:25.640> my

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
certainly wasn't the intention of my

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.990 
certainly wasn't the intention of my
students<00:02:26.480> either<00:02:27.370> when<00:02:28.370> they<00:02:28.490> came<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.850> class

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
students either when they came to class

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.510

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
that this is going to take away

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.890 
that this is going to take away
something<00:05:55.529> from<00:05:55.830> them<00:05:56.069> but<00:05:56.639> that<00:05:56.819> aside<00:05:57.150> again
