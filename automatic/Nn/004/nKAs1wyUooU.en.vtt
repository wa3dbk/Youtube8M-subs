00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
that way we're also I'm gonna have one

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.190 
that way we're also I'm gonna have one
seared<00:01:35.850> superc<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.539> that's<00:01:36.689> gonna<00:01:36.810> be<00:01:36.960> blind

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
seared superc and that's gonna be blind

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.899 
seared superc and that's gonna be blind
I<00:01:37.439> don't<00:01:37.860> want<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.039> be<00:01:38.100> dying<00:01:38.369> off<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.729> any

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
I don't want to be dying off of any

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.910 
I don't want to be dying off of any
streaks<00:01:39.240> because<00:01:39.630> my<00:01:39.930> opponent<00:01:40.469> has<00:01:40.560> streaks

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
streaks because my opponent has streaks

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.649 
streaks because my opponent has streaks
but<00:01:41.340> if<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.520> don't<00:01:41.880> want<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.149> use<00:01:42.240> blind<00:01:42.479> eye

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
but if you don't want to use blind eye

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.420 
but if you don't want to use blind eye
then<00:01:43.109> maybe<00:01:43.289> use<00:01:43.439> peripherals<00:01:44.039> that's

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
then maybe use peripherals that's

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.310 
then maybe use peripherals that's
definitely<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.969> good<00:01:45.270> perk<00:01:45.539> in<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.869> slot<00:01:46.109> too

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
definitely a good perk in the slot too

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.620 
definitely a good perk in the slot too
but<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:47.009> my<00:01:47.159> opinion<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.640> think<00:01:47.670> vonda<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.420> just

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
but in my opinion I think vonda is just

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.450 
but in my opinion I think vonda is just
a<00:01:48.719> better<00:01:48.960> perk<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.530> use<00:01:49.740> we're<00:01:50.070> gonna<00:01:50.159> using

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
a better perk to use we're gonna using

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.830 
a better perk to use we're gonna using

two to three packs let's be blast
oppressor<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.289> scavenger<00:01:52.920> blast<00:01:53.159> suppressor

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
oppressor and scavenger blast suppressor

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.889 
oppressor and scavenger blast suppressor

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
without even paying the mini-map so

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.919 
without even paying the mini-map so

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
suggest use is the UAV and the system

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.470 
suggest use is the UAV and the system
hack<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.460> UAV<00:02:11.820> I<00:02:12.030> say<00:02:12.240> threat

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
hack and on the UAV I say threat
