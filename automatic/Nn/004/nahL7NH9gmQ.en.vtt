00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
that would be something totally

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.940 
that would be something totally
different<00:01:21.780> where<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.170> actually<00:01:22.320> could<00:01:22.740> get

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
different where we actually could get

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.280 
different where we actually could get
some<00:01:23.220> justice<00:01:23.460> or<00:01:24.060> something<00:01:24.630> done<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.110> move

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
some justice or something done to move

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.170 
some justice or something done to move
forward<00:01:25.619> but<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:26.159> really<00:01:26.520> do<00:01:26.729> need<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.000> find

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
forward but we really do need to find

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.770 
forward but we really do need to find
someone<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.840> power<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.369> package<00:01:29.790> our<00:01:30.000> plan

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
and then get that moving forward I think

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.539 
and then get that moving forward I think
that<00:01:33.659> would<00:01:33.780> be<00:01:33.840> step<00:01:34.259> one<00:01:34.290> yes<00:01:34.890> marching<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.520> a
