bottom of the trade that has all the
holes<00:04:11.940> in<00:04:12.209> so<00:04:12.690> this<00:04:12.930> will<00:04:13.109> drain<00:04:13.410> like<00:04:13.650> a<00:04:13.680> pasta

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070

force<00:05:14.850> here<00:05:15.590> now<00:05:16.590> she's<00:05:16.889> draining<00:05:17.160> down<00:05:17.550> if

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
force here now she's draining down if

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.659 
force here now she's draining down if
she<00:05:18.180> starts<00:05:18.690> draining<00:05:18.930> down<00:05:19.320> this<00:05:20.130> will<00:05:20.370> quite

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
she starts draining down this will quite

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:23.270 
she starts draining down this will quite
quickly<00:05:21.110> take<00:05:22.110> the<00:05:22.290> water<00:05:22.530> out<00:05:22.740> of<00:05:22.770> here<00:05:23.100> you

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
watch this that water will just

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.200 
watch this that water will just
disappear<00:05:25.340> even<00:05:26.340> though<00:05:26.580> it's<00:05:26.729> still<00:05:26.820> coming

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
so he come along here so this one would

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.810 
so he come along here so this one would
be<00:05:36.720> in<00:05:36.780> the<00:05:36.870> sole<00:05:37.140> of<00:05:37.169> that<00:05:37.530> this<00:05:38.340> one<00:05:38.610> these

be in the sole of that this one these
would<00:05:39.090> be<00:05:39.210> float<00:05:39.539> bits<00:05:40.130> okay<00:05:41.130> and<00:05:41.789> this<00:05:42.600> is

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
would be float bits okay and this is

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.420 
would be float bits okay and this is
clear<00:05:43.140> water<00:05:43.350> pick<00:05:43.620> up<00:05:43.800> here<00:05:44.010> you<00:05:44.100> see<00:05:44.280> the
