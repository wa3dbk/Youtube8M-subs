more of my canning jars so here's how I

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.150 
more of my canning jars so here's how I
go<00:00:20.490> about<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:21.240> take<00:00:22.050> my<00:00:22.289> food<00:00:22.529> saver<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.100> I

go about it I take my food saver and I

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.200 
go about it I take my food saver and I
set<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.490> on<00:00:23.699> cut<00:00:24.269> only<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.140> inside<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.550> have<00:00:27.029> the

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
set it on cut only and inside I have the

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.939 
set it on cut only and inside I have the
small<00:00:27.680> bags<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:29.189> are<00:00:29.279> really<00:00:30.710> about<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
small bags that are really about the

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.549 
small bags that are really about the
size<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.489> court<00:00:33.360> bags

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
size of court bags

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.930 
size of court bags
the<00:00:34.860> typical<00:00:35.219> court<00:00:35.430> bags<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.730> would<00:00:35.850> buy

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
the typical court bags you would buy

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:44.569 
the typical court bags you would buy
premade<00:00:37.370> so<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.430> put<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:39.680> put<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:43.160> like<00:00:44.160> this

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
premade so I put I put it in like this

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.610 
premade so I put I put it in like this
and<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.239> side<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.899> food<00:00:46.110> saver<00:00:46.320> bags

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
and on the side of the food saver bags

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.549 
and on the side of the food saver bags
there<00:00:47.489> are<00:00:47.610> little<00:00:48.890> little<00:00:49.890> tiny<00:00:50.370> lines<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.559> I

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
there are little little tiny lines and I

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.979 
there are little little tiny lines and I
do<00:00:52.620> about<00:00:53.039> four<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.730> go<00:00:54.180> up<00:00:54.329> about<00:00:54.539> four<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.899> them

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
do about four I go up about four of them

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.260 
do about four I go up about four of them
so<00:00:55.079> that's<00:00:55.170> one<00:00:55.850> two<00:00:56.850> three<00:00:58.430> four<00:00:59.430> four<00:01:00.120> is

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
so that's one two three four four is

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.720 
so that's one two three four four is
just<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.660> tad<00:01:01.289> bit<00:01:01.320> long<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:02.010> let<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.399> fourth

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
just a tad bit long I let that fourth

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.759 
just a tad bit long I let that fourth
one<00:01:02.910> show<00:01:03.149> outside<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.809> food<00:01:03.989> saver<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.350> shut

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
one show outside the food saver I shut

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.920 
one show outside the food saver I shut
it<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.610> fourth<00:01:05.909> line<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.390> showing<00:01:06.630> right

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
it that fourth line is showing right

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.109 
it that fourth line is showing right
here<00:01:07.100> it's<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.369> little<00:01:08.549> long<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:09.000> could

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
here it's just a little long you could

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.539 
here it's just a little long you could
probably<00:01:09.270> do<00:01:09.540> three<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.990> half<00:01:10.229> it's<00:01:10.890> fine<00:01:11.220> I

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
probably do three and a half it's fine I

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.640 
probably do three and a half it's fine I
have<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.090> cut<00:01:12.360> only<00:01:12.659> mode<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:13.409> move

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
have it on cut only mode so I just move

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.980 
have it on cut only mode so I just move
my<00:01:13.890> my<00:01:14.640> cutter<00:01:15.000> there's<00:01:15.299> just<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.540> little<00:01:15.689> razor

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
my my cutter there's just a little razor

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.560 
my my cutter there's just a little razor
in<00:01:16.259> there<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.680> cuts<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.460> takes<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.330> bag

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
in there that cuts and takes that bag

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.980 
in there that cuts and takes that bag
off<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.110> Roll<00:01:20.150> then<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.240> move<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.540> back<00:01:21.570> to

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
off the Roll then I move it back to

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.390 
off the Roll then I move it back to
vacuum<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.650> seal<00:01:23.570> stick<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.750> cut<00:01:24.990> end<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
vacuum and seal stick the cut end of the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.810 
vacuum and seal stick the cut end of the
bag<00:01:27.200> into<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.229> food<00:01:28.560> saver<00:01:28.890> because<00:01:29.340> what<00:01:29.729> I'm

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
bag into the food saver because what I'm

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.880 
bag into the food saver because what I'm
actually<00:01:29.970> doing<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.509> making<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:31.079> bag<00:01:31.259> here<00:01:31.740> I'm

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
actually doing is making a bag here I'm

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.460 
actually doing is making a bag here I'm
sealing<00:01:32.549> up<00:01:32.790> one<00:01:33.000> end<00:01:33.299> press<00:01:34.049> it's<00:01:34.290> going<00:01:34.409> to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
sealing up one end press it's going to

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:48.240 
sealing up one end press it's going to
be<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.590> little<00:01:34.770> loud<00:01:35.009> here

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.880 

okay<00:01:49.250> it<00:01:49.340> clicks<00:01:49.580> off<00:01:49.760> and<00:01:49.790> releases<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.510> lid

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
okay it clicks off and releases the lid

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.320 
okay it clicks off and releases the lid
and<00:01:51.890> so<00:01:52.010> I've<00:01:52.070> got<00:01:52.220> a<00:01:52.250> nice<00:01:52.490> seal<00:01:52.910> here<00:01:53.180> it's<00:01:53.300> a

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
and so I've got a nice seal here it's a

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.670 
and so I've got a nice seal here it's a
little<00:01:53.540> hot<00:01:53.720> when<00:01:53.930> you<00:01:54.020> take<00:01:54.230> it<00:01:54.350> out<00:01:54.500> because

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
little hot when you take it out because

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.010 
little hot when you take it out because
it's<00:01:54.950> sealed<00:01:55.220> it<00:01:55.340> really<00:01:55.520> good<00:01:55.730> now<00:01:56.330> I<00:01:56.690> mean

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
it's sealed it really good now I mean

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.420 
it's sealed it really good now I mean
for<00:01:57.290> safety<00:01:57.590> measure<00:01:57.770> if<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:57.980> want<00:01:58.190> you<00:01:58.370> can

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
for safety measure if you want you can

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.950 
for safety measure if you want you can
seal<00:01:58.610> it<00:01:58.730> one<00:01:58.880> more<00:01:59.060> time<00:01:59.270> there<00:01:59.480> I<00:01:59.510> typically

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
seal it one more time there I typically

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.870 
seal it one more time there I typically
do<00:02:00.140> that<00:02:00.170> so<00:02:00.530> I'm<00:02:00.590> going<00:02:00.710> to<00:02:00.800> go<00:02:00.890> ahead<00:02:01.010> if<00:02:01.730> you

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
do that so I'm going to go ahead if you

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.310 
do that so I'm going to go ahead if you

look right here this little strip right
here<00:02:03.590> this<00:02:03.770> is<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:03.980> heater<00:02:04.450> this<00:02:05.450> is<00:02:05.600> the

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
here this is the heater this is the

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.420 
here this is the heater this is the
vacuum<00:02:05.990> channel<00:02:06.680> where<00:02:06.830> you<00:02:06.980> want<00:02:07.250> when

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
vacuum channel where you want when
