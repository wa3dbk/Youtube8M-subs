you're<00:03:08.740> robbing<00:03:09.130> well<00:03:09.459> I<00:03:09.790> guess<00:03:10.600> I<00:03:10.720> couldn't

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
you're robbing well I guess I couldn't

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
for long

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.550 
for long
besides<00:03:12.730> on<00:03:12.970> playback<00:03:13.569> rod<00:03:13.900> is<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.140> little<00:03:14.440> more

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
besides on playback rod is a little more

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.100 
besides on playback rod is a little more
my<00:03:14.740> speed<00:03:14.800> I<00:03:15.430> think<00:03:15.819> I'll<00:03:16.150> just<00:03:16.300> hang<00:03:16.630> back<00:03:16.900> and

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
my speed I think I'll just hang back and

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:27.600 
my speed I think I'll just hang back and
let<00:03:17.170> these<00:03:17.620> guys<00:03:17.980> show<00:03:18.760> me<00:03:18.970> their<00:03:19.180> stuff

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.510 

I<00:03:27.670> guess<00:03:28.390> even<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.870> most<00:03:29.080> skilled<00:03:29.650> rider<00:03:29.980> can

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
I guess even the most skilled rider can

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.140 
I guess even the most skilled rider can
run<00:03:30.760> into<00:03:31.000> a<00:03:31.030> few<00:03:31.270> snags<00:03:31.860> but<00:03:32.860> once<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:33.730> make

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
run into a few snags but once you make

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.330 
run into a few snags but once you make
it<00:03:34.210> to<00:03:34.390> the<00:03:34.630> top<00:03:34.870> it's<00:03:35.290> all<00:03:35.380> about<00:03:35.590> defenses<00:03:36.190> so

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
it to the top it's all about defenses so

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.400 
it to the top it's all about defenses so
getting<00:03:36.580> there<00:03:36.850> is<00:03:36.970> kind<00:03:37.210> of<00:03:37.330> satisfying<00:03:37.870> and

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
getting there is kind of satisfying and

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.170 
getting there is kind of satisfying and
then<00:03:38.590> when<00:03:38.710> you<00:03:38.800> get<00:03:38.920> to<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.220> top<00:03:39.460> it's<00:03:39.910> always

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
then when you get to the top it's always

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.910 
then when you get to the top it's always
coming<00:03:40.570> back<00:03:40.720> down<00:03:40.990> so<00:03:41.230> that's<00:03:41.350> kind<00:03:41.650> of<00:03:41.710> fun

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
coming back down so that's kind of fun

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:50.450 
coming back down so that's kind of fun
too<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:47.260> sometimes<00:03:48.160> a<00:03:48.580> little<00:03:48.940> painful<00:03:49.390> but

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
too and sometimes a little painful but

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.830 
too and sometimes a little painful but
another<00:03:51.460> cup<00:03:51.700> of<00:03:51.730> rocket<00:03:52.150> fuel<00:03:52.300> back<00:03:52.570> of<00:03:52.750> the
