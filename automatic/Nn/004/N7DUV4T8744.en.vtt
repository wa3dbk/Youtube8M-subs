recognize<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.129> as<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> controller<00:00:47.789> because

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
recognize it as a controller because

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.670 
recognize it as a controller because
there's<00:00:48.450> no<00:00:49.370> button<00:00:50.370> input<00:00:51.680> information

telling<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.520> what<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.789> actually<00:00:54.000> does

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
telling you what it actually does

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.590 
telling you what it actually does
so<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.440> probably<00:00:55.710> going<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.949> flash<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.600> human

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
so is probably going to flash to human

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.299 
so is probably going to flash to human
interface<00:00:57.960> device<00:00:58.320> name<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.190> then

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
interface device name and then

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.969 
interface device name and then
disconnect<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.940> 2<00:01:00.120> seconds<00:01:02.300> let's<00:01:03.530> go<00:01:04.530> flush

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
disconnect in 2 seconds let's go flush

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.480 
disconnect in 2 seconds let's go flush
the<00:01:05.280> name<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:06.000> disconnect<00:01:06.720> all<00:01:06.960> right<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:07.890> to

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
the name and disconnect all right so to

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.600 
the name and disconnect all right so to
fix<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.850> what<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.390> do<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:10.250> have<00:01:11.250> two<00:01:11.430> things

it's like this amount so apparently for

it's like this amount so apparently for
me<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:21.170> problem<00:02:21.409> is<00:02:21.709> that<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:22.099> doesn't

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
me the problem is that it doesn't

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:28.000 
me the problem is that it doesn't
install<00:02:23.349> the<00:02:26.290> Bluetooth<00:02:27.290> services<00:02:27.739> even

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
though I already have it connected and

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.690 
though I already have it connected and
have<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.209> set<00:02:32.659> to<00:02:32.689> install<00:02:33.230> them<00:02:33.439> it<00:02:34.189> seems<00:02:34.549> to

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
have it set to install them it seems to

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.490 
have it set to install them it seems to
forgive<00:02:35.000> that<00:02:35.209> so<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:35.420> do<00:02:35.659> is<00:02:35.870> I<00:02:35.989> tell<00:02:36.260> them<00:02:36.349> to
