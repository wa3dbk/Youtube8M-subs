 hello all these I hope makeup today 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.320
 it is a very simple makeup very nice 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.239
 very elegant and very practical that I hope 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.399
 like it but first thing we're going to 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.100
 do is use our base good 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.170
 for shadows that I'm going to apply so much 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.180
 on the mobile eyelid as in the little bone 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.150
 after using the pearl tone and what 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.640
 I'm going to use it in bone and doubts or 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.770
 on the mobile eyelid so it was very good and 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.960
 try to blur and blur it to 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.520
 that look very nice excuse me if 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.490
 truth the lighting is not very good 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.560
 I think that they do not super accommodate very 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.119
 well this time and well for the 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.190
 next I promise you first 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.170
 do it well since we apply well 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.429
 our shadow on both the mobile eyelid 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.530
 as in the little bone we are going to do our 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:35.750
 delineated what is the fear that we are going to 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.550
 use is good the gel that we are going to 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.640
 use is distilled from the in tone 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.759
 brown or chocolate is very beautiful is very 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.509
 good ssg be the ones that I recommend I go to 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.880
 make a line in the cat type ok 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.920
 then I will use what is the 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.940
 mask for eyelashes both the part 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.370
 from above as 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.110
 bottom part and then I'm going to get 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.060
 my foundation for makeup that is from the 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.550
 angelÃ­ssima brand that already comes with the 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.370
 brush included and the truth is great 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.530
 I really like the texture and it lasts 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.700
 all day'm testing just 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.250
 but I really liked it 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.610
 enough later to use a blush 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.820
 in peach shade peach heat from me 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.880
 you know, and he smiles and I put on my 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.030
 You write like that in the little things like that 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.620
 where it is also more predominant after 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.740
 that makes you understand well I'll 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.690
 to apply the powder that is so subtle to 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.690
 that makeup is compacted and lasts me 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.310
 more and lower the intensity of the blush by 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.650
 now I will use the lip gloss 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.900
 which is maybelline in hard red 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.970
 many hours and then well I wear 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.760
 only the moisturizer because it makes 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.890
 shine bright and last longer what is the 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.500
 good shine now we go with the 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.910
 hairstyle ok 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.550
 the hairstyle is something like that the 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.830
 hairstyle disheveled or pretty first 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.360
 grabbed and separated a lock and now I'm going to 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.819
 grab another lock which I'm going to 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.950
 divide 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.989
 and that address that I'm going to do good 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.389
 let's make a plaited braid what 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.209
 which means that I'm going to grab the 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:09.430
 external parts of the vila do and I'll go 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.810
 to cross in the channel I have a video les 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.150
 I'm going to leave the link in the box 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.799
 information so they like to see it 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.950
 more detail how am I doing the 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:20.260
 press let's make the braid if 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.209
 they want to half or have up to 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.889
 tips as you like them 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.290
 I recommend that you make it to the area 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:28.239
 because that way the effect is going to be a lot 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.430
 better than what we go the hairstyle that 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.560
 we will do as we did our 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.239
 Tang braid we are going to cut the 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.359
 things we can install small 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:40.629
 I need it so it looks very nice and the 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:42.430
 true that is very fashionable and the 12th and 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:44.889
 with the other side true and we're going to do 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.819
 the same procedure that we did with 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:51.249
 the lock on the left side 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.840
 good now since we also release that 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:55.030
 part we're going to make a crown with 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.769
 our hair ok let's use 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.569
 pins all the pins that 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.120
 need to try to hide it so that 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.069
 Look nice but forgive me first forgiveness 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.230
 before we are going to join the back 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.849
 the piglets that we parted with a 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.530
 past and now we are going to do 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.209
 our pate 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.359
 Now let's double the way you 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.099
 you can see there and we are going to apply the 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.660
 pins I tell them what they are 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.789
 necessary only that they try to 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.259
 hide them so that it looks nice and 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:22.750
 take your time is because sometimes 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:26.110
 accommodate this type of coronary with 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.210
 Natural hair is a little not heavy 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.729
 but I do like that you reload a little more 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.490
 so take your time nothing happens if 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:36.190
 you are going to do your how is your 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.050
 crown put on the pins and in 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.639
 reality ready is all that 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.830
 we need if you like you can 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.360
 use a pincer and make your 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.639
 waves I really wanted to stay 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.800
 well because that's how I got the call 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:51.370
 pay attention to straight hair 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.830
 but not a perfect limp 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.140
 and well, this is the makeup 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.910
 what I did do not forget to put this guy 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.320

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.320
