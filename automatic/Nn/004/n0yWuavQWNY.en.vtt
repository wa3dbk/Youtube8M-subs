00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.210
 so without taking controversy 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.559
 actually in this debate because 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.020
 it's too easy to say it's 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.950
 fault of so-and-so or the fault of so-and-so 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:18.680
 today there was in this drama 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.060
 and it's not luckily it's not 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.890
 trained as before 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.720
 the child who had died by this dog 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.890
 who had bitten but who were race 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.720
 Belgian Shepherd Malinois 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.329
 again we must not 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.980
 stigmatize dog breeds all 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.440
 the breeds are potash actually said 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.270
 dangerous it is necessary to 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.080
 teachers eventually strengthened the 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.910
 checks on associative shelters 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.520
 to make sure that 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.470
 the interior of the establishment includes 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.910
 real professionals of the doctors 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.980
 Canine Educator Veterinarians 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.260
 behaviorist that we will not give 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.760
 a dog to the first family for 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.770
 free up space in the shelter 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.480
 today you have to know that the 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.970
 main cause of the abandonment of 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.660
 animals is the lack of education or 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.759
 wear 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.070
 when we can no longer resolve or 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.799
 understand his animal saying 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.869
 that if ever a dog does not arrive at 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.719
 educate we give up no there is 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.700
 different reasons but when we buy 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:19.039
 a dog is a dog dies acquire 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.560
 it's for life in quotation marks 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:24.109
 the life expectancy of a dog varies 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.119
 between 10 and 15 or even 16 years 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:27.950
 so we know what a constraint so 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.929
 it is not done lightly it is necessary 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.869
 think carefully before buying a dog 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:35.450
 it's important in this case 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:38.420
 that it must be understood that the dog by 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.310
 survival instinct during a period 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.950
 criticism where his former master was 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:47.119
 deceased to provide for his needs 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.520
 and precisely bit his former master 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.209
 but here we are in an instinct of 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.819
 survival 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:54.529
 which is quite normal as on 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:56.209
 the videos where I'm talking to you about 

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:56.859
 development of the hierarchy in the state 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:59.179
 wild 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.889
 now it is true that we must do 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.289
 Warning 

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:05.119
 it would have been necessary that already controls 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:08.240
 and the statement of the bite is 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.330
 registered with the institutions and 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.190
 at the level of the competent bodies 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.220
 secondly the refuge in question 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.180
 should have informed if he did not 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.520
 also the fact of the dog's past all 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.590
 by explaining and bringing his touch of 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.570
 professionals telling him everything 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.670
 simply to the future purchasers of this 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.860
 dog is what they had children 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.090
 etc. is informed that the dog had already 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.010
 bitten 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.020
 I think any owner 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.180
 of dog today who wish 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.580
 to acquire a dog or a puppy 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.320
 any race and who is in 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.860
 possession in his family life 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.440
 children 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.290
 I do not think a normal family 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.780
 with a child is going to have to want 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.390
 to acquire a dog that has already bitten 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.520
 I think in different shelters he 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.470
 there are other opportunities to be able to 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.330
 recover a dog if you really want 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.400
 to have a dog so we will not say 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.900
 it's the fault of who today he 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.930
 must leave the investigation that is going on 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.200
 and who is going to perhaps have brought 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.700
 elements that can actually say 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.470
 party lace had errors and in 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.510
 the other part and mistakes we 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.160
 is there to inform users of 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.120
 dress my dog ​​points like that all 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.060
 dogs are potentially 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.550
 dangerous and who if you ever do if 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.900
 you never acquire it's a dog and 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.210
 that you have no skill 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.490
 we invite you to contact the educator 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.540
 canine behaviorist keep on solving 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.540
 and give you advice
