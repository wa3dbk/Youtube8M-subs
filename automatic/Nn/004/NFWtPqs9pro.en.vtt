00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.749 

it's<00:01:44.150> a<00:01:44.210> bit<00:01:44.390> like<00:01:44.420> a<00:01:44.840> tightrope<00:01:45.409> walk<00:01:45.770> not

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
that easy to click clack along that and

00:01:50.360 --> 00:02:12.940 
that easy to click clack along that and
metal<00:01:50.720> fence

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.010 

which<00:02:13.489> is<00:02:13.670> going<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.030> come<00:02:14.180> down<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.450> learn

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
which is going to come down to learn

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
I think it was a Ledge but we can't see

I think it was a Ledge but we can't see
