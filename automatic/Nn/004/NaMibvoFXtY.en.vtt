00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
start removing the linkages so that we

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.290 
start removing the linkages so that we
can<00:02:32.350> remove<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.769> locking<00:02:32.950> mechanism<00:02:33.610> first

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
can remove the locking mechanism first

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.229 
can remove the locking mechanism first
linkage<00:02:34.750> up<00:02:34.959> here<00:02:35.459> just<00:02:36.459> push<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:36.940> out<00:02:37.060> the

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
linkage up here just push it out the

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.720 
linkage up here just push it out the
position<00:02:37.690> like<00:02:37.870> so<00:02:38.130> and<00:02:39.130> it<00:02:39.310> might<00:02:39.489> have<00:02:39.700> a

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
position like so and it might have a

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.250 
position like so and it might have a
retainer<00:02:40.209> on<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.600> looks<00:02:40.810> like<00:02:40.900> this<00:02:41.050> one's

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
retainer on it looks like this one's

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.440 
retainer on it looks like this one's
lost<00:02:41.530> it<00:02:41.709> we<00:02:41.830> just<00:02:41.950> lift<00:02:42.220> off<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.400> retainer<00:02:42.910> and

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
lost it we just lift off a retainer and

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.920 
lost it we just lift off a retainer and
then<00:02:43.510> lift<00:02:44.170> off<00:02:44.350> that<00:02:44.590> linkage<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.930> small

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
then lift off that linkage a small

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.500 
then lift off that linkage a small
linkage<00:02:47.380> further<00:02:48.310> inside<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.940> door<00:02:49.150> here

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
linkage further inside the door here

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.940 
linkage further inside the door here
just<00:02:50.350> lift<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.340> retainer<00:02:51.700> on<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.239> just<00:02:52.950> leave

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
just lift the retainer on and just leave

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.460 
just lift the retainer on and just leave
for<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.280> rod<00:02:55.350> out<00:02:56.350> of<00:02:56.590> position<00:02:57.100> like<00:02:57.670> say

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
for the rod out of position like say

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.009 
for the rod out of position like say
free<00:02:59.470> and<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.680> lock<00:02:59.860> as<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:00.400> further<00:03:00.790> linkage

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.690 

move<00:03:05.019> these<00:03:05.290> bolts<00:03:05.680> up<00:03:05.860> and<00:03:06.070> is<00:03:06.190> holding<00:03:06.640> the

handle wall turn handle over can see the

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.190 
handle wall turn handle over can see the
linkage<00:03:19.000> in<00:03:19.180> there<00:03:19.360> we<00:03:19.570> just<00:03:19.750> leave<00:03:19.930> that<00:03:20.140> out

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
linkage in there we just leave that out

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.020 
linkage in there we just leave that out
of<00:03:20.470> position<00:03:21.360> just<00:03:22.360> wiggling<00:03:23.910> for<00:03:24.910> your
