00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.050
 the time is right to make an effort to avoid the dangers that have 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.539
 some on the box 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:10.460
 the characters finally on DVD 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.519
 or on the built-in hard drive 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:14.320
 the TV 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.349
 received in the context of the known connection 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.349
 Some records also have a trailer for digital television 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:23.369
 the quality can be seen 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.619
 Sana good time to buy a dvd-recorder 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.029
 as a test all devices have a good picture quality and a very good 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.080
 Sound quality had 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.640
 was to be refilled 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.080
 three of them with additional 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.540
 but it runs 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.490
 digital antenna television can receive three in addition to the analog 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.140
 TV all have a digital hdmi output are the front 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.830
 Devices from Panasonic 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.229
 in operation, the recorders consume 20 to 30 watts which actually Arno Kerst 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:55.649
 Harvest in standby gives it off some power guzzlers the passes 6 watts or 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.890
 consume over 6 watts of electricity 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.630
 Some manufacturers offer a power-saving mode who can be found in the menu 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.070
 adjust and Rossel power consumption in standby the night Panasonic had the 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.170
 Recorders are significantly slower, otherwise there is a lot to note 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.409
 Well you have to but now synonymous times a device with the integrated 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.030
 dvb-t-tuner or not that depends on whether you 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.120
 to talk more about politics Jan Kotulla for example, still analog over cable 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.300
 now you had to pay attention to the size of the hard drive there as well 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.300
 there are differences 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.330
 All records of a test dominate the time-shifted television 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.930
 In the middle of the favorite series the phone rings and presses a button 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.930
 the recorder records the program 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.450
 is preparing the interview, the recording can be played 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.840
 Eric Holder continued to draw in parallel 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.840
 so no second is lost 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.520
