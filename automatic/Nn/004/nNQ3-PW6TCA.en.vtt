note I don't mind that sort of
underwater<00:00:48.149> noise<00:00:48.950> cancelling<00:00:49.950> feeling<00:00:50.399> some

people<00:00:50.789> don't<00:00:50.969> like<00:00:51.120> there<00:00:51.360> used<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.660> be

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
people don't like there used to be

people don't like there used to be
totally<00:00:52.230> plugged<00:00:52.500> they<00:00:52.770> like<00:00:52.980> they<00:00:53.610> feel<00:00:53.879> that

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
totally plugged they like they feel that

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.080 
totally plugged they like they feel that

they prefer more of I guess more of a
noise<00:01:02.250> reduction<00:01:02.789> as<00:01:03.210> opposed<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.840> complete

noise reduction as opposed to a complete
noise<00:01:04.589> elimination<00:01:05.369> I'm<00:01:05.880> ok<00:01:06.270> with<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.479> I

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
noise elimination I'm ok with that I

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.960 
noise elimination I'm ok with that I
find<00:01:07.080> my<00:01:07.290> hearing<00:01:07.770> as<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.130> knock<00:01:08.369> out<00:01:08.549> most<00:01:08.820> of

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
find my hearing as I knock out most of

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.370 
find my hearing as I knock out most of
the<00:01:09.060> noise<00:01:09.210> my<00:01:09.479> hair<00:01:09.720> tends<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.140> get<00:01:10.320> more

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
the noise my hair tends to get more

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.560 
the noise my hair tends to get more
sensitive<00:01:11.070> they<00:01:11.610> have<00:01:11.729> no<00:01:11.909> problem<00:01:12.390> picking

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.800 
sensitive they have no problem picking
up<00:01:12.950> sounds<00:01:13.950> like<00:01:14.130> horns<00:01:14.880> or<00:01:15.119> tyre<00:01:15.479> screeching

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810

up sounds like horns or tyre screeching
or<00:01:16.259> sirens<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.860> those<00:01:16.950> sorts<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.340> things<00:01:17.400> and

or sirens and those sorts of things and
anyway<00:01:19.680> these<00:01:20.369> have<00:01:20.430> worked<00:01:20.850> very<00:01:20.970> well<00:01:21.210> for

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
anyway these have worked very well for

anyway these have worked very well for
me<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.140> I've<00:01:22.259> used<00:01:22.439> these<00:01:22.680> for<00:01:22.979> years<00:01:23.189> these

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
me and I've used these for years these

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.399 
me and I've used these for years these
are<00:01:23.820> these<00:01:24.000> smaller<00:01:24.390> foam<00:01:24.780> ones<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.200> worked

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
are these smaller foam ones have worked

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.050 
are these smaller foam ones have worked
very<00:01:25.740> well<00:01:25.799> for<00:01:25.979> me<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.400> I've<00:01:26.460> had<00:01:26.580> great<00:01:26.850> luck

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
very well for me and I've had great luck

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.350 
very well for me and I've had great luck
with<00:01:27.090> them<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.200> those<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.409> lot<00:01:29.360> these

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
with them so I like those a lot these

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.740 
with them so I like those a lot these
I've<00:01:30.869> used<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.670> love<00:01:33.060> these<00:01:33.329> these<00:01:33.570> are

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
I've used and I love these these are

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.230 
I've used and I love these these are
probably<00:01:34.259> far<00:01:34.860> more<00:01:34.890> comfortable<00:01:35.400> same<00:01:35.939> sort

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
probably far more comfortable same sort

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.859 
probably far more comfortable same sort
of<00:01:36.299> noise<00:01:36.509> attenuation<00:01:37.250> these<00:01:38.250> are<00:01:38.869> they're

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
of noise attenuation these are they're

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.010 
of noise attenuation these are they're
available<00:01:40.110> online<00:01:40.850> they're<00:01:41.850> they're<00:01:42.689> kind<00:01:42.960> of

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
available online they're they're kind of

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.649 
available online they're they're kind of
a<00:01:44.810> silly<00:01:45.810> putty<00:01:46.140> type<00:01:46.470> material<00:01:47.659> from

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
a silly putty type material from

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.740 
a silly putty type material from
beneficial<00:01:49.229> products<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:50.310> lot<00:01:50.880> they're<00:01:51.240> really

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
beneficial products a lot they're really

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.330 
beneficial products a lot they're really
they're<00:01:51.930> made<00:01:52.110> by<00:01:52.140> motorcyclists<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
they're made by motorcyclists and the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.819 
they're made by motorcyclists and the
idea<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.970> they<00:01:54.720> come<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:55.079> these<00:01:55.170> little<00:01:55.229> pucks

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
idea is they come in these little pucks

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.249 
idea is they come in these little pucks
that<00:01:56.070> feel<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.729> look<00:01:56.850> like<00:01:57.030> silly<00:01:57.360> putty<00:01:57.450> but

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259

that feel and look like silly putty but
they're<00:01:58.409> not<00:01:58.500> silly<00:01:58.829> putty<00:01:59.130> they're<00:01:59.310> actually

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670

that's<00:05:31.580> a<00:05:31.700> lot<00:05:31.880> of<00:05:31.910> money<00:05:32.830> it's<00:05:33.830> difficult<00:05:34.520> to
