00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.300 
clearance so that usually hints that
they're<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:16.320> know<00:00:16.350> they've<00:00:16.740> been<00:00:16.920> around<00:00:17.100> for

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310

they're you know they've been around for
a<00:00:17.340> little<00:00:17.430> while<00:00:17.580> but<00:00:17.939> I<00:00:18.120> have<00:00:18.240> not<00:00:18.480> seen<00:00:18.780> these

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
a little while but I have not seen these

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.290 
a little while but I have not seen these
before<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.590> just<00:00:19.830> found<00:00:20.040> them<00:00:20.310> for<00:00:21.180> about

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
before and I just found them for about

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.820 
before and I just found them for about
15<00:00:21.539> bucks<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:23.120> know<00:00:24.120> that<00:00:24.539> my<00:00:24.720> laptop<00:00:25.440> speakers

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
15 bucks I know that my laptop speakers

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.950 
15 bucks I know that my laptop speakers
aren't<00:00:26.130> very<00:00:26.280> loud<00:00:26.610> and<00:00:26.940> so<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.450> figured<00:00:27.840> I

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
aren't very loud and so I figured I

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.140 
aren't very loud and so I figured I
might<00:00:28.230> go<00:00:28.440> ahead<00:00:28.530> and<00:00:28.860> try<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.640> get<00:00:29.940> these

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
might go ahead and try to get these

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.059 
might go ahead and try to get these
speakers<00:00:31.099> to<00:00:32.099> see<00:00:32.309> if<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.669> can't<00:00:33.000> save<00:00:34.069> blowing

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:35.069 
speakers to see if I can't save blowing

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:36.770
