00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.969

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.220
 Y 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.529
 Y 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.529
 two 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.120
 good girls and how does this not say in 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.640
 this time I bring you a makeup 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.770
 which is a bit dramatic so it's not 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.450
 for every day as I promised them 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.360
 in a video I want this makeup 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.379
 that is with the smoke of Milan and this is 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.379
 one moradito 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.250
 I will be leaving the name in case 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.620
 interesting and how do I tell you your makeup 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:55.530
 it's very dramatic because you of 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:58.050
 very very dramatic false eyelashes see 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.879
 and you too glitter so I hope 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.730
 that you like what you enjoy is super 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.369
 super easy to do is simply 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.290
 blur blur and blur if you 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.040
 Interested in seeing how I did it to the presenters 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.560
 come with me and let's start 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.020
 to make this look they are using 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.150
 this palette that is the naked 3 remember 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.160
 that is not the original with a brush 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.500
 to blur we will take color 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.690
 coffee and we will place it in the fold 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.810
 of our eye then we take a 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.190
 little black color this is mate make 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.080
 exactly what I'm doing 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.080
 leaving the center empty 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.149
 now I will take this course of nix and what 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.759
 I will place in the center 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:49.500
 I loved it because it is super super creamy 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.500
 and it can be blurred well 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.549
 Now we take a little broach 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.830
 blur we blur everything super well 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.549
 erasing any line that you have in 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.549
 these colors 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.750
 so that our eye looks bigger 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.170
 try to pull the black a little 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.540
 outside 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.280
 now to illuminate the bone of our 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.280
 eyebrows we will take this little color 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.900
 we do the same in the lacrimal 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.939
 Now with the same jumbo little boy 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.939
 we will make our water line 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.900
 Now with a skewer like this 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.790
 we will take the same black color and 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.790
 we will delineate the tabs below 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.109
 now with this palette that has glitter 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.209
 we will take this blue and we will place it 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.780
 in the center where we put the color 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.780
 purple 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.050
 when it delineates the eye by the part of 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.330
 down I decided to leave a tail for him 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.580
 the eye will look bigger but after 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:27.070
 I deleted it because I did not like the result 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.560
 If you are like me, your eye is very 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.740
 sensitive when you put glue on 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.670
 eyelashes in your eye does this take a 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:38.680
 transparent gloss of color does not matter and 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.840
 put it in the part where you want to place 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.000
 the little one I swear this is going to 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.480
 work a lot and the glitter does not 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.480
 it will fall 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.870
 this is just to give a little more 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.930
 shine to our eye remember that this 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.450
 tail that you see there after I erase it 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.670
 now with this brush that is the powder 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.459
 remove all the glitter that I call 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.550
 now we are going to put tabs in this 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:13.000
 occasion I am using some very very 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:15.040
 dramatic I put them on and right now I come back 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.200
 now to erase the line of the 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.200
 eyelashes I will place a black shadow 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:29.090
 and now to join my lashes with the 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.090
 false I put some mascara 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.770
 and to finish I'll be using this 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:47.069
 product of milan and that I seriously love 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.060
 very hard lasts all the time and hydrates 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:51.310
 my lips 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.440
 all the products you use in this 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.330
 makeup I'll put them in the box 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.560
 information in case you are interested in any 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:01.050
 pass and check it 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:05.630
 and finally I will be placing this 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.630
 agüita elf that refreshes me a lot 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.490
 good girls and this is the result 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.880
 final as they could see is super super 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.430
 super easy to do is simply 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.110
 blur blur and blur so 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.480
 I hope you cheer up 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.400
 do it and if they do it by faith and that 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.590
 he fears he has in urges for it to see his 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.960
 photos and to see that they were also left 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.360
 it comes out and before I leave I love you 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.090
 recommend a little thing is this little bit of 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.890
 he was the one that I put on right now it's not 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.500
 as much as a makeup fixer is 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.910
 more like to cool off but I like it 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.340
 apply it after makeup 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.600
 spirit makeup is very heavy you 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.970
 it helps that the tapes like more 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.040
 livianito as fresher helps you to 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.620
 you feel fresher that's the word 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.950
 so I recommend it a lot 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.950
 this 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.910
