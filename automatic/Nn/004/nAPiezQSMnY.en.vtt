00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.320 
but I didn't think it was gonna be
anything<00:01:48.140> bad<00:01:48.620> we<00:01:49.190> didn't<00:01:49.430> pack<00:01:49.580> anything<00:01:49.850> but

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.030 
anything bad we didn't pack anything but
maybe<00:01:50.540> like<00:01:50.720> a<00:01:50.780> t-shirt<00:01:51.229> or<00:01:51.260> two<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:51.800> I

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
maybe like a t-shirt or two and I

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.530 
maybe like a t-shirt or two and I
brought<00:01:52.340> my<00:01:52.460> videogame<00:01:52.940> because<00:01:53.240> I<00:01:53.330> always

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
brought my videogame because I always

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.320

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
so we lose guessing that was gonna head

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.540
