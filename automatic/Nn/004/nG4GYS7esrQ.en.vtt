00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.129
 you're so for german is not even a game 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.260
 this is a very strange project to which 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.720
 very difficult to work out some 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.090
 balanced relationship break such and i 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.490
 I havenâ€™t seen it for a long time 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.369
 pack of 90 when the main game came out 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.039
 and then to her account for 1999 was launched 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.570
 addon assembled from a scrap of what is not 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.400
 included in the original with this 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.839
 docked out of a couple of some movie 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.100
 it fit a simple plot and 

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:37.100
 calm sold everything 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.940
 Kalman is greetings from the 90s in this regard 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.280
 while there is one big but was engaged 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.410
 this project people can fly 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.239
 Polish studio that made everyone 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.420
 Favorite pony killer will be storm and 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.920
 which epic subsequently bought baked 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.890
 generally hour such devilry happen 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.320
 making waves gone Blesinsky gone with she 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.360
 the company is preparing to sell to the Chinese 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.309
 why is some kind of install going on i 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.379
 on leapfrog maybe we are watching 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.180
 the last days of life in general such 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.729
 well-known company familiar format 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.680
 but not the essence but the essence is that while the most 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.780
 peak is not clear what busy opportunities 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.229
 new exclusive franchise for us 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.000
 gene 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.220
 their acquired eastern european 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.729
 assets and made a jazz band but people can 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.039
 fly 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.780
 and not as it is now becoming obvious 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.350
 they are really geniuses new shooter 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.350
 gameplay 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.750
 so what is a jackman formally 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.820
 a prequel to the main trilogy Dersu for in 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.610
 which old heroes are charismatic 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.890
 colas are not charismatic braid appear 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.070
 before the tribunal so the game is called 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.909
 part 1 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.979
 help white is on course 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.649
 happens after the world is clean when the wolf 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.659
 shame came out and before that 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.280
 these characters pull out Marcus 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.990
 phoenix from prison and actually all 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.909
 the narration takes place in the form 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.920
 testimonies that give characters on 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.210
 the judgment seat all and the protagonist a4 and 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.130
 boards come one to another 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.289
 naturally you can play co-op 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.729
 on the very essence because who would you 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.259
 neither did the gameplay play from this 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.119
 changing so here the whole game consists of 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.280
 the fact that just a group of characters 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.230
 goes on a completely abstract storyline 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.850
 lines and tells how it was for 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.980
 frame almost all, respectively 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.010
 videos that are in the game 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.690
 just occur in the courtroom 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.519
 the game itself is the past 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.010
 a set of rooms with enemies come 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.700
 kill a bunch of onion charter game exposes 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.530
 you rating 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.570
 how well did you do it after 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.180
 This lets you so in Japanese games 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.130
 like the devil we have krayt arena where at 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.260
 certain conditions you fight with 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.860
 enemies the whole project jan repair analog 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.860
 such arenas 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.260
 at the same time on each rental you can take 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.850
 all additional conditions on each 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.620
 level there is a gears of war badge 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.330
 clicking on which pixie krech eat it 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.150
 operation details 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.680
 remember the hits of the details and the passage 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.840
 the next plot from this is complicated 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.760
 for example, dust appears we are telling 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.160
 came to the museum and it was dusty 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.980
 or we came to the factory and there was everything in 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.200
 gas so i have a screen or when we 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.940
 came to the academy man from the bomb and for 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.260
 four minutes we needed to move 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.910
 50 forehead tired and still run away you had 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.410
 some modifiers change enemies 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.690
 add stronger opponents 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.420
 some missions you need to build 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.330
 competent defense arranging machine guns and 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.320
 resist the advancing waves of enemies 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.090
 as in chorus mode 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.950
 multiplayer or in any other case 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.050
 you pass level a modifier 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.970
 adds reinforcements of enemies who 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.920
 come to them comes to you from the back 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.620
 all this maybe sounds boring but 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.019
 really really awesome 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.610
 gameplay jaha man absolutely not like 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.500
 so that workers of our remember 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.980
 kingsford oppositional shooter in which 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.870
 you're sitting 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.599
 from the shelter donka aiming something shooting 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.190
 the enemy here came the python can fly which 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.349
 before that they only did a point or a fish 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.690
 play sheets to say the least quick and 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.909
 just soon whether everything is several times 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.430
 increase the number of enemies 10 times 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:06.500
 Hills have heroes increased too decently 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.420
 and therefore all the usual gameplay derso 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.549
 ford just sunk in summer and on the screen 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.860
 goin natural meat grinder goin 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.019
 dozens of enemies on the meat 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.030
 constantly all sawed and you still of course 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.669
 same a bunch of all sorts of black and there 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:26.620
 constantly under the hips shoot and shotgun 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:26.620
 spreading all the square go out 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:37.300
 thats every i took those against figuring 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:39.069
 out for yet cool and that action 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.870
 the game takes place before the events of this logic 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:43.060
 there is a zoo all gears of war for 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.740
 exclusion of infected cartoons from 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.719
 ovens will be about the plot while they 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.669
 came up with their monsters people can 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:50.620
 fly and loves monster in which you need 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.360
 shoot under certain conditions 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.189
 bridge and which are transformed into 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.689
 time before you eat a sniper 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:57.610
 falling into which it turns 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:59.800
 such a hulk and broadcasts you hurt her 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.360
 it's not two strokes kills if remember 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.370
 in the original gears of war 2 blind 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.590
 the monster who asked for the sound of bindu 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.650
 the wall needed to hide to the races five 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:11.080
 took this monster threw 30 and the score 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.060
 another monster and immediately told you 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.189
 how about killing at first burning out 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.020
 ganymede after which falls drop 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:19.590
 will present armored and finish off 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.590
 conventional weapons 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.389
 it's natural for exactly everything under 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.099
 RAM players planned their 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.409
 actions for what annoyed I say how 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:30.389
 action game like gameplay is actually a game 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:32.699
 ingenious of like i just sat down and 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.379
 blunt 6 hours without stopping passed 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:36.509
 the main company while I understand that 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:38.400
 and no game at all here is not a plot 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:40.710
 some kind of formal reply instead of atmosphere 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.509
 bonus points no adventure from 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.610
 all this is impossible 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:46.650
 generally not perceived as a 7 game 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:54.560
 rather cybersport attraction on 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:54.560
 skirmish warfare can't 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:01.040
 pain no gain first attack no big 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.500
 consolation for fans of fords 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.930
 favored company 2 author move if 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.880
 choose 40 points sound out from 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.949
 companies for certain sovereignty 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.199
 throw you can open a second campaign 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:14.930
 in a thermos and it will complement events 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:17.120
 gears of war 3 if you remember this gone 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.190
 for reinforcements author's move 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.570
 tells the volume of the story and more 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.850
 The thing is that the machine is going on 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.160
 almost the same what's the difference 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:28.250
 How are the rooms with prog called the author 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:31.760
 waved be jalbum and addon somehow 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:33.860
 was taken in the 90s for 1999 honestly I would 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.660
 he put the highest marks became what 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.550
 This is direct here mast have just awesome 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.380
 the game is because it is actually played 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:43.190
 great fun gameplay you 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:46.280
 brings but the game can call it 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:48.860
 complete when people openly chop 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.200
 grandmother sculpts on this price tag of $ 60 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.539
 promote as glue to the brass 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.449
 cult anxiety I want to ask them 

00:06:53.539 --> 00:07:00.370
 question they okhueli either comrade in general 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:00.370
 for all 7 points
