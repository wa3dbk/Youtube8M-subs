with conference play starting next week
you're<00:00:48.570> right<00:00:48.780> i<00:00:48.809> will<00:00:49.170> say<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.680> one<00:00:49.829> thing<00:00:50.070> is

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
you're right i will say the one thing is

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.560 
you're right i will say the one thing is
is<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.520> Seminoles<00:00:50.879> we're<00:00:51.120> able<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.420> get<00:00:51.539> a

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
is the Seminoles we're able to get a

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.810 
is the Seminoles we're able to get a
full<00:00:51.840> practice<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.949> rain<00:00:53.219> during<00:00:53.550> this

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
full practice in in the rain during this

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.060 
full practice in in the rain during this
fall<00:00:54.090> camp<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.899> they<00:00:54.930> have<00:00:55.230> some<00:00:55.500> experience

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
fall camp so they have some experience

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.500 
fall camp so they have some experience
with<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.280> wet<00:00:56.550> football<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.120> think<00:00:57.329> that's

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
with a wet football and I think that's

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.580 
with a wet football and I think that's
going<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.719> be<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.899> big<00:00:58.140> help<00:00:58.260> because<00:00:58.350> you

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
going to be a big help because you

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.869 
going to be a big help because you
haven't<00:00:58.859> had<00:00:58.890> an<00:00:59.039> opportunity<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.430> practice

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
haven't had an opportunity to practice

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.970 
haven't had an opportunity to practice
in<00:01:00.030> inclement<00:01:00.600> weather<00:01:00.809> like<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.440> then<00:01:01.859> it

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
in inclement weather like this then it

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.740 
in inclement weather like this then it
could<00:01:02.129> be<00:01:02.250> tough<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.670> do<00:01:03.120> remember<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.570> some

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
could be tough and do remember to some

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.850 
could be tough and do remember to some
of<00:01:03.809> those<00:01:03.870> first<00:01:04.080> practices<00:01:04.650> where<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
of those first practices where the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.350 
of those first practices where the
Seminoles<00:01:05.189> went<00:01:05.339> out<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.640> field<00:01:05.790> then<00:01:06.210> had

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
Seminoles went out on the field then had

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.640 
Seminoles went out on the field then had
to<00:01:06.450> go<00:01:06.570> into<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.780> locker<00:01:06.960> room<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.350> they<00:01:07.470> have

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
to go into the locker room so they have

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.109 
to go into the locker room so they have
that<00:01:07.799> experience<00:01:08.159> if<00:01:08.520> there<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.880> delay

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
way you mentioned Savannah State the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.670 
way you mentioned Savannah State the
football<00:01:51.899> team<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.259> doesn't<00:01:52.470> matter<00:01:52.590> if

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
football team it doesn't matter if

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.740 
football team it doesn't matter if
you're<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> one<00:01:53.159> double<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.549> one<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> team<00:01:54.210> we're

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
you're a one double I a one a team we're

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.179 
you're a one double I a one a team we're
going<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.960> take<00:01:55.140> everybody<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.770> same<00:01:55.950> way<00:01:56.159> I

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
going to take everybody the same way I

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.590 
going to take everybody the same way I
think<00:01:56.340> maybe<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.820> focus<00:01:57.180> for<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.420> team

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
think maybe the focus for this team

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.780 
think maybe the focus for this team
right<00:01:57.810> now<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:58.170> not<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.159> opponent<00:01:59.729> but

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
right now is not the opponent but

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.999 
right now is not the opponent but
