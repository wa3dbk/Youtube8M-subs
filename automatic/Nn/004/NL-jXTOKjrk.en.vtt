hey<00:00:01.439> guys<00:00:01.680> just<00:00:02.550> got<00:00:02.760> a<00:00:02.790> few<00:00:03.030> requests<00:00:03.570> on<00:00:03.720> my

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.000 
hey guys just got a few requests on my

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.759 
hey guys just got a few requests on my
LED<00:00:06.000> light<00:00:07.010> so<00:00:08.010> in<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.760> little<00:00:08.910> bit<00:00:09.179> of<00:00:09.269> detail

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.810 

the<00:00:13.769> timer<00:00:14.099> unit<00:00:14.460> I<00:00:14.849> salvaged<00:00:15.480> from<00:00:15.780> the

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
the timer unit I salvaged from the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:27.279 
the timer unit I salvaged from the
seven-foot<00:00:17.820> t5<00:00:18.510> fixture<00:00:23.570> basically

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:45.560 

that's<00:00:27.859> what<00:00:28.039> it<00:00:28.220> looks<00:00:28.400> like

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.720 

that<00:00:46.570> is<00:00:47.050> the<00:00:47.260> main<00:00:47.440> LED<00:00:48.690> as<00:00:49.690> you<00:00:49.870> can<00:00:49.989> see

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
that is the main LED as you can see

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.840 
that is the main LED as you can see
there's<00:00:51.730> 30<00:00:52.120> little<00:00:52.510> chips<00:00:52.989> in<00:00:53.230> it<00:00:53.640> each<00:00:54.640> one

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
there's 30 little chips in it each one

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.369 
there's 30 little chips in it each one
no<00:00:55.180> water<00:00:56.190> wired<00:00:57.190> in<00:00:57.370> parallel

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
no water wired in parallel

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.450 
no water wired in parallel
yeah<00:00:59.379> wired<00:00:59.680> in<00:01:00.129> parallel<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:02.220> they<00:01:03.220> run<00:01:03.430> over

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
yeah wired in parallel and they run over

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.840 
yeah wired in parallel and they run over
to<00:01:03.729> that<00:01:04.710> drenched<00:01:05.710> form<00:01:05.890> over<00:01:06.220> there<00:01:06.370> or<00:01:06.580> you

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
to that drenched form over there or you

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.610 
to that drenched form over there or you
can<00:01:07.030> call<00:01:07.270> it<00:01:07.330> a<00:01:07.540> driver<00:01:08.170> if<00:01:08.530> you<00:01:08.650> want<00:01:10.620> thing

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
can call it a driver if you want thing

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.750 
can call it a driver if you want thing
on<00:01:11.740> the<00:01:11.830> other<00:01:11.860> side<00:01:12.040> that<00:01:12.220> looks<00:01:12.460> like<00:01:12.640> the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
on the other side that looks like the

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.109 
on the other side that looks like the
ballast<00:01:13.240> is<00:01:13.710> actually<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:15.369> controller<00:01:15.790> for

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
ballast is actually the controller for

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.649 
ballast is actually the controller for
the<00:01:16.240> timer<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.890> on<00:01:18.010> one<00:01:18.159> of<00:01:18.190> the<00:01:18.340> prongs<00:01:18.659> well

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
the timer so on one of the prongs well

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.420 
the timer so on one of the prongs well
it's<00:01:19.900> actually<00:01:20.080> in<00:01:20.650> behind<00:01:20.979> there<00:01:21.220> you'll

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
it's actually in behind there you'll

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.010 
it's actually in behind there you'll
just<00:01:21.460> have<00:01:21.729> to<00:01:21.880> trust<00:01:22.060> me<00:01:22.299> on<00:01:22.390> it<00:01:22.479> they<00:01:22.810> got<00:01:22.960> the

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
just have to trust me on it they got the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.359 
just have to trust me on it they got the
same<00:01:23.200> type<00:01:23.409> of<00:01:23.440> connections<00:01:24.010> on<00:01:24.159> the<00:01:24.280> other

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
same type of connections on the other

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.500 
same type of connections on the other
side<00:01:24.670> one<00:01:25.479> of<00:01:25.600> them<00:01:25.720> is<00:01:25.840> line<00:01:26.080> voltage<00:01:26.619> in<00:01:27.510> one

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
side one of them is line voltage in one

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.270 
side one of them is line voltage in one
of<00:01:28.659> them<00:01:28.810> is<00:01:29.080> six<00:01:29.890> volts<00:01:30.369> DC<00:01:30.700> out<00:01:31.240> which<00:01:32.280> runs

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
of them is six volts DC out which runs

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.580 
of them is six volts DC out which runs
these<00:01:33.580> fans<00:01:33.970> if<00:01:34.360> either<00:01:34.750> of<00:01:34.930> the<00:01:35.200> high<00:01:35.350> voltage

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
these fans if either of the high voltage

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.950 
these fans if either of the high voltage

the blue LEDs and then the other high
voltage<00:01:54.880> terminal<00:01:55.300> just<00:01:55.450> because<00:01:55.780> I<00:01:55.810> had<00:01:56.080> it

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
voltage terminal just because I had it

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.970 
voltage terminal just because I had it
and<00:01:56.350> I<00:01:56.440> could<00:01:56.710> I<00:01:57.330> split<00:01:58.330> it<00:01:58.450> with<00:01:58.540> 5050<00:01:59.440> for

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
and I could I split it with 5050 for

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
and I could I split it with 5050 for
light<00:02:00.190> compact<00:02:00.640> fluorescents<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:01.840> just<00:02:02.650> took<00:02:02.830> a

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
light compact fluorescents I just took a

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.149 
light compact fluorescents I just took a
splitter<00:02:04.000> for<00:02:04.330> a<00:02:04.600> standard<00:02:05.140> from<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:05.710> standard

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159

splitter for a standard from a standard
light<00:02:06.340> fixture

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
light fixture

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.460 
light fixture
I<00:02:08.140> mounted<00:02:08.680> it<00:02:08.800> in<00:02:09.009> there<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:09.759> these<00:02:10.600> bulbs

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
I mounted it in there and these bulbs

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.530 
I mounted it in there and these bulbs
I<00:02:11.500> can't<00:02:12.010> unscrew<00:02:12.520> them<00:02:12.670> I'm<00:02:12.880> not<00:02:13.030> going<00:02:13.330> to

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
I can't unscrew them I'm not going to

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.920 
I can't unscrew them I'm not going to
say<00:02:14.500> half<00:02:14.710> to<00:02:14.920> you<00:02:15.010> but<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.600> can<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:18.930> that's

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
say half to you but I can and that's

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.740 
say half to you but I can and that's
pretty<00:02:20.170> much<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.590> unit<00:02:21.240> click<00:02:22.240> over<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.540> the

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
pretty much the unit click over to the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.770 
pretty much the unit click over to the
timer<00:02:23.460> so<00:02:24.460> you<00:02:24.490> got<00:02:24.610> function<00:02:25.090> 3

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.800 

bear<00:02:29.780> with<00:02:29.990> me<00:02:30.230> here<00:02:30.260> I'm<00:02:30.590> innocent<00:02:30.890> one<00:02:31.280> hand

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
bear with me here I'm innocent one hand

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.280 
bear with me here I'm innocent one hand
function<00:02:32.810> 3<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.890> blue<00:02:34.130> LEDs<00:02:35.110> they're<00:02:36.110> on

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
function 3 the blue LEDs they're on

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.870 
function 3 the blue LEDs they're on
their<00:02:36.590> own<00:02:36.710> timer<00:02:37.010> system<00:02:37.900> function<00:02:38.900> to

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
their own timer system function to

their own timer system function to
brings<00:02:40.880> on<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.630> fluorescents<00:02:42.260> in<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.410> front

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
brings on the fluorescents in the front

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.990 
brings on the fluorescents in the front
so<00:02:43.070> this<00:02:43.220> would<00:02:43.370> be<00:02:43.580> like<00:02:43.610> my<00:02:44.030> desk<00:02:44.300> Don<00:02:46.000> but

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
so this would be like my desk Don but

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.210 
so this would be like my desk Don but
they're<00:02:47.210> half<00:02:48.940> 6,500<00:02:49.940> K<00:02:50.180> half<00:02:51.140> actinic<00:02:51.860> royal

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
they're half 6,500 K half actinic royal

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.600 
they're half 6,500 K half actinic royal
blue<00:02:52.550> it's<00:02:53.090> hard<00:02:53.300> to<00:02:53.450> see<00:02:53.630> in<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.930> video<00:02:54.610> you

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
blue it's hard to see in the video you

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.030 
blue it's hard to see in the video you
have<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:55.880> take<00:02:56.030> my<00:02:56.210> word<00:02:56.360> for<00:02:56.390> it<00:02:56.770> in<00:02:57.770> the<00:02:57.890> first

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
have to take my word for it in the first

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.600 
have to take my word for it in the first
setting<00:02:58.580> it<00:02:59.420> was<00:02:59.600> the<00:02:59.930> main<00:03:00.140> tonality<00:03:00.610> which

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
setting it was the main tonality which

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.500

is<00:03:01.820> crazy<00:03:02.330> bright<00:03:03.130> it'll<00:03:04.130> actually<00:03:04.340> burn<00:03:04.820> well

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
is crazy bright it'll actually burn well

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.180 
is crazy bright it'll actually burn well
won't<00:03:05.930> burn<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:06.410> but<00:03:06.620> it'll<00:03:06.860> give<00:03:07.040> you<00:03:07.160> a

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
won't burn you but it'll give you a

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.560 
won't burn you but it'll give you a
sunburn<00:03:07.640> if<00:03:07.820> you<00:03:07.880> hold<00:03:08.030> your<00:03:08.209> hand<00:03:08.390> long

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
sunburn if you hold your hand long

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.230 
sunburn if you hold your hand long
enough<00:03:08.930> it<00:03:09.860> is<00:03:10.640> ridiculously<00:03:11.420> bright

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.750 

but<00:03:14.840> that's<00:03:15.470> that<00:03:17.140> basically<00:03:18.160> if<00:03:19.160> either<00:03:19.490> of

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
but that's that basically if either of

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.790 
but that's that basically if either of
the<00:03:19.820> high<00:03:19.940> voltage<00:03:20.150> terminals<00:03:21.110> are<00:03:21.200> on<00:03:21.320> so<00:03:21.590> the

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
the high voltage terminals are on so the

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.650 
the high voltage terminals are on so the
high<00:03:21.920> voltage<00:03:22.340> would<00:03:22.520> be<00:03:22.580> considered<00:03:23.240> my<00:03:23.420> main

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
high voltage would be considered my main

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.620 
high voltage would be considered my main
LED<00:03:24.200> or<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.550> fluorescents<00:03:26.180> if<00:03:26.300> either<00:03:26.450> of

LED or the fluorescents if either of
those<00:03:26.810> are<00:03:26.870> running<00:03:27.290> then<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.740> fans<00:03:27.980> are

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
those are running then the fans are

a baking sink the whole thing is mounted
in<00:03:35.210> a<00:03:35.300> track<00:03:36.100> that<00:03:37.100> I<00:03:37.160> cut<00:03:37.520> down<00:03:37.550> from<00:03:38.060> a

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
in a track that I cut down from a

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.360 
in a track that I cut down from a
seven-foot<00:03:38.690> fixture<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:42.530> track<00:03:42.770> comes<00:03:43.130> in

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
seven-foot fixture the track comes in

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.950 
seven-foot fixture the track comes in
two<00:03:43.550> pieces<00:03:46.000> splits<00:03:47.000> up<00:03:47.270> the<00:03:47.300> seam<00:03:47.690> right<00:03:47.720> here

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:47.960 
two pieces splits up the seam right here

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.620 
two pieces splits up the seam right here
if<00:03:48.260> you<00:03:48.380> take<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:48.710> ends<00:03:49.070> off<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:50.180> front<00:03:50.450> piece

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
if you take the ends off the front piece

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:57.250 
if you take the ends off the front piece
in<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:50.900> back<00:03:51.080> case<00:03:51.290> is<00:03:51.500> separate<00:03:56.110> there's<00:03:57.110> the

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
in the back case is separate there's the

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.450 
in the back case is separate there's the
spots<00:03:57.560> for<00:03:57.830> the<00:03:57.920> fans<00:03:58.130> I<00:03:58.900> had<00:03:59.900> to<00:03:59.990> the<00:04:00.620> end<00:04:00.800> and

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460 
spots for the fans I had to the end and

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.740 
spots for the fans I had to the end and
then<00:04:01.610> you<00:04:01.700> can<00:04:01.820> tilt<00:04:02.030> it<00:04:02.150> down<00:04:02.180> and<00:04:02.600> you<00:04:02.690> can

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
then you can tilt it down and you can

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.170 
then you can tilt it down and you can
just<00:04:03.080> screw<00:04:03.470> all<00:04:03.980> of<00:04:04.040> your<00:04:04.490> controls<00:04:04.880> right

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
just screw all of your controls right

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.680 
just screw all of your controls right
into<00:04:05.420> the<00:04:05.540> back<00:04:05.720> I<00:04:07.090> Section<00:04:08.090> doubt<00:04:08.240> a<00:04:08.270> couple

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
into the back I Section doubt a couple

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.680 
into the back I Section doubt a couple
spots<00:04:08.900> where<00:04:09.320> the<00:04:09.470> LEDs<00:04:09.980> are<00:04:12.250> there<00:04:13.450> and<00:04:14.450> then

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
spots where the LEDs are there and then

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.349 
spots where the LEDs are there and then
for<00:04:14.960> the<00:04:15.050> rest

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.170 

but<00:04:19.989> that's<00:04:20.709> that<00:04:20.949> let<00:04:21.759> me<00:04:21.819> know<00:04:21.939> what<00:04:22.060> you

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
but that's that let me know what you

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.860 
but that's that let me know what you
think<00:04:22.860> thanks
