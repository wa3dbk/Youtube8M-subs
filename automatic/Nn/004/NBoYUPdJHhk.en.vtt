have<00:01:27.500> a<00:01:27.530> little<00:01:27.770> look<00:01:27.979> in<00:01:28.299> one<00:01:29.299> of<00:01:29.329> them's

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
have a little look in one of them's

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.209 
have a little look in one of them's
blank<00:01:29.750> top<00:01:30.020> but<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.290> other<00:01:30.409> one<00:01:30.560> is<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.740> micro

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219 
blank top but the other one is a micro

blank top but the other one is a micro
SD<00:01:31.280> card<00:01:31.820> so<00:01:32.060> obviously<00:01:32.420> on<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.630> right<00:01:32.840> hand

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
SD card so obviously on the right hand

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.010 
SD card so obviously on the right hand
side<00:01:33.110> would<00:01:33.409> be<00:01:33.439> the<00:01:33.619> sim<00:01:34.280> card<00:01:34.310> slot<00:01:34.850> for<00:01:35.180> a<00:01:35.210> 3g

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
side would be the sim card slot for a 3g

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.249 
side would be the sim card slot for a 3g
version<00:01:37.329> so<00:01:38.329> it's<00:01:38.479> not<00:01:38.509> really<00:01:38.630> much<00:01:38.960> we<00:01:39.140> can

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259
