of<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.689> video<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:22.710> see<00:00:22.740> how<00:00:22.949> much<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.430> lost

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
of the video to see how much I lost

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.150 
of the video to see how much I lost
because<00:00:24.119> there's<00:00:24.330> no<00:00:24.570> way<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:25.710> I'm<00:00:25.890> going<00:00:26.070> to

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
because there's no way that I'm going to

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.080 
because there's no way that I'm going to
gain<00:00:26.369> anything<00:00:26.849> off<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.240> these<00:00:31.669> so<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.850> price

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
gain anything off of these so the price

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.330 
gain anything off of these so the price
check<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.710> 8.1<00:00:34.710> million<00:00:35.340> GP<00:00:36.530> so<00:00:37.530> what<00:00:38.160> do<00:00:38.250> you

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
check is 8.1 million GP so what do you

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.850 
check is 8.1 million GP so what do you
guys<00:00:38.489> think<00:00:38.550> we're<00:00:38.910> going<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.149> get<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.860> think

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860

a<00:03:11.819> lot<00:03:11.939> of<00:03:11.970> these<00:03:12.180> I<00:03:12.510> what<00:03:13.379> are<00:03:13.470> these<00:03:13.590> dragon

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
a lot of these I what are these dragon

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.110 
a lot of these I what are these dragon
daggers<00:03:14.879> guys<00:03:15.150> we<00:03:15.870> have<00:03:16.079> some<00:03:16.439> amazing<00:03:17.120> dragon

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
daggers guys we have some amazing dragon

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.509 
daggers guys we have some amazing dragon
daggers<00:03:18.750> out<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:19.470> all<00:03:19.650> of<00:03:19.680> these<00:03:19.949> I<00:03:20.010> think

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
daggers out of all of these I think

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.640 
daggers out of all of these I think
these<00:03:20.849> dragon<00:03:21.810> arrowheads<00:03:22.229> are<00:03:22.349> probably

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
these dragon arrowheads are probably

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.920 
these dragon arrowheads are probably
worth<00:03:22.859> the<00:03:23.040> most<00:03:23.239> because<00:03:24.239> I've<00:03:24.419> only<00:03:24.629> got

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
worth the most because I've only got

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.430 
worth the most because I've only got
that<00:03:25.169> once<00:03:25.560> I<00:03:25.889> haven't<00:03:26.819> got<00:03:26.940> that<00:03:26.970> anymore<00:03:27.449> so

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
that once I haven't got that anymore so

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.199 
that once I haven't got that anymore so
I<00:03:28.470> could<00:03:28.919> probably<00:03:29.159> imagine<00:03:29.959> that<00:03:30.959> is<00:03:31.349> the<00:03:32.209> the

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
I could probably imagine that is the the

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.670 
I could probably imagine that is the the
key<00:03:33.419> item<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.959> get<00:03:34.169> I<00:03:34.760> think<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:36.180> can<00:03:36.389> get<00:03:36.540> a

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
key item to get I think you can get a

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.619 
key item to get I think you can get a
dragon<00:03:37.680> two-hander<00:03:38.519> out<00:03:39.449> of<00:03:39.690> these<00:03:39.840> maybe<00:03:40.139> I

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:41.629 
dragon two-hander out of these maybe I

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.990 
dragon two-hander out of these maybe I
could<00:03:42.629> be<00:03:42.750> mistaken<00:03:42.900> but<00:03:43.650> I<00:03:45.079> probably<00:03:46.079> am

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
could be mistaken but I probably am

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.680 
could be mistaken but I probably am
alright<00:03:48.000> so<00:03:48.209> we<00:03:48.359> have<00:03:48.389> we<00:03:48.870> have<00:03:48.930> eight<00:03:49.169> more

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.559 
all this is going to be so bad oh and we
get<00:03:55.400> all<00:03:56.400> I<00:03:56.430> thought<00:03:56.819> that<00:03:56.939> was<00:03:57.030> a<00:03:57.090> two-hander

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569
