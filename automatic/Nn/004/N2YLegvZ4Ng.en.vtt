00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:02.810 
all right what I have up for auction is

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.710 
all right what I have up for auction is
two<00:00:04.520> wheelchair<00:00:05.520> motors<00:00:05.910> I'm<00:00:06.270> not<00:00:06.690> a

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
two wheelchair motors I'm not a

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.900 
two wheelchair motors I'm not a
wheelchair<00:00:07.350> professional<00:00:08.130> but<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:08.460> think<00:00:08.790> they

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
wheelchair professional but I think they

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.690 
wheelchair professional but I think they
came<00:00:09.120> out<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.510> quickie<00:00:09.809> wheelchair<00:00:10.639> but<00:00:11.639> I

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
came out of a quickie wheelchair but I

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.799 
came out of a quickie wheelchair but I
feel<00:00:12.059> that<00:00:12.179> most<00:00:12.269> people<00:00:12.540> are<00:00:12.599> gonna<00:00:12.719> be

kind<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.719> robotic<00:00:16.139> project<00:00:17.270> which<00:00:18.270> will<00:00:18.449> work

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
kind of robotic project which will work

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.290 
kind of robotic project which will work
good<00:00:18.810> for<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.550> just<00:00:20.550> want<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.789> make<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> video<00:00:21.090> to

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
good for I just want to make a video to

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.870 
good for I just want to make a video to
show<00:00:21.869> them<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.650> haven't<00:00:23.609> really<00:00:23.789> had

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
show them to you I haven't really had

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.070 
show them to you I haven't really had
time<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.240> clean<00:00:24.449> them<00:00:24.570> up<00:00:24.689> they're<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.930> little

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
time to clean them up they're a little

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.290 
time to clean them up they're a little
dirty<00:00:25.289> but<00:00:25.650> they<00:00:26.099> both<00:00:26.310> work<00:00:26.369> I've<00:00:26.849> tested

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
dirty but they both work I've tested

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.900 
dirty but they both work I've tested
both<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.660> them<00:00:27.779> um<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.470> took<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.519> top<00:00:29.670> off<00:00:29.849> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
both of them um I took the top off the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.849 
both of them um I took the top off the
gearboxes<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.660> then<00:00:30.990> look<00:00:31.140> at<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.349> gears<00:00:31.590> all

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
gearboxes and then look at the gears all

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.950 
gearboxes and then look at the gears all
the<00:00:31.980> gears<00:00:32.219> were<00:00:32.399> okay<00:00:35.420> these<00:00:36.420> particular

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
the gears were okay these particular

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.819 
the gears were okay these particular
units<00:00:37.680> have<00:00:38.180> a<00:00:39.180> selector<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.230> top<00:00:40.440> here

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
units have a selector on the top here

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.740 
units have a selector on the top here
this<00:00:41.610> will<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:42.030> will<00:00:42.090> come<00:00:42.329> with<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.629> I'll

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
this will this will come with it I'll

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.650 
this will this will come with it I'll
leave<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.050> ball<00:00:43.290> joint<00:00:43.620> on<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:44.070> them<00:00:44.660> and

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
leave this ball joint on on them and

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.260 
leave this ball joint on on them and
this<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.230> engage<00:00:46.410> or<00:00:47.100> disengage<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.850> drive

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
this is to engage or disengage a drive

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.060 
this is to engage or disengage a drive
so<00:00:48.600> if<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.780> want<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.989> freewheel<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.680> can<00:00:49.860> free

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
so if you want a freewheel you can free

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.040 
so if you want a freewheel you can free
wheel<00:00:50.989> or<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.680> engage<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.160> drive<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.809> you<00:00:54.809> can

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
wheel or you engage it drive and you can

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.290 
wheel or you engage it drive and you can
engage<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.590> disengage<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.399> on<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> fly<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:56.879> it

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
engage in disengage it on the fly so it

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.970 
engage in disengage it on the fly so it
actually<00:00:57.629> works<00:00:57.899> pretty<00:00:58.140> nice<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.770> for<00:00:58.949> a

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
actually works pretty nice and for a

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.700 
actually works pretty nice and for a
robot<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.730> would<00:00:59.910> be<00:01:00.710> pretty<00:01:01.710> good<00:01:03.710> also

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
robot that would be pretty good also

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.359 
robot that would be pretty good also
with<00:01:05.129> these<00:01:05.280> units<00:01:05.729> they<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.119> disc<00:01:06.450> brakes

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
with these units they have disc brakes

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.510 
with these units they have disc brakes
on<00:01:08.369> them<00:01:08.930> that<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.380> took<00:01:10.770> one<00:01:10.920> apart<00:01:11.010> here<00:01:11.369> so

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
on them that is I took one apart here so

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.450 
on them that is I took one apart here so
you<00:01:11.610> can<00:01:11.729> see<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.110> this<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.439> disc<00:01:13.770> brake<00:01:14.130> unit

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
you can see it this is a disc brake unit

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.890 
you can see it this is a disc brake unit
right<00:01:14.700> here<00:01:15.560> pretty<00:01:16.560> nice<00:01:17.540> and<00:01:18.540> what<00:01:18.750> this

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
right here pretty nice and what this

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.200 
right here pretty nice and what this
does<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.680> have<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.950> feed<00:01:20.189> as<00:01:20.820> long<00:01:21.030> as<00:01:21.150> you

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
does is you have to feed as long as you

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.480 
does is you have to feed as long as you
have<00:01:21.330> 12<00:01:21.659> volts<00:01:22.170> going<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.799> unit<00:01:23.280> right

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
have 12 volts going to this unit right

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.830 
have 12 volts going to this unit right
here<00:01:24.439> it<00:01:25.439> will<00:01:25.909> release<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.150> shaft<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.750> you

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
here it will release the shaft so you

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.120 
here it will release the shaft so you
can<00:01:28.110> drive<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.799> thing<00:01:28.979> will<00:01:29.100> work

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
can drive and this thing will work

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.840 
can drive and this thing will work
normal<00:01:29.610> but<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.820> minute<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.090> stop<00:01:30.450> power<00:01:31.850> the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
normal but the minute you stop power the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.690 
normal but the minute you stop power the
brakes<00:01:33.119> will<00:01:33.360> come<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.890> will<00:01:35.100> slow<00:01:35.670> it

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
brakes will come on and it will slow it

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.179 
brakes will come on and it will slow it
down<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.119> stop<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.600> when<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.740> get<00:01:37.979> these

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
down and stop it when you get these

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.300 
down and stop it when you get these
motors<00:01:38.729> now<00:01:39.329> I'm<00:01:39.479> going<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.689> have<00:01:39.869> them

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
motors now I'm going to have them

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.760 
motors now I'm going to have them
partially<00:01:41.310> disassembled<00:01:42.150> I'll<00:01:43.110> have<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.560> hub

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
partially disassembled I'll have the hub

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.679 
partially disassembled I'll have the hub
off<00:01:44.070> I'm<00:01:44.610> going<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.820> have<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.119> disc<00:01:45.390> brake

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
off I'm going to have this disc brake

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.050 
off I'm going to have this disc brake
unit<00:01:46.020> off<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.530> off<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.829> side<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.880> I'll

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
unit off and off to the side and I'll

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.710 
unit off and off to the side and I'll
have<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.270> little<00:01:48.509> bag<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.869> bolts<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.250> box

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
have a little bag of bolts in the box

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.980 
have a little bag of bolts in the box
because<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:52.909> have<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.030> fit<00:01:54.240> them<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:54.689> box

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
because I have to fit them in this box

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.350 
because I have to fit them in this box
and<00:01:55.350> they<00:01:55.619> won't<00:01:55.799> fit<00:01:56.100> fully<00:01:56.640> assembled<00:01:57.240> like

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
and they won't fit fully assembled like

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.130 
and they won't fit fully assembled like
this<00:01:57.649> this<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> flat<00:01:59.189> rate<00:01:59.520> box

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
this this is a flat rate box

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.480 
this this is a flat rate box
these<00:02:01.140> are<00:02:01.320> heavy<00:02:01.560> if<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.950> didn't<00:02:02.189> send<00:02:02.369> them

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
these are heavy if I didn't send them
