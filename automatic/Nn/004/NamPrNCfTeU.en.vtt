00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
that brutal beatdown the shield pretty

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.200 
that brutal beatdown the shield pretty
much<00:00:32.969> took<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.540> um<00:00:34.700> you<00:00:35.700> know<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.820> found<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
much took and um you know I found the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.910 
much took and um you know I found the
video<00:00:36.450> very<00:00:36.690> good<00:00:37.020> because<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.500> don't<00:00:37.680> see

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
video very good because you don't see

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.430 
video very good because you don't see
the<00:00:38.070> shield<00:00:38.370> at<00:00:38.550> all<00:00:38.760> just<00:00:39.629> dominated<00:00:40.290> and

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
the shield at all just dominated and

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.930 
the shield at all just dominated and
brutalized<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.129> they<00:00:41.280> had<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.730> think

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
brutalized like they had and I think

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.000 
brutalized like they had and I think
that's<00:00:42.120> why<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:43.140> left<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.500> lasting<00:00:43.649> impression

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
that's why it left a lasting impression

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.680 
that's why it left a lasting impression
and<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.610> makes<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.000> match<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.539> they're

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
and it makes that match that they're

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.540 
and it makes that match that they're
gonna<00:00:45.780> have<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.170> two<00:00:46.350> weeks<00:00:46.590> even<00:00:46.860> better<00:00:47.250> and

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
gonna have in two weeks even better and

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.850 
gonna have in two weeks even better and
it's<00:00:48.510> kind<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.750> sad<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> buildups<00:00:49.680> only

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
it's kind of sad that the buildups only

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.639 
it's kind of sad that the buildups only
three<00:00:50.160> weeks<00:00:50.340> long<00:00:50.700> because<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.930> know<00:00:52.050> you

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
three weeks long because you know you

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.549 
three weeks long because you know you
have<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.949> future<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.570> shield<00:00:54.840> now<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
have the future of the shield now in the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.869 
have the future of the shield now in the
band<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.890> future<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.430> shield<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.760> then

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
band the future of the shield and then

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.029 
band the future of the shield and then
you<00:00:57.030> got<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> past<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.870> evolution<00:00:58.469> it's

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
you got the past of evolution it's

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.560 
you got the past of evolution it's
really<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> match<00:00:59.550> much<00:01:00.059> like<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> white<00:01:00.539> sand

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
really a match much like the white sand

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.420 
really a match much like the white sand
thing<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.199> should<00:01:01.350> have<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> long<00:01:01.859> building

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
thing that should have a long building

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.210 
thing that should have a long building
along<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:03.629> know<00:01:03.750> just<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.379> ticking<00:01:04.769> time<00:01:04.979> bomb

happen<00:03:42.269> at<00:03:42.480> WrestleMania<00:03:42.989> but<00:03:43.140> besides<00:03:44.010> that

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
happen at WrestleMania but besides that

evolution<00:03:47.100> is<00:03:47.549> gonna<00:03:47.790> be<00:03:47.940> great<00:03:48.150> too<00:03:48.299> because

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
evolution is gonna be great too because

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.090 
evolution is gonna be great too because
I<00:03:48.900> think<00:03:48.959> you<00:03:49.200> can't<00:03:49.470> have<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.620> bad<00:03:49.860> match

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
I think you can't have a bad match

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.520 
I think you can't have a bad match
especially<00:03:50.570> you<00:03:51.570> got<00:03:51.690> Triple<00:03:51.989> H<00:03:52.079> in<00:03:52.260> there<00:03:52.410> you

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
especially you got Triple H in there you

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.840 
especially you got Triple H in there you
got<00:03:52.620> Roman<00:03:52.890> reigns<00:03:53.160> you<00:03:53.280> got<00:03:53.430> Seth<00:03:53.640> Rollins

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
got Roman reigns you got Seth Rollins

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.569 
got Roman reigns you got Seth Rollins
you<00:03:54.239> got<00:03:54.450> Dean<00:03:54.870> Ambrose<00:03:55.290> but<00:03:56.040> he's<00:03:56.190> an<00:03:56.340> orang

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
you got Dean Ambrose but he's an orang

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.250 
you got Dean Ambrose but he's an orang
can<00:03:56.730> have<00:03:56.820> a<00:03:56.850> good<00:03:57.030> match<00:03:57.269> like<00:03:57.660> you<00:03:57.900> saw<00:03:58.110> at

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
can have a good match like you saw at

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.259 
can have a good match like you saw at
the<00:03:58.290> Triple<00:03:58.709> Threat<00:03:58.739> with<00:03:59.220> Daniel<00:03:59.549> Bryan<00:03:59.760> so<00:04:00.090> I

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
the Triple Threat with Daniel Bryan so I

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.150 
the Triple Threat with Daniel Bryan so I
think<00:04:00.840> if<00:04:00.959> they're<00:04:01.170> if<00:04:01.410> it's<00:04:01.590> good<00:04:01.739> enough<00:04:01.769> and

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
think if they're if it's good enough and

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.140 
think if they're if it's good enough and
if<00:04:02.220> they're<00:04:02.400> in<00:04:02.459> there<00:04:02.579> with<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:02.820> right<00:04:02.970> guy

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
if they're in there with the right guy

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.100 
if they're in there with the right guy
is<00:04:03.180> it<00:04:03.480> a<00:04:03.690> I<00:04:03.840> don't<00:04:04.140> know<00:04:04.910> no<00:04:05.910> doubt<00:04:06.720> in<00:04:06.840> my<00:04:06.930> mind

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
is it a I don't know no doubt in my mind

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.350 
is it a I don't know no doubt in my mind
that<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.560> match<00:04:07.739> will<00:04:07.890> be<00:04:07.980> great<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:08.760> that's

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
that the match will be great so that's

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.680 
that the match will be great so that's
that<00:04:09.570> see<00:04:09.989> you<00:04:10.079> guys<00:04:10.170> in<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.350> next<00:04:10.440> video
