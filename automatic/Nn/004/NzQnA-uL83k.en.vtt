of dead sea hairs washing up on shore

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.420 
of dead sea hairs washing up on shore
they<00:01:30.329> believe<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.290> second<00:01:31.860> time<00:01:32.159> in

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
15 years no one knows exactly why the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.480 
15 years no one knows exactly why the
theory<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.259> bay<00:01:37.409> waters<00:01:37.950> are<00:01:38.189> getting

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
theory is the bay waters are getting

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.789 
theory is the bay waters are getting
warmer<00:01:39.030> because<00:01:39.329> they<00:01:39.810> tend<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.170> reproduce

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
warmer because they tend to reproduce

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.429 
warmer because they tend to reproduce
more<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.490> warmer<00:01:42.030> ocean<00:01:42.479> temperatures<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
more in warmer ocean temperatures the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.260 
more in warmer ocean temperatures the
life<00:01:43.649> cycle<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.280> sea<00:01:44.460> hare<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.759> about<00:01:45.000> one

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
life cycle of a sea hare is about one

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.740 
life cycle of a sea hare is about one
year<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.079> after<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.649> one<00:01:46.890> year<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.750> the

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
year and so after that one year of the

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.840 
year and so after that one year of the
population<00:01:49.350> boom<00:01:49.619> then<00:01:50.070> there's<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.340> massive

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
population boom then there's a massive

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.350 
population boom then there's a massive
death<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:52.220> wish<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.310> can<00:01:53.369> hold<00:01:53.670> one<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.000> my<00:01:54.090> hand

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
death I wish I can hold one in my hand
