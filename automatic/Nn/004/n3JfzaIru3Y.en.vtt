the way they have Diagon Alley is really

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.230 
the way they have Diagon Alley is really
cool<00:00:25.890> because<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.250> doesn't<00:00:26.760> have<00:00:26.849> any<00:00:27.000> signs

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
cool because it doesn't have any signs

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.880 
cool because it doesn't have any signs
or<00:00:27.480> anything<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.170> just<00:00:28.410> like<00:00:28.529> brick

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
or anything so it is just like brick

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.919 
or anything so it is just like brick
here<00:00:29.130> brick<00:00:29.460> here<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.910> then<00:00:30.300> like<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> opening

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
that you go in between so it was really

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.389 
that you go in between so it was really
fun<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:33.120> can't<00:00:33.450> remember<00:00:34.290> where<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.040> got<00:00:35.250> you

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.639 
chinam from so I'll just start so first
we<00:00:38.520> did<00:00:38.730> try<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.500> butterbeers

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
we did try the butterbeers

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.799 
we did try the butterbeers
I<00:00:41.010> saved<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:41.940> cup<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.239> has<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.360> lot<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.629> holes

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
I saved this cup it has a lot of holes

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.030 
I saved this cup it has a lot of holes
in<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.170> probably<00:00:43.469> will<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.770> throw<00:00:43.980> it

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
in it so probably will have to throw it

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.830 
in it so probably will have to throw it
away<00:00:44.129> but<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:44.940> thought<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.390> was<00:00:45.480> really<00:00:45.660> good

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840

very<00:00:46.079> sweet<00:00:46.410> though<00:00:46.680> um<00:00:46.950> but<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.340> does<00:00:47.489> just

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
very sweet though um but it does just

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.029 
very sweet though um but it does just
taste<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.059> butterscotch<00:00:48.629> um<00:00:49.020> like<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.620> see<00:00:49.890> we

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
taste like butterscotch um like I see we

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.279

both<00:00:50.219> had<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.460> frozen<00:00:51.000> ones<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:51.930> had<00:00:52.050> that

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
both had the frozen ones so we had that

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.720 
both had the frozen ones so we had that
and<00:00:52.620> then<00:00:52.829> we<00:00:53.010> did<00:00:53.280> try<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:55.250> pumpkin<00:00:56.250> juice<00:00:56.399> so

this<00:02:20.560> for<00:02:20.950> somebody<00:02:21.340> else<00:02:21.519> it's<00:02:21.730> that<00:02:22.030> you

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269

little little M&amp;Ms and then also from

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.800

there we got the little love potion and

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.640 
there we got the little love potion and
it<00:02:32.560> kind<00:02:32.799> of<00:02:32.859> leaked<00:02:33.099> but<00:02:33.400> it's<00:02:33.549> just<00:02:33.849> like<00:02:34.030> a

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
it kind of leaked but it's just like a

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.179 
it kind of leaked but it's just like a
like<00:02:35.650> a<00:02:35.709> liquid<00:02:36.329> kind<00:02:37.329> of<00:02:37.450> candy<00:02:37.989> it<00:02:38.890> wasn't

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:39.189 
like a liquid kind of candy it wasn't

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:41.039 
like a liquid kind of candy it wasn't
that<00:02:39.340> good<00:02:39.609> I<00:02:40.000> still<00:02:40.389> have<00:02:40.540> all<00:02:40.689> of<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:40.959> in

that good I still have all of it in
there<00:02:41.139> so<00:02:41.290> probably<00:02:41.560> just<00:02:41.650> dump<00:02:41.950> it<00:02:42.040> out<00:02:42.189> but<00:02:43.030> I

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
there so probably just dump it out but I

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.240 
there so probably just dump it out but I
really<00:02:43.450> like<00:02:43.659> the<00:02:43.840> little<00:02:43.989> love<00:02:44.769> potion<00:02:45.129> it

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
really like the little love potion it

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.360 
really like the little love potion it
came<00:02:45.430> in<00:02:45.609> -<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:47.590> then<00:02:47.980> at<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:50.260> Weasleys<00:02:50.889> we

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
came in - and then at the Weasleys we

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.210 
came in - and then at the Weasleys we
got<00:02:51.700> I<00:02:52.090> got<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.689> came<00:02:52.840> in<00:02:52.989> this<00:02:53.139> little<00:02:53.200> package

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
got I got it came in this little package

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.379 
got I got it came in this little package
so<00:02:55.120> it<00:02:55.239> came<00:02:55.510> like<00:02:55.689> that<00:02:55.959> and<00:02:56.909> it<00:02:57.909> does<00:02:58.150> not

stick<00:02:58.689> to<00:02:58.840> walls<00:02:59.230> I<00:02:59.470> thought<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.769> would<00:02:59.889> just

00:02:59.909 --> 00:02:59.919

be<00:03:00.129> thrown<00:03:00.579> it<00:03:00.730> sticks<00:03:00.939> to<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.120> wall<00:03:01.329> but<00:03:01.480> it

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
be thrown it sticks to a wall but it

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
doesn't but you just mess it around and

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.520 
doesn't but you just mess it around and
it<00:03:03.849> has<00:03:03.909> their<00:03:04.209> little<00:03:04.419> logo<00:03:04.689> on<00:03:05.230> it<00:03:05.379> so<00:03:05.470> I

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
it has their little logo on it so I

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.679 
it has their little logo on it so I
really<00:03:05.829> like<00:03:05.980> that<00:03:06.060> but<00:03:07.060> you<00:03:07.120> just<00:03:07.329> like<00:03:07.450> stick

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:19.509 
two books so I'll probably frame this

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:23.580 
two books so I'll probably frame this
and<00:04:19.780> this<00:04:19.870> is<00:04:20.109> just<00:04:21.330> it<00:04:22.330> is<00:04:22.810> just<00:04:23.200> a<00:04:23.320> little

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
and this is just it is just a little

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.830 
and this is just it is just a little
ticket<00:04:23.969> and<00:04:24.969> so<00:04:25.090> you<00:04:25.180> could<00:04:25.300> buy<00:04:25.389> this<00:04:25.450> at<00:04:25.750> the

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
ticket and so you could buy this at the

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.060 
ticket and so you could buy this at the
little<00:04:26.080> stores<00:04:26.320> too

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
little stores too

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.070 
little stores too
and<00:04:27.870> then<00:04:28.870> of<00:04:29.440> course<00:04:29.500> we<00:04:29.920> had<00:04:30.040> to<00:04:30.070> get<00:04:30.280> a<00:04:30.340> wand

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
and then of course we had to get a wand

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.830 
and then of course we had to get a wand
and<00:04:32.080> we<00:04:32.290> got<00:04:32.730> serious<00:04:33.730> black<00:04:33.910> because<00:04:34.240> he<00:04:34.270> had

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
and we got serious black because he had

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.500 
and we got serious black because he had
the<00:04:34.960> coolest<00:04:35.200> one<00:04:35.530> there<00:04:35.800> so<00:04:36.670> we<00:04:37.150> thought<00:04:37.330> they

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
the coolest one there so we thought they

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.320 
the coolest one there so we thought they
did<00:04:37.690> kind<00:04:37.810> of<00:04:37.900> like<00:04:38.020> birthday<00:04:38.440> ones<00:04:38.710> but<00:04:39.330> um

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
did kind of like birthday ones but um

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.120 
did kind of like birthday ones but um
some<00:04:41.080> of<00:04:41.200> them<00:04:41.290> said<00:04:41.440> oh<00:04:41.470> yeah<00:04:41.740> they're<00:04:41.920> over

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
some of them said oh yeah they're over

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.620 
some of them said oh yeah they're over
here<00:04:42.160> but<00:04:42.430> I<00:04:42.460> think<00:04:42.700> they<00:04:42.820> were<00:04:42.880> just<00:04:43.390> playing

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
here but I think they were just playing

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.210 
here but I think they were just playing
ones<00:04:43.870> that<00:04:44.080> just<00:04:44.320> didn't<00:04:44.650> associate<00:04:45.070> with<00:04:45.190> a

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
ones that just didn't associate with a

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.740 
ones that just didn't associate with a
character<00:04:45.640> and<00:04:45.790> you<00:04:45.850> kind<00:04:46.030> of<00:04:46.120> chose<00:04:46.360> it<00:04:46.600> that

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
character and you kind of chose it that

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.030 
character and you kind of chose it that
way<00:04:46.900> because<00:04:47.260> I<00:04:47.320> didn't<00:04:47.470> really<00:04:47.650> see<00:04:47.800> you<00:04:47.890> need

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
way because I didn't really see you need

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.490 
way because I didn't really see you need
that<00:04:48.160> said<00:04:48.370> like<00:04:48.550> a<00:04:48.580> actual<00:04:49.150> month<00:04:49.840> so<00:04:50.200> this<00:04:50.350> is

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
that said like a actual month so this is

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.080 
that said like a actual month so this is
what<00:04:50.650> his<00:04:50.800> looks<00:04:51.040> like<00:04:51.130> it<00:04:51.820> was<00:04:51.910> just<00:04:51.970> really

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
what his looks like it was just really

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.850 
what his looks like it was just really
cool<00:04:52.480> with<00:04:52.630> the<00:04:52.720> carvings<00:04:53.200> and<00:04:53.530> it<00:04:53.620> kind<00:04:53.830> of

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
cool with the carvings and it kind of

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.220 
cool with the carvings and it kind of
goes<00:04:54.010> to<00:04:54.250> a<00:04:54.280> like<00:04:54.460> a<00:04:54.490> little<00:04:54.790> swervy<00:04:55.300> carving

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
goes to a like a little swervy carving

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.890 
goes to a like a little swervy carving
so<00:04:56.470> we<00:04:56.560> just<00:04:56.740> got<00:04:56.890> one<00:04:57.150> my<00:04:58.150> husband<00:04:58.510> just<00:04:58.690> share

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
so we just got one my husband just share

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.060 
so we just got one my husband just share
because<00:04:59.170> I<00:04:59.200> don't<00:04:59.350> really<00:04:59.440> want<00:04:59.710> any<00:04:59.860> of<00:05:00.010> the

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
because I don't really want any of the

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:06.120 
because I don't really want any of the
other<00:05:00.190> characters<00:05:00.520> and<00:05:02.520> then<00:05:03.810> we<00:05:04.810> got<00:05:05.130> the

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
other characters and then we got the

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.480 
other characters and then we got the
marauders<00:05:06.640> map<00:05:06.810> puzzle<00:05:07.890> so<00:05:08.890> it<00:05:09.010> just<00:05:09.190> is<00:05:09.310> like

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
marauders map puzzle so it just is like

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.890 
marauders map puzzle so it just is like
that<00:05:09.670> and<00:05:10.000> then<00:05:10.210> when<00:05:10.360> you're<00:05:10.510> putting

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
that and then when you're putting

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.540 
that and then when you're putting
together<00:05:11.080> it'll<00:05:11.680> look<00:05:11.860> like<00:05:12.010> this<00:05:12.220> right<00:05:12.370> here

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
together it'll look like this right here

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.150 
together it'll look like this right here
and<00:05:13.000> it<00:05:13.240> is<00:05:13.420> 300<00:05:14.020> pieces<00:05:14.170> they<00:05:14.680> did<00:05:14.860> have<00:05:15.040> the

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
and it is 300 pieces they did have the

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.670 
and it is 300 pieces they did have the
actual<00:05:15.550> map<00:05:15.730> but<00:05:16.510> it<00:05:16.600> was<00:05:16.690> like<00:05:16.810> $50<00:05:17.290> so<00:05:17.560> I<00:05:17.590> was

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
actual map but it was like $50 so I was

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.070 
actual map but it was like $50 so I was
like<00:05:17.800> I<00:05:17.920> can't<00:05:18.220> buy<00:05:18.430> a<00:05:18.760> piece<00:05:19.150> of<00:05:19.330> paper<00:05:19.480> that's

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080

$50<00:05:20.680> so<00:05:20.920> I<00:05:20.950> really<00:05:21.280> wish<00:05:21.430> that<00:05:21.460> was<00:05:21.760> cheaper

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060
