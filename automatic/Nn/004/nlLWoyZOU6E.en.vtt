00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
the strap off the shoe it's one of the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.870 
the strap off the shoe it's one of the
hottest<00:00:29.130> parts<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.720> actual<00:00:31.590> model<00:00:32.160> maybe

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
hottest parts of this actual model maybe

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.450 
hottest parts of this actual model maybe
it<00:00:33.030> has<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.270> do<00:00:33.570> with<00:00:33.719> Kevin<00:00:34.079> Durant<00:00:34.230> maybe<00:00:34.770> the

it has to do with Kevin Durant maybe the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.729 
it has to do with Kevin Durant maybe the
strap<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.120> too<00:00:36.329> snug<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:36.870> his<00:00:37.050> foot<00:00:37.320> because

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
strap is too snug on his foot because

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.049 
strap is too snug on his foot because
you<00:00:37.860> know<00:00:37.950> he's<00:00:38.129> been<00:00:38.309> having<00:00:38.640> issues<00:00:38.820> with

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
you know he's been having issues with

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.060 
you know he's been having issues with
his<00:00:39.329> foot<00:00:39.570> lately<00:00:39.989> that's<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.410> only<00:00:40.649> thing<00:00:40.829> I

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
his foot lately that's the only thing I

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.600 
his foot lately that's the only thing I
could<00:00:41.129> think<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:42.030> can't<00:00:42.840> stand<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:44.040> model

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
could think of I can't stand this model

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.790 
could think of I can't stand this model
without<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.149> scrap<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.840> just<00:00:46.320> bothers<00:00:46.800> me

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
without the scrap it just bothers me

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.979 
without the scrap it just bothers me
because<00:00:47.190> with<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.789> strap<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:48.780> much

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
because with the strap it's so much

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.619 
because with the strap it's so much
hotter<00:00:49.289> but<00:00:50.129> at<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.850> end<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> day<00:00:51.420> they

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
hotter but at the end of the day they

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.369 
hotter but at the end of the day they
make<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.079> shoe<00:00:52.379> for<00:00:52.879> KD<00:00:53.879> now<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.899> fact

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
make this shoe for KD now is this a fact

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.410 
make this shoe for KD now is this a fact
that's<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.430> reason<00:00:56.550> why<00:00:56.760> they<00:00:57.059> remove<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
that's the reason why they remove the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.160 
that's the reason why they remove the
strap<00:00:57.989> no<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.460> just<00:00:59.489> me<00:01:00.030> just<00:01:00.539> assuming

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
strap no this is just me just assuming

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.520 
strap no this is just me just assuming
that's<00:01:01.410> probably<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.510> reason<00:01:03.510> why<00:01:03.690> they<00:01:03.960> did<00:01:03.989> so

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
that's probably a reason why they did so

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.340 
that's probably a reason why they did so
you<00:01:05.250> have<00:01:05.430> these<00:01:05.640> oversized<00:01:06.390> perforations

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
you have these oversized perforations

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.530 
you have these oversized perforations
maybe<00:01:08.220> also<00:01:08.549> there<00:01:08.939> wasn't<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> lot<00:01:09.360> of

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
maybe also there wasn't a lot of

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.020 
maybe also there wasn't a lot of
breathability<00:01:09.900> with<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.890> standard<00:01:11.430> model<00:01:11.460> so

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
breathability with the standard model so

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.730 
breathability with the standard model so
that's<00:01:12.210> why<00:01:12.420> they<00:01:12.570> have<00:01:12.720> these<00:01:12.869> oversized

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
that's why they have these oversized

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.160 
that's why they have these oversized
perforations<00:01:14.490> toward<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.360> back<00:01:15.570> on<00:01:15.869> this

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
perforations toward the back on this

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.039 
perforations toward the back on this
positive<00:01:16.710> material<00:01:17.340> whatever<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.540> case<00:01:18.750> may

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
positive material whatever the case may

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.160 
positive material whatever the case may
be<00:01:19.080> I'm<00:01:20.009> just<00:01:20.490> not<00:01:20.670> digging<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.299> compared<00:01:21.869> to

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
be I'm just not digging it compared to

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.859 
be I'm just not digging it compared to
the<00:01:22.439> actual<00:01:23.030> standard<00:01:24.030> model<00:01:24.479> I'd<00:01:24.570> rather

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
the actual standard model I'd rather

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.260 
the actual standard model I'd rather
have<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.650> standard<00:01:26.159> model<00:01:26.220> over<00:01:27.060> this

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
have the standard model over this

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.020 
have the standard model over this
doesn't<00:01:28.200> impress<00:01:28.500> me<00:01:28.560> at<00:01:28.950> all<00:01:29.159> but<00:01:29.520> that's

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030
