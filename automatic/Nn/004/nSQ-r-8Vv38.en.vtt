about<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.920> 64<00:01:26.430> but<00:01:26.610> from<00:01:26.729> what<00:01:26.820> I've<00:01:26.939> read

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
about the 64 but from what I've read

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.660 
about the 64 but from what I've read
online<00:01:27.299> after<00:01:28.049> their<00:01:28.200> Fiasco<00:01:28.979> about<00:01:29.310> saying

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
online after their Fiasco about saying

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.300 
online after their Fiasco about saying
there<00:01:29.880> was<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.030> little<00:01:30.530> available<00:01:31.530> storage<00:01:31.799> on

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
there was so little available storage on

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.640 
there was so little available storage on
the<00:01:32.579> 64<00:01:33.210> once<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.750> took<00:01:33.930> into<00:01:34.170> account<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
the 64 once you took into account the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.770 
the 64 once you took into account the
operating<00:01:35.130> system<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.880> recovery

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
operating system and the recovery

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.719 
operating system and the recovery
partition<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.740> apps<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.340> forth<00:01:38.640> that

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
partition and the apps and so forth that

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.030 
partition and the apps and so forth that
they<00:01:39.270> drove<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.720> lot<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.079> people<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.560> 128

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
they drove a lot of people to the 128

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.740 
they drove a lot of people to the 128
they<00:01:41.369> came<00:01:41.610> out<00:01:41.790> in<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.030> last<00:01:42.210> day<00:01:42.479> and

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
they came out in the last day and

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.270 
they came out in the last day and
clarified<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.470> actually<00:01:43.890> there's<00:01:44.070> more

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
clarified that actually there's more

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.190 
clarified that actually there's more
space<00:01:44.549> than<00:01:44.790> they<00:01:44.909> were<00:01:44.970> saying<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> 64

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
space than they were saying on a 64

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.950 
space than they were saying on a 64
instead<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.560> 23<00:01:47.100> gigabytes<00:01:47.640> if<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.509> take<00:01:48.780> off

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
instead of 23 gigabytes if you take off

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.330 
instead of 23 gigabytes if you take off
that<00:01:48.990> recovery<00:01:49.500> partition<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.070> can<00:01:50.220> actually

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
that recovery partition you can actually

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.920 
that recovery partition you can actually
get<00:01:50.549> about<00:01:50.700> 40<00:01:51.090> which<00:01:51.270> would<00:01:51.450> be<00:01:51.540> doable<00:01:51.780> for

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
get about 40 which would be doable for

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.530 
get about 40 which would be doable for
some<00:01:52.229> people<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.009> any<00:01:53.159> case<00:01:53.220> um<00:01:53.700> looks

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
that they produce for this first wave

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.370 
that they produce for this first wave
but<00:02:49.040> that<00:02:49.660> 128<00:02:50.660> smite<00:02:50.900> be<00:02:51.020> in<00:02:51.110> short<00:02:51.350> supply

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
but that 128 smite be in short supply

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.140 
but that 128 smite be in short supply
that's<00:02:51.920> why<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:52.070> read<00:02:52.310> earlier<00:02:52.460> this<00:02:52.760> morning

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
that's why I read earlier this morning

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.660 
that's why I read earlier this morning
so<00:02:53.300> it's<00:02:53.450> still<00:02:53.630> rumor<00:02:53.960> but<00:02:54.470> if<00:02:55.220> you're

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
so it's still rumor but if you're

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.730 
so it's still rumor but if you're
thinking<00:02:55.910> again<00:02:56.210> one<00:02:56.450> today<00:02:56.630> I'd<00:02:57.020> suggest

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
thinking again one today I'd suggest

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.220 
thinking again one today I'd suggest
going<00:02:57.920> urban
