00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
now um it's hard to say I mean it I

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.019 
now um it's hard to say I mean it I
suppose<00:00:17.500> ultimately<00:00:18.070> it's<00:00:18.279> just<00:00:18.640> pride

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
suppose ultimately it's just pride

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.010 
suppose ultimately it's just pride
because<00:00:19.900> I'm<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.880> thrilled<00:00:22.360> with<00:00:22.689> the<00:00:22.810> film

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.020 
because I'm so thrilled with the film

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.280 
because I'm so thrilled with the film
well<00:00:23.619> I<00:00:23.649> mean<00:00:23.890> I<00:00:24.160> think<00:00:24.700> of<00:00:25.270> it<00:00:25.419> as<00:00:25.570> being<00:00:25.840> kind

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.290 
well I mean I think of it as being kind

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.740 
well I mean I think of it as being kind
of<00:00:26.410> light<00:00:26.860> years<00:00:27.099> ahead<00:00:27.399> of<00:00:27.849> any<00:00:28.210> of<00:00:28.480> the<00:00:28.630> other

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
of light years ahead of any of the other

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.990 
of light years ahead of any of the other
films<00:00:29.079> in<00:00:29.200> the<00:00:29.259> series<00:00:29.619> and<00:00:29.829> I<00:00:30.099> find<00:00:30.880> it

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
films in the series and I find it

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.110 
films in the series and I find it
amazing<00:00:31.360> that<00:00:31.689> we<00:00:32.259> shot<00:00:32.890> part<00:00:33.700> 1<00:00:33.820> and<00:00:33.970> part<00:00:34.000> 2

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
amazing that we shot part 1 and part 2

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.370 
amazing that we shot part 1 and part 2
at<00:00:34.300> the<00:00:34.360> same<00:00:34.510> time<00:00:34.750> because<00:00:34.960> I<00:00:34.989> think<00:00:35.110> it's

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
at the same time because I think it's

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.319 
at the same time because I think it's
like<00:00:35.559> we're<00:00:35.769> different<00:00:36.129> actors<00:00:36.579> like<00:00:37.120> it<00:00:37.300> I

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
like we're different actors like it I

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.419 
like we're different actors like it I
mean<00:00:37.570> it's<00:00:37.780> it's<00:00:38.469> such<00:00:38.800> a<00:00:38.829> different<00:00:39.219> film

00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:39.429 
mean it's it's such a different film

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:42.180 
mean it's it's such a different film
from<00:00:39.609> part<00:00:39.820> one<00:00:39.969> I<00:00:40.480> mean<00:00:41.469> part<00:00:41.710> one<00:00:41.829> was<00:00:41.980> great

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
from part one I mean part one was great

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.279 
from part one I mean part one was great
but<00:00:42.399> this<00:00:42.609> in<00:00:42.850> terms<00:00:43.030> of<00:00:43.179> quality<00:00:43.539> this<00:00:43.690> is<00:00:43.750> the

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:44.289 
but this in terms of quality this is the

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:46.380 
but this in terms of quality this is the
best<00:00:44.469> film<00:00:44.679> we've<00:00:44.859> ever<00:00:45.010> made<00:00:45.190> so<00:00:45.489> I<00:00:45.730> suppose
