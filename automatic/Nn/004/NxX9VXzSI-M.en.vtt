so a fivefold decline in the number of
species<00:01:51.110> she<00:01:52.110> also<00:01:52.259> found<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.189> sizes<00:01:53.549> of

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.359 
species she also found that the sizes of
individuals<00:01:54.630> had<00:01:54.750> declined<00:01:55.200> enormous<00:01:55.979> li<00:01:56.159> and

now<00:01:56.640> most<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.329> fish<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.750> are<00:01:57.840> caught<00:01:58.140> are

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
now most of the fish that are caught are

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.859 
now most of the fish that are caught are

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.550 
juveniles they're baby babies
essentially<00:02:01.969> she<00:02:02.969> found<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.560> fishermen

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
essentially she found that fishermen

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.830 
essentially she found that fishermen
were<00:02:05.219> getting<00:02:05.520> fewer<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:05.880> purer<00:02:06.090> sharks<00:02:06.540> and

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
were getting fewer and purer sharks and

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.359 
were getting fewer and purer sharks and
as<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.110> result<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.740> they<00:02:07.920> had<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.220> move

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
as a result of that they had to move

over for the past like past years about

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.860 
over for the past like past years about
the<00:03:19.920> fish<00:03:20.130> species<00:03:20.519> and<00:03:21.060> abundance<00:03:21.570> in<00:03:21.690> Hong

Kong and for the over past five years I

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.120 
Kong and for the over past five years I
think<00:03:26.130> seeing<00:03:26.430> in<00:03:27.090> Hong<00:03:27.299> Kong<00:03:27.329> the<00:03:28.200> fish<00:03:28.440> now

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
think seeing in Hong Kong the fish now

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.470 
think seeing in Hong Kong the fish now
what<00:03:29.489> we<00:03:29.670> are<00:03:29.760> getting<00:03:31.760> about<00:03:32.760> this<00:03:33.239> size

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
what we are getting about this size

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.110 
what we are getting about this size
which<00:03:34.290> means<00:03:34.560> it's<00:03:34.859> pretty<00:03:35.130> much<00:03:35.340> of<00:03:35.549> our<00:03:35.700> size

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
which means it's pretty much of our size

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.190 
which means it's pretty much of our size
of<00:03:36.420> like<00:03:36.900> Hong<00:03:37.590> Kong<00:03:37.829> one<00:03:37.980> dollar<00:03:38.900> so<00:03:39.900> what

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
of like Hong Kong one dollar so what
