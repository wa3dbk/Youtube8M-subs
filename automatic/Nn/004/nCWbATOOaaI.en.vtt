oh<00:00:33.710> but<00:00:34.640> what<00:00:34.790> we<00:00:34.910> do<00:00:35.059> is<00:00:35.180> we<00:00:35.330> attach<00:00:35.660> the<00:00:35.900> three

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
oh but what we do is we attach the three

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.340 
oh but what we do is we attach the three
waist<00:00:36.320> level<00:00:37.240> one<00:00:38.240> section<00:00:38.690> to<00:00:38.840> our<00:00:38.900> main<00:00:39.110> line

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
waist level one section to our main line

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.100 
waist level one section to our main line
and<00:00:39.680> the<00:00:40.370> two<00:00:40.670> other<00:00:40.850> sections<00:00:41.150> are<00:00:41.570> leaders

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
and the two other sections are leaders

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.800 
and the two other sections are leaders
that<00:00:42.290> are<00:00:42.350> running<00:00:42.680> to<00:00:42.830> our<00:00:42.860> float<00:00:43.540> right<00:00:44.540> here

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
that are running to our float right here

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.040 
that are running to our float right here
and<00:00:45.620> then<00:00:45.920> running<00:00:46.340> to<00:00:46.430> our<00:00:46.670> leader<00:00:47.240> for<00:00:48.020> our

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
and then running to our leader for our

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.890 
and then running to our leader for our
cookies<00:00:48.820> so<00:00:49.820> what<00:00:50.030> we'll<00:00:50.180> do<00:00:50.360> here<00:00:50.390> is<00:00:50.630> when<00:00:50.870> we

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
cookies so what we'll do here is when we

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.260 
cookies so what we'll do here is when we
attach<00:00:51.290> our<00:00:51.500> leaders<00:00:51.829> to<00:00:52.070> our<00:00:52.610> float<00:00:52.910> in<00:00:53.150> our

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
attach our leaders to our float in our

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.000 
attach our leaders to our float in our
hook<00:00:53.510> we<00:00:53.990> try<00:00:54.230> to<00:00:54.290> keep<00:00:54.530> them<00:00:54.710> approximately

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
hook we try to keep them approximately

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.580 
hook we try to keep them approximately
the<00:00:55.579> same<00:00:55.760> size<00:00:55.840> this<00:00:56.840> right<00:00:57.110> here<00:00:57.320> is<00:00:57.440> about

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
the same size this right here is about

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.370 
the same size this right here is about
I'd<00:00:58.220> say<00:00:58.280> two<00:00:59.030> feet<00:00:59.300> two<00:00:59.570> and<00:00:59.600> a<00:00:59.720> half<00:00:59.870> feet<00:01:00.110> in

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
I'd say two feet two and a half feet in

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.040 
I'd say two feet two and a half feet in
length<00:01:00.620> both<00:01:01.310> of<00:01:01.520> them<00:01:01.640> what<00:01:02.420> this<00:01:02.600> does<00:01:02.810> is

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
length both of them what this does is

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.689 
length both of them what this does is
you'll<00:01:03.470> see<00:01:03.649> that<00:01:03.710> you<00:01:03.860> have<00:01:04.009> two<00:01:04.220> lines<00:01:04.460> now

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
you'll see that you have two lines now

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.490 
you'll see that you have two lines now
hanging<00:01:05.089> from<00:01:05.239> your<00:01:05.299> from<00:01:05.960> your<00:01:06.079> three<00:01:06.290> waist

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
hanging from your from your three waist

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.520 
hanging from your from your three waist
level<00:01:06.770> this<00:01:07.550> allows<00:01:08.030> you<00:01:08.360> to<00:01:08.960> when<00:01:09.409> you're

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
level this allows you to when you're

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.710 
level this allows you to when you're
casting<00:01:09.800> especially<00:01:10.580> from<00:01:10.820> us<00:01:10.970> a<00:01:11.180> genuine

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
casting especially from us a genuine

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.270 
casting especially from us a genuine

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
you're crammed up against the rocks and

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.800 
you're crammed up against the rocks and
you<00:01:13.370> don't<00:01:13.520> have<00:01:13.610> that<00:01:13.729> much<00:01:13.880> space<00:01:14.030> to<00:01:14.330> cap<00:01:14.510> it

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
you don't have that much space to cap it

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.110 
you don't have that much space to cap it
allows<00:01:15.470> you<00:01:15.650> to<00:01:15.770> cast<00:01:15.979> this<00:01:16.430> two<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:16.760> a<00:01:16.820> half

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
allows you to cast this two and a half

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.510 
allows you to cast this two and a half
foot<00:01:17.450> leader<00:01:17.750> which<00:01:18.409> is<00:01:18.560> your<00:01:18.740> float<00:01:19.040> and<00:01:19.280> your

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
foot leader which is your float and your

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.270 
foot leader which is your float and your
hook<00:01:19.729> into<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:20.690> water<00:01:20.930> and<00:01:21.200> what<00:01:21.920> it<00:01:22.010> ends<00:01:22.250> up

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
hook into the water and what it ends up

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.800 
hook into the water and what it ends up
happening<00:01:22.460> is<00:01:22.820> when<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:23.180> float<00:01:23.390> hits<00:01:23.659> the

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
happening is when the float hits the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.500 
happening is when the float hits the
water<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.350> float<00:01:24.830> will<00:01:25.010> rise<00:01:25.220> up<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:25.670> now<00:01:26.240> it

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
water the float will rise up and now it

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.020 
water the float will rise up and now it
will<00:01:26.659> it<00:01:27.020> will<00:01:27.200> allow<00:01:27.470> you<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:28.370> actually<00:01:28.760> be

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
will it will allow you to actually be

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.960 
will it will allow you to actually be

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
casting a two foot leader what it does

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.460 
casting a two foot leader what it does
is<00:01:37.100> when<00:01:37.610> it<00:01:37.729> cats<00:01:38.000> it<00:01:38.330> folds<00:01:38.659> up<00:01:38.750> it<00:01:39.229> doesn't

foot leader when it's the bait it's the
water<00:01:45.080> the<00:01:45.350> float<00:01:45.590> will<00:01:45.770> rise<00:01:45.979> up<00:01:46.220> and<00:01:46.549> now<00:01:47.330> you

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
water the float will rise up and now you

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.719 
water the float will rise up and now you
have<00:01:47.720> a<00:01:47.960> four<00:01:48.409> foot<00:01:48.590> leader<00:01:48.799> so<00:01:49.340> this<00:01:49.490> can<00:01:49.700> be

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
have a four foot leader so this can be

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.690 
have a four foot leader so this can be
done<00:01:49.850> this<00:01:50.720> can<00:01:50.930> be<00:01:51.080> done<00:01:51.260> all<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.740> way<00:01:51.890> to<00:01:51.950> ten

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
done this can be done all the way to ten

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.180 
done this can be done all the way to ten
foot<00:01:52.939> leaders<00:01:53.240> if<00:01:53.450> you<00:01:53.540> wanted<00:01:53.780> to<00:01:53.900> fish

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
foot leaders if you wanted to fish

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.100 
foot leaders if you wanted to fish
ten<00:01:54.340> foot<00:01:54.580> in<00:01:54.790> depth<00:01:54.970> you<00:01:55.390> would<00:01:55.510> have<00:01:55.690> a<00:01:55.720> five

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
ten foot in depth you would have a five

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.060 
ten foot in depth you would have a five
foot<00:01:56.610> floater<00:01:57.610> leader<00:01:57.910> and<00:01:58.360> a<00:01:58.450> five<00:01:58.720> foot

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
foot floater leader and a five foot

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.180 
foot floater leader and a five foot
hopefully<00:02:00.300> with<00:02:01.300> the<00:02:01.900> new<00:02:02.020> launchers<00:02:02.530> bombers

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
hopefully with the new launchers bombers

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.460 
hopefully with the new launchers bombers
we<00:02:03.370> have<00:02:03.520> up<00:02:03.640> here<00:02:03.880> these<00:02:04.000> are<00:02:04.150> 12<00:02:04.330> launchers

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
we have up here these are 12 launchers

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.440 
we have up here these are 12 launchers
these<00:02:05.920> are<00:02:06.070> allowing<00:02:06.400> us<00:02:06.490> to<00:02:06.640> throw<00:02:07.000> bait<00:02:07.240> a

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
these are allowing us to throw bait a

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.240 
these are allowing us to throw bait a
lot<00:02:07.750> further<00:02:08.140> than<00:02:08.320> the<00:02:08.560> standard<00:02:08.979> floater

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
lot further than the standard floater

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.340 
lot further than the standard floater
because<00:02:09.550> these<00:02:09.790> are<00:02:10.030> weighted<00:02:10.450> floats<00:02:10.720> this

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
because these are weighted floats this

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.900 
because these are weighted floats this
one<00:02:11.530> here<00:02:11.710> and<00:02:12.040> give<00:02:12.160> either<00:02:12.310> an<00:02:12.550> ounce<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:12.880> a

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
one here and give either an ounce and a

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.520 
one here and give either an ounce and a
half<00:02:13.090> or<00:02:13.300> allison<00:02:13.780> three<00:02:13.930> quarters<00:02:14.290> they're

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
half or allison three quarters they're

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.190 
half or allison three quarters they're
called<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:14.830> launchers<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:15.820> this<00:02:16.720> allows<00:02:17.020> you

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
called the launchers and this allows you

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.640 
called the launchers and this allows you
to<00:02:17.320> throw<00:02:17.680> baits<00:02:18.010> lot<00:02:18.910> further<00:02:19.300> without<00:02:19.900> you

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
to throw baits lot further without you

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.140 
to throw baits lot further without you
without<00:02:20.770> trying<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.250> weight<00:02:21.490> a<00:02:21.520> floater<00:02:21.880> down

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
without trying to weight a floater down

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.140 
without trying to weight a floater down
or<00:02:22.390> get<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.570> heavy<00:02:22.840> flow<00:02:23.080> this<00:02:23.710> is<00:02:23.850> one<00:02:24.850> South

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
or get a heavy flow this is one South

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.490 
or get a heavy flow this is one South
they<00:02:25.480> have<00:02:25.660> them<00:02:25.780> all<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.020> way<00:02:26.110> up<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.350> five

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
they have them all the way up to five

they have them all the way up to five
ounces<00:02:26.950> this<00:02:27.670> has<00:02:27.880> really<00:02:28.150> helped<00:02:28.330> their

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
ounces this has really helped their

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.080 
ounces this has really helped their

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
allowing us to fish the Jennings a lot

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.190 
allowing us to fish the Jennings a lot
easier<00:02:32.740> and<00:02:32.950> not<00:02:33.520> having<00:02:33.790> if<00:02:34.180> you<00:02:34.330> guys<00:02:34.480> casted
