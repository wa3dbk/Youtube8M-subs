00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:24.150
 and then the beauty make a box today of the game 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.189
 of the star zombie 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.019
 the guys were curious to know what they want 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.090
 how is where it came from and where it goes 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.480
 so let's look at how to analyze the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.950
 that comes from this little talking box the Pope is 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.120
 Dear patient because like this here already 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:50.600
 leave you - the week is still closed 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:56.430
 you had already opened without a ball in training 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:01:27.240
 taking advantage of the mile wave is fabÃ­ola 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:29.340
 Dani demonstrates well my role of butter 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:37.530
 problem is not tvn 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:39.630
 a man with quino plastic said 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.500
 shines in the dark you can not know now 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.500
 I can not see 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:51.110
 so I guess they just get one 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:56.899
 bit of light first and then it 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:59.790
 starts shining or not all are the same 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:04.350
 I do not know if they can see if they have a 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.719
 has a drawing has a fondness and a 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.619
 I do not know anything about that. 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:13.800
 have some 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:19.620
 comes here because this is one of the 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:30.150
 pins something simple and is behind the 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:32.459
 vettel blue and has the red has in 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.849
 box that is a hole here in the part 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.410
 back to fit for 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.709
 tell who is the red player who 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.540
 so blue player is good not for what I 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:50.730
 I know that a note does not come in the part 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:03:01.319
 from behind the box it looks a lot 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:03:03.090
 simple game I'm just to have 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.360
 sure there's nothing in the box 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:11.940
 there is no whole thing wrong is the guide 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:13.889
 how to prepare the game how to play and not 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.700
 to be planting the doors who wins the 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:20.430
 game of cans board 16 one eight bis 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.019
 blue pins eight red feathers 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:34.859
 according to the box when it shines on 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:36.780
 dark green or not but it seems 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:44.250
 one is one against one is the maximum of 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:47.389
 players on the front that is paper for 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.389
 today six years 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:56.380
 the improvement of 3 kg size of the pieces not 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:59.440
 is normal is good players from 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.710
 6 years seems like it's one against one 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.660
 a queue there for review is not it there 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:10.540
 but at first the piece that is 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:12.960
 resistant fit inside you can 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.960
 to do so 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.360
 that's it then we have to more 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.489
 curiosity but question was directed 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.820
 to answer why the box is simple 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.790
 The player will play to see something. 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:33.420
 look like lady handle picks up something 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.420
 so must have nationality here the 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.160
 folks 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.160
 thanks for helping me
