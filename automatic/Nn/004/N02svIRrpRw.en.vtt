00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:18.640
 Hello and welcome to a 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:21.610
 new video of software and hardware 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.250
 It's notebook again today 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.340
 I have here before that hp 635 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:32.230
 and today I have that 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.739
 paper 655 so the follower for you 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.300
 ordered again over 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.200
 have a notebook on thursday 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.660
 ordered saturday at 12 o'clock raster very much 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.760
 nice very nice years you see 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:53.000
 processor again from amd in the 635 was still 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:56.180
 the b 450 installed and in the 655 he from ap 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.910
 is now de 2800 installed 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:04.840
 with twice 1 7 ghz the notebook why 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.840
 Unpack just now times 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:42.420
 should be the hardest overcome already there 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:44.730
 is already the same time on the set 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.910
 up instruction contrary to completely unimportant 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.910
 for us 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:12.220
 the whole thing is empty for now 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:16.780
 complete and we have that good 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:19.959
 piece from which it differs 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:24.580
 actually almost immediately from the outside right now 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:27.120
 not at all from 635 but we are looking 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.120
 continue 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.590
 the good piece 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.720
 nice nice so the notebook hp 655th 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:05.970
 bring back a matte display with 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:09.050
 the camera is on board and otherwise on 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.020
 pretty much the same at first glance 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:15.770
 a thing for me right now on and 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:20.880
 these are the two buttons the mhp 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:23.340
 635 felt very disturbing because they 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.770
 No edges had the edge 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.370
 together, so to speak, the key to the 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.200
 yourself and thereby you can be very 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.520
 run fast if you complain or something 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.530
 then you just clicked off 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.470
 provided they have that well 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.360
 even now they have it themselves 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.690
 also noticed and yes you already have 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.690
 times solved 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:53.940
 otherwise power cable power and battery 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.590
 as it always is drivers will not 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.150
 the one you have to get from the 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.709
 Download hp page 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.060
 Of course, the whole thing has one too 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.769
 decisive advantage that you always 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.630
 the latest driver for the pc 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:07.200
 download or for the notebook always too 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.120
 Find 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.680
 Unfortunately, you also have all the drivers are 1 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.930
 there is not a package that one 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.230
 Everyone gets each other, so to speak 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.510
 driver 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.190
 the network is the audio of each part 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.169
 must be loaded individually 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.979
 they could be there again 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:28.690
 to come up with something 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:30.120
 but well, yes, the laptop comes with 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.850
 four gigabytes of RAM 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.330
 but the whole thing on a slot are two 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:40.440
 So it's easily available 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:45.970
 to add a second rule 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:47.800
 otherwise yes the keyboard and the 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:53.530
 touchpad is actually almost identical 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:54.729
 the 35er model well the keys like 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.960
 I was much better the old ones 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.940
 really a bit wider and so on 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.690
 really plastic moderately the whole is here 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:04.410
 very nice connected with this metal 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:07.449
 we would be the processor de 2 again 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.580
 to the processor the e2 has a better one 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.560
 graphic chip on board a graphics card 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:16.120
 we just do not have it in the graphic 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.710
 chip with shared memory for gambling is it 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.690
 do not necessarily think so synonymous 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:24.310
 So starcraft numbers runs for example 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.450
 on minimum setting with bra 54 fps 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.669
 it's a reasonable one 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.430
 number there you can already play with the game 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:32.880
 gamers are new players 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.780
 counterproductive for the product though 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.930
 If you want you can also like to 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:41.010
 games test if that if so specific 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:43.330
 games are required of you or 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.889
 benchmark 3d mark or whatever 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.450
 you can just do that too 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.789
 post and do that for you 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.930
 afterward 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:52.870
 I will also have a second video 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.660
 make was where it is then more likely to take out the 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.099
 ucs around windows and just about these things 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:02.590
 that was just the first time so 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:04.120
 little unboxing and superficial to 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:09.340
 the side are then still the 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:12.639
 leather device then audio yes that is 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:17.260
 just microphone and headset then once 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:19.000
 usb hdmi a network and 1 x vga front 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.430
 there is nothing at all except the 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.930
 fan exit on both sides 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:29.230
 and here the drive twice usb and 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.940
 the power plug in the back also nothing 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.550
 you have to say that with the speakers 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.660
 I also noticed the 635 he was there 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:39.250
 only speakers were installed 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.050
 I never had to agree that's right 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.520
 yes a ventilation that's even the 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.410
 I am sorry but speakers are 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.980
 the speakers right here is synonymous 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:49.360
 again in 635, he was there so there was 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.100
 just a speaker around the whole device 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.230
 This has become very unpleasant 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.870
 listened to the device there is now 

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.980
 I also test two for you again 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.020
 It's all so much nicer now 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:04.810
 has become sound 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:07.180
 and yes that was it for the first time yes 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.920
 Also more specific to the product itself 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.960
 product is moment at notebooksbilliger 

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:17.980
 to have for 279 euros 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:21.820
 that's 10 euros more than the hp 300 635 

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:23.200
 whether it's worth it or not 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.240
 I keep testing but I think so 

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:29.920
 even that for ten euros a better one 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:33.640
 graphics better cpu and and and and victory 

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:35.080
 definitely worth link to 635 as 

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.550
 to the old model and the new model 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.610
 I would post you below 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:43.360
 just like the other video for the 635 er 

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:45.070
 if I add to that and then 

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.370
 I'll shoot until the next one 

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.370
 Video
