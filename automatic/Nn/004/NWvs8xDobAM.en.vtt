00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.169
 today we are going to talk about 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.640
 the Achilles heel the subject 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:25.849
 pending 'or whatever you want to call it 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.870
 are the late very very important 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:32.180
 learn to city today no no 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.390
 it is not necessary to pull a lot of wit 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.660
 since there is a whole sport bed 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.980
 and accessories for me 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:44.440
 we used to have because the course 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.020
 is learning over time and what 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.030
 we need is the correct one 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.280
 We have our own 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.360
 tools always isolated to point 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.360
 no credit 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.840
 of communion 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.460
 in this system they have two advantages 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.560
 characterized by these two great 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.550
 advantages that it has 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:09.520
 one is that we can sharpen at speed 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.920
 that we want the each tool we 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.960
 allow and that our ability also 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.900
 allow us with which not to reheat 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.260
 for the tools if we work at a 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.210
 low speed not at 2,850 revolutions 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.729
 as worked more 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.799
 and the other of course is the economy 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.360
 since here we have everything 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.710
 necessary not only for the city but 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.420
 also to seat the film 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.060
 very important detail lost 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.820
 that is a completely autonomous system 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.460
 and now you will see it is adaptable to all 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.380
 now you will see how it works in 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.189
 any in any already large shades 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.649
 and small 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.830
 well we proceed to assemble the system in 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:53.320
 this case is a tone know 33 and enough 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.220
 with the support of an inch very 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.220
 standardized 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:05.170
 and at the speed that suits us 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.860
 we will line up what we have to 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.399
 always try to keep the stone 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.399
 effect 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.830
 why 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.720
 equal advance 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.060
 the very low low of the days I prefer 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.750
 more speed by psuv or speed 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.750
 so 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.070
 we place the corresponding stem 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.070
 the magic 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.960
 one 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.080
 and the articulated arm that is going to 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.080
 allow 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.960
 the distance that is thought for this 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.500
 kind of is precisely that the width of 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.500
 the garment 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.490
 with known is that to get the 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.030
 angle that we had 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.140
 now let's fix a gouge forced 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.490
 this system is able to say to 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.720
 any type of tool is called 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:17.020
 rains informed towards whatever 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.750
 well we already have the tool subject and 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.190
 marked and now what we proceed is 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.190
 adapt the system 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.780
 in this case 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.150
 the inclination to make it look good 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.150
 be 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.700
 and indeed it is a tilt 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.700
 adequate 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.420
 and without further proceeding to sharpen 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:11.400
 well we already have the sharp tool 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.400
 let's proceed to take out the left 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:21.049
 of the 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:25.509
 in the clip and is also 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.509
 and through the bottom of the brush 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.790
 now we have passed another lathe with another 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.610
 passed another bar 0 thread without any 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.889
 problem for the system we use the 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:56.569
 adapter the request 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:58.969
 and we counted the tooth even 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:01.460
 speed regulation does not matter we're going to 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:03.949
 work in the fastest that the 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.080
 lathe and even in the middle as bach 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:09.240
 as we do now we 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.200
 we put the support more or less 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.480
 be aligned 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.610
 and we have also changed the shank of the 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.720
 scion of our bull is this average 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.720
 therefore that we will use 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:28.380
 well as I said before the planned measure 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:30.890
 in this entity is the width of the plate 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.890
 ah 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.839
 we will have to 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:41.839
 to adjust the 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.510
 you have effectively 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.510
 and we proceed to phil to the rain 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:36.900
 I wore multiple advantage persists 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:40.680
 first we can work at speed 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:42.479
 that allows us not to burn the tool 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.870
 with the consequent descentre of the steel 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:48.120
 that this topic is very very important 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:51.600
 second is adaptable to all lathes 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:55.590
 and third does not avoid having to buy 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:58.800
 an additional machine and fourth 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:02.950
 this kit already contains everything you need 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:05.500
 to include included the theme of the 

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:08.560
 not any kind of problem for gouges 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:11.500
 be crowned be taught chisels 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.550
 oblique straight ridges scrapers 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.550
 any tools
