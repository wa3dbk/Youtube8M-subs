220 k again the price will vary or go up
and<00:03:51.930> down<00:03:52.109> I<00:03:52.349> bought<00:03:52.739> a<00:03:52.799> lot<00:03:52.949> of<00:03:52.979> these<00:03:53.099> cheaper

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669 
and down I bought a lot of these cheaper

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:55.580 
and down I bought a lot of these cheaper
because<00:03:53.909> just<00:03:54.479> at<00:03:54.659> the<00:03:54.750> times<00:03:54.989> I<00:03:55.169> bought<00:03:55.409> them

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
because just at the times I bought them

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.530 
because just at the times I bought them
but<00:03:56.159> the<00:03:56.250> prices<00:03:56.459> will<00:03:56.790> be<00:03:56.849> going<00:03:57.180> up<00:03:57.329> and<00:03:57.449> down

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
but the prices will be going up and down

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.770 
but the prices will be going up and down
so<00:03:57.959> I<00:03:57.989> just<00:03:58.799> be<00:03:58.949> wary<00:03:59.069> of<00:03:59.220> that<00:03:59.569> also<00:04:00.569> some

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780
