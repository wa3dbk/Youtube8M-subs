the<00:00:47.010> most<00:00:47.190> interesting<00:00:47.910> thing<00:00:48.360> for<00:00:48.570> me<00:00:48.690> was

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
the most interesting thing for me was

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.680 
the most interesting thing for me was
share<00:00:49.200> play<00:00:49.470> which<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.310> basically<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.270> care<00:00:51.540> a

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
share play which is basically you care a

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.250
