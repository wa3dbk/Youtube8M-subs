comes to mind evolved comes to mind and

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.380 
comes to mind evolved comes to mind and
I<00:00:31.439> think<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.800> community<00:00:32.009> sort<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.790> split<00:00:33.210> on

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
I think the community sort of split on

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.330 
I think the community sort of split on
games<00:00:33.719> like<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.320> think<00:00:34.770> people<00:00:34.950> who<00:00:35.130> buy

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
games like this I think people who buy

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.340 
games like this I think people who buy
games<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.059> go<00:00:36.210> straight<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.719> multiplayer

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
games and go straight to the multiplayer

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.799 
games and go straight to the multiplayer
the<00:00:37.590> multiplayer<00:00:38.129> lovers<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.360> know<00:00:39.510> say

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
the multiplayer lovers and you know say

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.510 
the multiplayer lovers and you know say
I<00:00:39.840> could<00:00:40.200> go<00:00:40.320> back<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.770> single<00:00:41.100> player<00:00:41.190> at

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
I could go back to the single player at

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.970 
I could go back to the single player at
some<00:00:42.120> point<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.570> think<00:00:42.780> those<00:00:42.989> people<00:00:43.469> don't

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
some point I think those people don't

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.770 
some point I think those people don't
really<00:00:44.219> care<00:00:44.579> if<00:00:44.820> there's<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.120> single<00:00:45.450> player

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
really care if there's a single player

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.479 
really care if there's a single player
then<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.289> think<00:00:46.649> there's<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.070> people<00:00:47.399> who

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
then I think there's the people who

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.369 
then I think there's the people who
prefer<00:00:47.850> single-player<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.450> really<00:00:49.050> wish

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
prefer single-player and really wish

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.690 
prefer single-player and really wish
that<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.770> would<00:00:49.980> have<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.160> single<00:00:50.520> player<00:00:50.670> and

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
that this would have a single player and

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.790 
that this would have a single player and
I<00:00:51.030> understand<00:00:51.539> both<00:00:51.719> sides<00:00:51.750> but<00:00:52.469> like<00:00:52.649> i<00:00:52.770> said

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
I understand both sides but like i said

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.830 
I understand both sides but like i said
i<00:00:53.039> don't<00:00:53.190> think<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.820> community<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.390> cut<00:00:54.719> and

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
i don't think the community is cut and

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.479 
i don't think the community is cut and
dry<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.379> i<00:00:55.590> think<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.829> lot<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:55.980> people<00:00:56.100> hate

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
dry on this i think a lot of people hate

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.189 
dry on this i think a lot of people hate
it<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.760> lot<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:56.969> people<00:00:57.180> love<00:00:57.960> it

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
it and a lot of people love it

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.200 
it and a lot of people love it
personally<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.039> have<00:00:59.399> no<00:00:59.579> problem<00:00:59.969> with<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
personally I have no problem with the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.450 
personally I have no problem with the
multiplayer<00:01:00.719> only<00:01:00.960> game<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.620> just<00:01:02.219> hope<00:01:02.430> that

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
multiplayer only game I just hope that

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.189 
multiplayer only game I just hope that
there's<00:01:02.699> enough<00:01:03.030> content<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.809> that's

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
there's enough content and that's

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.660 
there's enough content and that's
something<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.680> seems<00:01:05.100> hard<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.460> do

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
something that seems hard to do

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.149 
something that seems hard to do
especially<00:01:05.880> for<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> company<00:01:06.930> like<00:01:07.020> EA<00:01:07.439> that

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
especially for a company like EA that

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.060 
especially for a company like EA that
likes<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.119> take<00:01:09.390> your<00:01:09.659> money<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.619> should<00:01:11.040> be

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
likes to take your money so it should be

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.490 
likes to take your money so it should be
interesting<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:12.270> see<00:01:12.510> what<00:01:12.600> kind<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.900> DLC<00:01:13.350> they

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
interesting to see what kind of DLC they

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.760 
interesting to see what kind of DLC they
have<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.060> how<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.119> works<00:01:15.330> out<00:01:15.780> but<00:01:16.439> then<00:01:16.619> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
have and how that works out but then the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.289 
have and how that works out but then the
second<00:01:17.250> thing<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.700> think<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.000> lot<00:01:18.270> of

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
second thing that I think a lot of

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.600 
second thing that I think a lot of
people<00:01:18.450> overlooked<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.530> fact<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.189> Sony

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
people overlooked is the fact that Sony

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.730 
people overlooked is the fact that Sony
has<00:01:20.729> secured<00:01:21.420> marketing<00:01:22.049> rights<00:01:22.290> for<00:01:22.619> this

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
has secured marketing rights for this

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.130 
has secured marketing rights for this
game<00:01:23.100> we<00:01:23.759> know<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:23.909> last<00:01:24.299> holiday<00:01:24.689> season

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.469 
game we know that last holiday season
Microsoft<00:01:25.680> was<00:01:25.920> ready<00:01:26.159> Microsoft<00:01:26.909> was

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
Microsoft was ready Microsoft was

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.359 
Microsoft was ready Microsoft was
targeting<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.229> holiday<00:01:28.619> season<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.159> came

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
targeting the holiday season and came

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.130 
targeting the holiday season and came
out<00:01:29.400> with<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.939> halo<00:01:30.479> master<00:01:30.780> chief<00:01:31.110> collection

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
out with a halo master chief collection

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.649 
out with a halo master chief collection
sunset<00:01:32.009> overdrive<00:01:32.250> forts<00:01:32.790> Orizon<00:01:33.240> too<00:01:33.420> and

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
sunset overdrive forts Orizon too and

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.740 
sunset overdrive forts Orizon too and
they<00:01:34.320> did<00:01:34.799> very<00:01:34.829> well<00:01:35.310> on<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.000> holiday<00:01:36.299> season

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.749 
they did very well on the holiday season
and<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.530> looks<00:01:37.770> like<00:01:37.829> that's<00:01:38.070> Microsoft

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
and it looks like that's Microsoft

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.270 
and it looks like that's Microsoft
strategy<00:01:39.270> again<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:39.930> time<00:01:40.229> but<00:01:40.860> Sony<00:01:41.100> is

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
strategy again this time but Sony is

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
PlayStation commercial and while I don't

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.580 
PlayStation commercial and while I don't
think<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.270> going<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.720> make<00:01:55.020> up<00:01:55.290> for<00:01:55.320> not

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
think it's going to make it easier to

surprises we don't know about but
uncharted<00:02:25.140> got<00:02:25.290> pushed<00:02:25.560> back<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:26.100> it<00:02:26.520> looks

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
uncharted got pushed back and it looks

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.850 
uncharted got pushed back and it looks
pretty<00:02:26.880> bleak<00:02:27.270> for<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.600> end<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.930> year<00:02:27.960> so

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
pretty bleak for the end of the year so

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.740 
pretty bleak for the end of the year so
this<00:02:29.010> is<00:02:29.040> definitely<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:29.850> way<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.120> try<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.480> take

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
this is definitely a way to try to take

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.140 
this is definitely a way to try to take
some<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.200> those<00:02:31.290> sales<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:32.130> xbox<00:02:32.640> one<00:02:32.940> is

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
some of those sales that xbox one is

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.910 
some of those sales that xbox one is
sure<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.600> get<00:02:33.750> with<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.470> games<00:02:34.680> they're

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
sure to get with the games they're

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.070 
sure to get with the games they're
releasing<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.640> I'll<00:02:36.240> bring<00:02:36.540> them<00:02:36.750> over<00:02:36.780> to

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
releasing and I'll bring them over to

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.630 
releasing and I'll bring them over to
the<00:02:37.200> Sony<00:02:37.440> side<00:02:37.710> so<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:37.980> think<00:02:38.130> it's<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.490> good

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
the Sony side so I think it's a good

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.760 
the Sony side so I think it's a good
strategy<00:02:39.000> we're<00:02:39.900> just<00:02:40.110> going<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.320> have<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.500> see

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
strategy we're just going to have to see

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.820 
going to think that a star wars
battlefront<00:02:59.280> is<00:02:59.940> only<00:03:00.450> on<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.840> PlayStation<00:03:01.530> 4
