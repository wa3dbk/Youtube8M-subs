00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.639
 Lesson One 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.889
 personal requirements 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.920
 Limitations of physical ability and the driver 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:17.320
 personality 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.740
 In our first lessons, we treat the personal requirements 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.460
 from each of us 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.750
 perceive a traffic situation they correctly recognize and appropriate 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.050
 react 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.050
 Essential for survival in traffic 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.080
 how reliable basis for the right action are the singles 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.010
 information 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.210
 which physical abilities 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.510
 are important to us well it went 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.980
 I have heard that about 90 percent of all sensory impressions with the 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.700
 Eyes are recorded 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.400
 but also feeling and hearing are important sources of information for the 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.550
 driver 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.270
 I think, "It ultimately comes down to the optimal interaction of these 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.350
 Perceptions as the right decision can be 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.580
 absolutely right 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.159
 the driving license regulation prescribes 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.670
 that everyone driving a vehicle has to be roadworthy 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.300
 That's why they also have to if they want to get the driver's license 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.200
 first make an eye test 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.800
 around the central day 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.170
 to test her sharpness 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.550
 On average, they see why it comes to 1 0 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.020
 however, a VISOS of at least 7 is allowed 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.880
 Of course, they passed the test in that as well 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.920
 if you meet the minimum requirements with glasses or contact lenses 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.950
 to reach 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.180
 However, this visual aid is then noted in the driver's license 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.180
 And you always have to carry them while driving 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.740
 next to the 7th 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.180
 Listening is very important 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.880
 The sense of hearing gives us clues about what's outside ours 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.149
 Field of view lies 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.000
 sure, of course 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.690
 At an intersection, I often hear a car before I can see it 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.820
 who because of a full-blown radio or headphones 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.189
 Traffic noises can not hear anymore 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:12.519
 not only violates the traffic regulations but with himself 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.030
 also the possibility Dina to perceive 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.689
 before he sees her 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.689
 that sounds like that 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.529
 they have noticed how quickly the external perception weakens during 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:50.129
 but 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.949
 Feeling is important too 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:55.969
 For example, you feel a broken tire or how it bumps when you hit it 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:57.939
 over cobblestones 4 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:02:59.679
 right 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:03.519
 Many events are made by the driver with multiple senses at the same time 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:04.509
 perceived 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:07.079
 Diseases or physical ailments 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.090
 can limit these skills
