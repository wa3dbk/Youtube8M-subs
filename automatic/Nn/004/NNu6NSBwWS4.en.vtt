 I will attend this series every monday 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.550

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.660
 have sent or in the comments 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.670
 written have the simple compact that 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.560
 I found somewhere you can 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.019
 Definitely every Monday now 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.880
 be happy that will always be 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.980

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.829
 fail every Monday 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.020
 but i really only really want to 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.020
 cool resource packs or texter facts 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.399
 In this series, yes I believe you 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.559
 have understood everything 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.550
 if there is still drive off with it in 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.320
 the comments 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.120
 and then I want to say I start 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.539
 ever with the first texture pack 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.940
 that a really cool texts away more 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.940
 there are after the intro to the same 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.620
 so that is already ingame im 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.530
 start menu and I'll go to the 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.530
 options on the resources we have 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.960
 already the texture pack of the week and 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.480
 the sexy back is called so LÃ¶ffler deep 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.120
 v and I just go in now 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.480
 and then I show what this sexy back 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.150
 Everything can be done in my test field and yes me 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.180
 already ingame and already here 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.040
 all the renovations are the whole 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.050
 I swear I go now in the f1 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.680
 must and now you can do that 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.750
 look at 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.020
 Let's go the diamond swords it 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.150
 really a rather dark texture pack 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.490
 all swords are dark and with so 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.170
 nem with such a color then frame that 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.750
 is really a really cool idea that 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.430
 Right away, we'll hand them over 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.350
 So kept by default 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.870
 The bow is very, very, really 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.170
 nice and we still have the single 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:03.410
 sword instead of black wooden sword gold 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.490
 worth fall us that fms the default 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.190
 is held 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.119
 then go now in this f1 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.980
 mode ran again 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.220
 then we have the fire here already 

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:15.890
 really extreme the colors 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.690
 Change is really cool and fits 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.459
 very good to the texture pack that 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.560
 Inventory I have to be very short now 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.239
 or go now in game mode 0 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.750
 and here we have it already 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:29.450
 the ones shown below and that too 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.000
 inventory here and it is really very 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.540
 very nice 1 on the armor here on 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.360
 player is really mega cool I can tell you 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.880
 again, so to speak, is really very 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.310
 We have never held it very well 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.280
 seen and because that's really like me 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.739
 very good we still have the 2 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.830
 and that was very nice 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.750
 herewith armor parts with this shield 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.239
 here and that too a very nice one 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.930
 plant and then with his songs that 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:03.200
 xp with probes with a peeing 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.000
 x-fi indicator and then we have the in 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.160
 Power in the area that was very much 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.290
 held next and then I show you 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.000
 once again looks like the sword 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.280
 clicking normally go there you can see 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.200
 then already the contour beaten there 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.290
 then the driver is still very much 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.709
 very well 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:24.450
 into the game because me the red and there can 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.400
 You listen to this very beautiful 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.810
 sound as I think 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.840
 I really enjoy playing with the red ok 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.620
 I unfortunately given out is now the 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.909
 was of course must ran again and 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:41.189
 then we come to the bow and 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:43.019
 he also has very nice sounds and also 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:46.049
 I like the animation very much 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.720
 it is not that big but still 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.290
 visible is really very very good 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.030
 Nor does it make it green to red 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.970
 but goes from red to green 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.090
 that is not so often there we have 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.769
 still that makes it very difficult to see 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.650
 then beat the economy 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:08.099
 at the location wooden sword and the gold 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.799
 worth the driver are also very nice 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.540
 edited as I said that fms and then 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.730
 we come already for the second part 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.530
 to the blocks and to the dismantling 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.430
 noises and there I grab this once 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.410
 short here 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.410
 a listen closely when I build grass 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:32.250
 the commission sound is what I think 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:34.229
 And if you have blocks on board it is too 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.039
 a very nice sound so me 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:40.130
 really like the sound very much 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:43.349
 then we can still do that here 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.919
 to look at different items 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:48.990
 not much changed a bit 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.430
 changed one looks at the service 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.840
 become a bit darker 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.300
 in any case, from the color looks 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.090
 also very beautiful and garnished 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.409
 the whole text black very very good 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.810
 We like to come now 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:03.150
 rating so I want to say we see 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.979
 right back to me 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.500
 friends we arrived in the 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:10.800
 rating and the first group is the 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.419
 pvp group and this is about how 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.370
 is the texture pack and I have 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.979
 this for a whole day 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.259
 Tried a lot of pixel games a lot 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:21.030
 a lot of normal level games I have to 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.580
 Really say it is really a very very 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.300
 strong pack and that's why I give nine of 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.900
 ten points are really good 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.300
 I give the swords 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.889
 score four out of five if you get them 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.060
 maybe a little better 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.190
 could have done 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.020
 maybe somehow at the top 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.270
 from the team a bit lighter 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.699
 then a bit darker but otherwise that is 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.460
 bag really very good to those 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:46.660
 secondaries I would say would be 5 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.880
 of 5 points 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.039
 So the floor is really very good 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.830
 Like and also the attack very nice 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:56.620
 that it is the color here too 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:06:00.009
 I do not really like it very much 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:03.699
 very good and that's why there is pvp 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:06.130
 understanding forth from pvp area of 66 9 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:08.440
 of 10 points good now we come 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:12.580
 to look like the texture of the texture pack 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:15.160
 the whole town is actually from the 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.139
 he has kept dark and also the grass 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.190
 and so what is really in a very 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.860
 beautiful sound does not belong to believe that 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:23.110
 even even the ford I have 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:27.099
 not really on now and yes I think 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:29.410
 that's the consequence otherwise the items 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:30.009
 here diors are really very beautiful 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.780
 held 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:34.630
 I really like it very much 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:37.330
 that's why I give 9 out of 10 here 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.280
 really score points with the textile mill 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:42.280
 I liked it very much 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.409
 server or on maps and have played 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:47.800
 yes that's already from this review 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:50.139
 to this text beck to the texture pack of 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.699
 the week number one and I hope that 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:53.440
 whole has fallen 

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:55.720
 if so, then i would like one over 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.729
 rating very much and I want 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.190
 Say, see you in the next video 

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:02.940
 portrait friends until next time 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.940
 and bye
