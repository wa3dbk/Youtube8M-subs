00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.770

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.040

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.620
 The makeup she wears is an outfit. 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.140
 inspired by well- blacked black line 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.570
 of white water and a car that has a 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.570
 Yellow detail description and gold and 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.280
 I produced this in a usable way 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.790
 I hope you do not like my 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.030
 version that even of what I do then 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.030
 continued with me 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.530
 to start with I'll get a pencil 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.149
 and I will apply below the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.130
 eyebrow is a habit well then 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.039
 no people are breaking it is very strong 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.560
 It's stronger than the kiss is that 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:27.560
 toquinho the farm I was with the finger 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.290
 d 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.090
 now the animation will record harry and i will 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.580
 apply throughout the movable eyelid and 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.500
 also blur the concave that shadow is 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.450
 creamy but need not necessarily 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.759
 to be good 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.530
 I'm respecting the drawing of the globe 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.810
 ie eye makeup she is 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.330
 rounded is a pull out 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.750
 I do not do that kitten and respect 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.149
 exactly with my eye tower 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.940
 now takes a yellowish golden shadow 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.580
 in golden yellow I'll apply below 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.500
 of eyebrow leaned on brown people 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.850
 It's scary is this detail but it stays 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.380
 very good that he had not yet 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.050
 I thought of it and I loved it 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.600

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:19.130
 okay and care products to give 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:21.319
 that vanished in Canada marked 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.900
 now I have a brown shadow and the brush 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.459
 movie and I will mark this with the case 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.709
 as the external 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.930
 same scheme of maintaining the environment and 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.930
 rounded to respect the shape of the other 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.730
 I feel that the shuttle 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.220
 circular movements because the shadow 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.610
 she gets the most beautiful 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.610
 form 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.800
 also espionage the children 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.080
 previous is good to focus on 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.700
 wellington and external through the eye 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.980
 More or less, now comes the white pencil. 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.500
 and I'll apply across the waterline 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.980
 apply the sttrans top this way goes 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.980
 last longer 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.070
 now picks up an opaque black shadow and a 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.300
 Brush loose creation and I will 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.720
 apply this black close to the eyelashes 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.060
 lower ben reed're even I apply 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.790
 concentrated the tone of the middle out 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.870
 the other half arrives in the corner 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.220
 Internal I make the finer stroke 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.280
 table 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:41.620
 I 'm going to do that, too. 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:45.010
 to the upper lashes as if it were a 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.180
 outlined is also tank stretch 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.180
 and the conca 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.630
 and neither with him in the inner corner part 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.330
 turkish amount he has to circumvent the 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.220
 pain and with the belief now they 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:07.390
 service in the black shadow I used to 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:10.500
 quit smoking throughout the district to 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.500
 climb cap 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.419
 Here we follow I finished with 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.970
 false eyelashes and so I liked it 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:23.310
 enough and there was the so-called tire 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.169
 accustomed to black and brown 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.389
 only that this yellow detail really 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.680
 It's a lot of difference, there were not any people. 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.050
 You look super young. 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.430
 Who out of the ordinary is worth you? 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:38.400
 now try to speak a little bit of 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.610
 contour of the face her ceiling still counted 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.949
 it's one more lighter thing 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.169
 either by the fish mouth and you will 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.750
 find the attraction of your shows 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:52.590
 that is, production falls below the bone 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.820
 - he arks with the west the club that is 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.759
 my brown can not be red 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.169
 red is going to mark this thing of the 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.550
 I'm filming, I'm in favor of 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.539
 initial listening movement from above 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:07.080
 Work is now well and applied concealer 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:08.880
 on top of the bone I have to meet 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.240
 other to do this joke is not the fall 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.580
 light and shadow of the ossu and 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.009
 skirted shadow to make a side of me 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.300
 I used three products and started applying the 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.300
 red pencil around the outline 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:27.270
 fill out lab with this lapse 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:31.700
 to facilitate the arrival of the button 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.700
 have now normal time button 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.780
 I feel jealousy that I told you told 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:39.810
 in the center of the lake is being a 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.790
 red glow gives the feeling that 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.280
 impression that side is largest 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.560
 on the carts that load angelina jolie 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.450
 cleiton on top of that she already has 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.710
 now my side does not take us there 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.220
 improvement of Malaga has no doubt that 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.560
 This makeup because you were very angry. 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.660

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.280

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:06.300
 he looks like he's from the bank . 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.100
 I always expect a reaction so the 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.320
 elements of woman understand if you do 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.360
 This gets dressed looks beautiful and lipstick 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.310
 red so it gets very 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.890
 suspicious went very jealous between 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.620
 then it's meanness but she's dancing well 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.930
 because I do not usually make movies 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:25.680
 more expensive stating that I do not think 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:27.360
