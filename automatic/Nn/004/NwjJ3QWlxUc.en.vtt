00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
he's gonna separate the tube into two

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.690 
he's gonna separate the tube into two
pieces<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.570> get<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.750> more<00:02:31.050> manageable<00:02:31.440> length

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.850 

he<00:02:35.700> does<00:02:35.880> this<00:02:36.060> by<00:02:36.240> pulling<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.690> point<00:02:36.990> he<00:02:37.590> hits

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
he does this by pulling a point he hits

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.440 
he does this by pulling a point he hits
the<00:02:38.040> glass<00:02:38.190> takes<00:02:38.880> it<00:02:39.030> out<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.300> flame

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
the glass takes it out of the flame

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.870 
the glass takes it out of the flame
that's<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.440> cool<00:02:40.710> for<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:40.980> moment<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.520> then

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
that's it cool for a moment and then

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.550 
that's it cool for a moment and then
pulls<00:02:43.820> now<00:02:44.820> he<00:02:44.880> flame<00:02:45.360> cuts<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.990> separate<00:02:46.440> it

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
pulls now he flame cuts to separate it

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.490 
pulls now he flame cuts to separate it
from<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.830> larger<00:02:47.190> piece<00:02:48.020> now<00:02:49.020> that<00:02:49.170> he's<00:02:49.290> got<00:02:49.470> a

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
from a larger piece now that he's got a

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.650 
from a larger piece now that he's got a
more<00:02:49.740> manageable<00:02:50.160> piece<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:50.730> work<00:02:50.910> with<00:02:51.180> he's

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
more manageable piece to work with he's

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.510 
more manageable piece to work with he's
going<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:51.900> discard<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.590> first<00:02:52.800> point<00:02:53.250> and

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
going to discard the first point and

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.180 
going to discard the first point and
pull<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.180> really<00:02:54.540> sturdy<00:02:54.840> new<00:02:55.170> point<00:02:55.530> he<00:02:56.010> can

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
pull a really sturdy new point he can

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.620 
pull a really sturdy new point he can
see<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:56.460> he<00:02:56.550> heats<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.850> wider<00:02:57.030> section<00:02:57.390> of

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
see that he heats a wider section of

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.420 
see that he heats a wider section of
tubing<00:02:58.050> and<00:02:58.200> he<00:02:58.380> doesn't<00:02:58.650> pull<00:02:58.800> it<00:02:58.890> very<00:02:58.920> far

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
tubing and he doesn't pull it very far

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.550 
tubing and he doesn't pull it very far
it<00:03:00.090> needs<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.390> be<00:03:00.510> nice<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:00.960> strong<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.530> it

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
it needs to be nice and strong so it

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.980 
it needs to be nice and strong so it
doesn't<00:03:01.860> snap<00:03:02.160> while<00:03:02.430> he's<00:03:02.550> working<00:03:02.750> hey<00:03:03.750> who

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
doesn't snap while he's working hey who

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.300 
doesn't snap while he's working hey who
said<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.290> could<00:03:04.440> have<00:03:04.620> fun<00:03:04.890> there's<00:03:05.220> a

serious teaching going on here
it's<00:03:08.670> time<00:03:08.880> to<00:03:09.060> flame<00:03:09.300> cut<00:03:09.570> and<00:03:09.810> burn<00:03:10.110> off<00:03:10.230> the

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
it's time to flame cut and burn off the

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.650 
it's time to flame cut and burn off the
first<00:03:10.650> point<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:12.180> roll<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:12.780> out<00:03:14.540> when<00:03:15.540> you

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
first point and roll it out when you

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.930 
first point and roll it out when you
flame<00:03:15.930> cut<00:03:16.290> you<00:03:16.770> close<00:03:17.010> off<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.550> end<00:03:17.730> of<00:03:17.880> the

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
flame cut you close off the end of the

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.850 
flame cut you close off the end of the
tubing<00:03:18.360> and<00:03:18.540> if<00:03:19.200> you<00:03:19.290> want<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.530> ever<00:03:19.650> be<00:03:19.800> able

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
tubing and if you want to ever be able

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.560 
tubing and if you want to ever be able
to<00:03:19.980> blow<00:03:20.130> into<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.550> you<00:03:20.790> better<00:03:21.030> open<00:03:21.209> it<00:03:21.420> up

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
to blow into it you better open it up

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.059 
to blow into it you better open it up
which<00:03:21.810> is<00:03:21.840> what<00:03:22.050> Shane<00:03:22.350> does<00:03:22.560> now

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.789 

since<00:03:27.849> Shane<00:03:28.150> still<00:03:28.599> has<00:03:28.840> more<00:03:29.200> tubing<00:03:29.650> than

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
since Shane still has more tubing than

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.920 
since Shane still has more tubing than
he<00:03:29.890> needs<00:03:30.129> to<00:03:30.430> make<00:03:30.579> his<00:03:30.730> Finch<00:03:31.090> he's<00:03:31.689> gonna

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
he needs to make his Finch he's gonna

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.800 
he needs to make his Finch he's gonna
pull<00:03:32.260> out<00:03:32.439> a<00:03:32.469> second<00:03:33.069> point<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.640> get<00:03:34.359> just<00:03:34.689> the

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
pull out a second point and get just the

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:42.330 
pull out a second point and get just the
right<00:03:34.840> length<00:03:35.079> of<00:03:35.260> tubing<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.620> work<00:03:35.769> with<00:03:41.340> if

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
right length of tubing to work with if

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.890 
right length of tubing to work with if
you're<00:03:42.579> ever<00:03:42.730> having<00:03:42.909> trouble<00:03:43.480> pulling

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
you're ever having trouble pulling

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.619 
you're ever having trouble pulling
points<00:03:44.560> from<00:03:44.739> soft<00:03:45.099> glass<00:03:45.370> tubing<00:03:45.939> one<00:03:46.420> of<00:03:46.540> the

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629 
points from soft glass tubing one of the

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.660 
points from soft glass tubing one of the
things<00:03:46.840> you<00:03:46.959> probably<00:03:47.290> need<00:03:47.470> to<00:03:47.590> do<00:03:47.769> is<00:03:48.220> to

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
things you probably need to do is to

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.059 
things you probably need to do is to
heat<00:03:48.939> a<00:03:49.150> wider<00:03:49.450> section<00:03:50.170> of<00:03:50.349> tubing<00:03:50.769> before

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
heat a wider section of tubing before

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.220 
heat a wider section of tubing before
you<00:03:51.370> pull<00:03:51.609> and<00:03:51.849> remember<00:03:52.569> to<00:03:52.689> wait<00:03:52.900> a<00:03:52.930> moment

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
you pull and remember to wait a moment

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.710 
you pull and remember to wait a moment
before<00:03:53.680> you<00:03:53.769> pull<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.220> also<00:03:54.849> you<00:03:55.389> want<00:03:55.540> to

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
before you pull and also you want to

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.929 
before you pull and also you want to
remember<00:03:56.200> to<00:03:56.409> rotate<00:03:56.799> the<00:03:57.040> glass<00:03:57.459> all<00:03:57.819> the

00:03:57.929 --> 00:03:57.939 
remember to rotate the glass all the

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:59.490 
remember to rotate the glass all the
time<00:03:58.150> because<00:03:58.299> if<00:03:58.510> you<00:03:58.599> stop<00:03:58.870> rotating<00:03:59.379> the

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
time because if you stop rotating the

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.129 
time because if you stop rotating the
glass<00:03:59.709> then<00:04:00.370> you're<00:04:00.549> gonna<00:04:00.700> end<00:04:01.000> up<00:04:01.329> pulling

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
glass then you're gonna end up pulling

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.099 
glass then you're gonna end up pulling
out<00:04:02.439> flat<00:04:03.040> points<00:04:03.760> and<00:04:04.030> those<00:04:04.569> won't<00:04:04.750> work<00:04:04.870> at

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
out flat points and those won't work at

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:15.760 
out flat points and those won't work at
all

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.110 

okay<00:04:16.670> I<00:04:16.700> pulled<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.180> point<00:04:17.450> now

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
okay I pulled the point now

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.400 
okay I pulled the point now
after<00:04:20.109> I<00:04:20.169> straighten<00:04:20.650> the<00:04:20.709> point<00:04:22.230> I'm<00:04:23.230> going

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
after I straighten the point I'm going

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.310 
after I straighten the point I'm going
to<00:04:23.470> go<00:04:23.590> over<00:04:23.770> there<00:04:23.980> and<00:04:24.280> the<00:04:24.460> color<00:04:24.700> this<00:04:24.940> with

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
to go over there and the color this with

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.730 
to go over there and the color this with
probably<00:04:26.430> three<00:04:27.430> layers<00:04:27.669> of<00:04:28.740> different

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
probably three layers of different

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.100 
probably three layers of different
colors<00:04:30.130> powder<00:04:31.120> so<00:04:31.419> I'm<00:04:31.510> going<00:04:31.660> to<00:04:31.690> be<00:04:31.780> rolling

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.070 
it into powders and then I'm going to
take<00:04:36.220> a<00:04:36.250> rod<00:04:36.520> and<00:04:36.910> stripe<00:04:37.330> it<00:04:37.510> right<00:04:37.720> down<00:04:37.900> the
