store all the elements however figuring
out<00:00:19.340> how<00:00:19.520> to<00:00:19.580> do<00:00:19.760> it<00:00:19.880> might<00:00:20.090> be<00:00:20.270> a<00:00:20.300> little<00:00:20.480> bit

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
out how to do it might be a little bit

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.470

some<00:00:41.510> of<00:00:41.629> the<00:00:41.750> elements<00:00:42.110> so<00:00:42.409> that<00:00:42.620> we<00:00:42.739> could

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
some of the elements so that we could

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.320 
some of the elements so that we could
avoid<00:00:43.159> any<00:00:44.000> unnecessary<00:00:44.479> hassle<00:00:45.110> here

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
avoid any unnecessary hassle here

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.079 
avoid any unnecessary hassle here
okay<00:00:47.330> so<00:00:48.170> here's<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:48.920> Train<00:00:49.129> all<00:00:49.369> its<00:00:49.549> glory<00:00:49.790> I

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
almost all game elements will find the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.710 
almost all game elements will find the
place<00:00:56.690> there<00:00:57.159> but<00:00:58.159> from<00:00:58.400> some<00:00:58.879> that<00:00:59.570> would

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
place there but from some that would

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.609 
place there but from some that would
have<00:00:59.930> to<00:01:00.080> go<00:01:00.110> in<00:01:00.500> plastic<00:01:01.040> bags<00:01:01.420> like<00:01:02.470> this<00:01:03.470> one
