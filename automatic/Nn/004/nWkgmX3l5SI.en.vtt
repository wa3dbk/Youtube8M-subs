yeah<00:01:33.409> just<00:01:33.830> just<00:01:33.890> to<00:01:34.310> clarify<00:01:34.460> we<00:01:34.880> are<00:01:34.940> not

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
yeah just just to clarify we are not

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.120 
yeah just just to clarify we are not
like<00:01:35.450> unappreciative<00:01:36.320> for<00:01:36.530> this<00:01:36.650> it<00:01:36.830> was<00:01:36.950> just

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
like unappreciative for this it was just

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.550 
like unappreciative for this it was just
surprising<00:01:37.280> because<00:01:38.000> we<00:01:38.420> didn't<00:01:38.930> order<00:01:39.229> this

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
surprising because we didn't order this

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.680 
surprising because we didn't order this
and<00:01:40.340> it<00:01:40.520> looked<00:01:40.729> like<00:01:40.909> something<00:01:41.150> off<00:01:41.420> of<00:01:41.450> it

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
and it looked like something off of it

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.300 
and it looked like something off of it
so<00:01:42.229> somebody<00:01:42.530> must<00:01:42.590> have<00:01:42.799> just<00:01:42.979> put<00:01:43.159> my

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
so somebody must have just put my

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.289 
so somebody must have just put my
address<00:01:43.670> in<00:01:44.090> it<00:01:44.350> so<00:01:45.350> did<00:01:46.220> somebody<00:01:46.820> get<00:01:47.090> this

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299
