00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.580 
been working on a project for a platform
and<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:57.899> just<00:00:58.109> spray<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.350> stuff<00:00:58.500> on

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.240 

get<00:01:04.129> a<00:01:04.160> nice<00:01:04.309> good<00:01:04.489> coverage<00:01:05.800> use<00:01:06.800> the<00:01:06.950> brush

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
get a nice good coverage use the brush

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.450 
get a nice good coverage use the brush
and<00:01:08.500> brush<00:01:09.500> it<00:01:09.680> a<00:01:09.740> bit<00:01:09.920> now<00:01:09.950> that<00:01:10.070> you'll<00:01:10.280> see

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
and brush it a bit now that you'll see

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.250 
and brush it a bit now that you'll see
the<00:01:10.550> paint<00:01:10.760> paper<00:01:11.300> will<00:01:11.510> crow<00:01:11.750> a<00:01:11.840> little<00:01:12.140> when

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
the paint paper will crow a little when

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.700 
the paint paper will crow a little when
you<00:01:12.350> do<00:01:12.500> this<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:14.260> usually<00:01:15.260> it's<00:01:15.380> better<00:01:15.560> if

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
you do this and usually it's better if

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.190 
you do this and usually it's better if
you<00:01:15.770> do<00:01:15.920> two<00:01:16.820> hands<00:01:17.120> but<00:01:17.420> kind<00:01:17.720> of<00:01:17.750> sucks<00:01:18.020> we

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
you do two hands but kind of sucks we

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.010 
you do two hands but kind of sucks we
only<00:01:18.350> do<00:01:18.530> one

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.990 

Spray<00:01:26.020> it's<00:01:26.170> more<00:01:26.440> lunker<00:01:27.280> love<00:01:27.490> it

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.840 

now<00:01:32.510> you<00:01:32.570> can<00:01:32.810> potentially<00:01:33.650> use<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:34.070> slightly

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
now you can potentially use a slightly

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.930 
now you can potentially use a slightly
darker<00:01:35.360> grounds<00:01:35.690> of<00:01:35.780> coffee<00:01:35.990> and<00:01:36.730> put<00:01:37.730> those

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
darker grounds of coffee and put those

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.100 
darker grounds of coffee and put those
on<00:01:38.180> certain<00:01:38.870> areas<00:01:39.020> those<00:01:39.950> would<00:01:40.900> cause<00:01:41.900> those

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
on certain areas those would cause those

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.890 
on certain areas those would cause those
areas<00:01:42.530> to<00:01:42.650> be<00:01:42.710> darker<00:01:43.130> than<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.430> rest

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.670 

sometimes<00:01:48.770> you<00:01:48.920> can<00:01:49.040> do<00:01:49.130> secondary<00:01:49.640> coats

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
sometimes you can do secondary coats

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.100 
sometimes you can do secondary coats
usually<00:01:51.680> usually<00:01:52.610> if<00:01:53.150> I'm<00:01:53.300> crying<00:01:53.600> for<00:01:53.810> a<00:01:53.870> coat

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
usually usually if I'm crying for a coat

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.530 
usually usually if I'm crying for a coat
to<00:01:54.290> do<00:01:54.440> this<00:01:54.760> after<00:01:55.760> off<00:01:58.030> doing<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.090> edges

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
to do this after off doing the edges

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.590 
to do this after off doing the edges
first<00:01:59.840> if<00:02:00.650> that's<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.100> case<00:02:01.300> I'll<00:02:02.300> go<00:02:02.450> around

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
first if that's the case I'll go around

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.609 
first if that's the case I'll go around
the<00:02:02.810> edges<00:02:03.110> and<00:02:03.260> do<00:02:03.380> it

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.770 

and<00:02:06.130> then<00:02:06.280> when<00:02:06.460> I<00:02:06.490> come<00:02:06.700> back

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
and then when I come back

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.719 
and then when I come back
I'll<00:02:09.260> kind<00:02:09.410> of<00:02:09.500> try<00:02:09.740> blending<00:02:10.040> the<00:02:10.340> edges<00:02:10.430> in

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
I'll kind of try blending the edges in

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.190 
I'll kind of try blending the edges in
with<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:10.940> rest<00:02:11.120> of<00:02:11.300> it

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.620 

so<00:02:15.740> now<00:02:15.920> I<00:02:15.950> mean<00:02:16.370> this<00:02:16.490> is<00:02:16.670> basically<00:02:16.850> where<00:02:17.600> I

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
so now I mean this is basically where I

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.400 
so now I mean this is basically where I
wanted<00:02:17.960> to<00:02:18.050> be<00:02:18.110> I<00:02:18.970> could<00:02:19.970> potentially<00:02:20.510> go<00:02:21.050> and

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
wanted to be I could potentially go and

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.880 
wanted to be I could potentially go and
try<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.620> match<00:02:21.860> how<00:02:22.370> actually<00:02:22.819> look<00:02:23.000> in<00:02:23.330> game

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
try to match how actually look in game

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.830 
try to match how actually look in game
but<00:02:24.890> this<00:02:25.160> is<00:02:25.340> pretty<00:02:25.550> close<00:02:25.790> ten<00:02:26.270> nights<00:02:26.510> cold

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
but this is pretty close ten nights cold

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.340 
but this is pretty close ten nights cold
in<00:02:27.050> there<00:02:27.260> or<00:02:27.560> already<00:02:28.220> pre<00:02:28.430> folded<00:02:28.819> paper<00:02:29.420> and

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.650

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
a little bit a little bit of a barrier

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.110 
a little bit a little bit of a barrier
because<00:03:18.710> you<00:03:18.770> have<00:03:18.890> to<00:03:18.980> do<00:03:19.130> all<00:03:19.550> the<00:03:19.760> work<00:03:19.910> on

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
because you have to do all the work on

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.030 
because you have to do all the work on
these<00:03:20.210> bar<00:03:20.480> hands<00:03:20.780> then<00:03:21.110> you<00:03:21.170> go<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.350> a<00:03:21.590> gym<00:03:21.650> and

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
these bar hands then you go to a gym and

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.370 
these bar hands then you go to a gym and
you<00:03:22.250> let<00:03:22.520> them<00:03:22.610> dry<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:23.030> put<00:03:23.180> them<00:03:23.330> in<00:03:23.390> but<00:03:24.170> so

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
you let them dry and put them in but so

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.990 
you let them dry and put them in but so
once<00:03:24.710> this<00:03:24.860> is<00:03:24.920> done<00:03:25.160> I<00:03:25.220> will<00:03:25.490> go<00:03:25.580> in<00:03:25.700> there<00:03:25.820> too

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
once this is done I will go in there too

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.270 
once this is done I will go in there too
