 relatively big dog when I finally mine 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.450

 I apologize to the woman 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.830
 It costs five euros for the food so that goes 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.080
 still but since my grandma tighten the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.400
 same old inhabit I see them 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.320
 almost always when I go to my grandma's 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.340

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.479
 really angry at you is the embarrassing 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.670
 when I read the story 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.040
 I had to smile that believes you 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.840
 not because I think it's so funny 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.890
 again his grandma Langete somewhere laos 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.780
 No idea about anyone's land 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.030
 rottweiler or bus accident band 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.490
 is overturned and then you want that way 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.350
 to help his own grandma on the dog 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.149

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.759
 you realize that is not even the first time

 own grandma is it I imagine that 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.270
 really embarrassing was the format 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.890
 is also called embarrassing stories of 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.540
 therefore it is no wonder 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.920

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.579
 history then we hear make in 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.470
 Next story continues the next one 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.140
 story is from the dear leoni with 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.060
 germain it is the Parents' Day in 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.100
 to have our school and my girlfriend 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.560
 waffles sold i hold the waffles 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.300
 and my girlfriend had the coffee 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.640
 against thousands of greeks in my class where 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.350
 a parents talk bar and have mine 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.550
 offered teacher weapons and I mean 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.060
 after all, waffles are not said 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.950
 No 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.630
 and suddenly the whole thing falls to me 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.760
 tray with the weapons and the money 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.310
 down powdered sugar on the floor 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.930
 weapons on the floor money on the floor 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.600
 the things fell off me and 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.340
 the parents parents my girlfriend and 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.230
 my teacher got me out of sheet and 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.730
 that was adjusted to make up 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.900
 So I am very good at it myself 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.680
 Imagine that as sure as much 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.080
 was embarrassing 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.000
 where I have to say I think so 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.740
 find it a degree embarrassing if the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.670
 parents did not laugh at the teacher 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.590
 but if that's so embarrassing 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.910
 be offered silence because I know 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.770
 that to water and myself because 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.880
 I think that I also find so much 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.400
 Embarrassing for example in matters 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.959
 fall down or so if they are unfavorable 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.280
 is and then it actually is already 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.510
 a bit uncomfortable 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.550
 and if that happens then 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.870
 so waffle money falls to the ground and 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.459
 if then clarify and the 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.760
 Parents would have been right 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.830
 and so you know what I mean sum 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.480
 come help her when picking it up 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.650
 if that's such an atmosphere then 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.420
 Personally, I think that's what I think 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.160
 crudest embarrassing possible videos avi 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.630
 come to this story thank you leonie 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.280
 and I am sorry what we have there 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.590
 school happened okay the next 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.850
 story is from dear yes he is well 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.150
 even that parents also after the 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.560
 story good christmas party 2012 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.390
 our chef all to eat and 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.459
 cozy sitting together 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.930
 invited home after dinner 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.540
 I just wanted to get the dealers off 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.489
 wash then gästeklo law was gone 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.440
 me in the first floor in the bathroom 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.330
 We almost looked on 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.880
 I was one of my colleagues 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.710
 probably took a lot of dancing 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.930
 to let 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.980
 I went to the window on tilt 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.780
 and how fast your hands washed 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.710
 I really was not thinking high 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.510
 bear 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.490
 as I can go down the stairs like 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.260
 My boss first, I thought to myself 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.490
 nothing here but later at the table 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.740
 and god oh god and then but then 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.720
 played at the table and god who thinks 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.790
 that I was that, somehow I had that 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.420
 Feeling that always looks somehow 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.190
 funny 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.450
 I could not do that on hers 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.710
 we have been at least as easy 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.350
 I can much their well 

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.880
 Imagine what that means, I think so 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.410
 That would not have checked at the table 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.340
 came to meet in the moment before me 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.960
 if I but probably two 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.880
 seconds after the moment you where 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.950
 understand where god is going now 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.240
 this bathroom was totally wrong 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.740
 is and will think I have been that 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.240
 that must be really blatant before 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.770
 Everything for people who do not know quite 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.330
 how bad that can be with us 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.010
 game gabs times someone I do not know 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.540
 but it was then incredible power 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.610
 shit and we had had it 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.710
 our our funds or space was in such 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.470
 a land where the toilets were and it 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.270
 has stunk so abnormally beastly 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.580
 you can not imagine it 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.930
 In any case, I can do so very much 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.880
 Good to understand that is here 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.710
 I was certainly not uncomfortable 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.490
 can not understand and give 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.810
 a concern 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.100
 I would like to give you one now 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.450
 I'll read that story now 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.220
 also show down here 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.930
 thus you ever thus what I 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.120
 I always get to do it when I see you 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.800
 to read stories that are 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.670
 partly really terrible written 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.140
 so watch out 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.700
 this guy has written the following 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.960
 At least if I think so 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.900
 really now always here right now 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.870
 mister jonas I had once 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:27.410
 an embarrassing story in school 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:32.030
 I had a big time also the toilet 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:34.100
 then was I wash I wash there was 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.630
 I was there and did my business 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.990
 have done my business 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:41.870
 then two children came and heard 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.110
 that and that were 2 on my yes 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.770
 probably great 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:50.160
 Ulrich mug again as I am again 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:54.840
 they could have come in the class 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:57.810
 All Laughed and that is embarrassing that so 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.670
 it all go see the young age the 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.810
 what I temporarily put it where it 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.580
 I will read to you stories 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.630
 want and worse than this 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.010
 spelling mistakes is really such a 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.110
 verkorkster Satzbau if you do not 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.360
 points and no compass is installed and 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.490
 just advertise wild adjectives and now 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.020
 kind of good he's throwing like he's right now 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.250
 I relish finds bad of a 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.780
 or another job is back 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.430
 namely, shows quite well here and 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.720
 would be written as what two 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.950
 or one should be committed 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.750
 you actually know but im okay 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.010
 internet you have to pay attention but 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.420
 if we want to write the story 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.060
 which should be read and that 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.830
 Such texts write that is that is 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.170
 Almost selfish 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.510
 because that can translate otherwise 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.920
 sometimes it does not last but it is too 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.660
 that is also very funny sometimes 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.460
 I have to admit sometimes you have yes 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.590
 itself good I still have one 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.960
 story for you and that you the 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.970
 history of max this time especially 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.740
 Overweight I have to say that I have 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:50.190
 I did not understand this very funny 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:53.310
 I read before max is writing is 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.360
 mega embarrassing hello jonas with h &amp; s sz 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.380
 I could not quite describe that 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.450
 whole topic does not matter 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.130
 hello jonas my name is wax and me 

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.570
 I am the most embarrassing person in the world 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.760
 because of this story 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.600
 Today I asked my friend if 

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.640
 he is small 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.040
 but his mother had heard that and 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.410
 I'm on the business 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.360
 why did she kick you out then 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.290
 But his father came and has his mother 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.390
 in a fix 

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:17.070
 then I came and got his father and 

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.780
 do not throw in front of anyone because 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.640
 I want to be and in that 

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.860
 moment came a friend and said take 

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:27.630
 or I'll throw you out for that 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:29.600
 so embarrassed this history makes something 

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:32.390
 from no sense 

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.220
 ok max also with me I thank you for 

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:36.510
 this contribution 

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.860
 no idea what he should maybe 

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.300
 you understand the story so necessarily 

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:41.040

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.840

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.100
 Experienced then explained to me the whole thing 

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.330
 like times below in the comments because 

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.800
 I did not understand it 

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.200
 Nevertheless , I hope I hope the whole video 

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.750
 Did you like if yes 

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.950

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.600
 dearest even on the pin board can 

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.850
 its me but also private and times 

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.410
 on facebook not by e-mail and also 

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:02.330
 not on youtube I do not track 

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:05.750

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:06.620
 People wanted what I wanted 

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:09.080

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:12.370
