00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.870
 fichaux pnj to this animation is pretty much 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:13.969
 nearly all of wiggles one nation under 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.969
 cover of them in one hour 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.860
 ok so here I think I found 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.730
 excuse me forgive it's a stand 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.240
 angie here super bad I found one 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.240
 pleasure with pleasure way 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.110
 so we have to do a service and we see 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.240
 the speed at which the virtual ball 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.420
 by and the energy that is released in this 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.420
 movement 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.130
 ah I place musketeers ago 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.180
 not really a distinctive sign but I 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.060
 think I found the second 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.230
 angie animation that's it's the 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.930
 ankle and bees so this is the 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:11.250
 second so I managed to find 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.570
 philippe peyrat who is boss the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.160
 mjid foundation we were expected to go to us 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.290
 explain the bee chimney that I 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.030
 will find me here so we welcome 4 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.950
 to 1000 new visitors to roland 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.930
 garros the visitors behind us you 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.640
 have a fireplace with four thousand 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.530
 bees in a work of art that 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.940
 is called grow the sky 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.259
 it was created by the political party 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.580
 we accompany in seine-saint-denis 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.580
 to pollinate cities 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.780
 so my information was justified 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.170
 so know that here the third animation 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.149
 it's the second life exhibition so we 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.200
 will go back to try to understand a 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.409
 little what it is because these cost 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.549
 of the mission is to understand then 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.159
 angie is a development partner 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.179
 durable roland garros of the tournament so 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.069
 it's quite logical for us to 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.569
 sponsor the second life exhibition that 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:59.270
 is an exhibition that presents 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:01.460
 works of art that offers a second life 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:06.020
 hence the name of exposure to material 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.670
 sportsman or is then to find the 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.780
 4th animations I made a phone call 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.280
 to a knowledgeable source 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.209
 I understand that it was here 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.130
 goes robots or virtual reality 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.000
 really showed up at the news 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.130
 generations who has news 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.180
 technologies that angie it's not 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.620
 only gas but also 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.799
 new technologies and help people 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.799
 daily 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:32.590
 ok that to the accomplished mission as well as to 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.590
 ten o'clock victor holocaust to date
