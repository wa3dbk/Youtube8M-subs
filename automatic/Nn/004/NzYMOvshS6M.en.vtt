00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
guess but it's it's touchy you know if

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.950 
guess but it's it's touchy you know if
it's<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.069> little<00:01:29.310> too<00:01:29.490> dry<00:01:29.819> a<00:01:29.850> little<00:01:30.479> too<00:01:30.659> cold

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
it's a little too dry a little too cold

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.910 
it's a little too dry a little too cold
last<00:01:31.499> year<00:01:31.859> it<00:01:32.039> was<00:01:32.219> a<00:01:32.249> way<00:01:32.490> too<00:01:32.549> hot<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.920> this

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
last year it was a way too hot and this

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.069 
last year it was a way too hot and this
year<00:01:35.219> I<00:01:35.490> think<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.880> shaping<00:01:36.119> up<00:01:36.299> real<00:01:36.810> good

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
year I think is shaping up real good

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.719 
year I think is shaping up real good
because<00:01:37.350> we've<00:01:37.710> had<00:01:37.859> a<00:01:37.889> lot<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.159> snow<00:01:38.429> and<00:01:38.460> a

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
because we've had a lot of snow and a

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.440 
because we've had a lot of snow and a
lot<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.909> rain<00:01:39.179> and<00:01:39.479> that's<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.899> real<00:01:40.139> important

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
lot of rain and that's a real important

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.999 
lot of rain and that's a real important
factor<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.630> finding<00:01:43.020> mushrooms<00:01:43.439> well<00:01:43.770> for

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
factor in finding mushrooms well for

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.760 
factor in finding mushrooms well for
people<00:01:44.130> who<00:01:44.369> may<00:01:44.549> not<00:01:44.700> know<00:01:45.079> what<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.350> morel
