00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.050

 it's not going to help you anything, leave the pride 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.100
 because if I see that there is a moment of 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.960
 le boulou is how proud you become 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.220
 proud and this affects you a lot with the 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.350
 couple and you know very well that a 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.059
 Sometimes you say things that I should not say and 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.439
 there was a situation of discussions with 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.439
 a person that is affecting you 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.729
 because after he says things how 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.640
 then and you have that feeling has 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.130
 that feeling the time everything is going 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.409
 to tell the truth time justice 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.060
 of God look never fail alomar had 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.470
 curious facts in your life with people 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.740

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.920
 I'm telling you today because I eat 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.750
 my grandmother used to say sometimes does not feel that way 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.979

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.539
 corpses or enemy what do you mean 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.740
 what we're going to see maybe the 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.450
 circumstance of those people who for 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.490
 a moment they hurt themselves they're going to 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.350
 ask for help hopefully that's the way it is because 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.670
 you are going to realize that you are a person 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.100
 noble and because you have a good heart 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.420
