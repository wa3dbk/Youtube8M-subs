00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
of trouble mixing the color in cuz you

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.590 
of trouble mixing the color in cuz you
can<00:01:39.640> kind<00:01:39.820> of<00:01:39.880> see<00:01:40.030> I<00:01:40.060> got<00:01:40.299> it<00:01:40.390> make<00:01:40.509> this

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
can kind of see I got it make this

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.120 
can kind of see I got it make this
pretty<00:01:40.899> well<00:01:41.020> but<00:01:41.200> there<00:01:41.680> might<00:01:41.830> be<00:01:41.860> a<00:01:41.979> little

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
pretty well but there might be a little

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.149 
pretty well but there might be a little
bit<00:01:42.280> of<00:01:42.369> color<00:01:42.549> strip<00:01:42.939> enos<00:01:43.240> in<00:01:43.390> there<00:01:43.540> and<00:01:44.290> to

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
bit of color strip enos in there and to

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.319 
bit of color strip enos in there and to
make<00:01:45.250> it<00:01:45.310> easier<00:01:45.909> to<00:01:46.680> mix<00:01:47.680> that<00:01:48.060> what<00:01:49.060> you<00:01:49.149> can

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
make it easier to mix that what you can

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:51.660 
make it easier to mix that what you can
do<00:01:49.479> is<00:01:49.720> add<00:01:50.049> a<00:01:50.350> little<00:01:50.380> tiny<00:01:51.039> amount<00:01:51.430> of<00:01:51.520> your

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
do is add a little tiny amount of your

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.919 
do is add a little tiny amount of your
rubbing<00:01:51.850> alcohol<00:01:51.939> I<00:01:52.270> don't<00:01:52.450> want<00:01:52.570> to<00:01:52.630> do<00:01:52.720> too

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
rubbing alcohol I don't want to do too

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.679 
rubbing alcohol I don't want to do too
much<00:01:53.189> just<00:01:54.189> because<00:01:54.429> then<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:55.210> makes<00:01:55.330> it<00:01:55.539> hard

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
much just because then it makes it hard

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.359 
much just because then it makes it hard
to<00:01:55.750> work<00:01:55.869> with<00:01:56.080> but<00:01:56.590> this<00:01:56.799> will<00:01:56.979> make<00:01:57.070> it<00:01:57.250> like

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
to work with but this will make it like

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.310 
to work with but this will make it like
paste<00:01:57.729> and<00:01:58.570> it<00:01:58.689> makes<00:01:58.899> it<00:01:59.020> easier<00:01:59.289> to

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
paste and it makes it easier to

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.320 
paste and it makes it easier to
