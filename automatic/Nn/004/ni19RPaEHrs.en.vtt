let's get another unit of packed cells

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.460 
let's get another unit of packed cells
they're<00:07:25.240> doing<00:07:25.420> quickly<00:07:25.810> please<00:07:26.110> I'm<00:07:26.260> seeing

the<00:07:30.280> heart<00:07:30.550> lots<00:07:31.510> more<00:07:31.600> PVCs

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:32.500 
the heart lots more PVCs

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.160 
the heart lots more PVCs
okay<00:07:33.250> let's<00:07:33.790> ease<00:07:33.940> out<00:07:34.090> for<00:07:34.270> a<00:07:34.330> second<00:07:34.690> let<00:07:35.080> his

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:35.170 
okay let's ease out for a second let his
