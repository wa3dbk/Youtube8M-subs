00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
the image but that is the least of the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.830 
the image but that is the least of the
worries<00:00:47.129> with<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.789> image<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.450> with<00:00:48.660> all<00:00:48.780> that

worries with this image so with all that
being<00:00:48.989> said<00:00:49.200> I'm<00:00:49.530> gonna<00:00:49.620> point<00:00:49.890> out<00:00:50.010> what

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
being said I'm gonna point out what

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.250 
being said I'm gonna point out what
exactly<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.420> real<00:00:51.600> problem<00:00:52.079> with<00:00:52.199> this

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
exactly is the real problem with this

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.340 
exactly is the real problem with this
image<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.829> what<00:00:53.309> makes<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.699> 100%<00:00:54.390> fake<00:00:55.050> now

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
image and what makes it 100% fake now

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.990 
image and what makes it 100% fake now
like<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.590> said<00:00:55.620> at<00:00:55.949> first<00:00:56.190> glance<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.730> looks

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
like I said at first glance it looks

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.209 
like I said at first glance it looks
very<00:00:57.090> realistic<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.050> any<00:00:58.230> Photoshop<00:00:58.949> user

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
very realistic and any Photoshop user

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.189 
very realistic and any Photoshop user
that<00:00:59.399> has<00:00:59.460> some<00:00:59.910> knowledge<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.780> program

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
that has some knowledge of the program

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.080 
that has some knowledge of the program
can<00:01:01.590> make<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:01.949> look<00:01:02.219> as<00:01:02.430> plausible<00:01:02.760> as

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
can make this look as plausible as

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.729 
can make this look as plausible as
possible<00:01:03.629> now<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.960> left<00:01:04.199> side<00:01:04.379> looks<00:01:04.650> a

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
possible now the left side looks a

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.109 
possible now the left side looks a
hundred<00:01:05.010> percent<00:01:05.129> legit<00:01:05.640> there's<00:01:05.790> nothing

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
hundred percent legit there's nothing

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.730 
hundred percent legit there's nothing
really<00:01:06.360> wrong<00:01:06.479> with<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.990> but<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.530> things

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
really wrong with that but the things

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.109 
really wrong with that but the things
that<00:01:07.890> I'm<00:01:07.979> going<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.130> point<00:01:08.369> out<00:01:08.520> are<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
that I'm going to point out are on the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.880 
that I'm going to point out are on the
right<00:01:09.420> side<00:01:09.450> now<00:01:10.140> I'm<00:01:10.320> not<00:01:10.470> even<00:01:10.619> gonna<00:01:10.710> go
