00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.830 
London is not all about bicycles
it's<00:01:58.680> about<00:01:58.980> cars<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.820> about<00:02:00.030> pedestrians<00:02:00.540> is

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
it's about cars is about pedestrians is

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.270 
it's about cars is about pedestrians is
about<00:02:01.080> sharing<00:02:01.440> the<00:02:01.530> road<00:02:01.710> with<00:02:01.740> other<00:02:02.010> users

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
about sharing the road with other users

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.070 
about sharing the road with other users
so<00:02:02.610> it's<00:02:02.880> great<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> car<00:02:03.570> brand<00:02:03.780> has<00:02:03.930> got

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
so it's great that a car brand has got

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.650
