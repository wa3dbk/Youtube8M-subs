00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
no hammer required okay let's use a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.330 
no hammer required okay let's use a
couple<00:00:38.160> those<00:00:38.399> pads<00:00:38.760> there<00:00:39.120> yeah<00:00:39.329> oh<00:00:39.540> yeah

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
couple those pads there yeah oh yeah

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:49.040 
couple those pads there yeah oh yeah
so<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.489> don't

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:01:06.180 

and<00:00:50.050> started<00:00:50.740> yeah<00:00:51.130> yeah<00:00:51.370> starting<00:01:05.190> let's

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
and started yeah yeah starting let's

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.000 
and started yeah yeah starting let's
give<00:01:06.580> it<00:01:06.610> a<00:01:06.670> little<00:01:06.790> test<00:01:07.030> way<00:01:07.270> all<00:01:07.450> right<00:01:08.010> one

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
give it a little test way all right one

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.680 
give it a little test way all right one
of<00:01:09.070> the<00:01:09.130> best<00:01:09.370> ways<00:01:09.640> you<00:01:09.670> probably<00:01:10.270> know<00:01:10.450> is

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
of the best ways you probably know is

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.390 
of the best ways you probably know is
the<00:01:10.810> measure<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.260> diagonals<00:01:11.830> make<00:01:12.100> sure<00:01:12.250> they

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
the measure the diagonals make sure they

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.840 
the measure the diagonals make sure they
agree

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
agree

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.270 
agree
let's<00:01:13.780> hit<00:01:13.930> about<00:01:14.140> forty<00:01:14.500> seven<00:01:14.860> and<00:01:15.010> three

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
let's hit about forty seven and three

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.830 
let's hit about forty seven and three
three<00:01:15.729> eight<00:01:15.760> sixteenths<00:01:16.420> yeah<00:01:18.600> yeah<00:01:19.600> if<00:01:19.690> the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
three eight sixteenths yeah yeah if the

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.499 
three eight sixteenths yeah yeah if the
diagonals<00:01:20.380> are<00:01:20.530> the<00:01:20.680> same<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.820> wins<00:01:22.030> were

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
diagonals are the same the wins were

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.540 
diagonals are the same the wins were
then<00:01:22.869> about<00:01:23.170> a<00:01:23.200> thirty<00:01:23.560> second<00:01:24.100> I<00:01:24.160> can<00:01:24.340> live

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
then about a thirty second I can live

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.700 
then about a thirty second I can live
with<00:01:24.700> a<00:01:24.790> I'm<00:01:25.000> not<00:01:25.210> gonna<00:01:25.360> fight<00:01:25.600> about<00:01:25.810> that<00:01:25.960> no

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.280 

that's<00:01:29.710> good<00:01:30.130> yeah<00:01:30.640> that's<00:01:31.180> fine<00:01:31.479> we're

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
that's good yeah that's fine we're

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.800 
that's good yeah that's fine we're
square<00:01:32.700> am<00:01:33.700> I<00:01:33.759> happy<00:01:34.000> with<00:01:34.270> that<00:01:34.390> I<00:01:34.450> think<00:01:34.600> I'll

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
square am I happy with that I think I'll

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.620 
square am I happy with that I think I'll
let<00:01:34.899> it<00:01:34.960> sit<00:01:35.850> really<00:01:36.850> not<00:01:36.970> much<00:01:37.119> more<00:01:37.180> we<00:01:37.420> can

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
let it sit really not much more we can

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.880 
let it sit really not much more we can
do<00:01:37.750> with<00:01:37.780> it<00:01:37.960> we've<00:01:38.080> got<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.229> little<00:01:38.500> bit<00:01:38.710> of

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
do with it we've got a little bit of

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.830 
do with it we've got a little bit of
sanding<00:01:39.280> and<00:01:39.399> touch-up<00:01:39.790> to<00:01:39.910> do<00:01:40.060> with<00:01:40.210> some<00:01:40.780> of

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
sanding and touch-up to do with some of

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.480 
sanding and touch-up to do with some of
these<00:01:40.930> aren't<00:01:41.140> lined<00:01:41.380> up<00:01:41.530> just<00:01:41.560> perfectly<00:01:42.250> but

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
these aren't lined up just perfectly but

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.740 
these aren't lined up just perfectly but
you<00:01:42.610> know<00:01:42.729> they're<00:01:42.940> very<00:01:43.210> close

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
you know they're very close

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.420 
you know they're very close
breathing<00:01:44.080> well<00:01:44.530> from<00:01:44.740> here<00:01:44.950> I<00:01:45.009> guess<00:01:45.190> we<00:01:45.340> had

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
breathing well from here I guess we had

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.310 
breathing well from here I guess we had
a<00:01:45.460> certain<00:01:45.910> map<00:01:46.119> an<00:01:46.270> ER<00:01:46.360> strategy<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:46.960> cut<00:01:47.140> the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
a certain map an ER strategy to cut the

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.960 
a certain map an ER strategy to cut the
sheet<00:01:47.590> stock<00:01:47.860> don't<00:01:48.130> you<00:01:48.250> suppose<00:01:48.550> well

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
sheet stock don't you suppose well

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.520 
sheet stock don't you suppose well
before<00:01:49.390> we<00:01:49.509> get<00:01:49.630> into<00:01:49.840> that<00:01:49.960> I<00:01:50.020> was<00:01:50.259> interested

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
before we get into that I was interested

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.830 
before we get into that I was interested
in<00:01:50.830> pointing<00:01:51.549> out<00:01:51.700> to<00:01:51.970> some<00:01:52.180> of<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.390> members

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
in pointing out to some of the members

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.020 
in pointing out to some of the members
that<00:01:52.870> there<00:01:53.860> are<00:01:53.950> alternative<00:01:54.520> joints<00:01:54.909> it

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
that there are alternative joints it

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.539 
that there are alternative joints it
could<00:01:55.180> be<00:01:55.299> used<00:01:55.540> here<00:01:55.870> Yeah<00:01:56.320> right<00:01:56.350> I<00:01:56.950> myself

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
could be used here Yeah right I myself

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.280 
could be used here Yeah right I myself
I'm<00:01:57.940> really<00:01:58.240> a<00:01:58.270> fan<00:01:58.540> of<00:01:58.570> mortise<00:01:58.960> and<00:01:59.049> tenon

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
I'm really a fan of mortise and tenon

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.899 
I'm really a fan of mortise and tenon
because<00:01:59.500> many<00:01:59.740> times<00:02:00.040> I<00:02:00.220> won't<00:02:00.400> work<00:02:00.700> with

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
because many times I won't work with

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.580 
because many times I won't work with
wide<00:02:01.150> rail<00:02:01.479> stock<00:02:01.810> like<00:02:02.140> this<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.530> the

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
wide rail stock like this and the

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.750 
wide rail stock like this and the
mortise<00:02:02.860> and<00:02:02.979> tenon<00:02:03.280> of<00:02:03.369> course<00:02:03.610> is

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
mortise and tenon of course is

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.460 
mortise and tenon of course is
infinitely<00:02:04.210> variable<00:02:04.600> you<00:02:04.960> can<00:02:05.110> make<00:02:05.229> it<00:02:05.350> any

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
infinitely variable you can make it any

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.109 
infinitely variable you can make it any
size<00:02:05.560> you<00:02:05.950> want<00:02:06.130> regardless<00:02:06.310> of<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:06.940> weight

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
size you want regardless of the weight

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.419 
size you want regardless of the weight
of<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.360> rails<00:02:07.570> bigger<00:02:08.019> or<00:02:08.260> smaller<00:02:08.500> plus<00:02:09.280> you

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
of the rails bigger or smaller plus you

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.740 
of the rails bigger or smaller plus you
have<00:02:09.519> that<00:02:09.670> face<00:02:09.850> grain<00:02:10.179> two-phase<00:02:10.479> grain

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
have that face grain two-phase grain

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.449 
have that face grain two-phase grain
gluing<00:02:11.140> which<00:02:11.320> is<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.500> stronger<00:02:11.830> glue<00:02:12.160> joint

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
gluing which is a stronger glue joint

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.430 
gluing which is a stronger glue joint
yeah<00:02:12.790> you<00:02:13.660> know<00:02:13.720> there's<00:02:13.930> another<00:02:14.170> one<00:02:14.380> that

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
yeah you know there's another one that

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.140 
yeah you know there's another one that
face<00:02:14.860> grain<00:02:15.160> to<00:02:15.310> face<00:02:15.489> grain<00:02:15.760> that's<00:02:15.940> pretty

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
face grain to face grain that's pretty

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.670 
face grain to face grain that's pretty
interesting<00:02:16.420> too<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.110> I<00:02:17.170> don't<00:02:17.230> know<00:02:17.500> if<00:02:17.560> we

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
interesting too and I don't know if we

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.940 
interesting too and I don't know if we
have<00:02:17.769> a<00:02:17.799> sample<00:02:18.100> here<00:02:18.459> yes<00:02:18.670> they<00:02:18.880> do<00:02:18.940> have<00:02:19.060> one

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
have a sample here yes they do have one

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.850 
have a sample here yes they do have one
and<00:02:20.950> that's<00:02:21.310> our<00:02:21.519> lap<00:02:21.700> joint<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:23.470> difference

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
and that's our lap joint the difference

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.580 
and that's our lap joint the difference
here<00:02:24.070> is<00:02:24.190> we<00:02:24.220> only<00:02:24.519> cut<00:02:24.820> one<00:02:24.959> face<00:02:25.959> not<00:02:26.320> both

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
here is we only cut one face not both

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.590 
here is we only cut one face not both
faces<00:02:27.130> uh-huh<00:02:27.820> and<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.150> don't<00:02:28.330> need<00:02:28.480> the

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
faces uh-huh and you don't need the

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.390 
faces uh-huh and you don't need the
routing<00:02:29.019> in<00:02:29.110> other<00:02:29.260> words<00:02:29.470> one<00:02:29.739> setup<00:02:30.040> at<00:02:30.310> the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
routing in other words one setup at the

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.250 
routing in other words one setup at the
table<00:02:30.730> saw<00:02:30.880> with<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.120> dado<00:02:31.330> head<00:02:31.630> or<00:02:32.019> the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
table saw with the dado head or the

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.080 
table saw with the dado head or the
tenon<00:02:32.560> jig<00:02:32.799> would<00:02:33.040> make<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.430> joint<00:02:33.700> that's

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
tenon jig would make that joint that's

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.000 
tenon jig would make that joint that's
quick<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:34.510> easy<00:02:34.630> you<00:02:35.140> will<00:02:35.320> see<00:02:35.620> this<00:02:35.799> in

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
quick and easy you will see this in

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.680 
quick and easy you will see this in
green<00:02:36.280> that's<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.760> downside<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.239> lot<00:02:37.540> of

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
green that's the downside a lot of

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.240 
green that's the downside a lot of
people<00:02:37.930> don't<00:02:38.140> like<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.440> see<00:02:38.470> that<00:02:38.769> end<00:02:39.010> grain

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
people don't like to see that end grain

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.880 
people don't like to see that end grain
exposed<00:02:39.760> on<00:02:40.120> their<00:02:40.510> pieces<00:02:40.750> but<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:41.230> know<00:02:41.470> if

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
exposed on their pieces but you know if

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.319 
exposed on their pieces but you know if
this<00:02:42.130> were<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.430> front<00:02:42.640> of<00:02:42.700> a<00:02:42.760> cabinet<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.239> we

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
this were the front of a cabinet and we

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.880 
this were the front of a cabinet and we
were<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.510> put<00:02:43.690> a<00:02:43.720> dado<00:02:44.019> down<00:02:44.440> here<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:44.769> was

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
were to put a dado down here that was

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.890 
were to put a dado down here that was
three-eighths<00:02:45.250> deep<00:02:45.519> wood<00:02:46.299> erasing<00:02:46.810> it

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
three-eighths deep wood erasing it

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.819 
three-eighths deep wood erasing it
that's<00:02:47.380> right

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
that's right

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.650 
that's right
so<00:02:48.190> there<00:02:48.610> are<00:02:48.730> a<00:02:48.760> number<00:02:48.850> of<00:02:49.090> strategies<00:02:49.600> that

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
so there are a number of strategies that

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.199 
so there are a number of strategies that
we<00:02:49.930> can<00:02:50.079> employ<00:02:50.140> here<00:02:50.709> to<00:02:51.310> make<00:02:51.489> that<00:02:51.700> joint

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
we can employ here to make that joint

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.990 
we can employ here to make that joint
workable<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:53.250> lot<00:02:54.250> of<00:02:54.370> other<00:02:54.459> joints<00:02:54.850> are

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
workable a lot of other joints are

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.120 
workable a lot of other joints are
actually<00:02:55.630> butt<00:02:55.840> joints<00:02:56.230> with<00:02:56.319> reinforcement

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
actually butt joints with reinforcement

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.059 
actually butt joints with reinforcement
too<00:02:57.660> few<00:02:58.660> of<00:02:58.780> those<00:02:58.959> include<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.890> dowel<00:03:00.430> joint

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
too few of those include the dowel joint

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.970 
too few of those include the dowel joint
and<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.510> dowel<00:03:02.689> joints<00:03:03.079> another<00:03:03.319> interesting

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
and the dowel joints another interesting

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.699 
and the dowel joints another interesting
one<00:03:04.390> you've<00:03:05.390> got<00:03:05.420> so<00:03:05.900> much<00:03:06.049> strength<00:03:06.349> there

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
one you've got so much strength there

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.289 
one you've got so much strength there
and<00:03:06.859> again<00:03:07.040> its<00:03:07.219> face<00:03:07.400> screen<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.849> face<00:03:08.030> screen

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
and again its face screen to face screen

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.660 
and again its face screen to face screen
gluing<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.799> way<00:03:09.890> those<00:03:10.069> dowels<00:03:10.370> are

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
gluing and the way those dowels are

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.119 
gluing and the way those dowels are
formed<00:03:11.090> they're<00:03:11.659> actually<00:03:12.200> fluted<00:03:12.709> so<00:03:12.920> that

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
formed they're actually fluted so that

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.009 
formed they're actually fluted so that
you<00:03:13.579> don't<00:03:13.730> have<00:03:13.849> a<00:03:13.939> hydraulic<00:03:14.390> effect<00:03:14.870> when

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
you don't have a hydraulic effect when

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.380 
you don't have a hydraulic effect when
you<00:03:15.109> put<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.379> glue<00:03:15.590> in<00:03:15.769> and<00:03:16.489> again<00:03:17.030> we<00:03:17.209> got

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
you put the glue in and again we got

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.599 
you put the glue in and again we got
that<00:03:17.569> face<00:03:17.780> crane<00:03:18.049> gluing<00:03:18.439> yeah<00:03:18.799> have<00:03:19.519> you

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
that face crane gluing yeah have you

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.210 
that face crane gluing yeah have you
used<00:03:19.819> that<00:03:19.909> I've<00:03:20.269> a<00:03:20.299> lot<00:03:21.200> but<00:03:21.590> you<00:03:21.739> know<00:03:21.859> I've

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
used that I've a lot but you know I've

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.640 
used that I've a lot but you know I've
often<00:03:22.489> found<00:03:22.909> that<00:03:23.120> they<00:03:24.079> were<00:03:24.140> troublesome

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
often found that they were troublesome

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.559 
often found that they were troublesome
like<00:03:24.950> I<00:03:25.069> couldn't<00:03:25.400> get<00:03:25.640> them<00:03:25.849> to<00:03:26.030> prevent

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
like I couldn't get them to prevent

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.080 
like I couldn't get them to prevent
twists<00:03:27.049> in<00:03:27.379> the<00:03:27.680> pieces<00:03:28.159> but<00:03:28.489> time<00:03:28.700> I<00:03:28.730> drilled

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
twists in the pieces but time I drilled

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.119 
twists in the pieces but time I drilled
for<00:03:29.359> holes<00:03:29.629> one<00:03:30.019> of<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.319> four<00:03:30.590> was<00:03:30.799> slightly

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
for holes one of the four was slightly

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.129 
for holes one of the four was slightly
out<00:03:31.280> of<00:03:31.430> alignment<00:03:31.579> well<00:03:32.389> and<00:03:32.659> you<00:03:32.750> don't<00:03:32.930> have

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
out of alignment well and you don't have

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.860 
out of alignment well and you don't have
that<00:03:33.230> lateral<00:03:34.159> movement<00:03:34.700> either<00:03:34.879> that's<00:03:35.629> true

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
that lateral movement either that's true

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.319 
that lateral movement either that's true
now<00:03:36.079> today<00:03:36.470> if<00:03:36.859> we<00:03:37.489> want<00:03:37.700> that<00:03:37.939> lateral

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
now today if we want that lateral

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:39.819 
now today if we want that lateral
movement<00:03:38.720> you<00:03:38.840> probably<00:03:39.169> use<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.470> biscuit

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
movement you probably use the biscuit

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:45.550 
movement you probably use the biscuit
coat<00:03:40.010> all<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.519> time<00:03:43.659> now<00:03:44.659> in<00:03:44.900> this<00:03:45.019> case<00:03:45.260> we're

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
coat all the time now in this case we're

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.770 
coat all the time now in this case we're
using<00:03:45.590> actually<00:03:46.340> a<00:03:46.370> biscuit<00:03:46.849> and<00:03:47.060> we<00:03:47.480> slip

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
using actually a biscuit and we slip

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.030 
using actually a biscuit and we slip
that<00:03:47.989> in<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:48.319> slot<00:03:48.560> like<00:03:48.829> so<00:03:49.159> and<00:03:50.049> then<00:03:51.049> we

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
that in the slot like so and then we

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.800 
that in the slot like so and then we
have<00:03:52.280> some<00:03:52.549> lateral<00:03:52.970> movement<00:03:53.419> this<00:03:53.569> looks

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
have some lateral movement this looks

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.009 
have some lateral movement this looks
like<00:03:53.930> it's<00:03:55.120> there<00:03:56.120> it<00:03:56.239> is<00:03:56.419> these<00:03:56.780> are<00:03:56.930> the

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
like it's there it is these are the

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.849 
like it's there it is these are the
faces<00:03:57.609> they're<00:03:58.609> set<00:03:59.299> so<00:03:59.569> I<00:03:59.900> can<00:04:00.109> move<00:04:00.290> those<00:04:00.590> to

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
faces they're set so I can move those to

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.800 
faces they're set so I can move those to
get<00:04:01.010> those<00:04:01.220> in<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.549> exact<00:04:01.909> position<00:04:02.150> I<00:04:02.540> want

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
get those in the exact position I want

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.550 
get those in the exact position I want
and<00:04:03.109> by<00:04:04.069> the<00:04:04.129> design<00:04:04.669> of<00:04:04.909> this<00:04:05.090> shape<00:04:05.419> I<00:04:05.750> can

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
and by the design of this shape I can

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.089 
and by the design of this shape I can
move<00:04:06.709> from<00:04:06.979> above<00:04:07.840> to<00:04:08.840> actually<00:04:09.349> creeping

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
move from above to actually creeping

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.399 
move from above to actually creeping
down<00:04:10.340> slightly<00:04:11.120> below<00:04:11.299> just<00:04:11.780> wiggle<00:04:12.109> it<00:04:12.169> till

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:12.409 
down slightly below just wiggle it till

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.069 
down slightly below just wiggle it till
it<00:04:12.470> fits<00:04:12.739> right<00:04:13.040> right<00:04:13.370> and<00:04:13.729> again<00:04:14.599> just<00:04:14.900> like

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
it fits right right and again just like

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.689 
it fits right right and again just like
the<00:04:15.290> dowels<00:04:15.500> these<00:04:15.919> are<00:04:16.070> drier<00:04:16.340> than<00:04:16.639> the

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
the dowels these are drier than the

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:18.339 
the dowels these are drier than the
woods<00:04:17.000> so<00:04:17.269> when<00:04:17.479> the<00:04:17.599> moisture<00:04:17.780> and<00:04:18.139> the<00:04:18.199> glue

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:18.349 
woods so when the moisture and the glue

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:20.259 
woods so when the moisture and the glue
hits<00:04:18.590> them<00:04:18.739> they<00:04:18.889> swell<00:04:19.310> up<00:04:19.340> and<00:04:19.699> they<00:04:19.760> lock<00:04:20.000> up

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
hits them they swell up and they lock up

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.420 
hits them they swell up and they lock up
in<00:04:20.570> fact<00:04:21.289> I<00:04:21.620> was<00:04:22.010> always<00:04:22.280> skeptical<00:04:22.669> of<00:04:22.909> those

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
in fact I was always skeptical of those

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.939 
in fact I was always skeptical of those
so<00:04:25.430> I<00:04:25.460> broke<00:04:25.699> this<00:04:25.940> one<00:04:26.000> I<00:04:26.500> made<00:04:27.500> up<00:04:27.680> a<00:04:27.770> sample

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949 
so I broke this one I made up a sample

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.370 
so I broke this one I made up a sample
and<00:04:28.310> I<00:04:28.340> just<00:04:28.580> broke<00:04:28.820> it<00:04:28.880> let's<00:04:29.510> look<00:04:30.139> at<00:04:30.229> that

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
and I just broke it let's look at that

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.649 
and I just broke it let's look at that
that's<00:04:30.800> pretty<00:04:31.070> good<00:04:31.340> I've<00:04:31.849> often<00:04:32.120> been<00:04:32.270> prone

00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:32.659 
that's pretty good I've often been prone

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:34.420 
that's pretty good I've often been prone
particularly<00:04:33.169> when<00:04:33.289> I've<00:04:33.440> using<00:04:33.770> this<00:04:33.889> number

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
particularly when I've using this number

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.180 
particularly when I've using this number
zero<00:04:34.940> the<00:04:35.270> smallest<00:04:35.599> biscuit<00:04:36.199> to<00:04:36.680> double<00:04:37.039> them

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
zero the smallest biscuit to double them

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.279 
zero the smallest biscuit to double them
up<00:04:37.310> and<00:04:37.490> use<00:04:37.639> a<00:04:37.669> pair<00:04:38.120> but<00:04:38.419> I<00:04:38.659> never<00:04:38.870> thought<00:04:39.110> of

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
up and use a pair but I never thought of

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.170 
up and use a pair but I never thought of
doing<00:04:39.320> that<00:04:39.680> I've<00:04:39.979> always<00:04:40.250> used<00:04:40.400> one<00:04:40.729> well

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
doing that I've always used one well

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.820 
doing that I've always used one well
this<00:04:41.419> looks<00:04:41.659> like<00:04:41.870> it's<00:04:42.020> pretty<00:04:42.380> pretty

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
this looks like it's pretty pretty

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.040 
this looks like it's pretty pretty
strong<00:04:43.159> I<00:04:43.400> mean<00:04:43.550> we<00:04:43.760> got<00:04:43.970> actually<00:04:44.780> we've

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
strong I mean we got actually we've

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.080 
strong I mean we got actually we've
destroyed<00:04:45.440> the<00:04:45.680> joint<00:04:45.979> taking<00:04:46.550> it<00:04:46.639> apart<00:04:46.909> like

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
destroyed the joint taking it apart like

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.939 
destroyed the joint taking it apart like
that

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
that

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:50.710 
that
well<00:04:48.949> I<00:04:48.979> do<00:04:49.099> I've<00:04:49.430> used<00:04:49.880> this<00:04:50.030> a<00:04:50.090> lot<00:04:50.210> lately

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
well I do I've used this a lot lately

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.300 
well I do I've used this a lot lately
because<00:04:51.020> it's<00:04:51.409> faster<00:04:51.830> than<00:04:51.949> the<00:04:52.099> dowels

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
because it's faster than the dowels

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.490 
because it's faster than the dowels
you've<00:04:53.000> got<00:04:53.180> four<00:04:53.419> holes<00:04:53.599> that<00:04:53.930> drill<00:04:54.139> here

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
you've got four holes that drill here

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.770 
you've got four holes that drill here
and<00:04:54.919> basically<00:04:55.099> with<00:04:55.490> a<00:04:55.520> biscuit<00:04:56.419> cutter<00:04:56.479> a

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
and basically with a biscuit cutter a

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.570 
and basically with a biscuit cutter a
plate<00:04:57.020> joiner<00:04:57.380> you<00:04:57.500> make<00:04:57.830> two<00:04:58.009> cuts<00:04:58.250> in<00:04:58.460> each

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
plate joiner you make two cuts in each

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.999 
plate joiner you make two cuts in each
corner<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:59.090> it's<00:04:59.419> one<00:04:59.630> set<00:04:59.930> up<00:05:00.110> once<00:05:00.620> a<00:05:00.800> much

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:01.009 
corner and it's one set up once a much

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:05.230 
corner and it's one set up once a much
faster<00:05:02.020> one<00:05:03.020> other<00:05:03.199> approach<00:05:03.909> and<00:05:04.909> you<00:05:05.120> may

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
faster one other approach and you may

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.439 
faster one other approach and you may
have<00:05:05.360> used<00:05:05.570> these<00:05:05.930> and<00:05:06.250> that<00:05:07.250> is<00:05:07.310> the<00:05:07.849> screws

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
have used these and that is the screws

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.080 
have used these and that is the screws
and<00:05:09.250> essentially<00:05:10.250> what<00:05:10.400> you<00:05:10.490> do<00:05:10.610> is<00:05:10.639> you<00:05:10.849> drill

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
and essentially what you do is you drill

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.580 
and essentially what you do is you drill
two<00:05:11.270> pocket<00:05:11.690> holes<00:05:11.870> and<00:05:12.080> then<00:05:12.169> drive<00:05:12.409> the

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
two pocket holes and then drive the

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.040 
two pocket holes and then drive the
screws<00:05:12.860> in<00:05:13.099> and<00:05:13.279> you<00:05:14.090> line<00:05:14.330> the<00:05:14.510> faces

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
screws in and you line the faces

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.439 
screws in and you line the faces
up<00:05:15.139> the<00:05:16.009> beauty<00:05:16.340> of<00:05:16.370> this<00:05:16.550> is<00:05:16.789> really<00:05:17.240> if<00:05:17.360> I

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
up the beauty of this is really if I

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:18.760 
up the beauty of this is really if I
were<00:05:17.479> to<00:05:17.659> put<00:05:17.840> this<00:05:17.990> in<00:05:18.199> the<00:05:18.289> corner<00:05:18.530> of<00:05:18.710> this

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
were to put this in the corner of this

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.520 
were to put this in the corner of this
cabinet<00:05:19.280> say<00:05:20.150> like<00:05:20.360> this<00:05:20.599> would<00:05:21.229> you<00:05:21.349> really

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
cabinet say like this would you really

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.930 
cabinet say like this would you really
be<00:05:21.650> able<00:05:21.830> to<00:05:21.949> tell<00:05:22.159> whether<00:05:22.340> that's<00:05:22.520> mortise

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
be able to tell whether that's mortise

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.399 
be able to tell whether that's mortise
and<00:05:23.030> tenon<00:05:23.360> or<00:05:23.449> screws<00:05:23.720> no<00:05:24.110> but<00:05:24.289> how<00:05:24.379> about

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.409 
and tenon or screws no but how about

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:26.230 
and tenon or screws no but how about
durability<00:05:24.889> does<00:05:25.370> that<00:05:25.550> does<00:05:25.849> that<00:05:25.970> joint

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
durability does that does that joint

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.869 
durability does that does that joint
creep<00:05:26.599> or<00:05:26.870> move<00:05:27.110> I've<00:05:27.770> not<00:05:27.979> had<00:05:28.159> any<00:05:28.220> problems

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:28.879 
creep or move I've not had any problems

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:30.820 
creep or move I've not had any problems
with<00:05:28.970> everything<00:05:29.599> the<00:05:30.020> other<00:05:30.169> thing<00:05:30.409> is<00:05:30.590> if<00:05:30.740> I

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
with everything the other thing is if I

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.439 
with everything the other thing is if I
use<00:05:30.979> these<00:05:31.220> whatever<00:05:31.550> using<00:05:31.879> clamps

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:32.449 
use these whatever using clamps

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.930 
use these whatever using clamps
no<00:05:33.169> no<00:05:33.530> I'm<00:05:33.949> moving<00:05:34.400> on<00:05:34.520> to<00:05:34.639> then<00:05:34.759> actually

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
no no I'm moving on to then actually

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.820 
no no I'm moving on to then actually
don't<00:05:35.210> take<00:05:35.419> a<00:05:35.449> special<00:05:35.810> jig<00:05:36.229> to<00:05:36.440> drill<00:05:36.470> it

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
don't take a special jig to drill it

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.499 
don't take a special jig to drill it
takes<00:05:37.069> a<00:05:37.190> special<00:05:37.310> jig<00:05:37.789> to<00:05:37.940> drill<00:05:37.970> the<00:05:38.300> holes

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:38.509 
takes a special jig to drill the holes

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:41.740 
takes a special jig to drill the holes
but<00:05:39.050> it's<00:05:39.560> probably<00:05:40.099> as<00:05:40.669> far<00:05:40.940> as<00:05:41.300> speed<00:05:41.539> goes

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
but it's probably as far as speed goes

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.450 
but it's probably as far as speed goes
it's<00:05:41.990> a<00:05:42.110> little<00:05:42.349> faster<00:05:42.770> than<00:05:42.949> dowels<00:05:43.159> and<00:05:43.370> a

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
it's a little faster than dowels and a

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.180 
it's a little faster than dowels and a
little<00:05:43.729> slower<00:05:43.970> than<00:05:44.210> the<00:05:44.330> biscuit<00:05:44.659> jump<00:05:44.900> ah

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
little slower than the biscuit jump ah

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.860 
little slower than the biscuit jump ah
so<00:05:46.190> you<00:05:46.699> can<00:05:46.849> move<00:05:46.970> fast<00:05:47.330> and<00:05:47.539> without<00:05:47.599> the

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
so you can move fast and without the

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.409 
so you can move fast and without the
clamping<00:05:48.349> operation<00:05:49.129> you<00:05:49.759> can<00:05:49.940> get<00:05:50.150> a<00:05:50.180> little

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
clamping operation you can get a little

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:53.350 
clamping operation you can get a little
further<00:05:50.599> on<00:05:50.719> the<00:05:50.960> project<00:05:51.409> a<00:05:51.940> lot<00:05:52.940> of<00:05:53.060> people

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
further on the project a lot of people

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.730 
further on the project a lot of people
like<00:05:53.479> to<00:05:53.509> see<00:05:53.780> the<00:05:53.870> quality<00:05:54.319> and<00:05:54.409> that's<00:05:54.560> why<00:05:54.680> I

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
like to see the quality and that's why I

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:55.719 
like to see the quality and that's why I
thought<00:05:54.919> we'd<00:05:55.039> show<00:05:55.159> the<00:05:55.310> members<00:05:55.610> this

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
thought we'd show the members this

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.760 
thought we'd show the members this
approach<00:05:56.090> today<00:05:56.449> but<00:05:57.080> you<00:05:57.169> know<00:05:57.199> there's<00:05:57.710> a

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
approach today but you know there's a

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.140 
approach today but you know there's a
lot<00:05:57.889> of<00:05:58.039> times<00:05:58.219> you<00:05:58.400> just<00:05:58.430> got<00:05:58.759> to<00:05:58.849> get<00:05:58.940> that

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
lot of times you just got to get that

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.939 
lot of times you just got to get that
cabinet<00:05:59.389> done<00:05:59.719> you<00:05:59.900> are<00:06:00.199> or<00:06:00.500> you're<00:06:00.800> working
