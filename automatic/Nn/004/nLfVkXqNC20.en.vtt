but eyes better than the rest yeah i

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.740 
but eyes better than the rest yeah i
think<00:00:40.390> is<00:00:40.750> because<00:00:41.230> of<00:00:41.710> the<00:00:42.160> gradients<00:00:42.610> we<00:00:43.510> put

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
think is because of the gradients we put

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.720 
think is because of the gradients we put
in<00:00:43.870> as<00:00:44.230> just<00:00:44.769> straight<00:00:45.070> meat<00:00:45.339> straight

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
in as just straight meat straight

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.819 
in as just straight meat straight
chicken<00:00:46.120> there's<00:00:46.300> no<00:00:46.420> adverse<00:00:46.809> we<00:00:47.559> a<00:00:47.589> lot<00:00:47.769> of

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
chicken there's no adverse we a lot of

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.399 
chicken there's no adverse we a lot of
other<00:00:47.980> companies<00:00:48.280> for<00:00:48.760> cannabis<00:00:49.300> and<00:00:49.570> and<00:00:49.870> i

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:50.409 
other companies for cannabis and and i

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:52.560 
other companies for cannabis and and i
think<00:00:50.710> that's<00:00:50.860> really<00:00:51.040> the<00:00:51.430> reason<00:00:51.610> and<00:00:52.480> i

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
think that's really the reason and i

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.020 
think that's really the reason and i
think<00:00:52.809> the<00:00:52.870> other<00:00:52.989> reason<00:00:53.350> is<00:00:53.470> we're<00:00:54.309> at<00:00:54.940> a

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
think the other reason is we're at a

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.729 
think the other reason is we're at a
place<00:00:55.329> here<00:00:55.690> and<00:00:55.809> we<00:00:55.930> think<00:00:56.079> it's<00:00:56.260> paradise

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
place here and we think it's paradise

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.450 
place here and we think it's paradise
and<00:00:57.659> we're<00:00:58.659> on<00:00:58.839> a<00:00:58.870> lake<00:00:59.140> and<00:00:59.470> and<00:00:59.859> we<00:01:00.250> have<00:01:00.430> a
