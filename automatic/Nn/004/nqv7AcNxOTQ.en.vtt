something else coming off free

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.920 
something else coming off free
afterwards<00:00:29.040> they<00:00:30.040> make<00:00:30.070> this<00:00:30.400> initially<00:00:31.270> but

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
afterwards they make this initially but

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.810 
afterwards they make this initially but
the<00:00:32.140> problem<00:00:32.649> with<00:00:32.860> it<00:00:32.890> is<00:00:33.100> that<00:00:33.430> it<00:00:35.550> does<00:00:36.550> not

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
the problem with it is that it does not

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.169 
the problem with it is that it does not
detect<00:00:37.449> if<00:00:38.109> there<00:00:38.679> is<00:00:38.859> a<00:00:39.129> cart<00:00:39.870> there<00:00:40.870> or<00:00:41.469> not

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:42.179 
detect if there is a cart there or not

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:46.829 
detect if there is a cart there or not
until<00:00:43.179> if<00:00:43.480> I<00:00:43.629> send<00:00:43.899> out<00:00:44.260> two<00:00:44.890> guards<00:00:45.839> before

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
until if I send out two guards before

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.939 
until if I send out two guards before
this<00:00:47.260> one<00:00:47.499> has<00:00:48.329> coming<00:00:49.499> yeah<00:00:50.499> you<00:00:50.559> see<00:00:50.829> the

house yeah I still made this you just
show<00:01:16.450> this<00:01:16.630> frame<00:01:16.990> so<00:01:17.530> that<00:01:17.560> failed<00:01:18.310> miserably

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
show this frame so that failed miserably

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.560 
show this frame so that failed miserably
so<00:01:19.990> I<00:01:20.020> made<00:01:20.200> something<00:01:20.409> else<00:01:20.680> here<00:01:20.979> which<00:01:21.969> is<00:01:22.509> a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
so I made something else here which is a

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.850 
so I made something else here which is a
bit<00:01:22.899> different<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:24.549> here<00:01:24.759> i<00:01:25.000> have<00:01:25.439> three<00:01:26.439> cards

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
bit different so here i have three cards

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.880 
bit different so here i have three cards
there<00:01:27.130> are<00:01:27.340> four<00:01:27.700> spots<00:01:27.969> Oh<00:01:28.799> major<00:01:29.799> lag<00:01:31.890> click

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
there are four spots Oh major lag click

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.520 
there are four spots Oh major lag click
the<00:01:33.130> button<00:01:33.549> and<00:01:33.820> one<00:01:34.659> cuts<00:01:34.899> go<00:01:35.079> all<00:01:35.259> soft

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
the button and one cuts go all soft

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.910 
the button and one cuts go all soft
right<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:37.600> goes<00:01:37.780> around<00:01:37.930> here<00:01:38.350> it<00:01:38.710> comes

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
right that goes around here it comes

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.910 
right that goes around here it comes
back<00:01:39.130> there<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.869> can<00:01:41.079> see<00:01:41.109> that<00:01:41.439> this<00:01:41.649> power

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
back there you can see that this power

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.940 
back there you can see that this power
rail<00:01:42.280> is<00:01:42.869> currently<00:01:43.869> on<00:01:44.109> this<00:01:44.950> one's<00:01:45.189> off<00:01:46.950> so

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
rail is currently on this one's off so

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.919 
rail is currently on this one's off so
the<00:01:48.159> card<00:01:48.399> goes<00:01:48.670> into<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.899> one<00:01:50.109> that<00:01:50.500> is

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
the card goes into the one that is

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.849 
the card goes into the one that is
farthest<00:01:52.929> away<00:01:53.289> kind<00:01:53.770> of<00:01:54.840> if<00:01:55.840> I<00:01:56.020> send<00:01:56.259> up<00:01:56.409> two

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
farthest away kind of if I send up two

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:01.520 
farthest away kind of if I send up two
cords<00:01:57.189> that's<00:01:57.670> one<00:01:58.649> percent<00:01:59.649> after<00:01:59.829> another

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
cords that's one percent after another

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.779 
cords that's one percent after another
and<00:02:02.530> I<00:02:02.679> can<00:02:02.890> even<00:02:03.070> send<00:02:03.490> out<00:02:03.820> a<00:02:03.850> third<00:02:04.600> one<00:02:05.789> this

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
and I can even send out a third one this

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.040 
and I can even send out a third one this
one<00:02:06.999> comes<00:02:07.240> back<00:02:07.450> goes<00:02:08.350> in<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.649> first<00:02:08.890> spot

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
one comes back goes in the first spot

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.330 
one comes back goes in the first spot
second<00:02:11.050> one<00:02:11.200> comes

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
second one comes

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
second one comes
into<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.269> second<00:02:13.660> spot<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:14.739> third<00:02:15.010> one<00:02:15.360> comes

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
into the second spot the third one comes

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.479 
into the second spot the third one comes
into<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:17.530> third<00:02:18.599> spot<00:02:20.280> that's<00:02:21.280> all<00:02:21.459> very

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
into the third spot that's all very

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.600 
into the third spot that's all very
useful<00:02:22.000> um<00:02:23.879> yeah<00:02:24.879> I've<00:02:25.060> done<00:02:25.300> this<00:02:25.450> using<00:02:26.610> no

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
useful um yeah I've done this using no

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.680 
useful um yeah I've done this using no
mobs<00:02:27.849> only<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.450> halogen<00:02:29.019> stuff<00:02:30.180> now<00:02:31.180> using

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
mobs only the halogen stuff now using

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.940 
mobs only the halogen stuff now using
memory<00:02:31.959> gates<00:02:32.500> oops<00:02:33.360> yeah<00:02:34.360> so<00:02:34.930> here's<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.410> 1-bit

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
memory gates oops yeah so here's a 1-bit

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.320 
memory gates oops yeah so here's a 1-bit
memory<00:02:36.430> kit<00:02:37.590> when<00:02:38.590> this<00:02:38.739> card<00:02:39.129> passes<00:02:39.760> over

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
memory kit when this card passes over

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:50.390 
memory kit when this card passes over
this<00:02:40.810> spot<00:02:44.010> um<00:02:45.420> this<00:02:46.420> gate<00:02:46.690> switches<00:02:47.230> the

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.150 

power<00:02:51.630> goes<00:02:52.630> up<00:02:52.840> here<00:02:53.110> and<00:02:53.260> stays<00:02:53.560> on<00:02:53.860> even

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
power goes up here and stays on even

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.600 
power goes up here and stays on even
when<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.610> button<00:02:54.790> is<00:02:54.940> off<00:02:58.530> there<00:02:59.530> is<00:02:59.860> a<00:03:00.280> reset

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
when the button is off there is a reset

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.140 
when the button is off there is a reset
when<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.360> card<00:03:01.690> goes<00:03:02.530> over<00:03:03.010> this<00:03:04.049> detector<00:03:05.049> well

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
when a card goes over this detector well

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:13.770 
when a card goes over this detector well
which<00:03:07.150> goes<00:03:07.390> over<00:03:08.579> down<00:03:09.579> here<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:12.000> up<00:03:13.000> on<00:03:13.360> this

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
which goes over down here and up on this

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.170 
which goes over down here and up on this
side<00:03:14.049> comes<00:03:14.620> up<00:03:14.769> here<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.430> then<00:03:15.640> to<00:03:15.790> this<00:03:15.970> one

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
side comes up here and then to this one

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.069 
side comes up here and then to this one
which<00:03:16.420> resets<00:03:16.930> this<00:03:17.230> memory<00:03:17.650> gate<00:03:17.829> and<00:03:18.160> turns

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
which resets this memory gate and turns

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.599 
which resets this memory gate and turns
this<00:03:20.079> booster<00:03:20.920> track<00:03:21.220> piece<00:03:21.519> off<00:03:21.790> again<00:03:22.299> the

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
this booster track piece off again the

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.009 
this booster track piece off again the
same<00:03:24.609> process<00:03:25.060> is<00:03:25.359> repeated<00:03:26.079> on<00:03:26.859> the<00:03:26.980> side

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
same process is repeated on the side

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.150 
same process is repeated on the side
this<00:03:29.019> is<00:03:29.230> a<00:03:29.260> lower<00:03:29.560> gate<00:03:29.950> and<00:03:30.310> then<00:03:31.920> it<00:03:32.920> gets

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
this is a lower gate and then it gets

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.030 
this is a lower gate and then it gets
very<00:03:33.400> complicated<00:03:34.030> and<00:03:34.780> I<00:03:35.170> confused<00:03:35.950> myself

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
very complicated and I confused myself

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.620 
very complicated and I confused myself
well<00:03:36.700> don't<00:03:36.940> think<00:03:37.239> yes<00:03:37.450> oh<00:03:39.090> yeah<00:03:40.090> I<00:03:40.209> wouldn't

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
well don't think yes oh yeah I wouldn't

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.690 
well don't think yes oh yeah I wouldn't
really<00:03:40.810> recommend<00:03:40.930> it<00:03:41.440> but<00:03:41.980> it<00:03:42.099> works<00:03:42.340> it

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
really recommend it but it works it

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.089 
really recommend it but it works it
works<00:03:42.910> well<00:03:43.410> so<00:03:44.410> for<00:03:44.650> example<00:03:44.739> I<00:03:46.470> could<00:03:47.470> add

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
works well so for example I could add

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:55.770 
works well so for example I could add
one<00:03:48.790> more<00:03:49.000> card<00:03:49.450> guys<00:03:49.810> doing<00:03:52.079> yeah

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:06.940 

yes<00:03:56.780> I<00:03:57.080> do<00:03:57.140> use<00:04:02.080> in-game<00:04:04.690> inventory<00:04:05.690> edits<00:04:06.110> for

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
yes I do use in-game inventory edits for

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.410 
yes I do use in-game inventory edits for
this<00:04:07.270> because<00:04:08.270> this<00:04:08.450> is<00:04:08.660> just<00:04:08.690> a<00:04:09.050> test<00:04:09.290> thing

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
this because this is just a test thing

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.440 
this because this is just a test thing
my<00:04:11.420> logic<00:04:11.630> world<00:04:12.260> I<00:04:12.470> do<00:04:12.530> not<00:04:12.950> however<00:04:13.400> they<00:04:14.300> say

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
my logic world I do not however they say

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.349 
my logic world I do not however they say
well<00:04:14.630> there's<00:04:15.050> about<00:04:15.170> once<00:04:16.239> there's<00:04:17.239> the

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
well there's about once there's the

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.540 
well there's about once there's the
button<00:04:17.840> again<00:04:18.549> version<00:04:19.549> 3<00:04:19.730> times<00:04:20.030> and<00:04:21.550> this

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
button again version 3 times and this

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.640 
button again version 3 times and this
mostly<00:04:23.480> works<00:04:23.720> it's<00:04:23.990> a<00:04:24.200> big<00:04:24.380> huggie<00:04:24.889> but<00:04:25.580> yeah

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.700 

it's<00:04:30.650> pretty<00:04:30.770> cool<00:04:31.070> I<00:04:31.280> think<00:04:31.729> it<00:04:32.120> works<00:04:32.650> so<00:04:33.650> if

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
it's pretty cool I think it works so if

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.980 
it's pretty cool I think it works so if
you<00:04:33.830> press<00:04:34.040> a<00:04:34.070> button<00:04:34.220> I<00:04:34.550> tried<00:04:34.729> to<00:04:34.910> you<00:04:35.330> let<00:04:35.840> it

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
you press a button I tried to you let it

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.710 
you press a button I tried to you let it
break<00:04:36.169> right<00:04:36.650> let's<00:04:36.919> try<00:04:37.040> that<00:04:37.220> again<00:04:37.510> this<00:04:38.510> is

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
break right let's try that again this is

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:54.030 
break right let's try that again this is
another<00:04:39.020> cool<00:04:39.970> mr.<00:04:41.500> let's<00:04:42.500> run<00:04:42.710> back<00:04:47.139> yeah<00:04:51.910> mmm

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
another cool mr. let's run back yeah mmm

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.260 
another cool mr. let's run back yeah mmm
even<00:04:55.040> when<00:04:55.190> all<00:04:55.340> the<00:04:55.490> mobs<00:04:55.700> go<00:04:55.940> on<00:04:56.060> to<00:04:56.210> my<00:04:56.330> track

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
even when all the mobs go on to my track

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.810 
even when all the mobs go on to my track
Vega<00:04:59.270> alright<00:04:59.830> let's<00:05:00.830> see<00:05:01.010> here<00:05:01.250> let's<00:05:01.640> try

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
Vega alright let's see here let's try

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.529 
Vega alright let's see here let's try
that<00:05:01.940> again<00:05:02.470> the<00:05:03.470> super<00:05:03.830> jump<00:05:04.729> into<00:05:05.060> the<00:05:05.300> car

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
that again the super jump into the car

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:09.159 
that again the super jump into the car
oh<00:05:05.720> and<00:05:06.080> here's<00:05:06.500> a<00:05:06.830> ellicott<00:05:07.960> that's<00:05:08.960> really

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
oh and here's a ellicott that's really

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.920 
oh and here's a ellicott that's really
cool<00:05:09.370> just<00:05:10.370> not<00:05:10.580> a<00:05:10.610> minor<00:05:10.970> thing<00:05:11.240> nothing<00:05:11.780> to

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
cool just not a minor thing nothing to

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.779 
cool just not a minor thing nothing to
do<00:05:12.050> with<00:05:12.229> the<00:05:12.350> actual<00:05:12.560> system<00:05:15.490> detector<00:05:16.490> rail

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
do with the actual system detector rail

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:19.870 
do with the actual system detector rail
was<00:05:17.630> into<00:05:18.020> this<00:05:18.169> block<00:05:18.500> whose<00:05:19.250> Grail<00:05:19.610> here

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
was into this block whose Grail here

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.210 
was into this block whose Grail here
this<00:05:20.810> one<00:05:21.020> is<00:05:21.050> not<00:05:21.470> turned<00:05:21.950> on<00:05:22.270> because<00:05:24.220> when

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
this one is not turned on because when

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.600 
this one is not turned on because when
you<00:05:25.340> place<00:05:25.610> a<00:05:25.880> when<00:05:26.270> stone<00:05:26.930> torch<00:05:27.370> yeah<00:05:28.370> I<00:05:28.430> can

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
you place a when stone torch yeah I can

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.219 
you place a when stone torch yeah I can
place<00:05:28.760> it<00:05:28.910> underneath<00:05:29.210> like<00:05:29.660> I've<00:05:29.870> done<00:05:30.020> there

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
place it underneath like I've done there

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.770 
place it underneath like I've done there
it<00:05:30.890> only<00:05:31.070> travels<00:05:31.550> four<00:05:31.789> one<00:05:32.030> two<00:05:32.210> three<00:05:32.330> four

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
it only travels four one two three four

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.370 
it only travels four one two three four
five<00:05:33.260> six<00:05:34.010> seven<00:05:34.400> eight<00:05:35.090> nine<00:05:35.360> ten<00:05:35.930> blocks

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
five six seven eight nine ten blocks

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.310 
five six seven eight nine ten blocks
either<00:05:36.770> way<00:05:36.919> so<00:05:37.700> this<00:05:37.850> one's<00:05:38.090> off<00:05:38.270> when<00:05:39.080> they

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
either way so this one's off when they

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.590 
either way so this one's off when they
caught<00:05:39.590> passes<00:05:40.010> through<00:05:40.190> here<00:05:40.400> however<00:05:40.610> this

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
caught passes through here however this

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.090 
caught passes through here however this
rail<00:05:42.260> underneath<00:05:42.800> the<00:05:42.950> skirt<00:05:43.220> gets<00:05:43.520> Howard

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
rail underneath the skirt gets Howard

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.710 
rail underneath the skirt gets Howard
think<00:05:46.100> so<00:05:46.810> looks<00:05:47.810> damn<00:05:48.250> you<00:05:49.250> do<00:05:49.460> face<00:05:49.700> it<00:05:49.940> there

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
think so looks damn you do face it there

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.360 
think so looks damn you do face it there
is<00:05:51.160> no<00:05:52.160> but<00:05:52.550> now<00:05:52.669> you<00:05:52.729> don't<00:05:52.970> see<00:05:53.210> the<00:05:53.270> launch

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
is no but now you don't see the launch

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.150 
is no but now you don't see the launch
yeah<00:05:55.370> and<00:05:55.490> then<00:05:55.610> it<00:05:55.729> comes<00:05:55.850> back

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.290 

yeah<00:06:00.030> it's<00:06:00.210> just<00:06:00.450> like<00:06:00.890> on<00:06:01.890> mafia<00:06:02.220> thank<00:06:03.180> you

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300

for watching be nice if you left a
comment<00:06:09.090> how<00:06:10.050> I<00:06:10.080> could<00:06:10.410> improve<00:06:10.500> it<00:06:10.980> yeah<00:06:11.370> I

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
comment how I could improve it yeah I

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.590 
comment how I could improve it yeah I
try<00:06:11.700> to<00:06:11.760> improve<00:06:12.150> it<00:06:13.610> this<00:06:14.610> prevents<00:06:15.210> if<00:06:15.390> any

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
try to improve it this prevents if any

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.890 
try to improve it this prevents if any
card<00:06:15.990> if<00:06:17.390> something<00:06:18.390> happens<00:06:20.450> we<00:06:21.450> get<00:06:21.870> a

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
card if something happens we get a

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.450 
card if something happens we get a
minecart<00:06:22.710> there<00:06:23.250> yeah<00:06:23.400> and<00:06:24.590> a<00:06:25.590> minecart<00:06:26.130> goes

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
minecart there yeah and a minecart goes

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.630 
minecart there yeah and a minecart goes
backwards<00:06:26.970> and<00:06:27.660> prevent<00:06:28.110> from<00:06:28.650> going<00:06:29.250> all<00:06:29.520> the

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:29.640 
backwards and prevent from going all the

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.220 
backwards and prevent from going all the
way<00:06:29.730> around<00:06:29.820> and<00:06:30.270> messing<00:06:30.420> the<00:06:30.810> system<00:06:31.140> over

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.230 
way around and messing the system over

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.800
