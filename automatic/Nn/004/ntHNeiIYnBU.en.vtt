00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
becomes a lot more vibrant I'm going to

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.469 
becomes a lot more vibrant I'm going to
poke<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.760> with<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.909> fork<00:01:39.260> and<00:01:40.260> then<00:01:41.300> I'm<00:01:42.300> going

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
poke it with a fork and then I'm going

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.060 
poke it with a fork and then I'm going
to<00:01:42.570> just<00:01:42.690> turn<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.170> gas

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.780 

and<00:01:46.360> bung<00:01:47.360> it<00:01:47.540> it's<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.710> same<00:01:48.950> process<00:01:49.400> as<00:01:49.580> how

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
and bung it it's the same process as how

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.090 
and bung it it's the same process as how
you<00:01:49.850> make<00:01:50.690> a<00:01:50.720> bangin<00:01:51.080> Cappetta<00:01:51.440> there's

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
you make a bangin Cappetta there's

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.650 
you make a bangin Cappetta there's
nothing<00:01:52.490> really<00:01:52.670> that<00:01:52.790> difficult<00:01:53.750> about<00:01:54.080> this

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
nothing really that difficult about this

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.050 
nothing really that difficult about this
so<00:01:56.770> so<00:01:57.770> as<00:01:57.860> you<00:01:57.950> can<00:01:58.040> see<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.430> pepper<00:01:58.640> has

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
so so as you can see the pepper has

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.170 
so so as you can see the pepper has
become<00:01:59.420> quite<00:01:59.690> the<00:02:00.020> lack<00:02:00.650> I'm<00:02:01.490> just<00:02:01.760> going<00:02:02.000> to

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
become quite the lack I'm just going to

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.350 
become quite the lack I'm just going to
make<00:02:02.810> sure<00:02:02.840> that<00:02:03.500> all<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:04.190> remaining<00:02:04.880> parts

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.770 
make sure that all the remaining parts
are<00:02:05.890> black<00:02:06.890> -<00:02:07.220> this<00:02:07.880> is<00:02:08.060> just<00:02:08.270> because<00:02:08.570> you

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
are black - this is just because you

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.470 
are black - this is just because you
know<00:02:08.869> it'll<00:02:09.170> be<00:02:09.200> easier<00:02:09.590> to<00:02:09.649> peel<00:02:10.240> I'll<00:02:11.240> give

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
know it'll be easier to peel I'll give

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.880 
know it'll be easier to peel I'll give
you<00:02:11.570> a<00:02:11.600> tip<00:02:11.810> though<00:02:11.990> if<00:02:12.350> you're<00:02:12.590> in<00:02:12.680> a<00:02:12.770> hurry

you a tip though if you're in a hurry

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.160 
you a tip though if you're in a hurry
you<00:02:13.190> just<00:02:13.610> take<00:02:14.120> it<00:02:14.240> off<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.390> gas<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.870> run<00:02:15.020> it

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
you just take it off the gas to run it

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.990 
you just take it off the gas to run it
under<00:02:15.290> water<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.280> peel<00:02:16.490> will<00:02:16.670> just<00:02:16.850> come

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
under water and the peel will just come

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.570 
under water and the peel will just come
off<00:02:17.150> if<00:02:17.360> you're<00:02:17.840> not<00:02:18.110> you<00:02:18.740> can<00:02:18.770> wait<00:02:19.130> for<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:19.400> to

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
off if you're not you can wait for it to

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.520 
off if you're not you can wait for it to
sit<00:02:19.790> down<00:02:19.940> for<00:02:20.210> a<00:02:20.240> bit<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.660> then<00:02:21.140> peel<00:02:21.380> it

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
sit down for a bit and then peel it

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.110 
sit down for a bit and then peel it
slowly<00:02:22.210> so<00:02:23.210> this<00:02:23.360> is<00:02:23.480> done<00:02:24.310> so<00:02:25.310> I've<00:02:25.700> quickly

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
slowly so this is done so I've quickly

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.290 
slowly so this is done so I've quickly
run<00:02:26.420> this<00:02:26.660> bell<00:02:27.650> pepper<00:02:27.980> under<00:02:28.250> water<00:02:28.460> and<00:02:29.030> I'm

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
run this bell pepper under water and I'm

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.670 
run this bell pepper under water and I'm
going<00:02:29.480> to<00:02:29.540> chop<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:29.810> up<00:02:30.050> I'm<00:02:30.290> going<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:30.500> remove

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
going to chop it up I'm going to remove

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.170 
going to chop it up I'm going to remove
the<00:02:30.830> seeds<00:02:31.130> first<00:02:31.430> because<00:02:31.760> that's<00:02:31.910> really

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
the seeds first because that's really

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.140 
the seeds first because that's really
important<00:02:33.310> while<00:02:34.310> I'm<00:02:34.430> chopping<00:02:34.850> you'll<00:02:35.000> see

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
important while I'm chopping you'll see

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.460 
important while I'm chopping you'll see
that<00:02:35.300> water's<00:02:35.810> going<00:02:35.960> to<00:02:36.020> come<00:02:36.080> out<00:02:36.260> which<00:02:36.440> is

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
that water's going to come out which is

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.310 
that water's going to come out which is
fine<00:02:36.830> don't<00:02:37.250> bother<00:02:37.430> it's<00:02:38.330> not<00:02:39.080> going<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.260> be

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
fine don't bother it's not going to be

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.370 
fine don't bother it's not going to be
the<00:02:39.410> end<00:02:39.530> of<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.680> world<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:44.140> it's<00:02:45.140> a<00:02:45.230> little

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
the end of the world and it's a little

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.610 
the end of the world and it's a little
hot<00:02:45.650> but<00:02:45.950> I'm<00:02:46.700> sure<00:02:46.880> you<00:02:47.000> can<00:02:47.180> work<00:02:47.530> your<00:02:48.530> way

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
hot but I'm sure you can work your way

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.530 
hot but I'm sure you can work your way
around<00:02:48.709> it<00:02:48.980> you<00:02:49.459> have<00:02:49.610> to<00:02:49.700> just<00:02:49.730> roughly<00:02:50.239> chop

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
around it you have to just roughly chop

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.570 
around it you have to just roughly chop
it<00:02:50.720> because<00:02:51.470> it's<00:02:51.709> going<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:51.980> go<00:02:52.130> into<00:02:52.459> the

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
it because it's going to go into the

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.680 
it because it's going to go into the
food<00:02:53.239> processor<00:02:53.300> or<00:02:53.810> blender<00:02:53.959> in<00:02:54.500> any<00:02:54.739> case<00:02:55.690> if

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
food processor or blender in any case if

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.330 
food processor or blender in any case if
you<00:02:56.810> can<00:02:56.959> see<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.200> vibrant<00:02:57.650> orange<00:02:58.100> color

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
you can see the vibrant orange color

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.050 
you can see the vibrant orange color
it's<00:02:58.910> only<00:02:59.360> because<00:02:59.840> of<00:02:59.870> the<00:03:00.080> charring

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
it's only because of the charring

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.250 
it's only because of the charring
charring<00:03:02.060> makes<00:03:02.300> it<00:03:02.510> really<00:03:02.870> really

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
charring makes it really really

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.800 
charring makes it really really
beautiful<00:03:03.769> and<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.340> sweet<00:03:04.730> flavors<00:03:05.570> of<00:03:05.720> the

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
beautiful and the sweet flavors of the

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.670 
beautiful and the sweet flavors of the
peppers<00:03:06.110> come<00:03:06.320> through<00:03:06.530> very<00:03:06.560> beautifully

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
peppers come through very beautifully

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.120 
peppers come through very beautifully
after<00:03:09.680> I'm<00:03:09.860> done<00:03:10.100> with<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:11.050> cutting<00:03:12.130> I'm

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
after I'm done with the cutting I'm

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.790 
after I'm done with the cutting I'm
going<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.580> just<00:03:13.790> use<00:03:13.910> my<00:03:14.540> food<00:03:15.230> processor<00:03:15.380> but

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
going to just use my food processor but

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.250 
going to just use my food processor but
you<00:03:15.890> can<00:03:16.040> really<00:03:16.250> use<00:03:16.430> your<00:03:16.610> blender<00:03:16.850> or<00:03:17.600> you

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
you can really use your blender or you

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.020 
you can really use your blender or you
know<00:03:18.709> if<00:03:18.769> you<00:03:18.860> have<00:03:18.950> a<00:03:19.010> hand<00:03:19.280> blender<00:03:19.430> that

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
know if you have a hand blender that

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.560 
know if you have a hand blender that
will<00:03:20.209> work<00:03:20.360> perfectly<00:03:20.840> fine<00:03:21.110> too<00:03:21.410> I<00:03:22.570> the

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
will work perfectly fine too I the

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.080 
will work perfectly fine too I the
easiest<00:03:23.900> thing<00:03:24.140> about<00:03:24.290> harissa<00:03:24.769> is<00:03:25.010> that<00:03:25.910> you

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
easiest thing about harissa is that you

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.090 
easiest thing about harissa is that you
once<00:03:26.570> this<00:03:26.900> process<00:03:27.380> is<00:03:27.530> over

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
once this process is over

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.170 
once this process is over
you<00:03:28.459> just<00:03:28.670> have<00:03:28.820> to<00:03:28.940> bunk<00:03:29.540> everything<00:03:30.200> inside

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
you just have to bunk everything inside

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.120 
you just have to bunk everything inside
so<00:03:32.180> I'm<00:03:32.480> going<00:03:32.870> to<00:03:33.490> put<00:03:34.490> the<00:03:34.610> bell<00:03:34.760> peppers

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
so I'm going to put the bell peppers

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.050 
so I'm going to put the bell peppers
some<00:03:37.130> seeds<00:03:37.430> won't<00:03:37.610> really<00:03:37.849> make<00:03:38.000> a

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
some seeds won't really make a

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.390 
some seeds won't really make a
difference<00:03:38.230> we<00:03:39.230> will<00:03:39.319> put<00:03:39.530> in<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:40.130> cumin

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
difference we will put in the cumin

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:47.820 
difference we will put in the cumin
powder<00:03:41.380> the<00:03:42.380> salt<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:44.209> paprika<00:03:44.890> and

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
powder the salt the paprika and

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.850 
powder the salt the paprika and
coriander<00:03:48.830> powder<00:03:49.220> I'm<00:03:50.090> also<00:03:51.020> going<00:03:51.470> to<00:03:51.560> put

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
coriander powder I'm also going to put

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.780 
coriander powder I'm also going to put
the<00:03:52.010> garlic<00:03:52.420> at<00:03:53.420> this<00:03:53.750> point<00:03:54.020> and<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:55.580> whole

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
the garlic at this point and the whole

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.180 
the garlic at this point and the whole
red<00:03:56.330> chillies<00:03:56.989> which<00:03:57.590> are<00:03:57.739> basically<00:03:58.069> the

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
red chillies which are basically the

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.540 
red chillies which are basically the
stuff<00:03:58.580> I'm<00:03:59.030> going<00:03:59.720> to<00:03:59.810> use<00:04:00.110> a<00:04:00.140> bit<00:04:00.500> of<00:04:00.530> oil<00:04:03.550> the

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
stuff I'm going to use a bit of oil the

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.350 
stuff I'm going to use a bit of oil the
oil<00:04:04.660> is<00:04:05.660> what<00:04:06.140> will<00:04:06.440> make<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:07.069> harissa<00:04:07.580> into<00:04:08.330> a

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
oil is what will make the harissa into a

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.690 
oil is what will make the harissa into a
preserved<00:04:08.870> thing<00:04:09.590> which<00:04:09.739> can<00:04:09.920> last<00:04:10.069> you<00:04:10.489> for

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
preserved thing which can last you for

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.680 
preserved thing which can last you for
at<00:04:10.790> least<00:04:10.940> a<00:04:11.150> couple<00:04:11.180> of<00:04:11.510> weeks<00:04:11.569> and<00:04:12.549> a<00:04:13.690> squeeze

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
at least a couple of weeks and a squeeze

at least a couple of weeks and a squeeze
of<00:04:14.720> lemon

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:27.680 

I<00:04:19.430> gotta<00:04:20.430> go

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.400 

at<00:04:28.140> about<00:04:28.320> halfway<00:04:28.710> point<00:04:29.310> you<00:04:29.820> can<00:04:30.090> check<00:04:30.570> how

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
at about halfway point you can check how

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.310 
at about halfway point you can check how
thick<00:04:31.800> or<00:04:32.100> thin<00:04:32.220> you<00:04:32.910> want<00:04:33.150> you<00:04:33.630> can<00:04:33.810> see<00:04:34.020> here
