 according to the migrations of animals and 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:42.390
 cycle of seasons to a civilization of 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.560

 really dog ​​in the hot dogs have 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.090
 produces so many tarps on our 

00:01:58.769 --> 00:02:02.190
 planet that the weight of livestock is 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.909
 superior to on the human species and the 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.159
 meat consumption has been multiplied 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.240
 five in 50 years and at this rate we're going 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.489
 end up puffing our neighbors for 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.899

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.170
 dietary practices 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.650
 developed according to the cultures and 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.180
 religions 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.080
 I will not introduce everything to you but 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.970
 it is important to look at 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.290
 first of all we have the schemes by 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.209
 belief like the vegetarian diet 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.650

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.629
 it's a little bit the superheroes of 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.099
 modern times 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.540
