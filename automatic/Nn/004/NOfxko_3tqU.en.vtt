 a must is the bonus damage on 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.669
 put our opponents here 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.890
 the maximum value is to drown. 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.160
 click search 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.379

 skill among which we can choose 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.730
 what we need to propose to start with 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.149
 classics with barbarian 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.149
 go down and choose the maximum 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.609
 the stock i will be here max 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.989
 value 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:04.290
 click search and now we are left 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.990
 choose the skill that we will 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.170
 to use 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.600
 I personally use the money there but also 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.890
 more advice for you 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.170
 here we see the maximum sites on 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.290
 which board 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.480
 1 step rage costs 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:27.180
 as far as the top score is from 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:29.890
 five to six percent goes to damage from 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.800
 other 67 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.040
 each of which in my opinion 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.120
 only visually priceless port is different 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.580
 he of course 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.490
 slightly slowed down opponents 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:47.619
 Accordingly, each on the course he stands on 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:49.960
 order is more expensive as for personally here 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.910
 we see the maximum burns in which from 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.780
 2 to 7 percent of legends and joy and 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.330
 strike critical 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.350
 hang out here I advise 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.940
 focus exclusively on the cold 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.830
 make everything clear we come to the lowest 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.830
 class 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.830
 gabbana 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:16.630
 degree feet of the spirit which can be 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:20.810
 here are up to 200 cdi averages 1 and 9 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:24.140
 we can also choose which line I personally 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.110
 I can use the roof of my wounds 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.319
 try the way hundreds of fists either 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.590
 cold thunder each of these is not for me 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.910
 congratulates you 5 is 11 percent damage 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.400
 put here averages 11 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.019
 click search 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:46.489
 here we see only want and anans 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:49.280
 stone as for poetry here personally 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.260
 I advise to focus on lightning so 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.310
 how mant is basically you exactly lightning 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.299
 if you use half a kilo of course 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.720
 in principle, everything is clear here too 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:02.140
 move on to the next class 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.880
 this is a demon hunter 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.250
 grand here is the maximum margin 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.690
 concentrations which may be from 9 to 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:14.950
 10 units put here ten 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:17.620
 we can be my 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.870
 as for the demon hunter who is me 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:26.790
 like 4 I have the same trap post 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:29.440
 goal roll each of these two skills 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.310
 adds here such we have super 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.620
 traffic light still has explosive boom 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.920
 which is from 1 to 5 units and huddle 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.790
 the cost of it and of course speed 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.680
 shooting which is 2 to 7 percent 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.040
 add probability of drawing 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.430
 critical strike but as we see here 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.940
 there is only a spiked trap of that 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:59.440
 Called unfortunately sleep here is limited 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:04.090
 so you are at auction 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:07.810
 it's powerful and finding close here everything 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.170
 clear as for the other two 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:14.079
 classes of magician and sorcerer 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:18.669
 here as far as I can judge here as 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:23.139
 would not be popular and special 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:27.789
 sought after and addons stone since these two 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:30.070
 class for exact on speed so i 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:32.940
 here I will not advise you though 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.600
 and a given to me on these characters 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:41.040
 too 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:42.300
 I told you everything, I hope you 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.050
 I do not hope so 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.940
 I am sure that this video helped someone 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:52.050
 use on health 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.550
