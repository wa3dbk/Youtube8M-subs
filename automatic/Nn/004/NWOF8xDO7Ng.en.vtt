00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
short-term problem which is we had to

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.150 
short-term problem which is we had to
spend<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.930> lot<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.110> money<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.680> salvage<00:00:41.070> our

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
auto companies a huge recession which

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.930 
auto companies a huge recession which
drains<00:00:46.110> tax<00:00:46.410> revenue<00:00:46.890> at<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.160> same<00:00:47.399> time<00:00:47.610> it's

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
drains tax revenue at the same time it's

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.639 
drains tax revenue at the same time it's
putting<00:00:48.120> more<00:00:48.329> pressure<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.750> government<00:00:49.289> to

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
putting more pressure on government to

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.639 
putting more pressure on government to

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
for people who have been laid off so we

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.369 
for people who have been laid off so we
have<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> short-term<00:00:56.879> problem<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.719> we<00:00:58.170> also

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
have a short-term problem and we also

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.260 
have a short-term problem and we also
have<00:00:58.559> long-term<00:00:59.070> problem<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.789> short-term

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
have long-term problem the short-term

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.560 
have long-term problem the short-term
problem<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:01.520> dwarfed<00:01:02.520> by<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.030> long-term

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
problem is dwarfed by the long-term

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.460 
problem is dwarfed by the long-term
problem<00:01:04.049> duh<00:01:05.659> he<00:01:06.659> didn't<00:01:06.900> say<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.229> just

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
problem duh he didn't say that I just

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.740 
problem duh he didn't say that I just
threw<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.830> there<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:09.540> long-term

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
threw that in there and the long-term

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.530 
threw that in there and the long-term
problem<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.470> Medicaid<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.040> Medicare<00:01:11.450> if<00:01:12.450> you

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
problem is Medicaid and Medicare if you

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.060 
problem is Medicaid and Medicare if you
don't<00:01:12.720> reduce<00:01:12.960> long-term<00:01:13.200> health<00:01:13.770> care

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
don't reduce long-term health care

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.310 
don't reduce long-term health care
inflation<00:01:14.659> substantially<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.869> can't<00:01:16.140> control

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
inflation substantially we can't control

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.850 
inflation substantially we can't control
the<00:01:17.220> deficit<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:18.750> one<00:01:18.930> option<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:19.710> do

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
the deficit so one option is just do

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.740 
the deficit so one option is just do
nothing<00:01:20.040> we<00:01:20.369> say<00:01:20.400> we'll<00:01:20.970> well<00:01:21.390> it's<00:01:21.600> too

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
nothing we say we'll well it's too

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.030 
nothing we say we'll well it's too
expensive<00:01:21.960> for<00:01:22.290> us<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.619> make<00:01:22.770> short-term

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
expensive for us to make short-term

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.880 
expensive for us to make short-term
investments<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.939> health<00:01:24.900> care<00:01:25.140> we<00:01:25.619> can't

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
investments in health care we can't

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.039 
investments in health care we can't
afford<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.310> we've<00:01:26.790> got<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.210> big<00:01:27.509> deficit

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
afford it we've got this big deficit

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.749 
afford it we've got this big deficit
let's<00:01:28.650> just<00:01:28.740> keep<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.250> health<00:01:29.400> care<00:01:29.579> system

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
let's just keep the health care system

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.520 
let's just keep the health care system
that<00:01:30.090> we've<00:01:30.210> got<00:01:30.420> now<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.869> think<00:01:31.290> that's<00:01:31.439> a

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
that we've got now I think that's a

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.840 
that we've got now I think that's a
great<00:01:31.619> idea<00:01:32.840> along<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.049> trajectory

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
great idea along that trajectory

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.890 
great idea along that trajectory
continuing<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.939> quote<00:01:36.150> along<00:01:36.689> that

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
continuing the quote along that

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.960 
continuing the quote along that
trajectory<00:01:37.049> we<00:01:38.040> will<00:01:38.159> see<00:01:38.310> health<00:01:38.520> care<00:01:38.700> costs

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
trajectory we will see health care costs

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.910 
trajectory we will see health care costs
as<00:01:39.270> an<00:01:39.750> overall<00:01:40.140> share<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.619> our<00:01:40.740> federal

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
as an overall share of our federal

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.789 
as an overall share of our federal
spending<00:01:41.310> grow<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.909> grow<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.090> grow<00:01:42.299> until

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
spending grow and grow and grow until

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.219 
spending grow and grow and grow until
essentially<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:44.009> consumes<00:01:44.399> everything

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.950 

president<00:01:49.229> says<00:01:49.470> we're<00:01:49.860> out<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.009> money<00:01:50.250> now

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
president says we're out of money now

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.859 
president says we're out of money now
and<00:01:51.960> yet<00:01:52.670> he's<00:01:53.670> got<00:01:53.909> us<00:01:54.060> all<00:01:54.210> expecting<00:01:54.780> that

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
and yet he's got us all expecting that

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.389 
and yet he's got us all expecting that
the<00:01:55.020> government<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.500> going<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.799> provide<00:01:56.100> free

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
the government is going to provide free

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.929
