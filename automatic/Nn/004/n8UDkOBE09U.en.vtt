00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.389 
number 2 and I think that my hair is
more<00:01:17.149> like<00:01:17.389> a<00:01:17.420> 1b<00:01:18.049> I<00:01:18.380> don't<00:01:18.740> think<00:01:18.920> it's<00:01:19.069> a<00:01:19.159> 1

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
more like a 1b I don't think it's a 1

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.940 
more like a 1b I don't think it's a 1
but<00:01:19.939> I<00:01:19.999> don't<00:01:20.149> think<00:01:20.299> it's<00:01:20.389> quite<00:01:20.569> a<00:01:20.630> 2<00:01:20.959> but<00:01:21.590> it

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
but I don't think it's quite a 2 but it

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.580 
but I don't think it's quite a 2 but it
works<00:01:22.280> because<00:01:22.789> in<00:01:22.969> the<00:01:23.179> light<00:01:23.479> I<00:01:23.840> have<00:01:24.200> more

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590

wig you guys know that that has been
sent<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.739> me<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.130> so<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:28.090> comes<00:02:28.390> with<00:02:28.540> the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660

hairnet<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.230> I'm<00:02:29.380> thinking<00:02:29.769> that<00:02:29.980> this<00:02:30.160> is

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.979 
hairnet and I'm thinking that this is
what<00:02:30.459> they<00:02:30.580> all<00:02:30.760> do<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.180> I<00:02:31.269> believe<00:02:31.599> that<00:02:31.870> this

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
what they all do and I believe that this

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.309 
what they all do and I believe that this
is<00:02:32.170> in<00:02:32.290> there<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.620> protect<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:33.099> hair<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:33.610> then

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
is in there to protect the hair and then

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.080 
is in there to protect the hair and then
not<00:02:35.319> only<00:02:35.349> is<00:02:35.709> it<00:02:35.739> inside<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.280> hair<00:02:36.459> net<00:02:36.610> but

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
not only is it inside the hair net but

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.520 
not only is it inside the hair net but
it<00:02:37.120> also<00:02:37.390> comes<00:02:37.840> in<00:02:38.170> this<00:02:38.590> plastic<00:02:40.500> like<00:02:41.500> a

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530

it also comes in this plastic like a
plastic<00:02:42.040> bag<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:43.080> then<00:02:44.080> along<00:02:44.500> with<00:02:44.530> that<00:02:44.769> I
