00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.700 
out with it because it's just the way I
draw<00:00:23.039> maybe<00:00:23.550> it's<00:00:23.699> my<00:00:23.820> lack<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.300> ability<00:00:25.230> to

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
draw maybe it's my lack of ability to

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.200 
draw maybe it's my lack of ability to
draw<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.920> realistic<00:00:26.099> or<00:00:26.640> understanding
