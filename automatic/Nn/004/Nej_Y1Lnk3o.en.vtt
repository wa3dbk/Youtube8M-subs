00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.610
 now it does not seem well to me 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.949
 and so people on youtube quiet that 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.810
 cricket and bringing you an easter egg 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.100
 the hit clogs walkthrough 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.340
 the first thing you will have to 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.849
 to do is take my ep and the paralysis 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.680
 box also the monkey bomb and also the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.840
 time bomb to complete this easter 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.669
 ok ok after getting these three 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.710
 equipment being one for each 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.540
 player if you wish 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.640
 you will have to assemble and now the 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.070
 Guillotine guillotine is exactly 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.410
 side of the neighborhood and take care that 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.969
 guillotine parts some of them too 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.010
 they serve for the gallows 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.469
 So I'll show you and where 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.050
 the guillotine parts are the first 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.559
 piece will be on the top of the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.750
 bar lounge and it's a disco it's the disco you 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.109
 They'll need the guillotine. 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.719
 the second piece will be a little bit 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.689
 before you drive and in the tunnels of the 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.360
 and is a roll of yarn that will stick 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.170
 side of this fireplace that's easy to 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.510
 meet 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.760
 the other part that is an antenna one 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.939
 kind of antenna you found 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.860
 inside the barn in that part of 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.200
 now heading for the last piece 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.570
 that is a crystal she will meet there 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.460
 in the upper part where the tunis is 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.070
 side you'll see I 'll wait for you 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.850
 You cool and the other side is going to stay there. 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.759
 in this corner the crystal ok after having pb 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.369
 and placed all the pieces in the guillotine 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.770
 You'll have to warm up and the spheres 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.590
 the first sphere will be there from the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.040
 Bar side is easier to find 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.259
 the second sphere is also 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.159
 side of the church is also not difficult to 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.140
 meet 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.479
 the third sphere you are going to 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.030
 back to the tunnels and 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.009
 she will be staying and soon after one of the 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.869
 right-hand entrances like you 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.060
 You see, we're heating up the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.630
 third sphere and the fourth and last 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.729
 after the house of the witches in the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.780
 return of the houses of the witches when 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.410
 Are you seeing there? 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.440
 after leaving around us and be there 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.170
 the last piece is that you will have the last 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.240
 that you will have to be ok after 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.460
 completing this step will start 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.770
 shining a flashlight on a map 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.600
 the main part of the map and to 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.680
 you get your antenna just play 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.170
 her grenade or use the water to 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.630
 first regan and catch the flashlight 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.450
 after you catch the flashlight you 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.640
 going to the witches' house and 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.350
 after killing one by one 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.080
 You're going to hear that little 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.990
 teaching gradually increasing and 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.350
 When you get it, it 's the last one. 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.620
 the symbol that you will have to put there 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.750
 the flashlight will appear in front of the 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.510
 boat as I am showing you 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.550
 this time in the front of the bar goes 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.670
 show this flashlight 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.160
 just put the flashlight and it will appear 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.620
 the coding that you will have to 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.580
 knock there on the top I'll leave 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.190
 for you guys 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.470
 the code image indicates that I leave 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.290
 for you at the moment is the following each 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.030
 line ds e sign means a name 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.060
 complete of a board but if not 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.280
 need to write down the board completely 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.459
 write down only the first three words 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.490
 there and it will graduate and some plate because 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.560
 all plates start with letters 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:38.040
 then picks up the first three 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.140
 and so you will know the order of 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.330
 hit that plate now that you already 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.100
 knows the quantification of the plates enough 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.950
 use and abortion were not 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.380
 grasshoppers and stab each other 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.470
 code board and then 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.940
 there will appear the sper that would be that light 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.550
 magic as you can see in this 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.190
 moment and each I advise each person 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:03.060
 and the group gets a little scattered in the 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:05.760
 hockey map and the bank of the 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.209
 bar and the guillotine because you will have 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.570
 to pursue that magical light there and every 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:15.000
 one presses or x until it reaches no. 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.070
 place that would be the guillotine if 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.780
 You lose, you have to start. 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.820
 again this procedure 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.820
 You see there the light is going 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:27.000
 Ascend the guillotine at this moment 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.890
 So you completed one step, okay? 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.610
 next step you also hear the 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:35.160
 music on the beat background said 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.120
 completed step now so that you 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.580
 You'll have to do it and light it again. 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.380
 killing a zombie is simple a bis in there 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.360
 You'll have to kill me. 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.750
 and it will increase and those balls 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:52.110
 there the back of the guillotine 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.910
 ok after completing and heating the 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.700
 say so you will have to 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.990
 use the time bomb on top of the 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.500
 guillotine and all the characters 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.510
 will be on the side of the guillotine and 6 you 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.180
 they will have to find the key 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.010
 a kind of key to trigger the 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.010
 guillotine then as if I'm seeing there 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.500
 I luckily got this key though 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.990
 can be random and you will have to 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.420
 to use and the good team in fact the team 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.730
 good if you use it first and only way 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.350
 Escape a little from the zombie is using the 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.890
 monkey bomb so that's what you two 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:29.400
 they need the good huoc right now and 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:32.160
 after passing there the infinity mold you 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.640
 used in your key thought it would be 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.830
 found in the body to trigger aac 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.230
 Latin as you are seeing in this 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.190
 using the key in the 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.830
 guillotine 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.840
 Okay, now you're going to the 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.320
 last part for the penultimate part either 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:52.830
 say stress and most annoying part is 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:56.340
 in this part each port will have colors 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.240
 random red and yellow blue and 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.870
 green 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:03.990
 ok and that each of the characters will have 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.090
 that triggering a port is in a sequence 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.760
 I'll leave a sequence and all the 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.840
 possible sequences in the description of 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.150
 from this video 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.310
 luckily we hit this sequence 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.980
 first, and after doing so 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.050
 just put the coin had in the source and 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.630
 now each of the characters will have to 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:24.270
 hit the targets there on the maps the first 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.670
 target is right in front of you. 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.400
 The bank started demonstrating to you. 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:32.310
 the other target will stay in the house of the 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.440
 witches ok the third target also goes 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.830
 stay more or less in the witches' houses 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.090
 but decent yet 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.120
 The opposite as I'm showing 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:42.850
 in this way for you and last and the most 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:45.040
 Difficult to stay in the neighborhood then 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:48.010
 I advise one who has a little more 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:50.740
 skill and stay inside the boat 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.810
 you can even use the west zone 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:56.140
 even tanks l to complete and 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:58.390
 and if this step is the last thing you 

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:00.610
 You're going to make everybody right. 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:03.250
 the targets and how you will see and in this 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.540
 moment will complete the easter egg 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.270
 I hope you guys really have 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.370
 liked this step by step with others 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:12.160
 I would like to thank you all for you 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:15.520
 those who help not to 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:19.390
 complete this debut and Carlos the defendants 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:21.430
 and also the rank is so obliged to all 

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.950
 You who help there I hope that you 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.780
 really have liked to measure 

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:28.960
 a work to do the editing of this 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:31.750
 video and so that's what I ask 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.100
 your collaboration and a favorite game 

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.950
 to help spread the word 

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:39.510
 Thanks, I'll see you in the next video, peace. 

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.510
 all and even more
