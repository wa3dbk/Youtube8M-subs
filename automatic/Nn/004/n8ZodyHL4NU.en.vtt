00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.180 
the morning itself was quite tense and I
just<00:01:10.600> felt<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:11.170> best<00:01:11.350> way<00:01:11.500> to<00:01:11.590> deal<00:01:11.920> with<00:01:11.950> it

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
just felt the best way to deal with it

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.320 
just felt the best way to deal with it
was<00:01:12.310> get<00:01:12.490> through<00:01:12.729> it<00:01:12.820> as<00:01:12.910> quickly<00:01:13.149> as

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
was get through it as quickly as

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.930 
was get through it as quickly as
possible<00:01:13.780> and<00:01:14.320> not<00:01:14.710> labor<00:01:15.130> and<00:01:15.580> not<00:01:15.610> doing

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
possible and not labor and not doing

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.660 
possible and not labor and not doing
loads<00:01:16.360> of<00:01:16.570> Tanks<00:01:16.990> and<00:01:17.200> just<00:01:17.890> get<00:01:18.340> to<00:01:18.550> the

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
loads of Tanks and just get to the

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.290 
loads of Tanks and just get to the
moment<00:01:18.820> where<00:01:19.149> we<00:01:19.179> could<00:01:19.390> say<00:01:19.509> that's<00:01:19.690> about
