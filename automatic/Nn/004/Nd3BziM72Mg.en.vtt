 of this apple ham for this 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.519
 recipe let's use a thing of 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.250
 urine half a cup of refined sugar 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:38.049

 I want that perfect and the oven 180 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.809
 degrees you hear in what we do the 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.430
 mix let's make I want me to 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.799
 talk more about this roll that I 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.049
 aesthetic apart was saying something of 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:59.270
 what are you practicing right now 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:02.930
 picture something about him 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:07.670
 and food as your way of healing 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:10.040
 as you look more than how to heal yourself 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.760
 making a recipe serves as therapy 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.640
 occupational and is to give you a taste 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.380
 same then one of the rules that I 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.750
 I always use in the kitchen and I'm 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.820
 in my classes is if there is something that you do not 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.800
 you like you do not have to cook it 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.850
 because you're never going to be left with something 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.430
 I never cook, I do not like it, it's liver 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.740
 to me you put to cook liver'm not going 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.020
 I do not even know the touch, I'm going to do it 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.840
 reluctantly and it does not give you happiness I've 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.360
 tried it we tried it but doing it I have 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.610
 I tried to make a new one but I did not 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.300
 it's because you do not like the good thing 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.430
 we have flour flour butter and 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.890
 Sugar sauces sugary sugars but 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.850
 What we do is mix everything with the 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.000
 hands ok 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.940
 until there is one 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.580
 like a little cake that is what we are going to 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.190
 put up the apples that's why 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.229
 it's called cromwell thrombi are crumbs 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:09.649
 that gives a thrombus the sweet is where it says 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:13.680
 this dish is of English origin 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.780
 introduced in the USA by the pioneers and 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.940
 it is something very well very practical indeed 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.440
 they already do it in the schools the children and 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.880
 is what they start with but for 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.000
 motor skills to children is also 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.000

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.480
 a person when he says is because of a 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.480

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.549
 which is an excellent exfoliant 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.750
 so it's good to wash your hands 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:25.280
 before you start doing 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.280

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.319
 I expose lemon puts lemon on them 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.870
 I also put this lemon of people 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.090
 that you soak them in ice water 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:58.049
 and I also know of people who put them with 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:01.410
 Milk this but I also how do you 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:04.709

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.170
 yes with vinegar any means like that 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.540
 neutralizer is good so that it does not 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.900
 do they were the most ways here the 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.900
 parts 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:17.570
 if this that follows I did it well if very 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.150

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.300
 monument and the apple no longer takes 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.830
 sugar , I've got more eyes 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.040
 recipe I like it costs and for 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.380
 what because they carry less than half 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.200
 or less than half the sugar that 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.580
 I have seen in other recipes that is very 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.890
 good data because then the excess 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.630
 Sugar is not good for health is that 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:48.530
 sugar in general is not good for 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.060
 health is not that this recipe is fatal 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.260
 you can customize it you can put 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.260
 cinnamon vanilla 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.640
