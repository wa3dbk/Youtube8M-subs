00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.230
 good 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.630
 good week champions and is 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.970
 tremendously vibrant because we are in 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.430
 the quarter -final phase and with three 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.740
 Spanish teams then populating for 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.240
 get to wembley to dispute the great 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:30.090
 final as the first game that is 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.669
 in liza is the PAN in Yemen against the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.559
 fc barcelona and my friends in live 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.720
 They want to know what my prognosis is for 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.390
 this game and especially not the 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.449
 eliminatory the 90 minutes are the 90 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.580
 minutes then and went up in the park the 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.979
 principles to watch the game sometimes 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.690
 in a hundred versus valence is true 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:52.440
 that ibra did not play because he was 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.210
 sanctioned having been thus 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.420
 edge adam in first match with a 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.059
 Mestalla red card now seems 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.530
 sana yemen is a football team that 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.350
 he has great footballers but I do not see 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.659
 a whole all-in-one team is 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.770
 true that he is a leader in the league 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:17.070
 French but for me still 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.079
 has an itch that did not scratch 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.390
 I think that team that is very 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:24.509
 combined his game is usually 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.819
 search for ibra ibra guanta balones or aina 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.189
 balls give footballs to other players 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:32.340
 as the look is maura that is a 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.829
 Brazilian soccer player very fast very 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.140
 skillful a little individualistic for me 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.539
 maybe not taste but he made a football 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.090
 seat then dangerous as is the kiss the 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.850
 Argentinian who came from Naples 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.009
 and he knows how to play football well is also 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.729
 true and given moments I see you with 7 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.189
 appears laziness now that's sustainable 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.149
 because in the middle of the field they have in 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.079
 instead of bringing very eloquent players 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.020
 they have pawns of struggle 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.170
 there is a matuidi that really is a sea 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.569
 that the big investment may be needed 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.569
 some first-touch precision that 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:12.750
 he has makelele but really matuidi is 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.090
 a formidable battle pawn but also 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.790
 next door has other anton which is more 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.810
 well pawn of brega has two central 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.090
 one that I liked very much that is 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.630
 the other álex that I like a tad less 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.209
 or maybe because I imagine that against 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.190
 rather small rivals because they have 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.620
 difficulties I still remember when 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.340
 álex militated the chelsea had 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.390
 difficulties before the enquista and the 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.720
 leones mexico 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.330
 for exist or let's say not therefore a 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.640
 good set a set of 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.700
 expensive and good players but I do not think 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.940
 which is altogether combined therefore 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.890
 I see the favorite FC Barcelona that 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.370
 located in paris 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:04.190
 now the quotes the victory of 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:05.900
 psg pays four euros 60,000 my friends 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.750
 de vigo urge of the same notion that I 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.920
 it's not that the favorite barça draw the 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.830
 tie pays three euros 70 I think that 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.630
 It is generous because it can be given 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.060
 But I'm going to bet on football 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.900
 barça that pays one euro 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.060
 72 and if anything I laugh 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.450
 it's kind of generous there's also for me one 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.450
