with<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.539> Sumi<00:00:27.779> brush<00:00:27.989> you<00:00:28.169> can<00:00:28.349> transfer<00:00:28.919> over

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
with a Sumi brush you can transfer over

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.299 
with a Sumi brush you can transfer over
to<00:00:29.399> other<00:00:30.239> drawing<00:00:30.899> materials<00:00:31.380> also<00:00:31.919> dry

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
to other drawing materials also dry

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.710 
to other drawing materials also dry
drawing<00:00:32.850> materials<00:00:33.300> like<00:00:33.480> for<00:00:33.660> example

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
drawing materials like for example

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.910 
drawing materials like for example
chalks<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.730> even<00:00:35.730> charcoal<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.900> this<00:00:37.710> is

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
chalks and even charcoal so this is

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.740 
chalks and even charcoal so this is
something<00:00:38.699> that<00:00:38.850> somewhere<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.360> between<00:00:39.510> a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
colors and we're going to get to some of

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.220 
colors and we're going to get to some of
those<00:00:49.230> colors<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:50.180> little<00:00:51.180> later<00:00:51.480> but<00:00:51.690> first<00:00:51.899> I

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
those colors a little later but first I

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.900 
those colors a little later but first I
just<00:00:52.289> want<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.829> show<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.070> I'm<00:00:53.550> going<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.760> take

just want to show you I'm going to take

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.540 
just want to show you I'm going to take
that<00:00:54.149> Zen<00:00:54.420> approach<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:55.109> the<00:00:55.620> brush<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.129> I'm

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
that Zen approach of the brush and I'm

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.110 
that Zen approach of the brush and I'm
going<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.789> apply<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.800> as<00:00:58.800> if<00:00:59.579> this<00:00:59.820> were

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
going to apply it to as if this were

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.549 
going to apply it to as if this were
brush<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:01.940> just<00:01:02.940> very<00:01:03.329> quickly<00:01:03.539> be<00:01:04.259> able<00:01:04.289> to

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
brush and just very quickly be able to

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.790 
brush and just very quickly be able to
get<00:01:05.550> a<00:01:05.580> kind<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.970> abstract<00:01:06.800> gesture

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
get a kind of abstract gesture

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:24.140 
get a kind of abstract gesture
impression<00:01:08.550> of<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.630> pose<00:01:09.869> here<00:01:10.200> we<00:01:10.320> go

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.030 

now<00:01:25.150> one<00:01:25.630> of<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:25.840> keys<00:01:26.050> to<00:01:26.080> this<00:01:26.320> is<00:01:26.740> that<00:01:26.920> I'm

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
now one of the keys to this is that I'm

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.830 
now one of the keys to this is that I'm
twisting<00:01:27.550> and<00:01:27.700> turning<00:01:27.850> it<00:01:28.150> just<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.630> same

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
twisting and turning it just the same

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:39.950 
twisting and turning it just the same
way<00:01:28.900> I<00:01:29.080> would<00:01:29.320> a<00:01:29.830> brush

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.930 

and<00:01:40.960> all<00:01:41.380> those<00:01:41.530> twists<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.070> turns<00:01:42.250> I'm<00:01:42.610> aware

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
and all those twists and turns I'm aware

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.150 
and all those twists and turns I'm aware
of<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.360> edge<00:01:43.510> of<00:01:43.870> this<00:01:44.170> chalk<00:01:44.500> just<00:01:44.530> like<00:01:44.980> I

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
of the edge of this chalk just like I

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:52.470 
of the edge of this chalk just like I
would<00:01:45.220> be<00:01:45.610> with<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:46.450> brush<00:01:50.400> and<00:01:51.400> I<00:01:52.150> have<00:01:52.330> to

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
would be with the brush and I have to

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.440 
would be with the brush and I have to
change<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:53.170> angle<00:01:53.620> of<00:01:53.860> my<00:01:53.920> wrist<00:01:54.670> and<00:01:54.970> arm

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
change the angle of my wrist and arm

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.630 
change the angle of my wrist and arm
it's<00:01:55.720> really<00:01:55.990> a<00:01:56.020> very<00:01:56.080> athletic<00:01:56.500> kind<00:01:57.250> of<00:01:57.430> an

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
it's really a very athletic kind of an

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.900 
it's really a very athletic kind of an
experience<00:01:58.540> here<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:02.290> of<00:02:02.470> course<00:02:02.640> it's<00:02:03.640> all

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
experience here and of course it's all

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:13.590 
experience here and of course it's all
based<00:02:04.240> on<00:02:04.770> using<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.890> eye<00:02:12.240> if<00:02:13.240> I'm<00:02:13.420> unsure

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
based on using the eye if I'm unsure

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.630 
based on using the eye if I'm unsure
then<00:02:14.050> I<00:02:14.170> might<00:02:14.350> just<00:02:14.380> slow<00:02:14.770> down<00:02:15.070> just<00:02:15.400> for<00:02:15.610> a

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
then I might just slow down just for a

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.310 
then I might just slow down just for a
minute<00:02:15.760> just<00:02:15.910> so<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.450> know<00:02:16.600> I've<00:02:16.959> got<00:02:16.990> my

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
minute just so I know I've got my

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:24.420 
minute just so I know I've got my
bearings<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:18.010> I'm<00:02:18.640> in<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.910> right<00:02:19.060> spot<00:02:19.510> but<00:02:23.430> I

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
bearings and I'm in the right spot but I

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.330 
bearings and I'm in the right spot but I
hope<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.840> camera<00:02:26.110> shows<00:02:26.500> how<00:02:26.860> much<00:02:27.040> of<00:02:27.250> the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
hope the camera shows how much of the

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.910 
hope the camera shows how much of the
time<00:02:27.550> my<00:02:28.330> eye<00:02:28.600> is<00:02:28.930> spent<00:02:29.290> on<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.790> figure<00:02:31.150> as

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
time my eye is spent on the figure as

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.949 
time my eye is spent on the figure as
opposed<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.040> how<00:02:33.220> much<00:02:33.370> is<00:02:33.610> spent<00:02:33.700> looking<00:02:36.959> at

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
opposed to how much is spent looking at

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.790 
opposed to how much is spent looking at
the<00:02:38.080> page<00:02:39.690> because<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.780> whole<00:02:40.930> idea<00:02:41.260> is<00:02:41.560> to

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
the page because the whole idea is to

00:02:41.800 --> 00:03:08.490 
the page because the whole idea is to
keep<00:02:41.980> your<00:02:42.130> eye<00:02:42.190> on<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:43.060> figure

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.030 

and<00:03:09.250> just<00:03:09.790> that<00:03:09.970> quickly<00:03:10.410> using<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.590> gesture

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
and just that quickly using the gesture

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.900 
and just that quickly using the gesture
approach<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:13.500> this<00:03:14.500> magnificent<00:03:15.250> very

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
approach and this magnificent very

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.640 
approach and this magnificent very
wonderful<00:03:16.690> charcoal<00:03:17.910> chunky<00:03:19.320> you<00:03:20.320> can<00:03:20.500> get

wonderful charcoal chunky you can get

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.990 
wonderful charcoal chunky you can get
the<00:03:20.770> figure<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.250> appear<00:03:23.100> so<00:03:24.100> you<00:03:24.580> gotta<00:03:24.760> try

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
the figure to appear so you gotta try

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.060 
the figure to appear so you gotta try
this
