00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.330

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.430
 a very dear 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.340
 because in this was when I started as a 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.350

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.300

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.520
 line of fact I 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.320
 I saw a lot of maryland that in that 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.890
 then it was like boom and success 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.330
 because I had fights and this one in this 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.780
 I also have a very special affection 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.300
 because I used to collect events 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.490
 legal events nothing of xàbia 2 or nothing 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.400
 then it was a fart like very very 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.020
 special and that's why not then in this 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.400
 if I have enough enough events 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:56.400
 pure legal so to speak this and 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.099
 well, good 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.110
 how much love in this I bought nothing 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.549
 more equal not to have both in the 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.480
 that if I want to buy to play the 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:09.840
 East Island the excitement 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:14.780
 montero as it is called the Chinese drift 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.780
 what is called memory 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:22.360
 I do not remember what it's called 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.430
 platinum clear platinum this I want 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.229
 play it because he gave me and gave me a lot 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.259
 curious to know what I can with what to go 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:31.870
 to China and the distorted world I think 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:33.550
 which is called in this person in this was 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.220
 where my first pokemon saint came out 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.330
 that makes a good video uploaded 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.370
 on YouTube but how I recorded it 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.430
 with my cell phone and it was a very very quality 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.990
 horrible I decided to erase I think that 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.630
 still if I turn it on I can find it 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.069
 he was my first shiny this just ends 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.680
 to start the story and I got a 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:52.900
 Poni Taiana then that's why 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.009
 I also want to say it because it was my 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.999
 first legal dream 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:00.979
 and then let's go with the remake of this one 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:03.680
 I bought the heart gold because I always 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.839
 liked game and kiss me more and as 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.029
 it's cooler than lubia but it's more I'm going 

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:09.259
 and I like more lubia but good 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:11.629
 I bought a special edition indeed 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:13.699
 when it came out in this then then I called 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:15.499
 game planet and I told them that they can not 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.149
 set aside a website there and I arrived as 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:21.050
 in 10 minutes in the then I brought my 

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:23.509
 car and I went flying and good for 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.669
 to be able to get this beauty 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:28.550
 in the east the pokéwalker that you could 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.919
 walk and this and train your poems 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:34.069
 of their gained experience and so then 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:36.259
 it was very cool this and finally the 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:38.499
 fifth generation with which I already entered 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:42.229
 fully to play competitively 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:44.659
 it was this wild pokemon with which I 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:47.599
 I started in fact in this I do not have a 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:49.580
 story as very very curious because my 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:53.059
 Pokemon could not know them because 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.409
 had an air 4 then there was I do not think 

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:57.169
 I had a page where you 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:59.689
 they sent and you put this configuration go you 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:00.889
 internet and you could download them then 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:02.360
 it was with this one that I started playing 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:05.310
 in a competitive way 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:08.640
 if they look for my videos in the first 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.890
 battle I have a pretty random team and 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.510
 was with this in an original way in the 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.760
 first battles where you see the quality 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.410
 I'm recording with the camera, and 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.870
 well finally I bought white room 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.580
 because I wanted this to see what fart with the 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.400
 story because he had played black to 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.280
 Japanese and I uploaded the let's play and said 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.590
 well let's buy us 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.460
 and apart they recommend or if you bought yourself 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.110
 white 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.090
 you must share white a to follow 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.410
 the story is to see what wave and the 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.760
 I really liked it a lot 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:40.130
 and then I bought my r4 with this and 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.940
 until then he did not start up battles of 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.090
 competitive way 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.870
 Then it was there when all my 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.550
 from here 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:50.520
 this ice pokemon was when it started 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.770
 all my story about the fun of pokemon 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.350
 they really have been quite enough 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.660
 years which I have enjoyed 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:00.210
 too much and I've learned a lot already 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:04.320
 the date I do not follow, I keep doing it and 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:05.730
 because nothing that's everything what 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.620
 what I wanted to share with you 

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.270
 maybe I do not know the biggest collection nor 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.850
 nothing, but at least the games are the 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.550
 that matter and that is why this me 

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.750
 I decided to make videos but well this has 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.340
