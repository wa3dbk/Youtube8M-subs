00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:50.679 
are the three things we're looking to on
game<00:01:49.340> day<00:01:49.520> play<00:01:49.909> hard<00:01:50.090> play<00:01:50.149> together<00:01:50.420> have

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
game day play hard play together have

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:51.999 
game day play hard play together have
fun<00:01:50.720> and<00:01:51.110> I<00:01:51.320> think<00:01:51.500> we<00:01:51.560> did<00:01:51.680> all<00:01:51.829> those<00:01:51.950> things

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
fun and I think we did all those things

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.069 
fun and I think we did all those things
we<00:01:52.759> overcame<00:01:53.180> some<00:01:53.420> of<00:01:53.540> our<00:01:53.600> own<00:01:53.689> mistakes

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
we overcame some of our own mistakes

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.300 
we overcame some of our own mistakes
along<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:54.409> way<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:54.710> I<00:01:54.799> think<00:01:54.979> that's<00:01:55.130> good

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
along the way and I think that's good

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.740 
along the way and I think that's good
for<00:01:55.430> us<00:01:55.490> I<00:01:55.610> think<00:01:55.670> that<00:01:55.880> is<00:01:56.270> going<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.540> make<00:01:56.600> us

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
for us I think that is going to make us

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.090 
for us I think that is going to make us
a<00:01:56.990> stronger<00:01:57.229> team<00:01:57.439> I<00:01:57.649> think<00:01:57.890> it<00:01:57.950> demonstrates

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
a stronger team I think it demonstrates

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.969 
a stronger team I think it demonstrates
a<00:01:58.549> character<00:01:58.969> of<00:01:59.180> this<00:01:59.570> team<00:01:59.780> our<00:02:00.649> theme<00:02:00.950> of

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
a character of this team our theme of

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.889 
a character of this team our theme of
this<00:02:01.159> season<00:02:01.520> is<00:02:01.640> character<00:02:02.000> counts<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:02.540> and

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
this season is character counts and and

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.600 
this season is character counts and and
I<00:02:03.079> think<00:02:03.259> you<00:02:03.350> saw<00:02:03.560> that<00:02:03.770> here<00:02:04.159> today<00:02:04.430> in<00:02:04.579> the

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
I think you saw that here today in the

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.370 
I think you saw that here today in the
way<00:02:04.759> we<00:02:04.880> overcame<00:02:05.270> you<00:02:05.630> know<00:02:05.750> adversity<00:02:06.020> a

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
way we overcame you know adversity a

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.440 
way we overcame you know adversity a
great<00:02:06.770> stand<00:02:07.070> by<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.340> defense<00:02:07.820> you<00:02:08.239> know<00:02:08.390> in

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
great stand by the defense you know in

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.150 
great stand by the defense you know in
the<00:02:08.539> second<00:02:08.899> half<00:02:09.080> and<00:02:09.259> particularly<00:02:09.709> at<00:02:10.039> the

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
the second half and particularly at the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.729 
the second half and particularly at the
end<00:02:10.310> you<00:02:11.180> know<00:02:11.270> we<00:02:11.720> you<00:02:12.230> know<00:02:12.319> I<00:02:12.349> starting<00:02:12.709> to

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
end you know we you know I starting to

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.170 
end you know we you know I starting to
get<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:12.920> little<00:02:12.980> bit<00:02:13.160> nervous<00:02:13.489> when<00:02:13.520> you<00:02:13.970> know

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
get a little bit nervous when you know

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.789 
get a little bit nervous when you know
we<00:02:14.239> let<00:02:14.390> them<00:02:14.510> convert<00:02:14.810> on<00:02:14.989> fourth<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:15.319> 11<00:02:15.680> we

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 
we let them convert on fourth and 11 we

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:17.470 
we let them convert on fourth and 11 we
let<00:02:15.950> them<00:02:16.010> convert<00:02:16.310> on<00:02:16.489> 3rd<00:02:16.519> and<00:02:16.819> 11<00:02:16.849> I<00:02:17.269> think

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
let them convert on 3rd and 11 I think

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.360
