00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.320
 in the winners market more 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.930
 importance in the world also for 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.850
 compact off-road vehicles offered by the 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.700
 great whistle and also the manufacturers 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.700
 Germans are not left behind especially 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:28.200
 volkswagen with the tiguan these two are 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.200
 the candidates in the comparison 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.360
 first we tried the fox bag in old 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.559
 the box of seven dsg changes and the 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.620
 full attraction give a very good 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.770
 sensation 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.770
 the 4x4 makes sense above all to field 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.590
 Naughty shallow waters are not 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.710
 any problem for the tiguan distance 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.530
 to the ground 20 centimeters the turning radius 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.530
 12 meters is acceptable for the city 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.220
 but in narrow forest paths you can 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.220
 be annoying 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.510
 the classical sv suzuki great vitara not 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.250
 It has to fear the taiwan as 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.930
 to the equipment in the suzuki there is no 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.060
 what complaining comes with air 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.740
 optionally also with 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.330
 a browser to be that brings a box 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.940
 Reduction and differential lock 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.950
 central everything that is needed to field 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.289
 cables 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.899
 a stream is not a problem either 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:31.600
 for the great vitara the total attraction 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.670
 the distribution of force comes as standard 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.969
 between the axes can be set in 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.950
 each 50 percent with a radius of 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.789
 rotation of 11 meters is somewhat more flexible 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.789
 that the tiguan 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.869
 it is natural already a place to load have 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.119
 both cars in sufficient quantity in the 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.159
 suzuki grand vitara the tailgate will 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.470
 opens to the side is very good 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.140
 because it can be closed again with 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.689
 comfort but it takes a lot of place 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.539
 behind the vehicle the load volume 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:13.440
 if it is 400 liters if they are folded 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.920
 seats and it's loaded up to the ceiling thousand 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.920
 386 liters 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.799
 The tiguan has a trunk that opens 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.140
 up to close it you have to 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:29.170
 get high cargo volume 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.920
 well 470 liters with the back bench 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.980
 folding 1500 liters by the bottom is 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.420
 indicates 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.420
 back to the route 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.819
 inside the suzuki comes with few 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.489
 Decorative elements around the 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.530
 plastic ventilation silver the same 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.380
 around the speedometer and on the 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.010
 shifter chrome parts but 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.690
 that's all in regards to noble aspect of 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.000
 the optics 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.870
 the version with a gasoline engine of 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.790
 24 liters and 124 kilowatts of power 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:13.090
 costs in Germany 27 thousand 190 euros 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.490
 approved consumption 8.8 liters of 95 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.500
 octane in practice you get to about 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.500
 10 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:27.230
 the behavior of the suzuki could be 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.420
 more direct you have the impression that 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:34.359
 it is dominated in the route but in the case 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.359
 of tiguan the feeling is something better 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.860
 back to taiwan the confirmation is confirmed 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.860
 first positive impression 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.150
 the item is sold, the material is good 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.270
 used is of good quality does not leave 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.750
 nothing to be desired all soft the impression 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.750
 it's good 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.359
 also the benefits are adequate 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:06.329
 Acceleration from 0 to 100 83 seconds 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:08.579
 Approved consumption 86 liters of 95 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:12.439
 octane but that is achieved only if it 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.439
 drives very thrifty mind 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.139
 in the direction in the tiguan is not 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:23.280
 sporty but direct and transmits a 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.280
 good contact with the ground 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.860
 in summary the tiguan is a solid sv 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.230
 for the cross-country route the suzuki 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.810
 it is surpassed by the gearbox and the 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.730
 central differential lock but in 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.900
 Regarding finishing and fruity qualities 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.900
 the tiguan is imposed
