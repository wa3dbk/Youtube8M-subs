00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.920 
the bastard I'm completely okay between
thinking<00:04:48.389> and<00:04:48.690> so<00:04:49.970> but<00:04:50.970> I<00:04:51.060> don't<00:04:51.270> understand

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.700 

where's<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.139> power<00:04:55.379> from<00:04:55.949> the<00:04:56.099> first<00:04:56.370> time

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
where's the power from the first time

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.580 
where's the power from the first time
thinking<00:04:58.710> with<00:04:59.490> who<00:04:59.729> take<00:04:59.970> position<00:05:00.599> life<00:05:00.990> of

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
thinking with who take position life of

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.260 
thinking with who take position life of
the<00:05:01.770> first<00:05:02.039> time<00:05:02.340> is<00:05:03.090> the<00:05:03.300> thinking

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.809 

well<00:05:07.870> I<00:05:08.319> think<00:05:08.620> I<00:05:09.069> don't<00:05:09.250> think<00:05:09.490> you<00:05:09.639> can

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:09.819

separate<00:05:10.389> I<00:05:10.780> think<00:05:11.620> one<00:05:12.180> girl<00:05:13.180> is<00:05:13.360> the<00:05:13.509> long

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
separate I think one girl is the long

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.290 
separate I think one girl is the long
with<00:05:14.020> you<00:05:14.199> I<00:05:14.680> don't<00:05:15.160> think<00:05:15.430> no<00:05:15.789> matter<00:05:16.030> how

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300
