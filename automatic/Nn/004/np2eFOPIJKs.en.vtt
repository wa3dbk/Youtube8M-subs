you<00:02:07.560> take<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:08.130> and<00:02:08.660> because<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.899> knife<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.500> a

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
you take it and because this knife is a

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.130 
you take it and because this knife is a
little<00:02:10.950> bigger<00:02:11.250> than<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.630> give<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.080> a

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
glance and if you can see there's a

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.150 
glance and if you can see there's a
little<00:02:17.130> bit<00:02:17.520> of<00:02:18.319> move<00:02:19.319> that<00:02:19.530> backs<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:20.040> can

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
little bit of move that backs you can

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.089 
little bit of move that backs you can
see<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.340> little<00:02:20.489> better<00:02:21.290> just<00:02:22.290> about<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.830> type

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
it is about a 15 degree angle I believe

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.270 
it is about a 15 degree angle I believe
but<00:02:26.730> just<00:02:27.360> pretend<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:28.080> have<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.319> dime<00:02:28.650> taped

it you can do it a little faster than

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.550 
it you can do it a little faster than
that<00:02:37.830> but<00:02:38.190> slide<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.209> this<00:02:39.239> way<00:02:39.630> you<00:02:40.260> never
