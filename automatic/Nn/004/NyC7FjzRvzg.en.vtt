00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.019
 flew wonderful 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.620
 budget dvuhsimochny flash drive and all 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:17.779
 such a 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:21.890
 there is still a seal but 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:27.660
 free of charge no official 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:30.289
 we hardly have his nest so we 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.289
 extract 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:38.570
 bolts here are 8 of them 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:59.379
 Han way can also nail 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.280
 steelless plastic without plastic 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:09.659
 stays down 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:14.770
 to which the technology has come to do this you need 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:18.340
 but it's very easy we shoot here 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.450
 antenna contacts watering it as usual 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:34.810
 sometimes lenovo no he stayed here 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:42.210
 debug or postpone further to us 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:48.390
 need to repair the nest therefore the clasp 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:57.670
 mother's folder disconnected here is one 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:02:01.770
 the bolt of the lower part and slightly above 1 removed 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:06.190
 watering it here it is and the antenna 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.399
 delayed sensor litmus test 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:15.569
 water sensor plan here it was not white 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:23.580
 there would be a cherry remove the buttons 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:23.580
 so mango would get them unstuck 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:42.049
 and unplug the power button is also easy 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:42.049
 pulled out flew a little distracted us 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:51.480
 here someone was already insulating tape 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:56.420
 rather weakly sticked already something 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:03:01.829
 repaired we lifted a fastener and we took 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:06.200
 this little train is next 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.200
 the case is from bangs 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:21.590
 here there is one bolt put it off 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:21.590
 Separately better Well, in general, then slowly 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:33.019
 can i have another bolt 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:37.280
 in length they may differ therefore 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.280
 also separate it 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.659
 and raise 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:03.760
 here is a close photo from glued in 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:10.940
 bottom of the rather dangerous 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:11.739
 set trail trying to crawl to 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:19.190
 him 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:23.389
 raise the fastener and very slowly 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:29.979
 slowly recoverable from planting 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:36.070
 places here actually all days will die a 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:36.070
 the fee is removed the socket will be soldered to repair 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:45.669
 here on the board 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:45.669
 hearing this speaker is a loop stitch 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.390
 here she is 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:07.800
 santosh we put it back 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:12.190
 display buckle display plume and 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:15.580
 the last thing we shot was the same 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:20.920
 pathetic antenna i think contacts 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:22.380
 polyphonic dynamics here it is to 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.760
 remove the display from here 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:29.110
 we need initially 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.250
 it is desirable to blow on the slips from the hair dryer 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:35.410
 make this part pretty warm 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.420
 then the tape installed on the ridge 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:43.020
 will become weaker and after that you can 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:46.060
 ordinary plastic to hook and slowly 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:51.450
 peel off turn over so we are with him 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.450
 touch then remove the display
