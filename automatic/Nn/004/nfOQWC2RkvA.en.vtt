00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.160
 hello everyone that I hope you 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.360
 okay I'm really great 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.980
 well it is with pleasure that I can 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.480
 go back to China apix aca fr 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.980
 for you commented rich shelter because by 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.780
 the cause on mattel may have been beta 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.039
 for this video is the cause of 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.570
 montreux mends below the map 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.039
 in two different ways you go 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.810
 see that it's really super nice for 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.580
 start the first way you will have to 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.710
 take a helicopter by this problem 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.670
 route closed by the cause then 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.349
 you will have to your right 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.240
 a building that is not textured and in 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.189
 down you will have to go below this 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.809
 building so in hair group below 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.210
 be careful of walls kg in water 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.430
 because if you touch helicopter will exhibit 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.719
 so you really have to go all the way to 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.250
 true end in a very short time 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.870
 why you have to go all the way 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.670
 then once you are all 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.100
 stand up you go down helicopter 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.969
 and hurry to run in front of you 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.890
 you have 10 seconds 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.739
 normally if five seconds you 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.660
 should be able to go all the way to 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.640
 go all the way simply because 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.910
 if you do not have everything at the end I think 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.039
 that you may not have time in 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.690
 10 seconds to go here then once 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.369
 here you will have to go left then 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.740
 go right to get closer to the 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.720
 more possible kangaroo card 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.979
 then once here you already have 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.270
 finished the glitch so some 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.890
 could say that these rotten the 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.420
 game but honestly I would not say 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.759
 this because it's a beta using a beta 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.290
 is to collect 1 bugs for them 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.330
 for developers to be able to 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.880
 correct maybe even that it takes a 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.580
 beta for crops I do not 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.869
 so honestly it's a beta so I 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.479
 think you totally agree 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.220
 with me you would rather excuse to see this 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.380
 wild glitch explains normal date or 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.630
 is fighting and effective beta we agree 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.610
 to find death on the beta for 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.200
 that like that on leaks is normal 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.729
 there was no longer 8 hp so here it is 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.290
 I hope that to start this first 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.479
 game you will have pleased we will now 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.369
 go to second goal 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.320
 so the second one will consist of going into 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.700
 a shop that you can do but 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.079
 with a grid so it's really 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.790
 super important the magazine of really 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.649
 to do but with a grid then 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.119
 once here you will need to get started 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.520
 open the shop 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.310
 basically you open the city and that's it 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.990
 then you will have to close it and run 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.610
 and as quickly as possible 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.009
 below the grid is normally you 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.619
 know how to place you underneath lying down and 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.610
 this will take you below the 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.290
 table you will see that in very little 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.030
 of time 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.739
 the assaulted actually doing you're going 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.659
 to be lying down and the grid pushes you 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.829
 at the same time below the map it's 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:20.420
 Truly unbelievable 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.040
 so that's it's sight on his mac have 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.780
 finished I hope this video 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.250
 to accompany you will have pleased you was not 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.319
 manufacturers by a little trick on the 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.489
 chain does not go by the cos and why not 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.569
 also mine and I tell you to 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.959
 very mature for future videos 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.959
 go bye
