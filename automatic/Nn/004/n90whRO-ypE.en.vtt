hi<00:00:00.719> I'm<00:00:00.960> Paul<00:00:01.199> an<00:00:01.469> application<00:00:02.010> engineer<00:00:02.370> here

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
hi I'm Paul an application engineer here

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:03.830 
hi I'm Paul an application engineer here
at<00:00:02.580> national<00:00:03.000> semiconductor<00:00:03.240> and<00:00:03.750> the

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
at national semiconductor and the

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.690 
at national semiconductor and the
precision<00:00:04.140> Products<00:00:04.589> Group<00:00:04.650> and<00:00:05.310> today<00:00:05.580> I'd

precision Products Group and today I'd

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.220 
precision Products Group and today I'd
like<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.879> show<00:00:06.120> you<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.270> little<00:00:06.569> scale<00:00:06.839> I<00:00:06.870> built

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
like to show you a little scale I built

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.190 
like to show you a little scale I built
a<00:00:07.490> while<00:00:08.490> ago<00:00:08.760> one<00:00:09.090> of<00:00:09.179> my<00:00:09.300> bosses<00:00:09.540> challenged

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
a while ago one of my bosses challenged

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.770 
a while ago one of my bosses challenged
me<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.590> be<00:00:11.099> able<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.490> weigh<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:13.130> eyelash<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.780> I

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
me to be able to weigh a eyelash and I

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.420 
me to be able to weigh a eyelash and I
did<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> little<00:00:16.440> research<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.949> little<00:00:17.160> digging

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
did a little research a little digging

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.330 
did a little research a little digging
and<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.609> came<00:00:17.880> up<00:00:18.000> with<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.210> little<00:00:18.570> method

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
and I came up with this little method

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.470 
and I came up with this little method
the<00:00:20.340> trick<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.699> use<00:00:20.990> the<00:00:23.240> the<00:00:24.240> movement

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
the trick is to use the the movement

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.810 
the trick is to use the the movement
from<00:00:24.750> an<00:00:24.930> old<00:00:25.080> panel<00:00:25.439> meter<00:00:25.619> as<00:00:25.830> part<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.670> an

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
from an old panel meter as part of an

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.790 
from an old panel meter as part of an
electrode<00:00:27.180> balance<00:00:27.480> scale<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:28.109> what<00:00:28.289> we<00:00:28.380> do<00:00:28.529> is

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
electrode balance scale so what we do is

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.339 
electrode balance scale so what we do is
we<00:00:29.010> take<00:00:29.939> out<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.300> meter<00:00:30.480> movement<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.050> use

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
we take out the meter movement and use

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.229 
we take out the meter movement and use
the<00:00:31.800> meter<00:00:32.669> needle<00:00:33.480> as<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.690> balance<00:00:34.469> as<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
the meter needle as a balance as the

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.310 
the meter needle as a balance as the
beam<00:00:36.770> so<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:38.210> found<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.300> old<00:00:39.510> panel<00:00:39.809> meter<00:00:39.989> and

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
beam so I found this old panel meter and

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.869 
beam so I found this old panel meter and
I<00:00:41.219> removed<00:00:42.440> the<00:00:43.520> center<00:00:44.520> portion<00:00:44.989> and

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
I removed the center portion and

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.279 
I removed the center portion and
liberate<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.120> become<00:00:48.390> part<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.690> my<00:00:48.809> project

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
liberate it to become part of my project

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.250 
liberate it to become part of my project
and<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.399> how<00:00:50.489> we<00:00:50.550> do<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:51.020> we<00:00:52.020> take<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
and this is how we do it we take the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.830 
and this is how we do it we take the
meter<00:00:52.649> movement<00:00:52.920> out<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.789> meter<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.239> turn

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
meter movement out of the meter and turn

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.369 
meter movement out of the meter and turn
it<00:00:54.960> horizontally<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:57.600> needle<00:00:58.079> now

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
it horizontally and the needle now

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.340 
it horizontally and the needle now
becomes<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.920> beam<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.539> from<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.719> beam<00:01:00.930> we

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
becomes the beam and from this beam we

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.509 
becomes the beam and from this beam we
attach<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.829> shutter<00:01:02.129> which<00:01:02.879> goes<00:01:03.090> down<00:01:03.359> into<00:01:03.719> a

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
attach a shutter which goes down into a

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.230 
attach a shutter which goes down into a
photo<00:01:05.519> detector<00:01:06.680> which<00:01:07.680> modulates<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.700> beam

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
photo detector which modulates the beam

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.929 
photo detector which modulates the beam
of<00:01:09.390> light<00:01:09.650> which<00:01:10.650> changes<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.280> current<00:01:11.760> and

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
of light which changes the current and

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.719 
of light which changes the current and
the<00:01:12.090> diode<00:01:12.360> then<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> photodiode<00:01:13.590> which<00:01:13.860> then

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
the diode then the photodiode which then

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.730 
the diode then the photodiode which then
turns<00:01:15.119> into<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.450> current<00:01:15.869> which<00:01:16.200> turns<00:01:16.500> into<00:01:16.619> a

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
turns into a current which turns into a

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.190 
turns into a current which turns into a
voltage<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.280> drive<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.850> meter<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:19.020> whole

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
voltage to drive the meter so this whole

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.850 
voltage to drive the meter so this whole
system<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.830> servo<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.330> keep<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.990> beam<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.470> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
system is servo to keep the beam in the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.429 
system is servo to keep the beam in the
center<00:01:23.189> position<00:01:23.840> so<00:01:24.840> when<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.140> want<00:01:25.320> to

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
center position so when you want to

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.340 
center position so when you want to
weigh<00:01:25.590> something<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.909> apply<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> weight<00:01:27.600> to

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
weigh something you apply a weight to

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.890 
weigh something you apply a weight to
the<00:01:28.470> beam<00:01:28.680> which<00:01:29.340> causes<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.270> beam<00:01:30.600> to

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
the beam which causes the beam to

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.530 
the beam which causes the beam to
deflect<00:01:31.320> down<00:01:31.729> which<00:01:32.729> causes<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.210> change<00:01:33.450> in

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
deflect down which causes a change in

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.060 
deflect down which causes a change in
the<00:01:33.630> brightness<00:01:34.049> which<00:01:34.470> causes<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
the brightness which causes the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.249 
the brightness which causes the
amplifier<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:36.060> increase<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.630> current<00:01:36.840> into

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
amplifier to increase the current into

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.370 
amplifier to increase the current into
the<00:01:37.350> meter<00:01:37.560> movement<00:01:38.540> which<00:01:39.540> will<00:01:39.750> move<00:01:40.020> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
the meter movement which will move the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.920 
the meter movement which will move the
beam<00:01:40.829> back<00:01:41.130> up<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:42.210> extra<00:01:42.600> drive

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
beam back up and that extra drive

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.530 
beam back up and that extra drive
required<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:44.070> move<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.549> beam<00:01:44.909> back<00:01:45.149> into<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
required to move the beam back into the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.620 
required to move the beam back into the
zero<00:01:45.750> position<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:47.420> proportional<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.540> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
zero position is proportional to the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.810 
zero position is proportional to the
weight<00:01:48.810> applied<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.130> current<00:01:50.460> through

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
weight applied so the current through

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.609 
weight applied so the current through
the<00:01:50.970> meter<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.420> measured<00:01:51.750> by<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:51.930> resistor

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
the meter is measured by this resistor

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.139 
the meter is measured by this resistor
and<00:01:52.770> outputs<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.610> voltage<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:55.729> let's<00:01:56.729> see<00:01:56.909> if<00:01:57.000> it

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
and outputs a voltage so let's see if it

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.539 
and outputs a voltage so let's see if it
works

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
works

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.080 
works
so<00:01:59.549> here<00:01:59.820> is<00:01:59.939> our<00:02:00.060> movement<00:02:01.729> you<00:02:02.729> can<00:02:02.880> see

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
so here is our movement you can see

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.109 
so here is our movement you can see
here's<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.509> shutter<00:02:04.399> and<00:02:05.399> here's<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.939> beam

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
here's the shutter and here's the beam

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.270 
here's the shutter and here's the beam
and<00:02:06.930> now<00:02:06.960> at<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.530> end<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.770> where<00:02:07.920> we<00:02:08.099> will

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
and now at the end is where we will

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.140 
and now at the end is where we will
apply<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.640> weight<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.869> this<00:02:10.020> case<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.530> will

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
apply the weight and in this case I will

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.960
