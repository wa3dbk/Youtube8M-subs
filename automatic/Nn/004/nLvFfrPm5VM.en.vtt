00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.430
 bit different because the guy who 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:28.449
 will ask not shut is a master touch 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.220
 There's a lot of name in Brazil, there's a lot of it. 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.320
 going abroad 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.570
 the guy has a very big brother a 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.960
 great master who is the frames of roses 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:46.390
 So send the question through my 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:50.110

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.989
 So enjoy and ask you a question. 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.300
 in your vision, what do you think is the path 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.350
 that the guitarists of the new generation have 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.079
 what to follow 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.059
 What is the point of studying and for the people? 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.190
 Of course I'll keep an eye on 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.630
 answer because the new generation song 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.910
 but I want tips then too, guys who 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.970

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.970
 ask me what tip I would give 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.310
 for beginners - today's guitarist 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.470
 of the new generation 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.190
 Look, it's not even I come and it failed. 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.250
 a tip is different we will compare 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.500
 with what we had in our time 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.679
 Every reasonable agent sucks. 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:37.149
 Being able to have a good instrument, I could not 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:39.550
 it's quality equipment, right? 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.830

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.989
 I did not have an internet time, right? 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.910
 we did not have a computer so little 

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:48.819
 people I got was the friend who 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.220

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.910
 policy has to run to be able to 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.070

 face you have the possibility of 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:16.640
 private teachers right now 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.350
 There are a lot of good people doing this. 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.840
 be careful with the picking 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.729
 but at the same time there are a lot of good people and 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.950
 a lot of serious people a lot of people like 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.919
 to teach one thing I was going to talk about 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:32.400
 also that it is very important is the option 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:35.070
 from skype, why do you imagine your colleague? 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.340
 is in the small town of the interior and 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.169
 Face speaks so the brand can not face 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.410
 in which there is no school my city ​​does not 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:46.020
 I know what the guy does not have school but today 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.669
 everywhere has expensive internet 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.009
 skype condition 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:52.289
 you can have classes at a distance by 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.370
 example, some students are already coming 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.949
 in Japan 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:59.699

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:01.650
 aunt guy and the perfect transmitter to people 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.990

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:12.660
 What happens there, the internet, does she 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:14.610
 Decrease the space, do not connect everything 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.100
 so it will decrease the space with the music 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.720
 also you have a teacher, you will 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.419

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.479
