00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 hello guys given nissa ruffa let's go to 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:12.059
 take a quick review of the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:16.080
 paranoid android kit version for lg g2 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:19.350
 of 802 will be very fast 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.439
 because there's only one fucking moment 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.080
 there is nothing that is practically not me 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.599
 I know what they did 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:31.109
 but they slept a little bit then it is 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.180
 It is probable that I and I have not gone mad 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.270
 I ca n't find the options though 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.180
 let's go see they only did 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.329
 this very cute this easter egg 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.160
 the paranoid is beautiful 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.940
 I would like to say a few words for some 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.210
 my colleagues of the maximum type forum 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.770
 osta and coburg which they said was fantastic 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.160
 but obviously they meant by 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:00.930
 nexus 4 so I guess there is 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.940
 maybe something else but ok let's move on 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.000
 I always remind you to download the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.909
 our application out off beat that 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.470
 found on the play store 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.290
 on the home page you will find the link 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.020
 to the blog with all the news you can 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.700
 receive notifications the link to 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.830
 forum that does not work because they are 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.640
 offline is the one on our channel 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.250
 youtube 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.700
 we're looking for crazy writers 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.340
 for the blog and for the forum then 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.360
 contact us and visit us e 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.200
 write because we need someone who 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.260
 let the madman get a little wild then 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.000
 let's see this paranoid 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:44.580
 these are the toggle tiles as saying 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.540
 normal you can customize a little 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.430
 they move ok and then you can do something else 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.110
 ok let's see the settings 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.450
 because honestly I have nothing to 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.890
 say from this on this rom that is not 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.090
 there is nothing 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.920
 I tried the china that mood 11 ok 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.780
 basic customizations but still had 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.700
 a customization section 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.479
 I tried the slim made absolutely 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.530
 a higher step is paranoid than it has 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.090
 the nod that the mood with many 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.820
 customizations with everything that is one 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.520
 a slim so-called rom 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.460
 lots of customizations 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.390
 but here sincerely on the paranoid me 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.610
 I see nothing 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:34.470
 the only things I see is practically 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:37.560
 here in buttons the awakening buttons 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.000
 then volume keys the cursor like 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.000
 move the cursor with the volume keys 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.140
 lauryn hill change of orientation in 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.600
 based on how the I screen is set 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.570
 I can't find anything guys I just got it 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.160
 is therefore unless I am 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.400
 something is lost but I can't find it 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.490
 absolutely nothing but nothing at all 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.790
 nothing then the review of peace 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.550
 android ends here beautiful but 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.610
 just bocciatissima bocciatissima 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.140
 very bad and nothing though if 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.260
 you want to review the menu 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.230
 settings is this a lot if you know me that 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.480
 is more stock than android stock guys has 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.540
 for the time being the wide da da 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.370
 paranoid at least for lg.ii is not there 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.570
 absolutely nothing to what they have 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:31.780
 made this practically light bulbs 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.530
 compared to others but honestly not 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.450
 I see right 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.390
 I really don't see any reason to 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.660
 so flash it but if I close I greet you 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.670
 sorry for this video review 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.709
 so sad though 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.709
