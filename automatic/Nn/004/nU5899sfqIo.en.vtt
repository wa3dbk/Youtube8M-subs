 Captain 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.440

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:52.650
 155 points gave me good I care 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.650
 a complicated subject but 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.399
 in something good the crap 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.620
 and now we are going to make way after 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.620

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.970
 will not ask cyclops 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.690
 as you can see in the city 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.690
 I showed them 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.210
 they will ask us 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.330
 and others these three are the ones 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.990
 We will ask to give way to 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.920
 appear so master that he would be the boss 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.920
 epic 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.580
 now if you leave me for 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.439
 I want and we are going up from level to 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.439
 my 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.400
 with the weapon 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.490
 and see what it is that does not look so 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.970
 easy and it stung him 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.470
 which one will be of support to my people not 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:18.610
 I start great 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.610
 they start and wave because not so much 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.689
 and it's already giving me 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.430
 too strong 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.430
 These guys 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.470
 died 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.420
 I'm going to apply the trope 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.480
 children and heal me 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.480
 I will not distract you 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.760
 my soul does not convince me much so 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.760
 let's do the ordinary 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.349
 well first let's give it 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.430
 and we are going to 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.900
 I was stunned 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.160
 good 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.390
 today I am 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.390
 your rivals are very complicated 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.099
 It is happening here 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.739
 is that they are going crazy we are going to put them to me 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.739
 not crazy 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.730
 with a little earthquakes 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.210
 Y 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.510
 let's make some balls 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.600
 now occupy without a child 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.820
 I did not think that these three were to 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.730
 put so crazy in this beak you do not see 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.650
 nothing simple 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:25.130
 but that had a good level efe 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.389
 since endurance 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.560
 has tremor 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.560
 the expopular 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:38.550
 tremble with fear 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.550
 do not invent with these guys either 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.400
 in the eyes much we say 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.150
 the systems enlarging but still I do not 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.520
 I'm not no 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:56.410
 when a lot 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.410
 I'm going to heal a little bit something is something 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:06.560
 Now I'm going to throw you some balls 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.560
 again I lose the good 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.640
 we do more things 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.110
 talk windows 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.740
 two 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.740
 Uran 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.399
 well at least everything is ready 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:29.710
 I'm going to save my bucket for the next 

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:31.919
 round if you have everything not to saturate the 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.919
 center 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.060
 and now yes 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.400
 next round these three made me 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.670
 suffer I do not know if because it's not so 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.670
 good 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.000
 how 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.910
 well now we are going to apply in the 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.910
 ulna 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:09.210
 and we are going to apply command command 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.210
 exhausted 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.430
 so it suits me 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.430
 but once 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.270
 I'm going to apply some technique against this 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.230
 kind 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.230
 as they walk 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.390
 complicating me life these guys 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.050
 well see how many shifts dame me and with this 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:44.860

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.580
 Hombre de Hierro 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:03.790
 everything is between you and me dies die 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.790
 complicated had this epic 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.340
 he had to use a lot of things 

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:13.520
 secret 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:16.780
 no but it complicated me a lot 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.780
 and it gives me very little experience 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.280
 Well this is the team that everyone 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:25.740
 look in the soul 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.500

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.800
 Completed 

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:38.669
 finally this after ice 

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:40.950

 in this I leave the red bull group and 

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:50.169
 not without more things 

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:53.189
 and in the next video we will recruit 

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:53.189
 a new hero 

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.560
