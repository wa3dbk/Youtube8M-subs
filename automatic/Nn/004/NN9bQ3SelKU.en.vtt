the island and over the table and so you

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.220 
the island and over the table and so you
can<00:01:25.780> separate<00:01:26.780> these<00:01:26.960> all<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:27.200> different

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
entryway outside is still on so I can

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.730 
entryway outside is still on so I can
