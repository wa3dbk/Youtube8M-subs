00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:18.820
 at this time he completed 14 years 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:21.520
 graduate of the plastic surgeon and how 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.350
 that I have had the opportunity to see that 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.600
 historical evolution of surgery 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.850
 aesthetics when I grade in the year 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.790
 2000 was just like starting this 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.220
 boom of cosmetic surgery after 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:36.430
 between the year 2003 to 2004 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.250
 came television shows whose 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.400
 name I can not and should not say here that a 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.989
 my opinion did a lot of damage to 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.719
 plastic surgery because they did 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:52.269
 believe that patients could be made 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:54.250
 4 567 procedures at the same time and that 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:58.600
 it was completely allowed so 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:02.019
 allowed to go on television 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.879
 after this came the time as of 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.940
 all major accidents in surgery 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.759
 plastic increase in the amount of 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.100
 complications of increase in the amount 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.649
 of deaths by plastic surgery and 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.009
 fortunately today in 2014 we are 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:20.530
 already at a different time like that already 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.289
 the boom passed, the storms came 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.729
 the catastrophes have already passed and that 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:30.940
 He helped everyone to educate us to offer 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.920
 safe plastic surgery then today in 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.950
 day and to resolve this question 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.700
 timely surgery should not be done 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.500
 35 and maximum 6 hours not 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.380
 they should do for example liposculptures 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.960
 of more than 5 maximum 6 liters when it is a 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.240
 single procedure should never be done 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.909
 Liposculpture of more than 4 liters when 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.090
 they are combined procedures never 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.039
 they must do more than three procedures 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.039
 combined and fortunately today 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.450
 all this is written and it is already 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.159
 legislated 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.700
 this in what it has helped 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.979
 enormously in that we have to 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.390
 enter and I 've always said it in the 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.220
 it was our engineering 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.160
 procedures in plastic surgery today 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.200
 in day should be procedures 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.980
 Reproducible repeatable with high 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.860
 quality standards and with very low 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.260
 rates of complications if a surgery 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.569
 is done properly if we do not 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.940
 we went through surgical time if not 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.190
 we are going to offer that of 567 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.370
 procedures the typical patient that 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.560
 He comes to be face to chin nose 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.950
 he reads polypectomy today that 's 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.110
 a complete madness now for the 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.599
 patients that come from outside that 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.060
 we can offer to do two or three 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:52.299
 procedures that patient can 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.130
 be 15 days and at 15 days one re 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.760
 they intervene patient towards the others 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.489
 procedures is one way and the 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.140
 called very good to get out of the problem 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.730
 of that patient who has a time 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.240
 available to perform ones 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.390
 procedures but 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.040
 we want to offer the best and the most 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.230
 sure we can not transform a 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.210
 patient of a trip sorry of a 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.560
 patient from abroad in a catastrophe 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.560
 always with security
