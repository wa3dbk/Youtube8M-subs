from<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.330> dining<00:00:18.720> room<00:00:18.840> table<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:20.539> the<00:00:21.539> back<00:00:21.750> of

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
from a dining room table and the back of

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.779 
from a dining room table and the back of
the<00:00:21.990> veneer<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.500> completely<00:00:23.220> shot

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
the veneer is completely shot

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.029 
the veneer is completely shot
and<00:00:23.970> normally<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.750> would<00:00:25.170> just<00:00:25.380> glue<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.830> down

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
and normally I would just glue it down

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.509 
and normally I would just glue it down
but<00:00:26.849> it's<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.269> shot<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.840> some<00:00:28.140> spots<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:29.250> even

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
but it's so shot in some spots that even

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.089 
but it's so shot in some spots that even
a<00:00:29.580> repair<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.060> not<00:00:30.420> going<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.720> be<00:00:30.840> any<00:00:31.019> good<00:00:31.260> so

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
a repair is not going to be any good so

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.110 
a repair is not going to be any good so
what<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.309> like<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.579> do<00:00:34.309> is<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.460> like<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.670> remove

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
what I like to do is I like to remove

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.970 
what I like to do is I like to remove
what<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.300> can<00:00:36.570> by<00:00:36.750> hand<00:00:37.020> but<00:00:37.260> then<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.500> start<00:00:37.800> with

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
what I can by hand but then I start with

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.040 
what I can by hand but then I start with
a<00:00:38.010> chisel<00:00:38.340> when<00:00:39.300> you're<00:00:39.450> working<00:00:39.719> from<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
a chisel when you're working from the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.020 
a chisel when you're working from the
edge<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.829> makes<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.129> lot<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.309> sense<00:00:41.579> because<00:00:41.730> it

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
edge it makes a lot of sense because it

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.090 
edge it makes a lot of sense because it
leaves<00:00:42.239> your<00:00:42.390> chisel<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.079> flat<00:00:43.350> spot<00:00:43.770> for

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
leaves your chisel in the flat spot for

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.260 
leaves your chisel in the flat spot for
as<00:00:44.160> long<00:00:44.370> as<00:00:44.550> possible

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
as long as possible

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.290 
as long as possible
so<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.840> get<00:00:46.530> down<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> edge<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.610> lift<00:00:48.149> up

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
so you get down to the edge you lift up

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.110 
so you get down to the edge you lift up
a<00:00:48.450> little<00:00:48.570> bit<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.340> these<00:00:50.340> should<00:00:50.670> pull<00:00:50.940> off

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
a little bit and these should pull off

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.220 
a little bit and these should pull off
almost<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.750> one<00:00:51.930> complete<00:00:52.260> pieces<00:00:53.899> work<00:00:54.899> up<00:00:55.079> to

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
almost in one complete pieces work up to

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.319 
almost in one complete pieces work up to
the<00:00:55.350> edge<00:00:55.469> give<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.980> little<00:00:56.129> lift<00:00:59.270> try<00:01:00.270> to

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
the edge give it a little lift try to

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.029 
the edge give it a little lift try to
leave<00:01:00.539> your<00:01:00.629> chisel<00:01:01.050> as<00:01:01.140> flat<00:01:01.440> as<00:01:01.649> long<00:01:01.859> as

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039
