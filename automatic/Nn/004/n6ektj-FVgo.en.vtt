actually<00:01:32.759> rides<00:01:32.969> an<00:01:33.149> oil<00:01:33.299> bath<00:01:33.509> rate<00:01:33.899> rides<00:01:34.200> in

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
actually rides an oil bath rate rides in

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.169 
actually rides an oil bath rate rides in
the<00:01:34.469> same<00:01:34.679> oil<00:01:35.039> that<00:01:35.340> these<00:01:35.520> gears<00:01:35.819> ride<00:01:36.030> you

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
the same oil that these gears ride you

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:37.849 
the same oil that these gears ride you
in<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.420> because<00:01:36.719> of<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.840> stays<00:01:37.229> very<00:01:37.469> clean

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:37.859 
in so because of that stays very clean

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.149

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
last a life the unit you'll probably

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.899 
last a life the unit you'll probably
never<00:01:42.630> replace<00:01:43.109> those<00:01:43.289> grill<00:01:43.500> brakes<00:01:43.909> there's
