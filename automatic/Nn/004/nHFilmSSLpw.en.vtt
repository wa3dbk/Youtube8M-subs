00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 as sung in the song in our life 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.980
 death and taxes are inevitable and although 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.630
 the British government is quite successful 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.670
 copes with tax collection 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.830
 help their citizens in case 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.849
 the inevitable demise of what he gets 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.340
 much worse 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.550
 because on this small island there are places for 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.650
 graves is rapidly ending 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.150
 recent research results 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.250
 municipalities have shown that in almost 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.010
 half of the country's districts have room for 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.590
 burials will end in 20 years and in 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.780
 quarters of municipalities after 10 and 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.450
 this is not just a london problem 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.520
 cemeteries such as this are some tips in 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.829
 rural areas claim cemetery 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.870
 already filled it means people 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.360
 should look for a grave elsewhere 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.280
 and all this despite the fact that 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.660
 seventy-four percent departed 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.300
 cremated 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.129
 itâ€™s difficult to keep graveyards 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.070
 when they fill up local authorities 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.329
 must make a difficult decision 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.250
 building a new cemetery requires 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.449
 large financial investments also 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.000
 must contain 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.790
 existing cemeteries are increasing 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.770
 maintenance costs therefore have to 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.900
 raising the board was the obvious solution 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.729
 would be opening more cemeteries 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.650
 however, in conditions of limited 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.630
 spaces it can only become 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.670
 temporary measure you can force 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.220
 people to cremate what is also not 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.259
 works remains very ambiguous 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.360
 option to use the graves again 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.909
 buried the remains deeper and thereby 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.009
 making room for a new burial 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.420
 disturbing human remains 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.000
 the lawless cause is 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.189
 offense the justice ministry is not 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.829
 grants permission to create a new one 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.990
 burial sites however permits 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.090
 tear down church graveyards and build on 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.780
 their place of shopping or car 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.549
 parking lots 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.740
 it's a bit strange today re 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.140
 use of graves is allowed only on 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.600
 cemeteries of london and although this question 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.460
 touches literally all british he 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.439
 unlikely to bring politicians victory on 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.780
 elections so the government is just 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.000
 avoids discussing it however according to 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.190
 experts authorities must work out 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.270
 action plan for 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.490
 burials 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.850
 and instead of being silent like 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.850
 the grave
