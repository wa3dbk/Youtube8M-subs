 15 o'clock yes okay what we for our weapons 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.300
 need and how we make them show 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:48.400
 I need you so for the waffles we need 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.560
 waffles how do you get by the way so 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.830
 I have them in Turkish now 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.140
 bought in germany you get them in 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.180
 Major shops I think Kaufland has 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.930
 they are safe in austria 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.180
 Merkur and in switzerland you get them 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.960
 migros or coop I had them too 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.369
 ever seen and in you go there are 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.409
 you could almost at every gas station 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.950
 say 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:19.590
 then we need sugar chocolate 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:25.000
 vanilla sugar butter milk and 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.860
 biscuits and crushed walnuts can 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.540
 also 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:36.290
 with almonds you can also almond 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.700
 take or crush peanuts or 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.570
 if he has wet allergy right away 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.320
 omit only cookies pure optional 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.320
 and a pot 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:55.800
 Let's take the milk and 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:03:01.740
 Put in the pot with the sugar and 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:03.959
 cook it all the way up so now 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:09.600
 must switch the temperature under so 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:12.720
 on the middle stage for a short while and away 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.900
 back then we do the mother 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.900
 purely 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:27.800
 the chocolate and vanilla sugar 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:31.080
 that melt all the load and then 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.200
 let's leave it that way in the middle stage 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:41.720
 simmer for about 15 minutes until I get that 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.720
 If you have covered something, you can be that way 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:48.800
 and then you keep going like this 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.590
 before I look at the biscuits 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.750
 show qi give for that I had now 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.050
 on the ball customer for about 30 minutes 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:01.160
 outside so a mass should be like that 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:04.459
 be lukewarm when she is hot and the 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:08.350
 Biscuits purely then does that through 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:10.730
 You can not pass liquid well 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.340
 you can pass well but that 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:17.200
 the whole thing ends in the 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:22.610
 go out so we'll take us now 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:25.090
 biscuit must be mixed and beautiful everything 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.090
 mix 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:39.590
 Just try it there 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.590
 the whole filling is the best 

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:51.820
 hacker 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:55.420
 so next we take ourselves 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:58.950
 the first weapon we turn with 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:01.900
 the rough side on the paper 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:06.660
 so that that's the fine fine that 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:11.550
 Fine pattern looks up and there 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.550
 let's give something of the show qi on it 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:35.570
 where do I pass the whole thing? 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.210
 a cool angle range if it is 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.760
 someone interested where I have you 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:43.310
 I write down in the infobox exactly 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.090
 also as my prescriptions indicated 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.090
 quantitative disclosures 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:02.940
 so next comes the upper one 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:06.300
 simple page with the rough pattern 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:11.880
 press something on it so press 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:15.740
 not with the whole weight on it and 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.740
 then give it a little more schoki 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.610
 so my dear went so fast 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.120
 We finish with the rough side 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.190
 above 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.690
 So I have the rough side rough below 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.449
 side up no matter how he looks at it 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:51.379
 she attacks from both sides 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:53.750
 Pretty, that's one of the easiest 

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:56.389
 and fastest recipes, yes, there are 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:59.900
 different no idea hit me 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:00.440
 But they are really great and 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.930
 fast 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.150
 So I can only recommend so on the 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:08.110
 waffle we put something heavy now 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.650
 whether it is a sheet metal now or 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.770
 I do not want bricks now 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.550
 recommend and new could they be 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.270
 also endure 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:22.550
 So something heavy what you have there 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:27.130
 and for about 34 hours should the 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:31.580
 already so attached 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:33.050
 somewhere where it is cool are exactly 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.210
 so they do not fall apart when 

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:37.780
 to cut 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:41.110
 that was me again 

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:46.400
 I wish you a nice week 

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:49.599
 until next sunday and a whole 

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.599
 fat similar to pain on you
