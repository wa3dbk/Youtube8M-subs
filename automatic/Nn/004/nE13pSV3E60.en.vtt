00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.259
 I have not seen fireworks for a long time 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.719
 now show you such a unit 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.759
 who gathered peace last night for 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.440
 three hours here is such a jump 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:19.859
 of course I wanted dinner to show the process itself 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.029
 assemblies there people asked only 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.330
 showing type as an end result 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:30.060
 the process itself does not show well here in the evening 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.430
 went into the garage hands an hour of ice a little 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.480
 the case turned out to be such 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.989
 the brainchild of such a result and now on 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.350
 the investigation decided the situation of the court was not 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.850
 assembly process result 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.629
 I hope so try on the fingers 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.879
 I am here for you 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.390
 little man what I wanted everything was going 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.579
 from timber 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:02.850
 yes pause. I stayed every cut 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:05.729
 a pair of long duck was also gonna be them 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.830
 let here the little bars don't go you 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.710
 here and also common 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.450
 fell granddaughter, too, this is no 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.630
 head holders decided not gas 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:22.350
 so everything was going to 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:27.530
 self-tapping screws made such goose legs 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.400
 the principle of a long tale shell of love is 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:35.159
 everything went well 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:39.090
 It looks so under this we all 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:43.490
 It looks like so leg dumplings 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.490
 your planks boards also staying 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:58.590
 need to take care of the best strength looks 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:02:02.640
 will go about so high shelves did 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.759
 1 stereo such about leaves toilet tvp 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.660

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:15.329
 exactly bowline okay millimeters 67 not 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:18.320
 so they are not bent such vicious thought 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:22.110
 I decided should get such a go 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.720
 such a heavy man will not nothing 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.060
 I happen there even under I donâ€™t know a piece 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.760
 as if a fig clinical power is not visible 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.010
 SAI anyway but here and so all 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.860
 select 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.520
 So 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:44.310
 were giving countertops countertops countertops 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:47.400
 the eu limits on sheets of chipboard card would not 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.830
 it was the material of the tabletop of such an area 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.550
 I found 4 of these . 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.150
 laminated chipboard 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.880

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.670

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.330
 the capital Pavka said in the tabletop 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.880
 made of chipboard 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.840
 so it looks came so pass and 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.840
 pretty there 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:26.930

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:35.330
 essentially safe and happen like this 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.190
 now here 's the ball now so creative 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.220
 a mess 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.050
 after yesterday evening stoos i think 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.480
 now it's even worse because I have 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:49.280
 also an idea to make a hut over it 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.840
 the toilet also rolled the stick on to do 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.660
 because I only drank everyone 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.680
 little things small things have stupidly do not 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.940
 where does the floor want to help? 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.650
 small items 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.080

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:16.300
 probably know if it came to 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.300
 this video and all this result 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:22.750
 extra body movements do everything 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.990
 run bro 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:30.689

 height 80 distance 25 cm height 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.890

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.550

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.510
