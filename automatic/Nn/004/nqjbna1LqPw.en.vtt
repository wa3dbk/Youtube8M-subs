00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:13.150
 here is our self-made bugs start here 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:16.279
 in front of us here and rises back 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:23.499
 turovsky such a little bull to 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:32.360
 difficult fluid goes such a system 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:35.720
 the brakes are pressed so easily and very 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:40.480
 difficult but they have to be pumped up then they 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:49.760
 it doesn't work that way here 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:53.270
 the gas pedal serves as a shock absorber here they are 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:58.750
 us so here are made the springs you 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:06.740
 put Zhiguli but here we 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:09.619
 Lockers made straps headlights mirrors 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.509
 but they are different then we will find 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:19.210
 the same seat is still soft 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:22.549
 I still looked like you massively 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:26.539
 that's where they write in the comments what 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.909
 plastic but it hurts bad to go well 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:32.659
 put such 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:37.359
 simple soft she gently ride on 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:45.219
 bumps powder here we have a village here 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:49.759
 hillock here cottage so its for the engine 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:55.630
 the most important thing here it is with us why 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:02:02.319
 start the engine with a scooter 150 vat 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:07.869
 the name there seems to be 157 engine I don't remember 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:07.869
 here we have voices here 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.940
 here one candle works well 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:25.640
 air-we we made ourselves first we 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.160
 bought such a small beautiful so well 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.349
 that will work well but nothing 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.849
 gave even worse and engine experience here 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:36.709
 did it yourself still such a snag was we 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.880
 could not start it at first thought that 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:43.640
 it doesn't work 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.420
 show you here it is here here 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.269
 the air here is such a cap 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.519
 green little one hung here she didn't give 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:57.200
 we have to make here sorry but could not 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:03:01.250
 to get such a mask 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:05.299
 wiring here you can see we did too 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.849
 turned out well here, too, such 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:12.380
 small he is big not needed because 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:14.840
 amateur thrifty here and a little bit but we 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.739
 In general, somewhere half fill there 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.709
 somewhere around 2 liters 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:24.130
 Here we have a lever on the engine too 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:29.079
 the bolt was on we welded the ear not 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:31.750
 there was a place for the battery 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:36.079
 will then buy the battery 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:41.989
 small to start work on start 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:44.840
 alive is not visible here so what else 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.120
 we set us so that the back 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.090
 the speed was gears we have c so 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.880
 Comes, too, turned out then she here here 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.299
 so here it is connected here it is still 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:59.510
 one chain then goes naught you are the doctor 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:02.290
 the asterisk there stands the gearbox he gives us 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:06.940
 back speed now I'll show the lever 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:10.320
 here it is a lever and here 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:17.080
 first speed back speed and oh here 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:21.900
 mitral so here he goes goes on 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:25.210
 gearbox there is connected here wheels 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.810
 the package that we had on steel back 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.880
 a little bit more my back 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:35.140
 slightly less 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.660
 Establishments patrol here we have a steering 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:41.350
 sake 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:45.210
 easy turns two turns doin you 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:48.660
 turns completely now let's start 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.660
 when the button 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.710
 work 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.460
 to file 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:27.629
 here's another panel 

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:33.119
 this is the light here I showed here a button I 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:35.039
 we press ok and the engine is off 

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:37.999
 then when you need to start 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:41.249
 the handle here again we press it and 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:48.800
 expensive start up to drown here 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:51.509
 we press everything here we have a light here 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:55.349
 part it turns on but work when 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:06:00.539
 the engine he runs from the engine vodka 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:06:03.619
 give artem let's put here the key water here 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:11.579
 so easy to think squeezed battery bought 

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:16.099
 It will be good Well, sort of all though I have 

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:19.009
 still forgot shock absorber here they are with us 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:22.619
 shock absorbers are here on the left side 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:23.579
 right we have them Zaporozhets we them 

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:26.639
 extended 

00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:30.529
 and the spring itself we set with heavy 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:34.379
 motorcycle still conceived here 

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:36.839
 put the fan extra here 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:40.319
 here we have a fan but not enough when 

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:45.089
 Here we load it Here we have a trailer 

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:47.039
 It is worth so much quite a lot 

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:51.300
 the trial holds until the garbage is there 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:54.449
 saw already here and here we cling and when 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:57.269
 Here it is heavily loaded overheats it 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:59.419
 he starts working doubtfully 

00:06:57.269 --> 00:07:02.849
 starts to dry 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:05.539
 overheats here want to want to put 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:11.929
 additional fan 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:14.260
 So in general, all I wanted to say 

00:07:11.929 --> 00:07:17.080
 paid 

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:20.800
 Here we bother in the winter for about 3 months 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:25.360
 there two and a half months want more 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.670
 paint here it is in general, all here 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:31.800
 We have such a machine 

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:31.800
