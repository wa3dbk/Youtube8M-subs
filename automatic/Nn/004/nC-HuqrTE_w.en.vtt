 the white house and overwhelmed with telephone calls from witnesses 

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:11.479
 the event makes it one of the press 

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:14.609
 a General Staff of the Air Force then gives a conference of 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:17.609
 press 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.109
 still the most beautiful beach 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.589
 I'm here to speak english now would be flying saucer 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:27.720
 but a little more morn the interest shown by the sponsor necessarily the 

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:32.460
 problem results from the fine lace requirement and analyzed from our 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.500
 better the dive boat being in US airspace but 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.500
 may pose a threat to the us the malus m 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.780
 the title press on flying saucers but the official version 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.120
 evokes a traverse on temperature completely natural 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.560
 a layer of warm air in the sky could return radar echoes that 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.050
 actually came from the ground 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.310
 a version that does not explain the maneuvers of these objects 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.560
 this press conference was the first and the last of a general 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.820
 on the subject 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.520
 in the 50s and 60s 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.540
 air force continues UFO research program 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.270
 but I do not communicate anymore 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.050
 l survey of all reported sightings 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.090
 13,000 report that is being attempted today at the Washington National Archives 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.000
 we were able to consult them 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.770
 most phenomena no explanation 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.770
 like these photos 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.800
 it's actually an airplane above the capitol 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.420
 a reflection of the light on the lens of the camera 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.530
 monthly synthesis of unidentified phenomena in 1951 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.500
 in the month of August, fifteen observations are made by civilian pilots and 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.250
 military 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.250
 opposite the result of the investigations 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.390
 no conclusion 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.840
 no explanation either to the phenomenon 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.840
 classified folder 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.500
 in all, nearly 700 cases remained unexplained 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.590
 there are also drawings made from military observations 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.279
 US 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:15.689
 here on June 24, 1948 a pilot and his co-pilot saw this craft move to 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.709
 close to their planes 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.759
 a machine 15 meters long 

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:22.759
 passengers confirmed their testimony 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:28.309
 but in 1969 the united states announced that they say stopped investigating 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:29.549
 the UFOs 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.530
 officially according to the air force the study of non-aerial phenomena 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:36.529
 identified never brought anything conclusive 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.519
 we are leaving for arizona in central us 

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:50.349
 we have an appointment with a lawyer who attacked the government 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.349
 american justice 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:55.859
 rather than a system 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.949
 you're getting proof that the united states are interested in gambling 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:01.929
 unique long after 10 969 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:02.999
 club 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:04.959
 why this choice 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.959
 the new structure you have to set an attractive price 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:11.229
 parish experts 

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:14.799
 we tried to access all the documents in possession of the series to 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.199
 this concert manzoni the samia woman who gave up reminding you that at this 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:21.619
 era l intelligence agency to deny any involvement in that any 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:25.119
 investigation is a study around these phenomena pc could help to 

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:28.229
 appease their positions the position of the air force that was adopted 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:31.930
 by the other institutions firstly the men did not come 

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:37.249
 advanced technology nagoya pzk after that because UFOs do not constitute 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:40.189
 no threat to national security have this time taken my chance 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.609
 that they are not obvious because we had the right to ask if 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.409
 begging for money or knowing how many moves or less on the series side 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:50.539
 in Sorel where we finally got two years later the public signing more than 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:53.949
 900 pages of documents related to town planning with a clio in France 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.709
 the cadets at what shows us the memos of the subsidiary that managed to 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.449
 do is classified magistracy and the republican household flag will only 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.139
 not once 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:08.139
 these documents we list all kinds of these relationships 

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:19.419
 in 1976 a United States weapons storage area overflown by objects 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.419
 unidentified 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.700
 the most recent document 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.319
 19,192 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:29.620
 a memo on how china study the oci the UFO phenomenon 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.099
 some declassified documents do not give much information they 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:41.099
 have been confirmed in caviar departure la silla 

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:48.499
 but gastem does not stop there 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:52.619
 he also tried to get documents from the msa the agencies of 

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:54.129
 national security 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:58.009
 the most discreet agency in the united states responsible for all 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.089
 the forms of communication both military and civil 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:05.399
 yes or at the end of these cases we have the chance to go to the national ranking of 

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:08.469
 security nsa chance that we asked the nsa how many documents 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:11.170
 and own but they refused to tell us 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.219
 they told us it was top secret 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:18.649
 the judge forced moody's rwanda this result as 835 to do 

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:21.539
 their toilet the same chances as greenhouse thoughts we said 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:23.770
 okay finally we want these documents 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.460
 the grc said no you will not have any document that can affect security 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.729
 national seine-north but the size and the bins and settle down to women the 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:34.389
 thing was created on the cac 40 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.340
 that confirms one thing for sure they are related to national security 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.780
 on this theme while the Greek air force there is nothing in the sky 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.249
 is facing a threat to national security for business 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:45.759
 it's inconsistent big auto parts 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:50.499
 alonso then to climb at the same time this stage the letter the secret this is the 

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:53.229
 most practical solution in short I'm going to shut up 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:57.300
 s yes it's easier to deny the reality of this phenomenon and rather 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.300
 than trying to justify to london his senior 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.530
 the pentagon the American equivalent of our ministry of defense on 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:14.490
 refuses to communicate about UFOs 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.449
 we sent several requests for interviews 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.449
 they all went unanswered 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:26.610
 one of the UFO phenomena that sparked the most controversy had 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.610
 place on an American NATO base in England 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:35.239
 December 26, 1989 charm 200 km north east of london 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:39.089
 on a plus basis the zep curie layout that houses nuclear missiles from 

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:40.490
 nato 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.770
 about one o'clock in the morning an American soldier spots a light 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.770
 above the reindeer forest dol charm 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:50.969
 base authorities sending timegate mans three soldiers on the spot 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.350
 among them there was the American sergeant james spader stable 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:02.589
 her age for naked stent to a people we are approached to her in 

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:06.789
 the trees there was a bright white light be illuminated 

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:10.729
 both on the near take to go on continuing to move forward 

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:14.869
 the whitish light started to disappear the common 

00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:15.770
 we were 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.520
 close to the craft signed a memorandum of understanding in order 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.440
 I saw that it was a kind of donation marks his territory and to jobs a 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.840
 little by lot why we think in my opinion it was quite perplexed because this 

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.419
 was not a flight attendant it had nothing to do with the riots 

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:31.939
 additional that I knew 

00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:34.409
 the king is dying 

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:36.680
 dionne was really very very worried 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.930
 Norman 

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.930
 in jargon spring widow loose she 

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.319
 the three soldiers make the same story 

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:48.770
 the sergeant penis tons made drawings of those who saw him 

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.360
 it was not huge the size of a tank according to the first 

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.990
 tests 

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:57.430
 according to their testimonies after five minutes of observation the obliged to 

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:01.400
 take off but actually foyen so the evening we had traditional do the 

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.189
 noise does not become moving moscow russia 

00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:09.050
 so there the take off essence only has placement of m 

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:13.389
 the most important wheels in his role is the score not like some 

00:08:13.389 --> 00:08:14.840
 something like that because the héraultaises
