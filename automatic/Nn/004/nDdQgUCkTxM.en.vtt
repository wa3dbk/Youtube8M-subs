00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
list is checked and then click scan

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.850 
list is checked and then click scan
you'll<00:01:33.600> probably<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.050> wait<00:01:34.259> quite<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.619> bit

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
you'll probably have to wait quite a bit

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.460 
you'll probably have to wait quite a bit
for<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.100> program<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.580> finish<00:01:35.880> cleaning<00:01:36.440> so<00:01:37.440> I

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
for the program to finish cleaning so I

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.749 
for the program to finish cleaning so I
guess<00:01:37.830> I'll<00:01:37.950> come<00:01:38.100> back<00:01:38.220> in<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.399> few<00:01:38.430> minutes

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
guess I'll come back in a few minutes

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.180 
guess I'll come back in a few minutes
and<00:01:38.910> see<00:01:39.030> whether<00:01:39.149> it's<00:01:39.390> done<00:01:39.890> all<00:01:40.890> right<00:01:40.950> now

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
and see whether it's done all right now

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.550 
and see whether it's done all right now
it<00:01:41.310> looks<00:01:41.340> like<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.670> scans<00:01:41.940> done<00:01:42.300> so<00:01:42.780> now<00:01:43.500> you

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
it looks like the scans done so now you

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.400 
it looks like the scans done so now you
can<00:01:43.830> click<00:01:44.070> clean<00:01:44.479> and<00:01:45.479> choose<00:01:45.720> normal

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
can click clean and choose normal

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.430 
can click clean and choose normal
cleanup<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:48.570> if<00:01:48.810> it's<00:01:48.960> your<00:01:49.080> first<00:01:49.200> time

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
cleanup and if it's your first time

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.960 
cleanup and if it's your first time
it'll<00:01:49.740> probably<00:01:49.890> prompt<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.429> create<00:01:50.940> a

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
it'll probably prompt you to create a

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.310 
it'll probably prompt you to create a
restore<00:01:51.270> point<00:01:51.330> which<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.929> probably

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
restore point which is probably

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.499 
restore point which is probably
advisable<00:01:52.619> if<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.190> are<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.340> if<00:01:54.210> it's<00:01:54.390> your

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
advisable if you are a if it's your

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.440 
advisable if you are a if it's your
first<00:01:54.630> time<00:01:54.840> ever<00:01:55.050> using<00:01:55.289> it<00:01:55.580> now<00:01:56.580> even<00:01:57.360> after

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
first time ever using it now even after

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.800 
first time ever using it now even after
we're<00:01:57.720> wearing<00:01:57.990> quite<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.440> lot<00:01:58.830> more<00:01:59.399> time<00:01:59.810> and

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
we're wearing quite a lot more time and

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.109 
we're wearing quite a lot more time and
there<00:02:01.020> because<00:02:01.830> it<00:02:01.950> says<00:02:02.190> your<00:02:02.640> first<00:02:02.850> cleanup

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
there because it says your first cleanup

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.940 
there because it says your first cleanup
may<00:02:03.300> take<00:02:03.479> up<00:02:03.660> to<00:02:03.690> one<00:02:03.929> or<00:02:04.080> two<00:02:04.259> hours<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.830> next

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
may take up to one or two hours the next

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.040 
may take up to one or two hours the next
cleanups<00:02:05.369> will<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.580> much<00:02:05.729> faster<00:02:05.970> but<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.869> can

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
cleanups will be much faster but you can

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.039 
cleanups will be much faster but you can
reduce<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.440> time<00:02:07.890> by<00:02:08.070> clicking<00:02:08.130> boost<00:02:09.049> that

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
reduce that time by clicking boost that

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:11.479 
reduce that time by clicking boost that
probably<00:02:10.380> isn't<00:02:10.560> advisable<00:02:10.829> if<00:02:11.160> you're<00:02:11.280> doing
