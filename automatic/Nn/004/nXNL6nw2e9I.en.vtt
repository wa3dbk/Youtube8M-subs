00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.939 

hi<00:00:00.570> guys<00:00:00.719> it's<00:00:00.960> silver<00:00:01.230> and<00:00:01.319> again<00:00:01.589> and<00:00:01.800> I've

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
hi guys it's silver and again and I've

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.940 
hi guys it's silver and again and I've
got<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:02.129> tutorial<00:00:02.520> on<00:00:02.760> advanced<00:00:03.330> terrain

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:03.950 
got a tutorial on advanced terrain

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.559 
got a tutorial on advanced terrain
editing<00:00:04.950> and<00:00:05.339> that<00:00:05.430> sounds<00:00:05.700> very<00:00:05.850> interesting

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
editing and that sounds very interesting

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.520 
editing and that sounds very interesting
but<00:00:07.379> it's<00:00:08.340> actually<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.639> trick<00:00:08.970> that<00:00:09.269> not<00:00:09.599> many

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
but it's actually a trick that not many

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.379 
but it's actually a trick that not many
people<00:00:10.860> use<00:00:11.040> but<00:00:11.610> it's<00:00:11.759> actually<00:00:12.090> pretty

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
people use but it's actually pretty

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.460 
people use but it's actually pretty
useful<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:13.410> that<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.769> take<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.839> non<00:00:15.839> blending

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
useful and that is take a non blending

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.080 
useful and that is take a non blending
texture<00:00:16.920> like<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:17.279> one<00:00:17.460> as<00:00:17.640> you<00:00:17.670> can<00:00:17.789> see<00:00:17.880> it

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
texture like this one as you can see it

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.640 
texture like this one as you can see it
doesn't<00:00:18.270> blend<00:00:18.480> in<00:00:18.720> there<00:00:18.869> with<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.170> grass<00:00:19.380> if

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
doesn't blend in there with the grass if

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.990 
doesn't blend in there with the grass if
you<00:00:19.740> take<00:00:19.920> this<00:00:20.070> texture<00:00:20.430> for<00:00:20.580> example<00:00:20.609> you

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
you take this texture for example you

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.939 
you take this texture for example you
could<00:00:21.119> see<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:21.390> little<00:00:22.080> blending<00:00:22.529> andreen

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
could see this little blending andreen

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.160 
could see this little blending andreen
on<00:00:23.100> here<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.490> don't<00:00:23.670> want<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.330> always

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
on here and you don't want that I always

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.620 
on here and you don't want that I always
use<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.500> texture<00:00:25.830> because<00:00:26.220> as<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:27.300> can<00:00:27.420> see

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
use this texture because as you can see

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.560 
use this texture because as you can see
every<00:00:27.990> tile<00:00:28.490> represents<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:30.090> tile<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
every tile represents the tile of the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.749 
every tile represents the tile of the
grits<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.080> that's<00:00:31.289> very<00:00:31.500> handy<00:00:31.769> now<00:00:32.610> what

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
grits so that's very handy now what

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:33.979 
grits so that's very handy now what
you're<00:00:32.910> going<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.149> do<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.630> you're<00:00:33.750> going<00:00:33.899> to

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
you're going to do is you're going to

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.780 
you're going to do is you're going to
make<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> chessboard<00:00:34.590> pattern<00:00:34.860> say<00:00:35.610> for

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
make a chessboard pattern say for

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.060 
make a chessboard pattern say for
example<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.360> want<00:00:36.600> some<00:00:36.750> rough<00:00:37.020> grass<00:00:37.320> then<00:00:37.739> I'm

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
example I want some rough grass then I'm

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.400 
example I want some rough grass then I'm
just<00:00:38.370> going<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.640> play<00:00:38.879> some<00:00:39.120> Bach<00:00:39.600> textures<00:00:40.140> in

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
just going to play some Bach textures in

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.930 
just going to play some Bach textures in
here<00:00:40.760> oops

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
here oops

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.110 
here oops
I'm<00:00:42.360> not<00:00:42.510> supposed<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.899> do<00:00:43.050> that's<00:00:44.059> anyway<00:00:45.059> you

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
I'm not supposed to do that's anyway you

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.299 
I'm not supposed to do that's anyway you
get<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.450> point<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.020> let's<00:00:47.010> forget<00:00:47.250> about

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
get the point of it let's forget about

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.860 
get the point of it let's forget about
that<00:00:47.520> last<00:00:47.850> bit<00:00:48.059> right<00:00:48.239> now<00:00:48.270> it's<00:00:48.510> not<00:00:48.629> really

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that last bit right now it's not really

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.139 
that last bit right now it's not really
important<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.649> then<00:00:50.160> you're<00:00:50.280> going<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.550> fill

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
important and then you're going to fill

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.479 
important and then you're going to fill
all<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.360> rest<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.930> with<00:00:52.350> normal<00:00:52.770> grass<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.309> as

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
all the rest in with normal grass and as

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.970 
all the rest in with normal grass and as
you<00:00:53.610> can<00:00:53.760> see<00:00:53.820> now<00:00:54.270> you've<00:00:55.079> got<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> somewhat

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
you can see now you've got a somewhat

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.360 
you can see now you've got a somewhat
rougher<00:00:56.640> grass<00:00:57.180> rock<00:00:57.629> ish<00:00:57.899> texture<00:00:58.530> that's<00:00:59.160> a

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
rougher grass rock ish texture that's a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.650 
rougher grass rock ish texture that's a
lot<00:00:59.579> different<00:01:00.000> than<00:01:00.090> all<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> grass

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
lot different than all of the grass

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.319 
lot different than all of the grass
textures<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.230> game<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:02.100> that's<00:01:02.370> nice<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:03.180> that

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
textures in game so that's nice but that

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.630 
textures in game so that's nice but that
isn't<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.629> only<00:01:03.719> variations<00:01:04.559> there<00:01:04.830> well<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
isn't the only variations there well the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.950 
isn't the only variations there well the
variations<00:01:06.270> are<00:01:06.420> limitless

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
variations are limitless

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.810 
variations are limitless
you've<00:01:07.320> got<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.740> lot<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.070> options<00:01:08.400> when<00:01:08.760> it

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
you've got a lot of options when it

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.020 
you've got a lot of options when it
comes<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.360> honestly<00:01:10.729> one<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.880> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
comes to this honestly one of the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.640 
comes to this honestly one of the
options<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.570> are<00:01:12.720> also<00:01:12.930> like<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.470> for

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
options that are also like is for

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.289 
options that are also like is for
example<00:01:13.799> when<00:01:14.159> you've<00:01:14.280> got<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:14.549> dry<00:01:14.939> coast

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
example when you've got this dry coast

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.140 
example when you've got this dry coast
in<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.630> Mediterranean<00:01:15.990> climate<00:01:16.470> for<00:01:16.890> example

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
in a Mediterranean climate for example

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.030 
in a Mediterranean climate for example
you<00:01:18.150> take<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.509> little<00:01:18.750> soil<00:01:19.350> kind<00:01:19.920> of

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
you take this little soil kind of

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.700 
you take this little soil kind of
texture<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.900> put<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.049> all<00:01:22.229> over<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.470> place

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
texture and put it all over the place

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.789 
texture and put it all over the place
and<00:01:23.009> then<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.060> take<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.420> white<00:01:25.049> sand<00:01:25.439> over

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
and then you take this white sand over

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.890 
and then you take this white sand over
here<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> somewhat<00:01:27.030> lighter<00:01:27.270> sign<00:01:27.659> over

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
here and the somewhat lighter sign over

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.170 
here and the somewhat lighter sign over
there<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.400> you're<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:29.430> going<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.880> fill<00:01:30.060> in

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
there and you're just going to fill in

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.319 
there and you're just going to fill in
the<00:01:30.360> rest<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.049> little<00:01:31.950> tiles<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.460> as<00:01:33.180> you

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
the rest of the little tiles and as you

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.030 
the rest of the little tiles and as you
can<00:01:33.509> see<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.869> gets<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.229> somewhat<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:34.979> between

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
can see it gets a somewhat in between

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.789 
can see it gets a somewhat in between
texture<00:01:36.030> that's<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.450> little<00:01:36.659> bit<00:01:36.810> sand<00:01:37.140> ish<00:01:37.290> but

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
texture that's a little bit sand ish but

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.630 
texture that's a little bit sand ish but
still<00:01:38.070> has<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.490> dry<00:01:39.590> texture<00:01:40.590> from<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.920> soil

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
still has that dry texture from the soil

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.749 
still has that dry texture from the soil
so<00:01:42.240> that's<00:01:42.420> really<00:01:42.659> nice<00:01:42.930> now<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.549> can

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
so that's really nice now you can

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.490 
so that's really nice now you can
honestly<00:01:45.090> blend<00:01:45.630> all<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:46.079> these<00:01:46.229> things

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
honestly blend all of these things

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.560 
honestly blend all of these things
together<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:47.070> would<00:01:47.280> really<00:01:47.549> recommend<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:48.299> try

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
together I would really recommend to try

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.210 
together I would really recommend to try
experimenting<00:01:49.200> with<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.680> try<00:01:50.009> different

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
experimenting with this try different

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.700 
experimenting with this try different
textures<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.000> maybe<00:01:51.960> you'll<00:01:52.140> find<00:01:52.350> something

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
textures and maybe you'll find something

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.069 
textures and maybe you'll find something
new<00:01:52.829> but<00:01:53.490> basically<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.450> isn't<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.780> only

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
new but basically this isn't the only

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.690 
new but basically this isn't the only
technique<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.799> can<00:01:55.920> use<00:01:56.100> for<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.340> there<00:01:56.579> are

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
technique you can use for this there are

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.760 
technique you can use for this there are
two<00:01:57.240> other<00:01:57.479> techniques<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.170> haven't<00:01:58.500> seen<00:01:58.649> many

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
two other techniques I haven't seen many

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.789 
two other techniques I haven't seen many
people<00:01:58.979> use<00:01:59.310> these<00:01:59.490> before<00:01:59.939> but<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.530> like<00:02:01.530> using

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
people use these before but I like using

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.740 
people use these before but I like using
them<00:02:02.040> I'm<00:02:02.490> just<00:02:02.549> going<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.090> create<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.360> big

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
them I'm just going to create a big

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.450 
them I'm just going to create a big
square<00:02:04.020> over<00:02:04.380> here<00:02:04.619> for<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.040> sake<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
square over here for the sake of the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.940 
square over here for the sake of the
tutorial<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:06.090> I'm<00:02:06.990> going<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.469> remove<00:02:07.740> these

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
tutorial and I'm going to remove these

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.249 
tutorial and I'm going to remove these
because<00:02:08.340> I'm<00:02:08.520> perfect

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
because I'm perfect

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.530 
because I'm perfect
and<00:02:11.230> first<00:02:12.230> of<00:02:12.349> all<00:02:12.470> we've<00:02:13.310> got<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.879> I<00:02:13.910> have<00:02:14.300> no

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
and first of all we've got the I have no

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.670 
and first of all we've got the I have no
idea<00:02:14.810> what<00:02:15.019> this<00:02:15.140> technique<00:02:15.440> is<00:02:15.650> called

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
idea what this technique is called

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.640 
idea what this technique is called
technique<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:17.000> I<00:02:17.420> can't<00:02:18.140> come<00:02:18.349> up<00:02:18.500> with<00:02:18.530> the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
technique and I can't come up with the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.970 
technique and I can't come up with the
name<00:02:18.920> but<00:02:19.190> it<00:02:19.700> basically<00:02:19.879> goes<00:02:20.269> like<00:02:20.510> this<00:02:20.980> you

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
name but it basically goes like this you

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.759 
name but it basically goes like this you
just<00:02:22.239> put<00:02:23.239> something<00:02:23.450> down<00:02:23.690> every<00:02:23.989> other<00:02:24.019> tile

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
just put something down every other tile

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.820 
just put something down every other tile
and<00:02:25.269> then<00:02:26.269> you're<00:02:27.170> going<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.380> fill<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.709> rest

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
and then you're going to fill the rest

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.770 
and then you're going to fill the rest
in<00:02:28.040> with<00:02:28.310> grass<00:02:28.610> for<00:02:28.849> example<00:02:28.880> because<00:02:29.510> I<00:02:29.599> want

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
in with grass for example because I want

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.259 
in with grass for example because I want
some<00:02:29.959> dark<00:02:30.170> ross<00:02:30.440> now<00:02:31.069> this<00:02:31.280> still<00:02:31.640> blends<00:02:32.000> in

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
some dark ross now this still blends in

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.930 
some dark ross now this still blends in
but<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:33.560> grass<00:02:33.769> for<00:02:34.040> example<00:02:34.069> blends<00:02:34.700> in<00:02:34.910> more

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
but the grass for example blends in more

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.870 
but the grass for example blends in more
than<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.720> dark<00:02:36.110> of<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.620> asphalt<00:02:36.950> texture<00:02:37.430> so

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
than the dark of the asphalt texture so

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.059 
than the dark of the asphalt texture so
as<00:02:38.030> you<00:02:38.180> can<00:02:38.299> see<00:02:38.360> what<00:02:38.780> you<00:02:38.900> get<00:02:39.080> is<00:02:39.379> grass<00:02:39.739> but

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
as you can see what you get is grass but

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.130 
as you can see what you get is grass but
just<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.400> little<00:02:40.459> bit<00:02:41.150> more<00:02:41.360> dark<00:02:41.540> than<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:41.959> use

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
just a little bit more dark than you use

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.350 
just a little bit more dark than you use
your<00:02:42.290> in-game<00:02:42.680> grass<00:02:42.980> so<00:02:43.610> if<00:02:43.760> you<00:02:43.910> want<00:02:44.150> for

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
your in-game grass so if you want for

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.150 
your in-game grass so if you want for
example<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.840> forest<00:02:45.319> or<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.590> little<00:02:45.860> bit<00:02:45.980> more

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
example a forest or a little bit more

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.610 
example a forest or a little bit more
mossy<00:02:46.700> kind<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.510> texture<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:47.989> this<00:02:48.170> is<00:02:48.349> this

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
mossy kind of texture and this is this

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.390 
mossy kind of texture and this is this
is<00:02:48.739> really<00:02:49.040> good

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
is really good

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.150 
is really good
but<00:02:50.150> there<00:02:50.690> is<00:02:50.810> also<00:02:51.110> a<00:02:51.260> variation<00:02:51.620> on<00:02:51.980> this

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
but there is also a variation on this

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.870 
but there is also a variation on this
technique<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:53.680> it<00:02:54.680> starts<00:02:55.010> out<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.280> same<00:02:55.549> and

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
technique and it starts out the same and

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.460 
technique and it starts out the same and
for<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.150> safety<00:02:56.299> tutorial<00:02:56.989> I'm<00:02:57.079> going<00:02:57.290> to<00:02:57.380> use

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
for the safety tutorial I'm going to use

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.890 
for the safety tutorial I'm going to use
the<00:02:57.650> same<00:02:57.860> texture<00:02:58.220> but<00:02:58.400> say<00:02:58.640> for<00:02:58.670> example<00:02:59.299> you

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
the same texture but say for example you

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.280 
the same texture but say for example you
want<00:03:00.230> dots<00:03:00.590> but<00:03:01.099> with<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:01.400> little<00:03:01.849> bit<00:03:02.030> of

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
want dots but with a little bit of

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.080 
want dots but with a little bit of
earthy<00:03:03.290> soil<00:03:03.860> mixed<00:03:04.459> in<00:03:04.690> well<00:03:05.690> mix<00:03:05.989> basically

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
earthy soil mixed in well mix basically

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.940 
earthy soil mixed in well mix basically
yeah<00:03:08.090> just<00:03:08.360> put<00:03:08.780> that<00:03:08.900> down<00:03:08.959> in<00:03:09.349> between<00:03:09.590> so

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
yeah just put that down in between so

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.039 
yeah just put that down in between so
you<00:03:09.980> get<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.510> chessboard<00:03:11.510> pattern<00:03:11.569> like<00:03:12.019> this

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
you get a chessboard pattern like this

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.960 
you get a chessboard pattern like this
and<00:03:12.500> then<00:03:12.590> fill<00:03:12.799> the<00:03:12.920> rest<00:03:13.069> in<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.549> texture

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
and then fill the rest in the texture

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.949 
and then fill the rest in the texture
that<00:03:14.150> you<00:03:14.389> like<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:16.150> then<00:03:17.150> as<00:03:17.600> you<00:03:17.750> can<00:03:17.900> see

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
that you like and then as you can see

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.690 
that you like and then as you can see
you<00:03:18.350> get<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.620> same<00:03:18.829> kind<00:03:19.069> of<00:03:19.220> idea<00:03:19.430> a<00:03:19.549> little

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
you get the same kind of idea a little

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.970 
you get the same kind of idea a little
bit<00:03:19.880> darker<00:03:20.209> grass<00:03:20.450> but<00:03:20.780> it's<00:03:21.500> a<00:03:21.560> bit<00:03:21.769> little

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
bit darker grass but it's a bit little

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.650 
bit darker grass but it's a bit little
bit<00:03:22.100> brownish<00:03:22.430> it's<00:03:22.910> almost<00:03:23.120> like<00:03:23.359> it's<00:03:23.600> a

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
bit brownish it's almost like it's a

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.319 
bit brownish it's almost like it's a
construction<00:03:24.200> site<00:03:24.380> or<00:03:24.560> something<00:03:24.889> or<00:03:25.329> it's

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
construction site or something or it's

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.120 
construction site or something or it's
been<00:03:26.480> taken<00:03:26.720> over<00:03:26.780> by<00:03:26.900> nature<00:03:27.260> or<00:03:27.620> something

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
been taken over by nature or something

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.080 
been taken over by nature or something
like<00:03:28.310> that's<00:03:28.459> I<00:03:28.700> have<00:03:29.120> no<00:03:29.239> idea<00:03:29.510> but<00:03:31.090> once

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
like that's I have no idea but once

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.520 
like that's I have no idea but once
again<00:03:32.209> that's<00:03:32.569> one<00:03:32.780> that's<00:03:33.049> one<00:03:33.319> of<00:03:33.440> the

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
again that's one that's one of the

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.400 
again that's one that's one of the
limitless<00:03:34.340> options<00:03:34.700> I<00:03:35.090> mean<00:03:35.269> you<00:03:35.840> can<00:03:36.019> try

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
limitless options I mean you can try

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.349 
limitless options I mean you can try
countless<00:03:36.920> of<00:03:37.010> things<00:03:37.190> with<00:03:37.340> that<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.670> if

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
countless of things with that and if

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:39.640 
countless of things with that and if
you're<00:03:38.540> a<00:03:38.569> smart<00:03:38.750> person<00:03:39.170> and<00:03:39.319> you've<00:03:39.500> already

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
you're a smart person and you've already

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.050 
you're a smart person and you've already
seen<00:03:40.010> this<00:03:40.130> coming<00:03:40.459> then<00:03:40.609> you've<00:03:40.760> seen<00:03:40.910> this

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
seen this coming then you've seen this

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.849 
seen this coming then you've seen this
coming<00:03:41.420> because<00:03:41.540> you<00:03:41.870> see<00:03:42.200> next<00:03:42.380> time<00:03:42.500> never

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
coming because you see next time never

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:43.150 
coming because you see next time never
mind

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
mind

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.580 
mind
and<00:03:43.959> yeah<00:03:44.959> that's<00:03:45.139> there's<00:03:45.470> of<00:03:45.560> course

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
and yeah that's there's of course

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.650 
and yeah that's there's of course
there's<00:03:46.010> a<00:03:46.100> there's<00:03:46.519> a<00:03:46.609> fourth<00:03:46.970> way<00:03:47.420> you<00:03:47.480> can

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
there's a there's a fourth way you can

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.289 
there's a there's a fourth way you can
do<00:03:47.750> this<00:03:47.930> and<00:03:48.430> yeah<00:03:49.430> you<00:03:49.760> must<00:03:49.940> have<00:03:50.030> seen<00:03:50.180> it

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
do this and yeah you must have seen it

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.660 
do this and yeah you must have seen it
coming<00:03:50.739> start<00:03:51.739> out<00:03:51.829> the<00:03:52.010> same<00:03:52.160> way<00:03:52.370> that<00:03:52.519> we

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
coming start out the same way that we

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.759 
coming start out the same way that we
just<00:03:53.150> started<00:03:53.329> out<00:03:53.569> I'm<00:03:53.720> just<00:03:53.900> going<00:03:54.079> to<00:03:54.139> make

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
just started out I'm just going to make

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.910 
just started out I'm just going to make
some<00:03:54.829> random<00:03:55.280> textures<00:03:55.880> here<00:03:56.530> this<00:03:57.530> one<00:03:57.709> looks

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
some random textures here this one looks

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.910 
some random textures here this one looks
nice<00:03:58.040> so<00:03:59.079> we're<00:04:00.079> gonna<00:04:00.200> put<00:04:00.440> this<00:04:00.560> out<00:04:00.769> beware

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
nice so we're gonna put this out beware

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.900 
nice so we're gonna put this out beware
and

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
and

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.750 
and
now<00:04:03.810> we<00:04:03.870> are<00:04:04.110> going<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:04.410> mix<00:04:04.770> it<00:04:05.010> with<00:04:05.040> this

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
now we are going to mix it with this

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
now we are going to mix it with this
texture<00:04:07.100> yes

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
texture yes

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.870 
texture yes
oops<00:04:10.280> I'm<00:04:11.280> going<00:04:11.460> to<00:04:11.550> replace<00:04:11.850> that<00:04:13.040> okay<00:04:14.040> now

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
oops I'm going to replace that okay now

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.420 
oops I'm going to replace that okay now
so<00:04:15.360> far<00:04:15.570> so<00:04:15.690> good<00:04:15.720> and<00:04:16.019> now<00:04:16.709> comes<00:04:16.980> the<00:04:17.070> little

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
so far so good and now comes the little

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.460 
so far so good and now comes the little
bit<00:04:17.519> harder<00:04:17.850> parts<00:04:18.209> where<00:04:18.930> you<00:04:18.959> have<00:04:19.320> to

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
bit harder parts where you have to

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.000 
bit harder parts where you have to
concentrate<00:04:20.040> to<00:04:20.160> get<00:04:20.310> it<00:04:20.430> right<00:04:21.860> we're<00:04:22.860> going

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
concentrate to get it right we're going

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.580 
concentrate to get it right we're going
to<00:04:23.070> take<00:04:23.250> this<00:04:23.490> texture<00:04:24.060> and<00:04:24.290> we're<00:04:25.290> going<00:04:25.500> to

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
to take this texture and we're going to

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.750 
to take this texture and we're going to
fill<00:04:25.830> on<00:04:25.980> every<00:04:26.370> other<00:04:26.780> diagonal<00:04:28.250> tile<00:04:29.250> like

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
fill on every other diagonal tile like

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.400 
fill on every other diagonal tile like
this<00:04:31.490> yeah<00:04:32.490> that's<00:04:32.730> good

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.380 

this<00:04:37.410> requires<00:04:37.920> some<00:04:38.070> concentration<00:04:38.400> because

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
this requires some concentration because

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.820 
this requires some concentration because
you<00:04:39.480> don't<00:04:39.660> want<00:04:39.840> to<00:04:39.900> miss<00:04:40.140> anything<00:04:40.440> so

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
you don't want to miss anything so

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.090 
you don't want to miss anything so
that's<00:04:41.460> that's<00:04:41.820> all<00:04:42.060> good<00:04:42.240> and<00:04:42.770> let's<00:04:43.770> say<00:04:43.950> for

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
that's that's all good and let's say for

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.650 
that's that's all good and let's say for
example<00:04:44.160> we<00:04:44.550> want<00:04:44.760> some<00:04:44.910> sand<00:04:45.240> with<00:04:45.510> this

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
example we want some sand with this

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.180 
example we want some sand with this
because<00:04:45.870> we're<00:04:46.170> going<00:04:46.290> to<00:04:46.380> mix<00:04:46.620> everything

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
because we're going to mix everything

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.670 
because we're going to mix everything
together<00:04:47.660> then<00:04:48.660> you<00:04:49.110> get<00:04:49.290> an<00:04:49.410> even<00:04:49.650> more

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
together then you get an even more

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.250 
together then you get an even more
complex<00:04:50.360> texture<00:04:51.360> and<00:04:51.480> now<00:04:51.570> this<00:04:51.720> isn't<00:04:51.930> the

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
complex texture and now this isn't the

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.980 
complex texture and now this isn't the
nicest<00:04:52.590> of<00:04:52.980> textures<00:04:53.490> because<00:04:53.880> I've<00:04:54.450> mixed

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
nicest of textures because I've mixed

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.650 
nicest of textures because I've mixed
some<00:04:55.170> weird<00:04:55.800> things<00:04:56.220> so<00:04:57.060> you<00:04:57.120> get<00:04:57.330> a<00:04:57.360> pretty

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
some weird things so you get a pretty

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.830 
some weird things so you get a pretty
weird<00:04:57.870> texture<00:04:58.350> but<00:04:58.950> this<00:04:59.880> is<00:04:59.940> this<00:05:00.480> is<00:05:00.540> the

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
weird texture but this is this is the

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.900 
weird texture but this is this is the
fourth<00:05:01.050> option<00:05:01.500> and<00:05:01.740> if<00:05:02.040> you<00:05:02.160> can<00:05:02.550> really<00:05:02.790> make

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
fourth option and if you can really make

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.630 
fourth option and if you can really make
some<00:05:03.290> very<00:05:04.290> well<00:05:04.590> mixing<00:05:04.950> textures<00:05:05.430> I've

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
some very well mixing textures I've

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.340 
some very well mixing textures I've
rarely<00:05:05.970> seen<00:05:06.180> people<00:05:06.630> do<00:05:06.750> that<00:05:06.960> but

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
rarely seen people do that but

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.590 
rarely seen people do that but
especially<00:05:08.190> with<00:05:08.580> the<00:05:08.670> grass<00:05:08.880> it's<00:05:09.120> possible

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
especially with the grass it's possible

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.170 
especially with the grass it's possible
then<00:05:10.170> this<00:05:10.380> can<00:05:10.560> give<00:05:11.100> you<00:05:11.280> limitless<00:05:12.000> options

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
then this can give you limitless options

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.840 
then this can give you limitless options
basically<00:05:12.900> so<00:05:13.560> that's<00:05:13.710> it<00:05:13.980> for<00:05:14.190> advanced

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
basically so that's it for advanced

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.460 
basically so that's it for advanced
texturing<00:05:15.480> I'm<00:05:15.630> just<00:05:15.840> going<00:05:15.990> to<00:05:16.110> show<00:05:16.260> you<00:05:16.320> a

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
texturing I'm just going to show you a

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.200 
texturing I'm just going to show you a
few<00:05:16.770> textures<00:05:17.220> that<00:05:17.250> I<00:05:17.430> really<00:05:17.850> like<00:05:18.000> with

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
few textures that I really like with

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.150 
few textures that I really like with
these<00:05:18.360> tricks

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
these tricks

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.010 
these tricks
all<00:05:20.160> right<00:05:20.610> this<00:05:20.820> for<00:05:21.030> example<00:05:21.300> is<00:05:21.510> arguably

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
all right this for example is arguably

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.950 
all right this for example is arguably
the<00:05:22.110> best<00:05:22.500> most<00:05:22.890> texture<00:05:23.370> in<00:05:23.490> the<00:05:23.580> game<00:05:23.960> it's

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
the best most texture in the game it's

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.990 
the best most texture in the game it's
made<00:05:25.200> by<00:05:25.350> mixing<00:05:25.590> the<00:05:25.890> asphalt<00:05:26.250> texture<00:05:26.700> with

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
made by mixing the asphalt texture with

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.620 
made by mixing the asphalt texture with
this<00:05:27.240> little<00:05:28.110> bit<00:05:28.260> lighter<00:05:29.190> greener<00:05:30.150> ish

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
this little bit lighter greener ish

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.100 
this little bit lighter greener ish
green<00:05:31.080> than<00:05:31.320> the<00:05:31.350> usual<00:05:31.890> grass<00:05:32.130> and<00:05:33.110> yeah

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
green than the usual grass and yeah

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.720 
green than the usual grass and yeah
that's<00:05:34.290> when<00:05:34.470> you<00:05:34.560> get<00:05:34.680> this<00:05:34.860> and<00:05:35.190> this<00:05:35.580> is

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
that's when you get this and this is

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.409 
that's when you get this and this is
very<00:05:35.910> useful<00:05:36.390> for<00:05:36.419> magical<00:05:37.020> forests<00:05:37.560> or<00:05:37.800> just

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
very useful for magical forests or just

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.800 
very useful for magical forests or just

this<00:05:43.020> is<00:05:43.169> the<00:05:43.320> somewhat<00:05:43.650> greyish<00:05:44.190> asphalt

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
this is the somewhat greyish asphalt

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.490 
this is the somewhat greyish asphalt
texture<00:05:45.180> as<00:05:45.300> I<00:05:45.390> like<00:05:45.570> to<00:05:45.750> call<00:05:45.780> it<00:05:45.990> I've<00:05:46.290> used

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
texture as I like to call it I've used

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.860 
texture as I like to call it I've used
this<00:05:46.650> one<00:05:46.860> in<00:05:47.190> my<00:05:47.610> coaster<00:05:48.000> ileus<00:05:48.450> shout-out

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
this one in my coaster ileus shout-out

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.390 
this one in my coaster ileus shout-out
to<00:05:49.020> those<00:05:49.169> who<00:05:49.380> still<00:05:49.560> remember<00:05:49.950> at<00:05:50.070> least<00:05:50.280> by

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
to those who still remember at least by

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.310 
to those who still remember at least by
the<00:05:50.430> way<00:05:50.640> and<00:05:51.120> it's<00:05:51.360> a<00:05:51.450> little<00:05:51.540> bit<00:05:51.690> more<00:05:51.960> light

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
the way and it's a little bit more light

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.920 
the way and it's a little bit more light
and<00:05:52.590> grayish<00:05:53.130> than<00:05:53.370> the<00:05:53.490> in-game<00:05:53.930> asphalt

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
and grayish than the in-game asphalt

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.570 
and grayish than the in-game asphalt
which<00:05:55.110> is<00:05:55.260> a<00:05:55.290> little<00:05:55.560> bit<00:05:55.650> too<00:05:55.919> dark<00:05:56.220> for<00:05:56.310> my

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
which is a little bit too dark for my

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.310 
which is a little bit too dark for my
taste<00:05:56.610> and<00:05:57.120> this<00:05:57.210> is<00:05:57.360> this<00:05:57.780> is<00:05:57.930> great<00:05:58.050> for

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
taste and this is this is great for

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.900 
taste and this is this is great for
paths<00:05:58.560> for<00:05:58.890> example<00:05:59.250> and<00:05:59.340> it's<00:05:59.430> made<00:05:59.610> by

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
paths for example and it's made by

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.060 
paths for example and it's made by
mixing<00:06:00.540> this<00:06:00.840> dark<00:06:01.110> asphalt<00:06:01.560> actually<00:06:01.919> with

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
mixing this dark asphalt actually with

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.040 
mixing this dark asphalt actually with
this<00:06:02.190> very<00:06:02.520> light<00:06:02.760> texture<00:06:03.390> you<00:06:03.630> see<00:06:03.810> over

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
this very light texture you see over

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.220 
this very light texture you see over
here<00:06:04.110> and<00:06:04.410> that's<00:06:05.010> where<00:06:05.190> you<00:06:05.250> get<00:06:05.340> this<00:06:06.230> now

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.230 
here and that's where you get this now

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.810 
here and that's where you get this now
the<00:06:07.290> last<00:06:07.590> one<00:06:07.890> is<00:06:08.040> what<00:06:08.220> I'd<00:06:08.340> like<00:06:08.520> to<00:06:08.580> call

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
the last one is what I'd like to call

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.080 
the last one is what I'd like to call
the<00:06:08.970> in-between<00:06:09.690> sand<00:06:10.169> you<00:06:10.800> mix<00:06:11.010> this<00:06:11.669> darker

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
the in-between sand you mix this darker

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.940 
the in-between sand you mix this darker
sand<00:06:12.419> with<00:06:12.690> this<00:06:12.900> dune<00:06:13.140> sands

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950 
sand with this dune sands

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.070 
sand with this dune sands
and<00:06:14.040> the<00:06:14.370> reason<00:06:14.670> why<00:06:14.790> I<00:06:14.820> like<00:06:15.330> to<00:06:15.540> do<00:06:15.660> that<00:06:15.840> is

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
and the reason why I like to do that is

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.650 
and the reason why I like to do that is
because<00:06:16.380> this<00:06:16.530> dune<00:06:16.800> sands<00:06:17.130> is<00:06:17.400> way<00:06:18.150> too<00:06:18.210> light

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
because this dune sands is way too light

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.050 
because this dune sands is way too light
and<00:06:19.020> if<00:06:19.560> you<00:06:19.650> turn<00:06:19.800> on<00:06:20.040> bloom<00:06:20.250> it's<00:06:20.550> just<00:06:20.910> going

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
and if you turn on bloom it's just going

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.440 
and if you turn on bloom it's just going
to<00:06:21.150> kill<00:06:21.390> your<00:06:21.570> eyes<00:06:21.720> and<00:06:22.640> yeah<00:06:23.640> it's<00:06:24.060> nice<00:06:24.180> to

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
to kill your eyes and yeah it's nice to

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.270 
to kill your eyes and yeah it's nice to
mix<00:06:24.600> it<00:06:24.720> with<00:06:24.840> with<00:06:25.440> this<00:06:25.560> dark<00:06:25.800> scent<00:06:26.100> like

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
mix it with with this dark scent like

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.490 
mix it with with this dark scent like
this<00:06:26.490> and<00:06:26.760> yeah<00:06:27.750> you<00:06:28.020> still<00:06:28.230> have<00:06:28.350> that

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
this and yeah you still have that

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.720 
this and yeah you still have that
dooney's<00:06:29.250> windy<00:06:30.030> sand<00:06:30.480> texture<00:06:30.960> but<00:06:31.650> it's<00:06:32.640> a

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:32.730 
dooney's windy sand texture but it's a

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.180 
dooney's windy sand texture but it's a
little<00:06:32.850> bit<00:06:32.970> darker<00:06:33.510> and<00:06:33.630> that's<00:06:33.810> nice

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
little bit darker and that's nice

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.680 
little bit darker and that's nice
alright<00:06:35.190> so<00:06:35.430> as<00:06:35.550> an<00:06:35.670> example<00:06:35.790> I<00:06:36.210> want<00:06:36.420> to<00:06:36.540> give

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 
alright so as an example I want to give

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:37.640 
alright so as an example I want to give
my<00:06:36.870> coaster<00:06:37.320> called

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
my coaster called

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.250 
my coaster called
all<00:06:37.740> for<00:06:38.070> I've<00:06:38.370> used<00:06:38.790> this<00:06:39.000> I've<00:06:39.570> used<00:06:39.900> few<00:06:40.200> of

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
all for I've used this I've used few of

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.840 
all for I've used this I've used few of
these<00:06:40.410> tricks<00:06:40.710> all<00:06:40.980> over<00:06:41.250> the<00:06:41.340> place<00:06:41.550> as<00:06:41.760> you

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850 
these tricks all over the place as you

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.300 
these tricks all over the place as you
can<00:06:42.000> see<00:06:42.210> these<00:06:42.780> aren't<00:06:43.080> the<00:06:43.590> normal<00:06:43.950> in-game

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.310 
can see these aren't the normal in-game

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.370 
can see these aren't the normal in-game
textures<00:06:44.850> I've<00:06:45.030> used<00:06:45.630> a<00:06:45.810> lot<00:06:45.960> of<00:06:46.140> rock

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 
textures I've used a lot of rock

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.200 
textures I've used a lot of rock
textures<00:06:46.920> and<00:06:47.190> mixing<00:06:47.580> them<00:06:47.760> with<00:06:47.790> grass

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.210 
textures and mixing them with grass

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.990 
textures and mixing them with grass
textures<00:06:48.690> as<00:06:48.870> you<00:06:48.990> can<00:06:49.140> see<00:06:49.350> and<00:06:49.560> also<00:06:50.430> using

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 
textures as you can see and also using

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.640 
textures as you can see and also using
sand<00:06:51.390> textures<00:06:51.870> here<00:06:52.140> and<00:06:52.290> there

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
sand textures here and there

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.850 
sand textures here and there
these<00:06:53.160> are<00:06:53.370> these<00:06:53.550> little<00:06:53.930> yellow<00:06:54.930> brownish

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 
these are these little yellow brownish

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.630 
these are these little yellow brownish
spots<00:06:56.430> and<00:06:57.830> altogether<00:06:58.830> it<00:06:59.130> looks<00:06:59.400> pretty

00:06:59.630 --> 00:06:59.640 
spots and altogether it looks pretty

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.120 
spots and altogether it looks pretty
nice<00:06:59.790> I<00:07:00.060> think<00:07:00.300> so<00:07:00.960> this<00:07:01.410> is<00:07:01.560> the<00:07:01.680> way<00:07:01.800> you<00:07:01.860> can

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.130 
nice I think so this is the way you can

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.880 
nice I think so this is the way you can
use<00:07:02.370> these<00:07:02.580> techniques<00:07:02.970> and<00:07:03.360> I<00:07:03.870> hope<00:07:04.770> you

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:04.890 
use these techniques and I hope you

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.860 
use these techniques and I hope you
learned<00:07:05.070> something<00:07:05.310> from<00:07:05.490> this<00:07:05.640> tutorial<00:07:05.970> so

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:06.870 
learned something from this tutorial so

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.830 
learned something from this tutorial so
thanks<00:07:07.350> for<00:07:07.470> watching
