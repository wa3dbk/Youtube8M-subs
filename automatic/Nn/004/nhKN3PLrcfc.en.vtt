pretty much just have to jump right to

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.750 
pretty much just have to jump right to
the<00:02:25.780> end<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:26.230> this<00:02:26.530> puzzle<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:27.190> there's<00:02:27.670> a

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760

chest<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.270> there's<00:02:28.990> also<00:02:29.170> a<00:02:29.350> portal<00:02:29.800> that

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
chest and there's also a portal that

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.300 
chest and there's also a portal that
ports<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:30.790> right<00:02:30.970> out<00:02:31.120> so<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:32.200> then<00:02:32.890> get<00:02:33.130> this
