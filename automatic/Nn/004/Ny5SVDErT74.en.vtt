00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
on how that works you can go into the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.740 
on how that works you can go into the
folder<00:01:26.100> itself<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:28.070> you<00:01:29.070> can<00:01:29.509> go<00:01:30.509> ahead<00:01:30.600> and

not quite configured properly so we're

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.620 
not quite configured properly so we're

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
going to go to the root of the site and

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.389 
going to go to the root of the site and
we're<00:01:48.750> going<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.899> make<00:01:49.049> some<00:01:49.350> changes<00:01:49.619> up<00:01:50.009> here

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
we're going to make some changes up here

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.789 
we're going to make some changes up here
before<00:01:51.149> we<00:01:51.240> can<00:01:51.329> get<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.659> work<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.439> we're

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
before we can get this to work so we're

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.270 
before we can get this to work so we're
going<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.979> click<00:01:53.329> FTP<00:01:54.329> authentication<00:01:55.280> and

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
going to click FTP authentication and

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.530 
going to click FTP authentication and
we're<00:01:56.369> going<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.549> make<00:01:56.670> sure<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:56.969> our<00:01:57.030> basic

authentication is enabled by default
it's<00:01:59.670> disabled<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.299> can<00:02:00.509> enable<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.960> or

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
it's disabled so you can enable it or

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.469 
it's disabled so you can enable it or
disable<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.130> right-hand<00:02:02.520> corner<00:02:02.759> and

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
that is enabled on basic just like at

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.210 
that is enabled on basic just like at
the<00:03:35.000> root<00:03:35.299> level<00:03:35.439> then<00:03:36.439> we'll<00:03:36.650> go<00:03:36.769> to<00:03:36.829> FTP

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
the root level then we'll go to FTP

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.550 
the root level then we'll go to FTP
authorization<00:03:38.150> and<00:03:38.840> here's<00:03:39.290> where<00:03:39.470> we're

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
authorization and here's where we're

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.080 
authorization and here's where we're
going<00:03:39.680> to<00:03:39.739> now<00:03:39.859> go<00:03:40.009> ahead<00:03:40.099> and<00:03:40.310> add<00:03:40.489> our<00:03:40.790> allow

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
root of our test and we've got current

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.479

sessions<00:03:50.989> which<00:03:51.169> we<00:03:51.259> don't<00:03:51.379> have<00:03:51.500> yet<00:03:51.650> let's

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
sessions which we don't have yet let's

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.490 
sessions which we don't have yet let's
go<00:03:52.609> to<00:03:52.699> FTP<00:03:53.000> Firewall<00:03:53.540> support<00:03:53.959> you<00:03:54.139> can<00:03:54.259> see

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
go to FTP Firewall support you can see

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.039 
go to FTP Firewall support you can see
the<00:03:54.680> changes<00:03:55.009> we<00:03:55.159> made<00:03:55.310> at<00:03:55.549> the<00:03:56.180> top<00:03:56.419> level<00:03:56.900> up

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
the changes we made at the top level up

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.830 
the changes we made at the top level up
here<00:03:57.379> are<00:03:57.590> now<00:03:57.859> carried<00:03:58.819> down<00:03:58.970> to<00:03:59.239> the<00:03:59.540> child

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
here are now carried down to the child

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.379 
here are now carried down to the child
level<00:04:00.109> here<00:04:00.590> so<00:04:00.799> this<00:04:00.979> is<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.549> correct

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
level here so this is the correct

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:07.240 
level here so this is the correct
settings<00:04:03.519> and<00:04:04.519> we'll<00:04:04.729> go<00:04:04.819> to<00:04:04.909> the<00:04:05.030> FTP<00:04:06.250> address

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
settings and we'll go to the FTP address

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.580 
settings and we'll go to the FTP address
into<00:04:07.699> instructions<00:04:08.269> and<00:04:08.540> again<00:04:08.810> this<00:04:09.199> passed

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
into instructions and again this passed

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.349 
into instructions and again this passed
down<00:04:09.889> from<00:04:10.189> the<00:04:10.370> parent<00:04:10.669> level<00:04:10.790> down<00:04:11.090> to<00:04:11.150> the

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
down from the parent level down to the

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.580 
down from the parent level down to the
child<00:04:11.659> level<00:04:13.540> all<00:04:14.540> right<00:04:14.750> so<00:04:14.930> we're<00:04:15.409> going<00:04:15.530> to

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590

them to click on advanced and change the

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.409 
them to click on advanced and change the
block<00:05:15.650> edge<00:05:15.949> traversal<00:05:16.520> to<00:05:16.669> allow<00:05:17.060> edge

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
block edge traversal to allow edge

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.110 
block edge traversal to allow edge
traversal<00:05:18.050> and<00:05:18.650> that<00:05:19.190> helps<00:05:19.430> you<00:05:19.639> get<00:05:19.819> through

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
traversal and that helps you get through

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.680 
traversal and that helps you get through
a<00:05:20.150> certain<00:05:20.389> firewalls<00:05:21.020> and<00:05:21.819> then<00:05:22.819> click<00:05:23.030> OK

a certain firewalls and then click OK
so<00:05:23.840> one<00:05:24.080> more<00:05:24.289> change<00:05:24.560> we<00:05:24.650> need<00:05:24.800> to<00:05:24.830> make<00:05:24.919> and

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
so one more change we need to make and

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.920 
so one more change we need to make and
this<00:05:25.580> is<00:05:25.759> sort<00:05:25.940> of<00:05:26.000> a<00:05:26.090> radical<00:05:26.479> change<00:05:26.780> that

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
this is sort of a radical change that

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.689 
this is sort of a radical change that
some<00:05:27.259> people<00:05:27.500> may<00:05:27.680> or<00:05:27.949> may<00:05:28.099> not<00:05:28.130> agree<00:05:28.490> with

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 
some people may or may not agree with

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.659 
some people may or may not agree with
but<00:05:28.849> it<00:05:28.969> does<00:05:29.180> make<00:05:29.449> it<00:05:29.509> work<00:05:29.830> so<00:05:30.830> yeah<00:05:31.310> once

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
but it does make it work so yeah once

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.540 
but it does make it work so yeah once
you<00:05:31.849> make<00:05:32.090> the<00:05:32.830> firewall<00:05:33.830> change<00:05:34.159> to<00:05:34.430> allow

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
you make the firewall change to allow

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.930 
you make the firewall change to allow
inbound<00:05:35.330> on<00:05:35.509> port<00:05:35.780> 21<00:05:36.139> and<00:05:36.590> also<00:05:37.009> on<00:05:37.190> 20<00:05:37.729> if<00:05:37.909> you

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
inbound on port 21 and also on 20 if you

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.390 
inbound on port 21 and also on 20 if you
want<00:05:38.210> to<00:05:38.270> do<00:05:38.360> passive<00:05:38.779> FTP<00:05:39.259> then<00:05:39.979> you<00:05:40.099> need<00:05:40.279> to

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
want to do passive FTP then you need to

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.430 
want to do passive FTP then you need to
make<00:05:40.550> one<00:05:40.729> more<00:05:40.789> change<00:05:41.389> and<00:05:41.719> that<00:05:41.810> is<00:05:42.110> you

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
make one more change and that is you

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:49.180 
make one more change and that is you
need<00:05:42.620> to<00:05:42.800> allow<00:05:43.569> all<00:05:44.569> all<00:05:45.139> ports<00:05:47.949> which<00:05:48.949> is

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
need to allow all all ports which is

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:55.980 
need to allow all all ports which is
going<00:05:49.340> to<00:05:49.490> be<00:05:49.550> a<00:05:49.580> range<00:05:50.060> of<00:05:52.270> 1024<00:05:53.300> to<00:05:54.250> 65,000

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
going to be a range of 1024 to 65,000

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.600 
going to be a range of 1024 to 65,000
now<00:05:56.990> if<00:05:57.080> you<00:05:57.199> don't<00:05:57.409> make<00:05:57.590> that<00:05:57.620> change<00:05:58.190> then

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
now if you don't make that change then

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.640 
now if you don't make that change then
this<00:05:59.029> the<00:05:59.419> whole<00:05:59.630> thing<00:05:59.930> won't<00:06:00.080> work<00:06:00.229> from<00:06:00.529> the

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
this the whole thing won't work from the

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.439 
this the whole thing won't work from the
outside<00:06:01.039> but<00:06:01.279> it<00:06:01.400> will<00:06:01.490> work<00:06:01.639> fine<00:06:01.969> from<00:06:02.300> the

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
outside but it will work fine from the

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:05.080 
outside but it will work fine from the
inside<00:06:02.840> so<00:06:03.710> if<00:06:04.340> you<00:06:04.520> want<00:06:04.699> to<00:06:04.759> make<00:06:04.880> it<00:06:04.969> work

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
inside so if you want to make it work

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.490 
inside so if you want to make it work
from<00:06:05.150> the<00:06:05.270> outside<00:06:05.569> you've<00:06:05.750> got<00:06:05.779> to<00:06:06.139> open<00:06:06.289> up

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
from the outside you've got to open up

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.629 
from the outside you've got to open up
these<00:06:06.650> port<00:06:06.860> now<00:06:06.949> you<00:06:07.009> don't<00:06:07.130> have<00:06:07.250> to<00:06:07.310> open<00:06:07.430> up

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 
these port now you don't have to open up

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:09.100 
these port now you don't have to open up
all<00:06:07.880> these<00:06:08.090> ports<00:06:08.479> you<00:06:08.599> can<00:06:08.750> do<00:06:08.870> some<00:06:09.080> testing

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
all these ports you can do some testing

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.860 
all these ports you can do some testing
I<00:06:09.680> thought<00:06:10.310> you<00:06:10.550> know<00:06:10.610> port<00:06:10.880> thousand<00:06:11.270> 24<00:06:11.690> on

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
I thought you know port thousand 24 on

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.740 
I thought you know port thousand 24 on
up<00:06:12.080> there<00:06:12.319> are<00:06:12.500> much<00:06:12.800> less<00:06:13.039> risky<00:06:13.460> than<00:06:13.750> ports

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
up there are much less risky than ports

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.570 
up there are much less risky than ports
below<00:06:15.080> thousand<00:06:15.500> 24<00:06:15.889> where<00:06:16.190> all<00:06:16.430> the

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
below thousand 24 where all the

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.080 
below thousand 24 where all the
communication<00:06:17.180> happens<00:06:17.599> with<00:06:18.500> Windows<00:06:18.949> so<00:06:19.639> go

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
communication happens with Windows so go

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.029 
communication happens with Windows so go
ahead<00:06:20.180> and<00:06:20.360> open<00:06:20.690> that<00:06:20.900> up<00:06:21.080> and<00:06:21.440> then<00:06:21.500> if<00:06:21.919> you

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:22.039 
ahead and open that up and then if you

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:24.999 
ahead and open that up and then if you
choose<00:06:22.219> you<00:06:22.430> want<00:06:22.639> to<00:06:22.960> narrow<00:06:23.960> that<00:06:24.289> to<00:06:24.710> less

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:25.009 
choose you want to narrow that to less

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:26.649 
choose you want to narrow that to less
ports<00:06:25.460> you<00:06:25.580> can<00:06:25.699> certainly<00:06:25.849> do<00:06:26.120> that<00:06:26.270> as<00:06:26.539> long

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:26.659 
ports you can certainly do that as long

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:28.120 
ports you can certainly do that as long
as<00:06:26.750> it<00:06:26.840> works<00:06:26.960> you<00:06:27.229> can<00:06:27.380> continue<00:06:27.770> making<00:06:27.919> that

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
as it works you can continue making that

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.089 
as it works you can continue making that
go<00:06:28.599> alright<00:06:29.599> so<00:06:29.750> before<00:06:29.990> we<00:06:30.469> could<00:06:30.740> not<00:06:30.919> get

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:31.099 
go alright so before we could not get

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.930 
go alright so before we could not get
anywhere<00:06:31.430> now<00:06:31.759> let's<00:06:32.060> see<00:06:32.240> if<00:06:32.330> it<00:06:32.449> works<00:06:32.719> and

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
anywhere now let's see if it works and

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.550 
anywhere now let's see if it works and
there<00:06:34.940> it<00:06:35.029> is<00:06:35.120> directory<00:06:35.659> listing<00:06:35.990> successful

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
there it is directory listing successful

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.850 
there it is directory listing successful
there

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
there

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.070 
there
is<00:06:36.979> our<00:06:37.430> files<00:06:38.030> on<00:06:38.240> the<00:06:38.300> right-hand<00:06:38.629> side<00:06:38.840> on

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
is our files on the right-hand side on

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.839 
is our files on the right-hand side on
the<00:06:39.110> server<00:06:39.409> and<00:06:39.710> our<00:06:39.949> local<00:06:40.159> files<00:06:40.490> on<00:06:40.789> the

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:40.849 
the server and our local files on the

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:42.939 
the server and our local files on the
left-hand<00:06:41.240> side<00:06:41.379> so<00:06:42.379> now<00:06:42.560> you<00:06:42.620> know<00:06:42.770> how<00:06:42.889> to

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:42.949 
left-hand side so now you know how to

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:46.990 
left-hand side so now you know how to
get<00:06:43.129> through<00:06:43.400> the<00:06:43.639> errors<00:06:44.330> that<00:06:45.289> are<00:06:46.000> come

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 
get through the errors that are come

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.119 
get through the errors that are come
along<00:06:47.270> with<00:06:47.509> creating<00:06:48.229> an<00:06:48.319> FTP<00:06:48.740> site<00:06:48.949> and
