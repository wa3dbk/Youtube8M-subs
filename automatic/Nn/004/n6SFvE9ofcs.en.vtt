00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.520
 soon spread to the ship more than 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.980
 I never imagined that it would give so much work 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.649
 simplicity without such dedication not 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.700

 Obviously personal and not here 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.539
 and from face to human location was 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:58.530
 probable the dedication of christina to 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:01.530
 Paraguayan identification and it's not here 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.829

 little bit 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:36.150
