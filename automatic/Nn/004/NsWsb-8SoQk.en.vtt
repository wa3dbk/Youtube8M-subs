spider-man<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.850> movie<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.300> know<00:00:18.539> you've

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
spider-man in the movie I know you've

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.660 
spider-man in the movie I know you've
said<00:00:19.080> multiple<00:00:19.199> times<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.770> overcrowding<00:00:20.580> a

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
said multiple times that overcrowding a

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.730 
said multiple times that overcrowding a
movie<00:00:20.939> isn't<00:00:21.090> really<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.420> thing<00:00:21.510> but<00:00:22.050> still<00:00:22.380> it

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
movie isn't really a thing but still it

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.590 
movie isn't really a thing but still it
seems<00:00:23.189> like<00:00:23.369> that'd<00:00:23.640> be<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.730> lot<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.000> people<00:00:24.330> to

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
seems like that'd be a lot of people to

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.060 
seems like that'd be a lot of people to
split<00:00:24.779> screen<00:00:25.170> screen<00:00:25.710> time<00:00:25.920> between

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
split screen screen time between

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.830 
split screen screen time between

worry<00:01:47.100> about<00:01:47.369> overcrowding<00:01:47.759> I'm<00:01:48.329> starting<00:01:48.990> to

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
worry about overcrowding I'm starting to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.600 
worry about overcrowding I'm starting to
worry<00:01:49.259> about<00:01:49.350> overcrowding<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.159> not<00:01:50.430> just

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
worry about overcrowding and not just

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.770 
worry about overcrowding and not just
the<00:01:50.700> overcrowding<00:01:51.270> issue<00:01:51.450> but<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.659> other

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
the overcrowding issue but the other

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.060 
the overcrowding issue but the other
thing<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.079> brought<00:01:52.140> up<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.470> few<00:01:52.619> weeks<00:01:52.710> ago<00:01:52.860> is

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
thing I brought up a few weeks ago is

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.789 
thing I brought up a few weeks ago is
that<00:01:53.570> even<00:01:54.570> if<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.750> doesn't<00:01:54.990> feel<00:01:55.049> overcrowded

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
that even if it doesn't feel overcrowded

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.260 
that even if it doesn't feel overcrowded
it's<00:01:56.070> starting<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.549> feel<00:01:56.670> less<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.090> less<00:01:57.149> like

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
it's starting to feel less and less like

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.240 
it's starting to feel less and less like
a<00:01:57.479> Captain<00:01:57.840> America<00:01:57.899> movie<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.740> after<00:01:58.890> seeing

think<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.060> had<00:02:27.180> anything<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.569> do<00:02:27.780> with<00:02:27.810> the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
think that had anything to do with the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.740 
think that had anything to do with the
with<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.459> inclusion<00:02:30.000> or<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.330> lack<00:02:30.510> of

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
with the inclusion or the lack of

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.020 
with the inclusion or the lack of
certain<00:02:31.140> other<00:02:31.349> Marvel<00:02:31.800> characters<00:02:32.250> in<00:02:32.550> that

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
certain other Marvel characters in that

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.720 
certain other Marvel characters in that
film<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:34.170> it's<00:02:34.650> called<00:02:34.890> civil<00:02:35.130> war<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.580> so

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
film this it's called civil war and so

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.759 
film this it's called civil war and so
when<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.000> if<00:02:36.239> it's<00:02:36.660> Iron<00:02:36.930> Man<00:02:37.170> going<00:02:37.470> against

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769

Captain America and those are your two
weed<00:02:39.239> dogs<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.750> know<00:02:39.930> we<00:02:40.200> have<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.410> other

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
weed dogs I know we have the other

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.710 
weed dogs I know we have the other
Avengers<00:02:40.890> they<00:02:41.220> might<00:02:41.459> take<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.819> step<00:02:42.090> back<00:02:42.330> so

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
Avengers they might take a step back so

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.880 
Avengers they might take a step back so
you<00:02:42.810> can<00:02:42.930> introduce<00:02:43.260> these<00:02:43.379> new<00:02:43.590> characters

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
you can introduce these new characters

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.740 
you can introduce these new characters
and<00:02:44.220> spider-man<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.420> think<00:02:45.569> it's<00:02:45.660> the

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
and spider-man and I think it's the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.030 
and spider-man and I think it's the
right<00:02:45.900> way<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.110> go<00:02:46.349> particularly<00:02:46.769> about

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
right way to go particularly about

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.710 
right way to go particularly about
spider-man<00:02:47.430> it's<00:02:47.700> like<00:02:47.819> I<00:02:47.880> don't<00:02:47.940> need<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.209> see

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.180 
spider-man it's like I don't need to see
spider-man's<00:02:49.319> on<00:02:49.470> screen<00:02:49.739> I<00:02:49.769> don't<00:02:49.980> need<00:02:50.160> a

spider-man's on screen I don't need a

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.979

be seen by seeing like you're gonna have

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.550 
be seen by seeing like you're gonna have
an<00:03:17.880> Avengers<00:03:18.359> scene<00:03:18.660> you're<00:03:19.260> gonna<00:03:19.350> have<00:03:19.530> a

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
an Avengers scene you're gonna have a

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.500 
an Avengers scene you're gonna have a
big<00:03:19.889> scene<00:03:20.190> that<00:03:20.430> kind<00:03:20.700> of<00:03:20.790> pushes<00:03:21.150> you<00:03:21.299> into

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
big scene that kind of pushes you into

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.539 
big scene that kind of pushes you into
what<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.959> Civil<00:03:22.260> War<00:03:22.290> is<00:03:22.620> people<00:03:23.370> are<00:03:23.459> gonna

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
what the Civil War is people are gonna

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.610 
what the Civil War is people are gonna
split<00:03:24.420> up<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.660> become<00:03:25.139> you<00:03:25.350> know<00:03:25.380> take

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
split up and become you know take

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.300 
split up and become you know take
different<00:03:25.799> sides

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
different sides

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.099 
different sides
I<00:03:26.430> think<00:03:26.790> Black<00:03:26.970> Panther<00:03:27.420> will<00:03:27.630> have<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:27.810> bigger

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
I think Black Panther will have a bigger

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.590 
I think Black Panther will have a bigger
role<00:03:28.350> than<00:03:28.560> spider-man<00:03:29.040> will<00:03:29.730> have<00:03:29.940> I<00:03:30.209> agree<00:03:30.420> I

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
role than spider-man will have I agree I

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.780 
role than spider-man will have I agree I
think<00:03:31.170> Black<00:03:31.950> Panther<00:03:32.250> might<00:03:32.400> be<00:03:32.519> the<00:03:32.639> one

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
think Black Panther might be the one

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.129 
think Black Panther might be the one
that<00:03:32.970> they're<00:03:33.090> trying<00:03:33.299> to<00:03:33.329> split<00:03:33.540> sides<00:03:33.900> with

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
that they're trying to split sides with

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.559 
that they're trying to split sides with
I<00:03:34.440> wonder<00:03:34.739> if<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:35.010> situation<00:03:36.000> that<00:03:36.150> we<00:03:36.329> see

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
I wonder if the situation that we see

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.090 
I wonder if the situation that we see
from<00:03:36.930> all<00:03:37.079> these<00:03:37.200> set<00:03:37.470> photos<00:03:37.859> with

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
from all these set photos with

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.370 
from all these set photos with
crossbones<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:39.569> know<00:03:39.690> if<00:03:39.900> that's<00:03:40.079> gonna<00:03:40.200> be

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
crossbones you know if that's gonna be

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.870 
crossbones you know if that's gonna be
maybe<00:03:40.739> it<00:03:40.889> could<00:03:41.040> be<00:03:41.130> what<00:03:41.280> condo<00:03:41.639> we<00:03:41.730> don't

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
maybe it could be what condo we don't

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.449 
maybe it could be what condo we don't
know<00:03:42.060> but<00:03:42.359> I<00:03:42.569> mean<00:03:43.049> I<00:03:43.319> think<00:03:43.859> it's<00:03:44.040> gonna<00:03:44.160> set

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
know but I mean I think it's gonna set

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.949 
know but I mean I think it's gonna set
stuff<00:03:44.700> up<00:03:44.850> and<00:03:45.060> cap<00:03:45.239> is<00:03:45.389> gonna<00:03:45.540> be<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.780> main

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
stuff up and cap is gonna be the main

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.270 
stuff up and cap is gonna be the main
character<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:46.680> know<00:03:46.799> who's<00:03:46.950> gonna<00:03:47.100> be<00:03:47.190> a

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
character you know who's gonna be a

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.099 
character you know who's gonna be a
secondary<00:03:47.760> character<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.450> seems<00:03:48.750> like<00:03:48.930> it'll

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
secondary character it seems like it'll

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.629 
secondary character it seems like it'll
be<00:03:49.139> Iron<00:03:49.380> Man<00:03:49.620> yeah<00:03:50.010> and<00:03:50.130> then<00:03:50.220> everyone<00:03:50.609> else

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
be Iron Man yeah and then everyone else

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.129 
be Iron Man yeah and then everyone else
will<00:03:50.910> have<00:03:50.940> their<00:03:51.329> role<00:03:51.569> and<00:03:51.780> have<00:03:51.959> their

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
will have their role and have their

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.979 
will have their role and have their
scenes<00:03:52.470> but<00:03:53.040> as<00:03:53.190> supporting<00:03:53.790> roles<00:03:54.510> so<00:03:54.959> I

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
scenes but as supporting roles so I

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.240 
scenes but as supporting roles so I
don't<00:03:55.200> think<00:03:55.410> it's<00:03:55.530> gonna<00:03:55.620> be<00:03:55.829> too<00:03:55.980> crowded

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
don't think it's gonna be too crowded

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.099 
don't think it's gonna be too crowded
and<00:03:56.579> I<00:03:56.910> think<00:03:57.120> spider-man<00:03:57.329> will<00:03:57.660> definitely

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
and I think spider-man will definitely

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.780 
and I think spider-man will definitely
be<00:03:58.260> in<00:03:58.290> there<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.739> he'll<00:03:58.920> be<00:03:59.069> a<00:03:59.099> supporting

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
be in there and he'll be a supporting

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.360 
be in there and he'll be a supporting
role<00:03:59.819> for<00:04:00.269> sure<00:04:00.780> he<00:04:01.230> might<00:04:01.410> have<00:04:01.650> a<00:04:01.889> little<00:04:02.160> bit

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
role for sure he might have a little bit

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.430 
role for sure he might have a little bit
more<00:04:02.579> time<00:04:02.819> than<00:04:02.849> maybe<00:04:03.299> Black<00:04:03.630> Widow<00:04:03.900> or

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
more time than maybe Black Widow or

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.620 
more time than maybe Black Widow or
maybe<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.370> vision<00:04:05.760> spider-man<00:04:06.510> will

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
maybe the vision spider-man will

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:07.789 
maybe the vision spider-man will
probably<00:04:06.900> have<00:04:06.989> a<00:04:07.019> little<00:04:07.200> bit<00:04:07.349> more<00:04:07.560> time

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
probably have a little bit more time

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.379 
probably have a little bit more time
than<00:04:07.829> that<00:04:07.980> but<00:04:08.280> you<00:04:08.700> know<00:04:08.790> I<00:04:08.819> think<00:04:09.239> once

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
than that but you know I think once

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.150 
than that but you know I think once
again<00:04:09.660> you're<00:04:10.019> talking<00:04:10.169> about<00:04:10.440> possibly<00:04:11.040> a

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
again you're talking about possibly a

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.250 
again you're talking about possibly a
two<00:04:11.370> hour<00:04:11.549> movie<00:04:11.760> remember<00:04:12.660> what<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.900> Avenger

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
two hour movie remember what the Avenger

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.720 
two hour movie remember what the Avenger
is<00:04:13.290> like<00:04:13.560> if<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:13.709> broke<00:04:14.010> all<00:04:14.250> of<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.489> Avengers

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
is like if you broke all of the Avengers

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.159 
is like if you broke all of the Avengers
up<00:04:14.970> they're<00:04:15.120> like<00:04:15.269> we're<00:04:15.450> all<00:04:15.569> five<00:04:15.840> minutes

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
up they're like we're all five minutes

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.289 
up they're like we're all five minutes
of<00:04:16.289> screen<00:04:16.530> time<00:04:16.560> if<00:04:17.099> we<00:04:17.280> if<00:04:17.430> that's<00:04:18.030> how<00:04:18.180> they

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
of screen time if we if that's how they

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.240 
of screen time if we if that's how they
broke<00:04:18.510> it<00:04:18.690> up<00:04:18.780> like<00:04:19.019> here's<00:04:19.320> Hawk<00:04:19.650> I've<00:04:19.859> seen

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
broke it up like here's Hawk I've seen

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.740 
broke it up like here's Hawk I've seen
but<00:04:20.789> it<00:04:20.880> didn't<00:04:21.060> really<00:04:21.150> work<00:04:21.269> that<00:04:21.599> way

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
but it didn't really work that way

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.540
