00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:07.140
 as usual you need to be if the voice 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.980
 breathe a breath I find a mutual voice 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.230
 of the deep 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.910
 Hi everyone guys and welcome this 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.790
 we are the ones who write here as 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.609
 cimatti from today we are here for this 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.990
 mini video to explain a little something 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.180
 will happen in the summer let's say then need 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.939
 a little less active in these days 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.830
 we kind of pre registered a casino of 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.830
 video so we are in quotes 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.950
 almost all summer scheduled almost 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.079
 because they office is safe and will grow 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.660
 at least call for a week for this 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.820
 it's almost all summer session 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.370
 therefore they serve much less active and for i 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.489
 so let us say there is no reason 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.399
 don't comment on it 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.660
 for example in the future and do this 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.550
 because these are pre-recorded videos 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.030
 yes because we have registered now 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.949
 to get won or next month type 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.199
 to make you understand then if you tell us 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.210
 kind of doing something in the comments us 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.860
 we will do it after the summer when me 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.110
 I'll come back from vacation 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.570
 another thing guys don't complain 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.090
 maybe for the length of the videos we 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.880
 as explained jane and the precedents that 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.200
 no one shits we record too 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.479
 four hours of video 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.090
 but in the end with all the cuts comes 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.700
 then out 45 minutes maximum then 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.470
 for us take a 10 minute video then 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.659
 to register the 6 then the case of 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.250
 stress and in short, let's say that too 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.540
 we have a life behind that not 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.640
 we can always be attached to 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.750
 avoid recording fingers register 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.270
 so leaders 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.340
 put yourself in our shoes too 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.189
 if you say yes, oh well, cut stronger winds 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.860
 but here the video can become the 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.659
 boring so think 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.000
 just think about what's behind the job 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.100
 that's all, however, of what not 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.939
 complain even if not for hours 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.670
 see video of the new crime report 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.600
 pay part hard and you will see it type a 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.610
 September 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.380
 here is why is not I do not know if we 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.209
 we are registered as we do 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.819
 register here this is a question that 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.860
 very often you do then how we do it 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.270
 to record first thing 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.940
 many wonder how to register 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.069
 only ps4 on ps 4 guys for 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.350
 register you need at least one 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.209
 acquisition card with a disbursement 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.640
 game capture at a minimum have a 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.440
 computer from there you will have to follow some 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.350
 tutorial because I have never today not 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.300
 I never used these tools then on 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.590
 this will not be able to answer however 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.489
 how to record from the computer and from 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.959
 computer 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.870
 but if you live download some programs 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.300
 as abs or seemed of the same 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.640
 software software not software 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.920
 or action after that where 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.620
 surely you can find some 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.290
 tutorial how you are staying there at best like 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.380
 to feel good the quality is everything and then 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.990
 after 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.710
 after recording you will have this file 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.510
 god that should go to assemble me 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.220
 I recommend if you read segments for whom 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.290
 I know it will be or for those in the first place 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.550
 weapons could stand even study span 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.920
 then dani but you have to see you say 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:16.100
 always ask for so much duty of well 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.760
 randy I said half- dark because you do n't do it 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.300
 feel 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:24.050
 so let's say he does a lot of passing 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.090
 less computer time so I always have 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.980
 something to do lately has been in 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.930
 vacation a week and just in 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.760
 that week where we didn't record 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.710
 for you to have videos for all 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.020
 therefore there was no summer 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.550
 which throughout the summer may be that 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:42.160
 you won't hear it in videos unless 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.890
 boh unless he makes a video he 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.660
 we say that if we have reached 10,000 e 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.590
 I do n't know this video when it came out for 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.410
 boys 10 thousand to 10 thousand titles 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.590
 audience before 10,000 to 10,000 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.580
 bank of jane missing 108 members 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.590
 entered entries 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.700
 missing 108 subscribers from now I'm 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.390
 controlled by when we are recording 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.710
 now then once you've just been on 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.630
 10,000 mark we will publish the video 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.700
 then special special video log 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.920
 keep an eye on the number of subscribers 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.140
 as soon as we reach 10,000 , the 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.780
 special video 10,000 subscribers of 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.150
 ours you will see our our faces 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.010
 fruits unfortunately we do too 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.810
 you see ireniche made crazy minds that 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:30.970
 but it's nothing I would say we're affixed 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.190
 we will see the best breads moments vi 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.110
 complain that there are very few 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.970
 because to achieve with the but not 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.600
 certainly difficult especially in one 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.090
 week 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.610
 organizes that is to program an inter is 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.110
 it was really difficult 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.560
 the actress is everything from spots to everything and 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:50.370
 now indeed indeed a good summer match e 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.370
