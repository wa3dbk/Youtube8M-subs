00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:09.880
 hi friends youtube 6 here is a lot 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:13.180
 with many of you like having the ball 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:17.780
 legally bright the first thing is 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.760
 catch this focus in each 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.400
 because this little one that has eyes 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.250
 compounds there are other type pokemones 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.580
 bug that has stability 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.990
 compounds that the wild pokemon that 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.329
 you are going to capture have the possibilities 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.039
 that has elite in that you want 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.070
 good the one that you want being me 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:40.920
 I mean the one that is already determined to 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.240
 that appears to you as bulky or 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.080
 crooked spoon in case there will be 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:52.060
 very well then of that after having 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.060
 captured let's go to the city karl water 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.250
 here I edited it because I forgot a 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.990
 unnecessary kit to enter the 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.950
 safari area 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.950
 this girl does not 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.580
 what is that 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.130
 is to be able to give more possibilities of 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.860
 that the wild pokemon appears to you more 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.080
 easily and leaving safari very well 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.520
 after having obtained it 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.520
 we are just going to the safari area 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.869
 and we count 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.190
 four feet just in case in case 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.520
 look a bit like a strong 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.500
 and here commented narra 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.780
 a little one on the cross 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:48.320
 I want to really care about the truth 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:51.430
 but it's better that way we finish 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.890
 will not escape, let's focus that the 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.890
 good interesting was not a critic 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.000
 and again 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.799
 good a dead 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.799
 if we are to flee if we advance 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.239
 and we leave our own in the pc 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.230
 it is necessary that in each this the 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.319
 start of your team 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.620
 I said you put yourself to be able to 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:29.620
 Find more easily flights by almost 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:34.180
 if I see that he has made him catch he has 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.819
 oil I'm no longer going to a government over 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.450
 others sea and ready very well in this 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.250
 area appears picacho 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.550
 have a job that obviously mones 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.270
 because that outside us 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.420
 I do not care, we can live without 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.420
 problems 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.830
 they travel to another another pokÃ©mon that 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.260
 I care a lot we do not want 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.930
 these parts are necessary 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.610
 made this this video edit it is 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.310
 because they keep supporting me because he dies 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.020
 without necessary for the video 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.930
 but still trying because the 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.950
 cat appears here as you just saw 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.950
 in the room because ball 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.510
 in the rags 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.400
 to show you this car more 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.450
 easily use pokemones with 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.450
 static electricity 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.110
 and as you just watched the video go back to 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.150
 luminous also because in the first one it is 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.980
 I was lucky because it can not be that 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.560
 appear the first 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.060
 it can also be expressed to the second 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.180
 the third or fourth 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.690
 the thing that with this compound eye you're going to 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.690
 do it faster 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:58.019
 thanks for watching the video we'll see you in 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.019
 another finger up opportunity
