00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 I'd like to buy an alliance chopper but 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.450
 here is no money at all what do we go to 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.450
 twinka dot ru 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.330
 choose gold and buy link in 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.500
 description 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.470
 hello gangsters panda with you 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.720
 want to decorate your garrison with such 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.330
 beautiful guild and banners not 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.550
 problem but no problem if you know 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.199
 where to buy them they are bought there 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.630
 where all the guild things where 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.310
 Guild's page is bought from the horde 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.710
 done in gremory is very easy with the alliance 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.910
 this is done in the storm city at night still 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.559
 many places where you can buy them 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.420
 so here you need this 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.989
 the banners garrison stand they 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.140
 penny 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.730
 that they have your guild available 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.860
 need to 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.840
 achievement of achievement the essence of which is 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.000
 that in the guild group you 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.489
 must pass all three norske a 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.840
 dungeons in principle from not very difficult 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.250
 our guild for example from achivka 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.620
 it turned out even if it is not four 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.350
 even three people you have enough three there 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.210
 you need everything from the guild very quickly 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.299
 does these 8 sheets cover the weights 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.020
 Well, not a problem but what arose 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.750
 I have a problem 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.850
 buy bought achivku we have done but where 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.640
 click to put these banners 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.720
 immediately after purchase, they are not put network 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.280
 there are such things you can 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.360
 monuments put but it is necessary achivki 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.560
 for now there is no such possibility 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.750
 I just also paid attention today 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.790
 but we can interestingly enough 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.110
 what can be done so here at the alliance is 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.630
 done here stands here such 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.280
 the guy is not talkative and as you can see there 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.290
 even in the text a little bit more of a problem 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.329
 he has apparently not completed the title yet 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.220
 flags made in english but here we are 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.659
 click on it and the banners are removed or 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.030
 push again and guild replacements 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.340
 just appeared meniscus questioned from 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.450
 I didn't find the topic myself either 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.090
 this because it will be useful to do 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.799
 video so that you can find where all the same 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.329
 put these banners players put 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.180
 they look good to me personally very much 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.040
 who likes this funny option 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.540
 slightly decorate your garrison of course 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.280
 bare polemous with poles would be 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.020
 more interesting but at least guild 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.020
 banners are not bad such cases
