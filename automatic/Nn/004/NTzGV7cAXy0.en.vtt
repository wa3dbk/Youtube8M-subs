I<00:00:08.790> just<00:00:09.540> got<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.429> UPS<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.880> fun<00:00:12.090> interruptible

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
I just got a UPS and fun interruptible

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.509 
I just got a UPS and fun interruptible
power<00:00:12.900> supply<00:00:13.290> so<00:00:13.500> it's<00:00:13.620> basically<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.070> battery

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
power supply so it's basically a battery

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.930 
power supply so it's basically a battery
that<00:00:14.790> plugs<00:00:15.000> into<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:16.670> allegedly<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.789> can

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
that plugs into it and allegedly you can

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.160 
that plugs into it and allegedly you can
hook<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.690> USB<00:00:19.140> cable<00:00:19.380> from<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.359> battery<00:00:21.359> right

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
hook a USB cable from the battery right

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.650 
hook a USB cable from the battery right
into<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.680> back<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.130> nas<00:00:23.310> which<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.760> one<00:00:24.570> of

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
into the back of the nas which is one of

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.390 
into the back of the nas which is one of
the<00:00:24.720> reasons<00:00:25.050> having<00:00:25.380> extra<00:00:25.619> USB<00:00:25.769> ports<00:00:26.279> is

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
the reasons having extra USB ports is

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.210 
the reasons having extra USB ports is
really<00:00:26.730> handy<00:00:27.359> on<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.660> particular<00:00:28.109> unit<00:00:28.410> so

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
really handy on this particular unit so

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.790 
really handy on this particular unit so
I'm<00:00:29.580> going<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.000> plug<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:30.779> right<00:00:30.810> now<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.470> in

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
I'm going to plug it in right now and in

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.520 
I'm going to plug it in right now and in
theory<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.550> disk<00:00:33.270> station<00:00:33.780> will<00:00:34.020> be<00:00:34.050> able<00:00:34.260> to

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
theory the disk station will be able to

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.139 
theory the disk station will be able to
detect<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.309> has<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.430> battery<00:00:35.670> hooked<00:00:36.000> up

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
detect that it has a battery hooked up

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.360 
detect that it has a battery hooked up
and<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.899> will<00:00:36.989> figure<00:00:37.260> itself<00:00:37.500> out<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:37.890> if<00:00:38.250> it

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
and it will figure itself out so if it

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.340 
and it will figure itself out so if it
detects<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.940> power<00:00:39.090> goes<00:00:39.360> out<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.809> will

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
detects that the power goes out it will

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.770 
detects that the power goes out it will
safely<00:00:40.739> power<00:00:41.250> itself<00:00:41.760> down<00:00:42.059> before<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
safely power itself down before the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.139 
safely power itself down before the
battery<00:00:43.020> runs<00:00:43.290> out<00:00:43.500> that's<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.399> theory<00:00:44.730> so

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
battery runs out that's a theory so

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.290 
battery runs out that's a theory so
let's<00:00:46.050> try<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.460> right<00:00:47.579> now<00:00:47.760> my<00:00:47.969> battery

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
let's try it so right now my battery

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.660 
let's try it so right now my battery
backup<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:48.930> sitting<00:00:49.200> here<00:00:49.559> has<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.219> USB

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
backup I have sitting here has a USB

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.029 
backup I have sitting here has a USB
cable<00:00:51.030> plugged<00:00:51.660> into<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.559> we'll<00:00:52.710> plug<00:00:52.890> this

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
cable plugged into it so we'll plug this

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:06.070 
cable plugged into it so we'll plug this
right<00:00:53.100> into<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.430> back<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.180> disk<00:00:54.360> station

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.500 

alright<00:01:07.080> I've<00:01:07.350> plugged<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.070> now<00:01:08.939> let's<00:01:09.299> go

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
alright I've plugged it in now let's go

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.609 
alright I've plugged it in now let's go
see<00:01:09.869> if<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.200> actually<00:01:10.530> figures<00:01:11.520> anything<00:01:11.700> out

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
see if it actually figures anything out

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.950 
see if it actually figures anything out
okay<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.650> don't<00:01:13.860> see<00:01:14.070> any<00:01:14.390> automatic<00:01:15.390> detection

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
okay I don't see any automatic detection

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.230 
okay I don't see any automatic detection
of<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.680> yet

when<00:01:29.189> system<00:01:29.549> enters<00:01:29.880> safe<00:01:30.150> mode<00:01:32.450> ok<00:01:33.710> apply<00:01:35.780> so

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
when system enters safe mode ok apply so

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.899 
when system enters safe mode ok apply so
before<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.380> was<00:01:37.799> grayed<00:01:38.280> out<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.670> didn't

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
before this was grayed out it didn't

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.030 
before this was grayed out it didn't
know<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.180> there<00:01:39.329> was<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.509> UPS<00:01:39.990> now<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.740> does

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
know that there was a UPS now it does

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.210 
know that there was a UPS now it does
and<00:01:43.850> settings<00:01:44.850> applied<00:01:45.829> device<00:01:46.829> information

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
and settings applied device information

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.950 
and settings applied device information
and<00:01:47.850> there<00:01:48.659> we<00:01:48.780> are

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
and there we are

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.410 
and there we are
it<00:01:49.590> shows<00:01:49.890> our<00:01:50.009> UPS<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.700> shows<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.090> correct

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
it shows our UPS it shows the correct

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.230 
it shows our UPS it shows the correct
model<00:01:51.750> status<00:01:52.409> connected<00:01:53.100> ah<00:01:53.280> we<00:01:54.000> have<00:01:54.119> an

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
model status connected ah we have an

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.240 
model status connected ah we have an
event<00:01:54.450> up<00:01:54.689> here<00:01:55.790> estimated<00:01:56.790> battery<00:01:57.299> life<00:01:58.250> so

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
event up here estimated battery life so

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.499 
event up here estimated battery life so
we<00:01:59.430> have<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.610> lot<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.850> juice<00:02:00.229> ok<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.969> think<00:02:02.969> that's

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
we have a lot of juice ok I think that's

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.980 
we have a lot of juice ok I think that's
working

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.020 

so<00:02:07.799> now<00:02:07.890> we'll<00:02:08.069> conduct<00:02:08.220> an<00:02:08.429> experiment<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
so now we'll conduct an experiment the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.910 
so now we'll conduct an experiment the
battery<00:02:09.330> should<00:02:09.360> be<00:02:09.630> pretty<00:02:09.780> charged<00:02:10.200> let's

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
battery should be pretty charged let's

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.240 
battery should be pretty charged let's
unplug<00:02:11.490> it<00:02:11.700> from<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.880> wall<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.390> see<00:02:13.230> what<00:02:14.130> it
