these<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.780> couple<00:00:13.049> different<00:00:13.139> stages<00:00:13.709> this

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
these in a couple different stages this

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.070 
these in a couple different stages this
is<00:00:14.669> one<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.940> very<00:00:15.059> first<00:00:15.419> ones<00:00:15.660> we<00:00:15.809> wanted

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
is one of the very first ones we wanted

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.570 
is one of the very first ones we wanted
to<00:00:16.139> kind<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.350> see<00:00:16.560> what<00:00:16.800> type<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.070> power<00:00:17.310> we

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
to kind of see what type of power we

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.710 
to kind of see what type of power we
could<00:00:17.700> actually<00:00:17.880> produce<00:00:18.180> out<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.539> this

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:30.359 
make it made more power than what we

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:31.550 
make it made more power than what we
