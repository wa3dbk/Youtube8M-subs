00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:04.370
 and can be financed and also within 36 months r 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.200
 the commentator here the digital version always discounted 15% 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.429
 he had this machine here 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.019
 respect the technical characteristics towers network 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:18.579
 5 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:21.579
 since its fall from a bridge in the network 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:25.679
 What I needed to appear 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:30.159
 is a four-core processor working costs with corruption 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:31.960
 quattor 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.520
 real to summarize this law is so that in four years only two real and two 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.400
 thousand weapons that is that I do not know that he has four fines imposed from the goal 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.530
 dr 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.289
 I have a similar function that has 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:50.739
 has two shaved heads I know if you think how 444 abc works with four 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.449
 his luck 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:53.639
 as the engineer 

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:55.140
 few are missing 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.230
 in his pocket has a real frequency in that case that two points 26 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.960
 only in the past 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.200
 I could not go forward with the scoreboard open to head he will react 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.200
 concluded 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.350
 but it is not possible to forget that whoever wins this test the processor 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.000
 Who will marry them? 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.920
 it will not cause cancer 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.940
 problems 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.330
 you will not regular are not very clear does this hurt people 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.020
 they do not have to put 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.689
 when returning from a lower frequency 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.799
 brought to the technical knowledge and end up damaging a processor 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.920
 It's a real death robbery in this case of parents taking 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.980
 all alone and to programming in prague processors 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.180
 that is 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.820
 not necessarily what you need to do 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.880
 the fans got their way when proposing a program that he received 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.290
 so what happened in a hurry was working it's a 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.630
 a very 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.610
 the encounter that counted on six it is a bit work successfully 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.929
 It's time to talk September 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:02.930
 the person concerned is only 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.880
 reminisce of the past, being a candidate literally a victory suffered there 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.079
 iara commented thus while the other 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:12.959
 a point in time 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.959
 so if you're out of control 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:20.599
 What happened this week is very powerful, we do not 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.649
 to ruin everything they have 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:26.599
 she did it because she prepares the internet and always made herself announce 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.249
 minimize / eliminate thousand 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:34.529
 mizael is held in defense the house staff had 3 million births open 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:39.450
 to harmonize production in times of crisis is that it exists 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.099
 has grown so much that this needs a lot of merchandise 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.929
 so that today the marks most common three of them died 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:52.739
 with all of them to this day, but the 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.919
 samae 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:57.919
 who said this on the internet by the dedication 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:04.549
 You do not have to buy five items without a great team from CearÃ¡. 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.189
 talk can be a core 2 duo 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:08.150
 corridors of 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.189
 action 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:09.900
 waiter 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.759
 I would be happy to test around 245 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:17.030
 complete the notes 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.990
 and sbt
