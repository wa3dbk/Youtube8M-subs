the idea behind this project was we

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.110 
the idea behind this project was we
wanted<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:04.980> try<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:05.279> find<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.520> way<00:00:05.549> of<00:00:05.819> bringing

preparing the body for everyday life

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.959 
preparing the body for everyday life
activities<00:00:13.280> we've<00:00:14.280> got<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.519> potential<00:00:14.790> to

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
activities we've got the potential to

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.150 
activities we've got the potential to
move<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.450> three<00:00:15.780> different<00:00:15.960> directions<00:00:16.470> so

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
move in three different directions so

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.250 
move in three different directions so
sideways<00:00:17.699> forward<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.240> back<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.660> twisting

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
sideways forward and back and twisting

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.050 
sideways forward and back and twisting
so<00:00:19.859> our<00:00:19.980> freestyle<00:00:20.369> areas<00:00:20.730> that<00:00:20.850> try<00:00:21.029> to

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
so our freestyle areas that try to

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.730 
so our freestyle areas that try to
encourage<00:00:21.390> our<00:00:21.660> members<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.470> store

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
encourage our members to that store

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.040 
encourage our members to that store
vectors<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.850> idea<00:00:24.269> was<00:00:24.449> really<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.779> sort

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
vectors and the idea was really to sort

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.349 
vectors and the idea was really to sort
of<00:00:25.170> do<00:00:25.320> something<00:00:25.350> with<00:00:25.800> Damian<00:00:26.250> who<00:00:26.430> were<00:00:27.269> all

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
of do something with Damian who were all

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.050 
of do something with Damian who were all
massive<00:00:27.840> fans<00:00:28.140> or<00:00:28.410> nothing<00:00:28.760> who's<00:00:29.760> kind<00:00:29.970> of

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
massive fans or nothing who's kind of

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.910 
massive fans or nothing who's kind of
known<00:00:30.330> for<00:00:30.359> doing<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.019> kind<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.410> incredible

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
known for doing this kind of incredible

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.000 
known for doing this kind of incredible
acrobatic<00:00:32.759> stuff<00:00:33.260> and<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.440> just<00:00:34.620> seemed<00:00:34.980> like

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
acrobatic stuff and it just seemed like

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.799 
acrobatic stuff and it just seemed like
it<00:00:35.160> might<00:00:35.340> be<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> really<00:00:35.790> nice<00:00:35.969> fit<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.600> bring

it might be a really nice fit to bring
him<00:00:37.110> into<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.620> environment<00:00:38.010> with<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.820> new

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
freestyle equipment they've got in I

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
freestyle equipment they've got in I
thought<00:00:40.530> it'd<00:00:40.620> be<00:00:40.680> nice<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.040> me<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.280> actually

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
thought it'd be nice to me to actually

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.100 
thought it'd be nice to me to actually
try<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.700> see<00:00:42.300> what<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.450> can<00:00:42.629> come<00:00:42.719> up<00:00:42.780> with<00:00:42.960> and

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
try and see what I can come up with and

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.830 
try and see what I can come up with and
what<00:00:43.230> creative<00:00:43.710> movements<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.160> can<00:00:44.340> get<00:00:44.520> I

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
what creative movements I can get I

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.420 
what creative movements I can get I
think<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.079> important<00:00:46.440> thing<00:00:46.469> for<00:00:46.620> us<00:00:46.890> was<00:00:47.190> to

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
think the important thing for us was to

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.880 
think the important thing for us was to
try<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.760> capture<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.989> reactions<00:00:49.530> from<00:00:49.739> other

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
try and capture the reactions from other

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.920 
try and capture the reactions from other
people<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.520> gym<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:50.910> as<00:00:51.120> genuine<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.629> way<00:00:51.750> as

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
people in the gym in as genuine a way as

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.049 
people in the gym in as genuine a way as
possible<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:52.949> do<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.250> we<00:00:53.550> kind<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.879> gone

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
possible so to do that we kind of gone

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.959 
possible so to do that we kind of gone
to<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.570> lot<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.020> trouble<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.590> insert<00:00:56.520> cameras

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
to a lot of trouble to insert cameras

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.299 
to a lot of trouble to insert cameras
into<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.329> space<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:58.379> hopefully<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
into the space that hopefully the

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.979 
into the space that hopefully the
regular<00:00:59.640> gym<00:00:59.850> users<00:01:00.210> aren't<00:01:00.449> necessarily

regular gym users aren't necessarily

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.869 
regular gym users aren't necessarily
going<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.320> spot<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:01.980> soon<00:01:02.250> as<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.520> start

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
going to spot as soon as you start

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.039 
going to spot as soon as you start
bringing<00:01:03.149> out<00:01:03.510> cameras<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:05.790> view<00:01:06.210> people

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
bringing out cameras in in view people

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.410 
bringing out cameras in in view people
will<00:01:07.200> start<00:01:07.409> acting<00:01:07.860> differently<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.820> what<00:01:09.330> we

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
will start acting differently so what we

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.170 
will start acting differently so what we
want<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.140> immediate<00:01:10.979> natural<00:01:11.670> reaction

movement pattern he can twist rotate and

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.010 
movement pattern he can twist rotate and
before<00:01:23.100> back<00:01:23.369> jump<00:01:23.729> high<00:01:23.939> print<00:01:24.720> across<00:01:24.900> the

eight years old now so I mean we've both
star<00:02:07.140> gymnastics<00:02:07.350> together<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.099> we're<00:02:08.489> in

star gymnastics together and we're in
the<00:02:08.729> gym<00:02:08.910> nearly<00:02:09.420> all<00:02:09.539> day<00:02:09.569> every<00:02:09.929> day<00:02:09.959> we're

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
the gym nearly all day every day we're

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.730 
the gym nearly all day every day we're
always<00:02:10.649> together<00:02:10.950> in<00:02:11.310> all<00:02:11.459> ways

always together in all ways
so<00:02:12.310> instead<00:02:13.000> of<00:02:13.060> just<00:02:13.360> me<00:02:13.480> being<00:02:13.660> on<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.810> piece

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
so instead of just me being on a piece

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.930 
so instead of just me being on a piece
of<00:02:14.020> equipment<00:02:14.170> there's<00:02:14.770> more<00:02:14.980> variety<00:02:15.490> that

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
of equipment there's more variety that

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.390 
of equipment there's more variety that
we<00:02:16.030> can<00:02:16.180> do<00:02:16.770> we<00:02:17.770> can<00:02:17.920> both<00:02:18.070> caught<00:02:18.280> with

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
we can do we can both caught with

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.190 
we can do we can both caught with
different<00:02:18.670> ideas<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.150> different<00:02:19.360> ways<00:02:19.990> of

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
different ideas and different ways of

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.330 
different ideas and different ways of

cameras that we've rigged we've got
three<00:02:28.630> of<00:02:28.750> these<00:02:28.930> dotted<00:02:29.500> about<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.860> space

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
three of these dotted about the space

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.570 
three of these dotted about the space
and<00:02:30.760> we've<00:02:30.970> also<00:02:31.120> got<00:02:31.450> three<00:02:32.100> smaller<00:02:33.100> fixed

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
and we've also got three smaller fixed

and we've also got three smaller fixed
cameras<00:02:34.060> we've<00:02:34.540> mapped<00:02:34.840> it<00:02:35.080> out<00:02:35.200> so<00:02:35.500> that<00:02:35.530> we

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
cameras we've mapped it out so that we

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.980 
cameras we've mapped it out so that we

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
he moves in this space and also

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.720 
he moves in this space and also
