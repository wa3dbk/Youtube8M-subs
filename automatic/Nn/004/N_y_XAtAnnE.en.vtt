00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.270 
look nice on your cake and it'll
probably<00:03:00.360> break<00:03:00.900> apart<00:03:01.319> when<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:01.650> try<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:01.950> put

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
probably break apart when you try to put

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:12.050 
probably break apart when you try to put
it<00:03:02.400> on<00:03:09.769> so<00:03:10.769> now<00:03:10.950> what<00:03:11.130> we're<00:03:11.280> going<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:11.489> do<00:03:11.790> is

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
it on so now what we're going to do is

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.940 
it on so now what we're going to do is
actually<00:03:12.299> slowly<00:03:12.959> start<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.440> roll<00:03:13.769> the

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
actually slowly start to roll the

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.490 
actually slowly start to roll the
fondant<00:03:14.430> onto<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:15.000> rolling<00:03:15.180> pin<00:03:15.540> as<00:03:15.810> I'm

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
fondant onto the rolling pin as I'm

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.020 
fondant onto the rolling pin as I'm
doing<00:03:16.830> right<00:03:17.459> now<00:03:17.519> and<00:03:19.459> lifting<00:03:20.459> it<00:03:20.610> slowly

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
doing right now and lifting it slowly

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.270 
doing right now and lifting it slowly
off<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.690> counter<00:03:22.019> top<00:03:22.230> so<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:22.590> doesn't<00:03:23.040> rip

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
off the counter top so it doesn't rip

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.500 
off the counter top so it doesn't rip
and<00:03:24.890> this<00:03:25.890> might<00:03:26.130> be<00:03:26.250> sort<00:03:26.700> of<00:03:26.850> difficult<00:03:27.090> if

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
and this might be sort of difficult if

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.410 
and this might be sort of difficult if
you're<00:03:27.690> not<00:03:27.810> used<00:03:28.170> to<00:03:28.319> it<00:03:28.910> slide<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.209> cake
