we're<00:00:44.040> gonna<00:00:44.100> build<00:00:44.400> off<00:00:44.640> this

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.340 

using<00:00:52.960> those<00:00:53.109> four<00:00:53.469> voicings

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:50.359 

you

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:58.859 

in<00:01:51.369> this<00:01:51.640> example<00:01:52.090> I<00:01:52.390> began<00:01:57.390> by<00:01:58.390> playing

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
in this example I began by playing

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.560 
in this example I began by playing
around

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.130 

that<00:02:02.570> a<00:02:02.930> mixolydian<00:02:04.870> there<00:02:05.870> are<00:02:05.960> some

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
that a mixolydian there are some

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.980 
that a mixolydian there are some
chromaticism

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.840 

Morcom<00:02:13.890> Attis<00:02:14.130> ism<00:02:14.430> here<00:02:16.400> then<00:02:17.400> i<00:02:17.490> go<00:02:17.640> right

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
Morcom Attis ism here then i go right

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:26.170 
Morcom Attis ism here then i go right
back<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.330> scale

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:50.420 

so<00:02:27.140> just<00:02:27.349> a<00:02:27.439> rolling<00:02:27.709> like<00:02:28.040> at<00:02:28.159> the<00:02:28.280> end<00:02:28.340> there

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:59.369 

all<00:02:51.430> right<00:02:51.550> I<00:02:51.610> begin<00:02:52.000> this<00:02:52.180> one<00:02:57.959> I'm<00:02:58.959> just<00:02:59.200> kind

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:06.220 
all right I begin this one I'm just kind
of<00:02:59.470> mixing<00:03:03.150> so<00:03:04.150> this<00:03:04.300> is<00:03:04.450> sort<00:03:04.690> of<00:03:04.810> a

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
of mixing so this is sort of a

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.330 
of mixing so this is sort of a
a<00:03:07.239> G<00:03:08.239> major<00:03:08.480> 7<00:03:08.780> arpeggio

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:19.780 

and<00:03:12.910> then<00:03:13.180> I<00:03:13.270> go<00:03:13.480> into<00:03:13.780> that<00:03:14.080> kind<00:03:14.260> of<00:03:14.349> thing

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:27.099 

and<00:03:20.790> then<00:03:21.150> I<00:03:21.240> kind<00:03:21.480> of<00:03:21.569> work<00:03:21.840> six<00:03:22.290> into<00:03:22.950> it

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:33.430 

back<00:03:28.109> into<00:03:28.409> sir

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.420 

another<00:03:34.440> part<00:03:34.710> of<00:03:34.770> that<00:03:34.830> lick<00:03:35.130> was<00:03:35.340> this

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
another part of that lick was this

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:44.270 
another part of that lick was this
little

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.040 

so<00:03:45.280> this<00:03:45.460> is<00:03:45.550> a<00:03:45.610> fun<00:03:45.820> thing<00:03:46.000> I<00:03:46.030> call<00:03:46.480> it<00:03:46.600> a<00:03:46.630> pivot

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
so this is a fun thing I call it a pivot

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.860 
so this is a fun thing I call it a pivot
point<00:03:47.080> I'm<00:03:47.530> pivoting<00:03:47.800> off<00:03:48.280> of<00:03:48.460> this

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.110 

and<00:03:51.440> just<00:03:52.160> playing<00:03:52.370> different<00:03:52.730> notes<00:03:52.879> on<00:03:53.090> top

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
and just playing different notes on top

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:02.170 
and just playing different notes on top
of<00:03:53.540> it

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.190 

so<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.240> could<00:04:03.450> do<00:04:03.570> that<00:04:03.690> kind<00:04:03.870> of<00:04:03.990> thing

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
so you could do that kind of thing

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:14.630 
so you could do that kind of thing
anywhere

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.580 

it's<00:04:15.480> just<00:04:15.659> a<00:04:15.749> really<00:04:15.959> easy<00:04:16.109> thing<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:16.620> do

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
it's just a really easy thing to do

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:28.200 
it's just a really easy thing to do
here's<00:04:19.590> another<00:04:19.859> one

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.410 

that's<00:04:29.210> kind<00:04:29.480> of<00:04:29.510> a<00:04:29.630> fun<00:04:29.810> one<00:04:29.960> there<00:04:30.170> too
