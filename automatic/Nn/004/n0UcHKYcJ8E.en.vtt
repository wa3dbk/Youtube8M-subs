people who are arguing about whether or
not<00:02:01.100> Twitter's<00:02:01.490> doing<00:02:01.819> the<00:02:01.940> right<00:02:02.119> thing<00:02:02.420> and

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
not Twitter's doing the right thing and

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.590 
not Twitter's doing the right thing and
how<00:02:02.720> they're<00:02:02.960> monetizing<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:04.190> service<00:02:04.610> they

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
how they're monetizing the service they

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.749 
how they're monetizing the service they
just<00:02:05.929> today<00:02:06.289> announced<00:02:06.860> a<00:02:07.009> new<00:02:07.429> approach<00:02:07.700> to

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
just today announced a new approach to

just today announced a new approach to
developers<00:02:08.590> and<00:02:09.590> not<00:02:09.860> many<00:02:10.130> developers<00:02:10.550> were

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
developers and not many developers were

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.850 
developers and not many developers were
happy<00:02:11.000> with<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.300> and<00:02:11.900> so<00:02:12.380> there's<00:02:12.530> a<00:02:12.590> lot<00:02:12.800> of

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
happy with it and so there's a lot of

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.160 
happy with it and so there's a lot of
back<00:02:13.130> and<00:02:13.160> forth<00:02:13.400> and<00:02:13.880> I<00:02:14.570> think<00:02:14.870> everyone

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
back and forth and I think everyone

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.630 
back and forth and I think everyone
though<00:02:15.350> understands<00:02:15.950> that<00:02:16.130> if<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:16.370> want<00:02:16.579> a

the way in terms of permissions the

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.050 
the way in terms of permissions the
question<00:02:52.769> then<00:02:52.950> is<00:02:52.980> can<00:02:53.370> they<00:02:53.489> make<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:53.670> product

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
question then is can they make a product

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.780 
question then is can they make a product
that<00:02:54.450> brings<00:02:55.049> brands<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.769> marketers<00:02:55.950> into

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
that conversation that is Twitter in

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.190 
that conversation that is Twitter in
such<00:02:58.980> a<00:02:59.010> way<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.670> it<00:03:00.150> adds<00:03:00.390> value<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.989> the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
such a way that it adds value to the

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.110 
such a way that it adds value to the
overall<00:03:01.470> ecosystem<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.489> doesn't<00:03:02.879> interrupt

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
and get in the way and I think the

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.650 
and get in the way and I think the
jury's<00:03:05.160> a<00:03:05.190> little<00:03:05.519> bit<00:03:05.670> out<00:03:05.819> but<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.480> fact

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
jury's a little bit out but the fact

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.509 
jury's a little bit out but the fact
that<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.049> ad<00:03:07.200> units<00:03:07.560> for<00:03:07.709> example<00:03:08.099> on<00:03:08.220> Twitter

around<00:04:18.560> this<00:04:18.920> product<00:04:19.370> is<00:04:19.490> pretty

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
around this product is pretty

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.300 
around this product is pretty
extraordinary<00:04:19.970> and<00:04:20.660> I<00:04:20.750> think<00:04:20.990> it's<00:04:21.290> also<00:04:21.560> one

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
extraordinary and I think it's also one

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.810 
extraordinary and I think it's also one
of<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.730> first<00:04:23.260> true<00:04:24.260> scaled<00:04:24.950> computing

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
of the first true scaled computing

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.850 
of the first true scaled computing

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
products that Apple's done were there

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.940 
products that Apple's done were there
the<00:04:28.100> you<00:04:28.370> know<00:04:28.490> on<00:04:29.480> a<00:04:29.540> you<00:04:30.050> know<00:04:30.140> unequivocal

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
the you know on a you know unequivocal

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.400 
the you know on a you know unequivocal
leader<00:04:31.490> they<00:04:31.970> are<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.300> leader<00:04:32.540> they<00:04:33.200> have

eighty-three<00:04:34.010> percent<00:04:34.190> market<00:04:34.820> share<00:04:35.380> you

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
eighty-three percent market share you

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.110 
eighty-three percent market share you
can't<00:04:36.620> imagine<00:04:37.070> a<00:04:37.160> time<00:04:37.340> when<00:04:37.400> the<00:04:37.670> Macintosh

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
can't imagine a time when the Macintosh

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.460 
can't imagine a time when the Macintosh
could<00:04:38.420> ever<00:04:38.540> claim<00:04:38.750> to<00:04:39.020> have<00:04:39.140> eighty-three

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
could ever claim to have eighty-three

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.070 
could ever claim to have eighty-three
percent<00:04:39.590> market<00:04:40.190> share<00:04:40.220> of<00:04:40.370> anything<00:04:40.850> and<00:04:41.780> so

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
percent market share of anything and so

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.800 
percent market share of anything and so
