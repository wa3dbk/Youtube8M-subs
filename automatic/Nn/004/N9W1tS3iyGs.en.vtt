00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
warfare 2 is probably my favorite that's

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.259 
warfare 2 is probably my favorite that's
why<00:03:44.950> I<00:03:44.980> decide<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.280> review<00:03:45.580> it<00:03:45.700> first<00:03:45.910> try<00:03:46.209> to

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
why I decide to review it first try to

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.240 
why I decide to review it first try to
give<00:03:46.480> it<00:03:46.570> a<00:03:46.630> rating<00:03:46.930> for<00:03:47.320> Nintendo<00:03:47.680> DS<00:03:47.709> I

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
give it a rating for Nintendo DS I

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.670 
give it a rating for Nintendo DS I
probably<00:03:49.180> going<00:03:49.840> to<00:03:49.900> give<00:03:50.050> it<00:03:50.170> an<00:03:50.260> 8<00:03:50.470> I

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
probably going to give it an 8 I

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.530 
probably going to give it an 8 I
wouldn't<00:03:51.070> give<00:03:51.190> it<00:03:51.220> a<00:03:51.370> 10<00:03:51.670> because<00:03:52.090> clearly

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
wouldn't give it a 10 because clearly

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.970 
wouldn't give it a 10 because clearly
because<00:03:52.810> it's<00:03:52.959> for<00:03:53.140> them<00:03:53.290> sound<00:03:53.440> yes<00:03:53.709> the

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
because it's for them sound yes the

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.190 
because it's for them sound yes the
graphics<00:03:54.430> suck<00:03:54.790> so<00:03:55.209> I<00:03:55.510> mean<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:55.810> graph<00:03:56.019> is

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
graphics suck so I mean the graph is

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.560 
graphics suck so I mean the graph is
just<00:03:56.470> really<00:03:57.010> really<00:03:57.160> bad<00:03:57.430> I<00:03:57.580> mean<00:03:57.760> they're

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
just really really bad I mean they're

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.080 
just really really bad I mean they're
not<00:03:58.750> completely<00:03:59.140> bad<00:03:59.530> not<00:03:59.920> like<00:04:00.100> UNIX<00:04:00.550> you'd

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
not completely bad not like UNIX you'd

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.640 
not completely bad not like UNIX you'd
expect<00:04:01.450> them<00:04:01.570> to<00:04:01.660> be<00:04:01.810> completely<00:04:02.260> horrible

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
expect them to be completely horrible

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.320 
expect them to be completely horrible
but<00:04:02.980> they're<00:04:03.190> not<00:04:03.310> too<00:04:03.550> bad<00:04:03.700> for<00:04:03.970> me<00:04:04.030> but

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
but they're not too bad for me but

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.090 
but they're not too bad for me but
that's<00:04:04.989> why<00:04:05.170> I'm<00:04:05.260> giving<00:04:05.380> it<00:04:05.590> an<00:04:05.709> 8<00:04:05.860> but<00:04:06.040> the

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
that's why I'm giving it an 8 but the

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.190 
that's why I'm giving it an 8 but the
story<00:04:06.580> and<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:08.100> what<00:04:09.100> do<00:04:09.160> you<00:04:09.220> call<00:04:09.370> it<00:04:09.400> the

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
story and the what do you call it the

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.840 
story and the what do you call it the
the<00:04:11.200> multiplayer<00:04:11.920> is<00:04:12.040> not<00:04:12.190> bad<00:04:12.400> at<00:04:12.610> all<00:04:12.640> that's

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
the multiplayer is not bad at all that's

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.340 
the multiplayer is not bad at all that's
why<00:04:13.060> I<00:04:13.090> really<00:04:13.390> like<00:04:13.690> this<00:04:13.900> and<00:04:14.050> I<00:04:14.140> wouldn't

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
why I really like this and I wouldn't

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.020 
why I really like this and I wouldn't
give<00:04:14.500> it<00:04:14.620> lower<00:04:14.860> than<00:04:15.070> an<00:04:15.220> 8<00:04:15.400> but<00:04:15.610> modern

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
give it lower than an 8 but modern

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.159 
give it lower than an 8 but modern
warfare<00:04:16.209> is<00:04:16.510> definitely<00:04:16.930> one<00:04:17.019> of<00:04:17.049> my

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169
