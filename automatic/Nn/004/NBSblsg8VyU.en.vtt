hello everyone so like I said I'm just
going<00:00:07.440> to<00:00:07.529> have<00:00:07.649> one<00:00:07.950> last<00:00:08.130> side<00:00:08.460> video<00:00:08.700> on

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
going to have one last side video on

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.299 
going to have one last side video on
this<00:00:09.179> and<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:10.500> cover<00:00:10.650> something<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:11.190> I

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
this and to cover something that I

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.919 
this and to cover something that I
didn't<00:00:11.730> actually<00:00:11.820> cover<00:00:12.150> fully<00:00:12.480> in<00:00:12.780> the

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
didn't actually cover fully in the

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.289 
didn't actually cover fully in the
actual<00:00:13.200> walkthrough<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:13.950> that<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.000> three

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
actual walkthrough and that is the three

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.880 
actual walkthrough and that is the three
secret<00:00:15.660> passwords<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.470> can<00:00:16.590> put<00:00:16.740> into

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
secret passwords that you can put into

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.160 
secret passwords that you can put into
this<00:00:17.100> machine<00:00:17.460> up<00:00:17.609> here<00:00:17.820> so<00:00:18.570> one<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:18.840> them<00:00:19.050> I

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
this machine up here so one of them I

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.779 
this machine up here so one of them I
did<00:00:19.350> actually<00:00:19.500> put<00:00:19.830> in<00:00:19.980> during<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.670> actual

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
did actually put in during the actual

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.240 
did actually put in during the actual
walkthrough<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:22.380> was<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.680> code<00:00:22.890> for

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
walkthrough and that was the code for

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.359 
walkthrough and that was the code for
the<00:00:23.609> ultimate<00:00:24.060> sword<00:00:24.420> shield<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.320> Rin<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:26.250> the

the ultimate sword shield and Rin so the

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.810 
the ultimate sword shield and Rin so the
code<00:00:26.550> for<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:27.029> four<00:00:27.330> two<00:00:27.840> zero<00:00:28.140> one<00:00:28.890> six

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
code for that is four two zero one six

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.440 
code for that is four two zero one six
zero<00:00:30.090> zero<00:00:30.570> two<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.850> I'll<00:00:32.850> just<00:00:33.059> show<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.210> the

this<00:00:37.500> increases<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.040> vigilance<00:00:38.520> attack<00:00:38.790> by

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
this increases the vigilance attack by

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.389 
this increases the vigilance attack by
100<00:00:39.719> critical<00:00:40.260> rate<00:00:40.410> by<00:00:40.590> three<00:00:40.890> percent<00:00:41.250> and

sure what that stands for but it

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.439 
sure what that stands for but it
increases<00:00:52.289> defense<00:00:53.010> by<00:00:53.190> 91<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.940> dodge<00:00:54.239> rate

didn't put in before so you'll you guys
will<00:01:16.530> see<00:01:16.710> what<00:01:17.400> happens<00:01:17.729> at<00:01:17.909> cyclic<00:01:18.210> mill

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
will see what happens at cyclic mill

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.820 
will see what happens at cyclic mill
okay<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.619> one<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.920> two<00:01:20.189> zero<00:01:21.229> zero<00:01:22.229> zero

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
okay so this one is two zero zero zero

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.410 
okay so this one is two zero zero zero
zero<00:01:23.549> yes<00:01:24.450> four<00:01:24.720> zero<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.320> then<00:01:26.009> six<00:01:26.420> three

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
zero yes four zero and then six three

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.630 
zero yes four zero and then six three

data for Dutch falcomon alright so I'm
going<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.479> quickly<00:02:09.630> go<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.020> convert<00:02:10.380> them<00:02:10.560> to

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
going to quickly go and convert them to

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.100 
going to quickly go and convert them to
and<00:02:11.039> we'll<00:02:11.400> see<00:02:11.580> what<00:02:11.730> they're<00:02:11.880> like<00:02:12.000> ok<00:02:12.900> here

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
and we'll see what they're like ok here

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.290 
and we'll see what they're like ok here
we<00:02:13.200> go<00:02:13.349> so<00:02:13.590> first<00:02:13.800> up<00:02:14.040> we<00:02:14.160> have<00:02:14.190> dot<00:02:14.550> argument

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.449 

as<00:02:18.300> you<00:02:18.360> get<00:02:18.750> them<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.080> stats<00:02:19.349> are<00:02:19.620> quite<00:02:20.160> low

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
as you get them the stats are quite low

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.870 
as you get them the stats are quite low
and<00:02:21.080> they<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.890> get<00:02:23.040> them<00:02:23.190> straight<00:02:23.520> away<00:02:23.700> at

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
and they you get them straight away at

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.930 
and they you get them straight away at
low<00:02:24.000> 35

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
low 35

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.670 
low 35
got<00:02:26.940> argument<00:02:27.390> is<00:02:27.480> born<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:27.900> then<00:02:28.319> we'll<00:02:28.530> take

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
got argument is born and then we'll take

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:37.490 
got argument is born and then we'll take
a<00:02:28.739> look<00:02:29.010> at<00:02:29.130> dr.<00:02:29.580> falgot<00:02:29.730> mode

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.500 

so<00:02:38.500> again<00:02:38.739> you<00:02:38.890> get<00:02:39.040> him<00:02:39.250> that<00:02:39.400> level<00:02:39.609> 35<00:02:40.120> and

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
so again you get him that level 35 and

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:49.510 
so again you get him that level 35 and
stats<00:02:41.019> are<00:02:41.260> pretty<00:02:41.819> low<00:02:42.819> as<00:02:42.969> well

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.040 

all<00:02:50.520> of<00:02:50.700> us<00:02:50.760> let's<00:02:51.090> go<00:02:51.210> over<00:02:51.390> their<00:02:51.540> techniques

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
all of us let's go over their techniques

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.390 
all of us let's go over their techniques
and<00:02:52.350> then<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:52.650> look<00:02:52.830> at<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.040> digivolution

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
and then I look at the digivolution

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.670 
and then I look at the digivolution
route<00:02:53.850> so<00:02:54.660> of<00:02:54.990> course<00:02:55.170> they're<00:02:55.410> not<00:02:55.530> going<00:02:55.650> to

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
route so of course they're not going to

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.220 
route so of course they're not going to
have<00:02:55.800> great<00:02:56.340> attacks<00:02:56.640> at<00:02:56.820> first<00:02:57.090> this<00:02:58.050> is<00:02:58.110> just

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
have great attacks at first this is just

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.500 
have great attacks at first this is just
the<00:02:58.710> standard<00:02:59.520> tax<00:02:59.940> that's<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.300> normal

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
the standard tax that's a normal

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.080 
the standard tax that's a normal
argument<00:03:00.810> gap<00:03:01.350> anyway

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
argument gap anyway

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.410 
argument gap anyway
it's<00:03:03.090> just<00:03:03.300> dr.<00:03:03.690> Eggman<00:03:04.110> has<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.290> thing<00:03:04.590> as<00:03:05.420> for

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
it's just dr. Eggman has a thing as for

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.410 
it's just dr. Eggman has a thing as for
the<00:03:06.600> digivolution<00:03:06.930> room<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:09.000> actually<00:03:09.240> can't

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
the digivolution room the actually can't

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.660 
the digivolution room the actually can't
did<00:03:09.570> you<00:03:09.660> go<00:03:09.860> so<00:03:10.860> all<00:03:11.160> you've<00:03:11.340> got<00:03:11.460> to<00:03:11.550> do

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
did you go so all you've got to do

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.640 
did you go so all you've got to do
really<00:03:11.880> is<00:03:12.060> keep<00:03:12.270> going<00:03:12.930> backwards<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.410> forth

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
really is keep going backwards and forth

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.880 
really is keep going backwards and forth
between<00:03:13.830> four<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.280> one<00:03:14.550> and<00:03:14.580> got<00:03:15.120> our<00:03:15.300> beam<00:03:15.480> on

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
between four and one and got our beam on

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.980 
between four and one and got our beam on
to<00:03:16.890> get<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.130> attitude<00:03:17.250> er<00:03:17.700> or<00:03:18.420> you<00:03:18.720> can<00:03:18.840> just

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
to get the attitude er or you can just

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.900 
to get the attitude er or you can just
stick<00:03:19.200> them<00:03:19.290> in<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.530> ditch<00:03:19.680> farm<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.310> get<00:03:20.790> his

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
stick them in the ditch farm and get his

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.290 
stick them in the ditch farm and get his
stats<00:03:21.120> up<00:03:21.300> that<00:03:21.510> way<00:03:21.950> but<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:23.220> don't<00:03:23.880> know<00:03:24.090> these

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
stats up that way but I don't know these

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.100 
stats up that way but I don't know these
these<00:03:25.230> didn't<00:03:25.530> aren't<00:03:25.860> really<00:03:26.160> for<00:03:27.050> I'd<00:03:28.050> say

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
these didn't aren't really for I'd say

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.050 
these didn't aren't really for I'd say
using<00:03:28.740> in<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.100> games<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.490> more<00:03:29.640> just<00:03:29.820> for<00:03:30.000> fun

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
using in the games and more just for fun

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.850 
using in the games and more just for fun
I<00:03:30.240> guess<00:03:31.040> so<00:03:32.040> Falcon<00:03:32.550> born<00:03:32.730> again<00:03:33.620> he<00:03:34.620> actually

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
I guess so Falcon born again he actually

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.800 
I guess so Falcon born again he actually
has<00:03:35.010> one<00:03:35.220> good<00:03:35.430> skill<00:03:35.970> which<00:03:36.300> is<00:03:36.330> crimson

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
has one good skill which is crimson

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:44.300 
has one good skill which is crimson
flame<00:03:39.080> and<00:03:40.080> swift<00:03:40.800> retaliation<00:03:43.130> so<00:03:44.130> some

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
flame and swift retaliation so some

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.880 
flame and swift retaliation so some
different<00:03:44.400> attacks<00:03:44.790> there<00:03:44.970> but<00:03:45.890> his

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
different attacks there but his

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.040 
different attacks there but his
digivolution<00:03:47.310> route<00:03:47.760> as<00:03:47.970> well<00:03:48.240> I<00:03:48.420> think<00:03:48.750> he

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
digivolution route as well I think he

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.230 
digivolution route as well I think he
can<00:03:49.260> knock<00:03:49.350> patrols<00:03:49.800> so<00:03:50.730> know<00:03:50.880> if<00:03:50.940> you<00:03:51.060> have<00:03:51.150> to

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
can knock patrols so know if you have to

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.610 
can knock patrols so know if you have to
keep<00:03:51.360> going<00:03:51.510> backwards<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.170> forwards

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
keep going backwards and forwards

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.000 
keep going backwards and forwards
between<00:03:52.709> doc<00:03:53.160> or<00:03:53.430> Falcon<00:03:54.239> when<00:03:54.360> I'm<00:03:54.480> cocomong

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
between doc or Falcon when I'm cocomong

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.229 
between doc or Falcon when I'm cocomong
like<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.100> same<00:03:56.310> for<00:03:56.610> um<00:03:57.860> Doraemon<00:03:58.910> or<00:03:59.910> you<00:04:00.030> go

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
like the same for um Doraemon or you go

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.780 
like the same for um Doraemon or you go
back<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.660> max<00:04:01.470> Falcon<00:04:02.010> 1<00:04:02.130> or<00:04:02.250> something<00:04:02.580> but

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
back to max Falcon 1 or something but

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.100 
back to max Falcon 1 or something but
you<00:04:03.600> can<00:04:03.720> only<00:04:03.810> get<00:04:03.959> dr.<00:04:04.350> Falcon<00:04:04.680> 1<00:04:04.860> from<00:04:05.580> the

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
you can only get dr. Falcon 1 from the

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.229 
you can only get dr. Falcon 1 from the
secret<00:04:07.110> password<00:04:07.260> as<00:04:07.650> well<00:04:07.680> as<00:04:07.920> Doraemon<00:04:08.520> so

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
secret password as well as Doraemon so

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.580 
secret password as well as Doraemon so
anyway<00:04:09.540> that's<00:04:09.690> definitely<00:04:10.110> going<00:04:10.290> to<00:04:10.320> be<00:04:10.440> the

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
anyway that's definitely going to be the

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.290 
anyway that's definitely going to be the
last<00:04:10.709> part<00:04:11.100> of<00:04:11.250> this<00:04:11.400> Digimon<00:04:11.640> well<00:04:12.000> -<00:04:12.120> yes
