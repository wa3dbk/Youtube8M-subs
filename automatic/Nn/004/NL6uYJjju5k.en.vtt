 a show in pure superbike style 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.260

 group and closed four tenths from the

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.660
 proving himself to be already at

 but respectively fifth and sixth while 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.010
 for her there was a slip without 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.050
 consequences 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.460
 they close the top ten with strong but six 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.460
 polita and dinner 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.930
 oh well a very funny race 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.170
 for me it is also difficult at the beginning 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.830
 ready to leave and I pulled hard 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:33.160
 but I failed to leave has me 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:36.019
 resumed not taken up my past gimbel e 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.849
 I knew I had the rhythm to stay with him 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:41.840
 behind 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:46.720
 after past still passed by marra is 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:50.930
 been back there at the end arrived 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:54.880
 now it lowered to both the 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.880
 the last two rounds really was 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.010
 on the last lap he knew he couldn't 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.830
 define why he had done he did 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.280
 a gap is true last part recovery i 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:11.250
 passed in the end really are a lot 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:13.319
 glad you won all the races we'll see 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.480
 during all seasons 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.360
 but I want to thank hardin team 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.980
 pedercini the class that my Argentine 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.709
 family to my speakers at all 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.340
 people who was with me the moment 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.600
 difficult these two victories are for 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.940
 them as thanks a lot 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.280
 I made a not exceptional start 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.310
 so I was pretty far back done a 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.290
 little effort to recover after theirs 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.120
 disadvantage they put a little to play 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.510
 one with the other to be annoyed then 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:47.970
 I'm recited closer and 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:51.060
 calmly at some point if not 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.590
 managed to slip into the group after is 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.110
 It was time to finish a little 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.720
 too much and I managed not to do the 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.010
 disaster I also tried to make a 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.050
 little escape 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.780
 on the last lap but unfortunately in the sprint 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.400
 he thinks anyway let's say he 's gone 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.530
 all more or less was a little more 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.270
 difficult today and yesterday 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.490
 it will be more and more going ha 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.960
 titled the championship then in the 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.090
 thank you all thank you too 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.980
 other pilots because I think it was 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.040
 a beautiful race 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.960
 thank you it was a race 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.340
 maybe a nice fight today too 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:29.670
 more than yesterday, however, unfortunately we suffer from 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.790
 both engine and setup compared to 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.880
 we have them 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.490
 I was so stressed this weekend 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.980
 hard to fix the bike for three years 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.930
 that I didn't set foot in here though 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.230
 from I can I can consider myself 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.370
 satisfied with the result in all of us 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.670
 went to the podium in both races 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:53.250
 so it went well all in all 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:57.460
 unfortunately we suffer from a non engine gap 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:59.260
 not indifferent so we will see a bit of 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.830
 to settle even new in short, that's it 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.830
 that's all
