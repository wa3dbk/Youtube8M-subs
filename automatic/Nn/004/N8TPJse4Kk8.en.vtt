00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.650
 say that this cartoon is long-awaited 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.040
 nothing to say drink wide 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.269
 comes first of its kind Orthodox 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.700
 animated blockbuster first 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.540
 viewers most of which are schoolchildren 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.480
 delighted and say the film is not only 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.779
 spectacular but still has a special deep 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.869
 meaning here shows that first 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.869
 the military seized the churches there they broke but 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.349
 although it was not necessary to do so 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.490
 priests sat down for that simple 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.890
 revealing film comes out on screens 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.870
 the forty-third year of the last century is the height 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.059
 great patriotic war in children 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.770
 home getting the daughter of the repressed 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.680
 the priest with the rare name of the seraph 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.969
 Shelter and do not love because she is the daughter of dad that 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.739
 in those days it was considered almost 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.570
 oath at some point from her 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.489
 even requires renouncing faith 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.039
 just pray a mystery pectoral cross 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.649
 hides under the pillow the most difficult period 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.610
 I is its patron saint 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.710
 Rev. Seraphim of Sarov 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.960
 the girl has to make amazing 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.960
 what travels have the world seen yet 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.390
 happens 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.340
 real wonders on the first open 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.620
 cartoon session is present him 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.480
 the creators say that before the premiere 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.230
 held in Nizhny Novgorod for them 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.180
 is symbolic 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.260
 after all, it was in Nizhny Novgorod that lived 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.420
 reverend old man 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.760
 work on the film they drove and in 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.920
 Diveevo and Sarov for inspiration 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.050
 work on the image of Sarov elder 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.580
 it was difficult because the screen was coming 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.410
 to revive not the common man 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.150
 amazing saint had to 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.100
 use the latest technology 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.310
 film industry pro start we want 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.890
 make it a classic draw but 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.590
 that's the challenge after all 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.960
 each frame is drawn frames if you 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.830
 painted by Joseph Sarovsky it was 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.560
 would be the background and so we chose 3d tech 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:57.420
 when a three-dimensional character is left alone 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.490
 once it turns virtual actor more 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.040
 it was harder to pick an actor who 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.080
 could realistically voice the saint 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.460
 the elder chose the famous actor 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.440
 Alexander Mikhailov 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.019
 The author says the script did not lose 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.780
 your casting was for the role of seraphim 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.510
 Sarovsky and we listened very long 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.480
 took away the voices and 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.769
 the main principle was such a voice 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.510
 which we listened we believed him 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.519
 absolutely also in extraordinary 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.220
 adventure seraphim first applied 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.329
 latest technology surround sound aura 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.489
 and dolby atmos 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.860
 this is when the sound reaches the viewer as if 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.959
 from all over the cinema in fact 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.610
 how the Russian viewer will take the first 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.440
 russian orthodox cartoon become 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.370
 already understood the nearest ki when it comes out 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.560
 on the big screen 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.019
 but at least not one viewer pride 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.060
 premiere this room is not yet 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.189
 left myself want to add that 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.840
 the film will be interesting to people far from 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.849
 Orthodoxy because he is above all 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.459
 talks about such eternal values 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.569
 like love and faith friendship only understandable 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.359
 modern viewer 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:02.420
 spectacular and loud cinema language
