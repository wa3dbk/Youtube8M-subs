competitive and I wanted to get to the
front<00:00:54.080> and<00:00:54.290> I<00:00:55.510> was<00:00:56.510> generally<00:00:57.140> pretty<00:00:57.260> nice<00:00:57.500> to

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
front and I was generally pretty nice to

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.850 
front and I was generally pretty nice to
most<00:00:57.920> people<00:00:58.280> as<00:00:58.369> I<00:00:58.489> went<00:00:58.670> by<00:00:58.790> them<00:00:59.000> and<00:00:59.860> you

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
most people as I went by them and you

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.499 
most people as I went by them and you
know<00:01:00.949> I<00:01:00.979> saw<00:01:01.670> an<00:01:01.790> opportunity<00:01:01.850> there<00:01:02.330> and

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:02.509 
know I saw an opportunity there and

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:05.109 
know I saw an opportunity there and
that's<00:01:02.629> was<00:01:03.259> sort<00:01:03.530> of<00:01:03.589> where<00:01:04.460> my<00:01:04.610> mindset<00:01:04.970> was

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
that's was sort of where my mindset was

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.700 
that's was sort of where my mindset was
as<00:01:05.449> i<00:01:05.509> was<00:01:05.659> taking<00:01:06.020> opportunities<00:01:06.530> when<00:01:06.680> they

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710

when<00:01:07.460> they<00:01:07.580> came<00:01:07.759> and<00:01:08.030> I<00:01:08.350> was<00:01:09.350> pretty<00:01:09.799> sure

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
when they came and I was pretty sure

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.469 
when they came and I was pretty sure
when<00:01:10.189> I<00:01:10.220> came<00:01:10.340> through<00:01:10.580> turn<00:01:10.939> one<00:01:10.970> that<00:01:11.299> I<00:01:11.330> had

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
when I came through turn one that I had

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:12.520 
when I came through turn one that I had
an<00:01:11.600> opportunity<00:01:11.780> there<00:01:12.140> and<00:01:12.409> that

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
an opportunity there and that

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.590 
an opportunity there and that
opportunity<00:01:13.220> went<00:01:13.400> away<00:01:13.490> pretty<00:01:13.579> quickly<00:01:14.030> the

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
opportunity went away pretty quickly the
