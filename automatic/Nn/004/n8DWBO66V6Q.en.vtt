 Forests can be found about 20 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.079
 edible and very rarely say so 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.320
 poisonous 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.059
 but if you are going to take that 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.579
 common this way and nickname 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.680
 here he has such an ordinary 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.110
 yellowish

 only young mushrooms here are snare than here 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.070
 this cobweb because when the mushroom is already 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.259
 grows over here over here bigger 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.850
 cobwebs 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.630
 disappear and only this remains 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.689
 brown ring from them and already and very 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.579
 easily confused with some inedible 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:34.380
 mushroom 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:35.270
 but even a young mushroom is not 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.310
 some 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.090
