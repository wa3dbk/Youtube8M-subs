00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:18.500
 Today we are taking a strawberry punch with us 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.540
 elderberry and basil by the 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.670
 basil will be the punch very 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.310
 refreshing because that's very good 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.279
 tolerates the sweetness of elderberry and 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:32.020
 I think it's the perfect drink 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.020
 for a warm summer 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.399
 the strawberries must be washed in advance and 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.079
 be disappointed 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.149
 you can cut them small I think 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.269
 It's actually nicer if you have smaller ones 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.039
 takes strawberries and then leaves completely 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.129
 then they do not lose so fast 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:57.049
 color and also look over the course of a 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.049
 better in the evening 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.810
 and first 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.900
 about a quarter liter of elderflower syrup 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.320
 the lemons are naturally untreated 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.320
 and washed 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.730
 thick 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.440
 With 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.420
 the special thing is for sure here 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.790
 basil in the table 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.130
 who does not like basilico can be sure too 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.210
 coin that tastes great too me 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.040
 I'm so basilic at the moment 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.280
 I think it's great 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.130
 Variation always with sweet and basil 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.100
 to use 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:26.080
 You can vary the amount of each 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.080
 after how intense that should taste 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.349
 it will still be poured with sky 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.749
 given the sweet by and sugar 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.060
 syrup is sure to be quite good dry 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:54.510
 wine increasing dry white wine that 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.549
 was dry riesling the whole 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.889
 mix with the lemons basil 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:02.420
 strawberries, etc. should now 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:06.709
 pull for at least two hours 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:09.180
 and yes in the reason just before serving 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:24.510
 then comes the prosecco 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:27.150
 ice cold, of course, about half 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.689
 hour before serving the punch 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.269
 want it is quite good to bohlen approach 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.639
 ever to cool down the stand 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.949
 now two hours at room temperature 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:41.099
 and of course no one wants to drink it 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:46.290
 and not all of it now 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:47.849
 It is improved coal with ice cubes 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.620
 very practical you have one again 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.110
 keep it loose 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.180
 around it, where the ice cubes fit 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.680
 then virtually around the whole planks 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.549
 can push the tube and then it works 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.549
 actually very disfigured 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.880
 hole is now pulled through nicely and 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.860
 Ice cold then you can do that with prosecco 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.860
 infuse and serve 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.640
 if the prosecco times in the pole it is 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.610
 actually quite good you are not stirring anymore 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.470
 too much in there because then it will be 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.650
 only yes, the carbonic acid is back 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.650
 Out 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:40.269
 mix very carefully 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.750
 so that the whole thing can stay cold 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.669
 Of course, ice cubes in the 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.009
 punch sound and we have here now 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:13.220
 frozen small rose petals 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:13.220
 that looks totally romantic
