 the attacker who has never refused to isolate himself from sugar that comes back 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:34.829
 it is in the heart of the himalaya 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.790
 it's about populations that exists and that is distributed 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.660
 uniform 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.660
 for fear of group type 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.300
 health coverage mainly provided by chic men on the 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.080
 practitioners 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.290
 of Medicine 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.740
 police medicine 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.970
 who supports 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.680
 among the physical and emotional or spiritual characteristics of patients 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.140
 in recent decades 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.140
 medicine in China has been declining 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.700
 very pronounced 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.630
 % is due in particular to social change community change 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.470
 the preservation of the dissident army shimon attack 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.590
 decisive 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.630
 because it will not serve it would have no health coverage at the level 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.630
 rural areas 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.010
 I've been here for a little over two and a half years 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.830
 to conduct an evaluator mission 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.830
 on various development projects 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.840
 in the project i'm not maso de tence softball revitalize the 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.130
 medical practice attack 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.509
 two years of research in anthropology and honestly 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.500
 pharmacology 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.020
 the project is based on a partnership with local organizations and 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.859
 is structured around three 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:54.090
 First of all, to education with the setting up of a training course 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.750
 diploma 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.510
 in purpose and the the switchboarder and the practice and she gave them a 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.510
 recognition at central government level 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.920
 the second point 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.880
 setting up drug banks but be careful 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.919
 first proposed the working capital 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:14.859
 that is, to allow Shiite men to practice directly but 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:16.009
 August 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:19.559
 at the same time training that allows trails to manage 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:22.839
 pharmaceuticals 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:26.250
 we also organize public education campaigns in the villages 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.250
 in order to inform the villagers about the slopes of medicines 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.729
 difficulties first of all at the project level support people's trust 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.679
 one of the reasons we proceed 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:40.599
 step by step hamel piquant villages 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:41.589
 found 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:44.589
 lasset concrete 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.599
 and then more material difficulties that are accessibility 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.719
 we are here in the highest mountains of the world 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:56.719
 and he signs some of the world's poorest regions 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.689
 I'm involved in this project is certainly 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.529
 for the development of traditional therapies 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:05.939
 but we can also use it as a metaphor to learn 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.399
 other logic to think 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:10.399
 other social logics 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:13.259
 knowing that a character that 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:14.879
 with her 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.879
 some of them 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:23.769
 my ambition is to 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.049
 leave the boat 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.049
 not because I do not feel well on the contrary 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.009
 yes because one day I will be able to leave this one 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:32.879
 people feel that two weeks 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:33.979
 action 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:36.519
 the medicine the site has to survive there 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.519
 because with it endures a health system 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:41.779
 unique and original 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:43.209
 but also a culture
