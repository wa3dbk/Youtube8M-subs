00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.160 
and it's heading towards the premium
market<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:44.000> think<00:00:45.000> if<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.239> if<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.600> if<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.020> look

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
market I think if you if you if you look

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.590 
market I think if you if you if you look
at<00:00:46.320> their<00:00:46.559> then<00:00:47.399> Mojave<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:48.030> has<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> really

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
at their then Mojave it has a really

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.229 
at their then Mojave it has a really
great<00:00:48.780> stance<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.739> other<00:00:49.890> way<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.489> stands<00:00:51.030> on

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
great stance in other way it stands on

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.290 
great stance in other way it stands on
the<00:00:51.420> wheels<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:52.469> has<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:53.550> has<00:00:53.760> quite<00:00:54.239> some

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
the wheels it has a it has quite some

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.810 
the wheels it has a it has quite some
big<00:00:54.600> wheels<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.469> think<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.520> best

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
big wheels and I think that the best

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.930 
big wheels and I think that the best
thing<00:00:57.000> about<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.660> its<00:00:58.559> proportion<00:00:59.280> it's

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
thing about it is its proportion it's

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.729 
thing about it is its proportion it's
even<00:01:00.750> wider<00:01:01.469> but<00:01:02.070> lower<00:01:02.309> than<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.699> bmw<00:01:03.270> x5

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
even wider but lower than a bmw x5

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.429 
even wider but lower than a bmw x5
so<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:05.129> will<00:01:05.489> look<00:01:05.939> very<00:01:06.270> sporty<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.260> road

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
so it will look very sporty on the road

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.740 
so it will look very sporty on the road
it<00:01:07.650> would<00:01:07.770> look<00:01:08.040> very<00:01:08.100> very<00:01:08.369> sporty<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.150> it's

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
it would look very very sporty and it's

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.210 
it would look very very sporty and it's
got<00:01:09.990> very<00:01:10.530> very<00:01:11.299> simple<00:01:12.799> surfaces<00:01:13.799> with<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> lot

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
got very very simple surfaces with a lot

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.570 
got very very simple surfaces with a lot
of<00:01:14.400> tension<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.770> very<00:01:16.770> clear<00:01:17.100> graphic

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
of tension and very clear graphic

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.370 
of tension and very clear graphic
elements<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.420> side<00:01:18.600> window<00:01:18.930> graphic

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
elements like the side window graphic

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.999 
elements like the side window graphic
and<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:20.490> front<00:01:20.700> grille<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.470> it's<00:01:22.860> a

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
and the front grille so it's a it's a

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.570 
and the front grille so it's a it's a
very<00:01:24.560> strong<00:01:25.560> statement<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.220> very<00:01:26.250> bold

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
very strong statement a very bold

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.030 
very strong statement a very bold
statement<00:01:27.390> by<00:01:28.229> its<00:01:28.409> by<00:01:28.740> its<00:01:28.890> architecture<00:01:29.670> and

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
statement by its by its architecture and

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:38.210 
statement by its by its architecture and
it's<00:01:32.869> simple<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:34.020> tension<00:01:34.860> full<00:01:35.040> design<00:01:37.220> so

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
it's simple but tension full design so

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.330 
it's simple but tension full design so
well<00:01:38.759> proportioned<00:01:39.210> good<00:01:40.200> stance<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
well proportioned good stance on the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.969 
well proportioned good stance on the
wheels<00:01:42.350> great<00:01:43.430> exterior<00:01:44.430> with<00:01:44.670> nice<00:01:45.420> and

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
wheels great exterior with nice and

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.609 
wheels great exterior with nice and
clear<00:01:46.979> graphical<00:01:47.909> elements<00:01:48.479> but<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.229> think

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
clear graphical elements but I think

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.030 
clear graphical elements but I think
what<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.460> also<00:01:50.729> very<00:01:50.970> important<00:01:51.720> with<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:52.229> very

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
what is also very important with a very

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.459 
what is also very important with a very
important<00:01:53.790> part<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.740> Mojave<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.570> that<00:01:57.570> it

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
important part of the Mojave is that it

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.859 
important part of the Mojave is that it
has<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.680> great<00:01:59.369> interior<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.270> interior<00:02:00.299> is

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
has a great interior the interior is

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.060 
has a great interior the interior is
really<00:02:01.159> kind<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.369> premium<00:02:03.180> upmarket<00:02:04.070> when

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
really kind of premium upmarket when

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.800 
really kind of premium upmarket when
I've<00:02:05.189> saw<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.670> first<00:02:05.880> time<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.180> set<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.659> it

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
I've saw it the first time I set in it

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.369 
I've saw it the first time I set in it
it<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.560> great<00:02:07.979> it's<00:02:08.250> great<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.610> drive<00:02:08.759> and

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
it it is great it's great to drive and

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.320 
it it is great it's great to drive and
what<00:02:10.379> I<00:02:10.410> like<00:02:10.709> about<00:02:10.920> course<00:02:11.489> all<00:02:11.910> the

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
what I like about course all the

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.570 
what I like about course all the
I've<00:02:12.660> been<00:02:12.870> doing<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:13.320> far<00:02:13.620> if<00:02:14.190> there<00:02:14.460> is<00:02:14.550> a

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
I've been doing so far if there is a

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.460 
I've been doing so far if there is a
harmony<00:02:14.940> between<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.570> exterior<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.410> the

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
harmony between the exterior and the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.850 
harmony between the exterior and the
interior<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.430> think<00:02:17.820> also<00:02:18.440> with<00:02:19.440> him<00:02:19.590> oh<00:02:19.680> is

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
interior and I think also with him oh is

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.890 
interior and I think also with him oh is
this<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.490> case<00:02:20.700> with<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.000> Mojave<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.600> ex<00:02:21.720> and

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
this the case with the Mojave the ex and

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.810 
this the case with the Mojave the ex and
the<00:02:22.050> interior<00:02:22.530> they<00:02:23.070> go<00:02:23.250> nicely<00:02:23.490> together

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
the interior they go nicely together

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.700 
the interior they go nicely together
like<00:02:24.270> yin<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.720> yang<00:02:25.250> with<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:27.690> Mojave<00:02:28.020> we<00:02:28.620> are

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
like yin and yang with the Mojave we are

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.280 
like yin and yang with the Mojave we are
