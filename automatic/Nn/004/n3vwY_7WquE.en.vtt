question come up a lot in the forum and

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.600 
question come up a lot in the forum and
that<00:00:31.660> question<00:00:32.169> is<00:00:32.320> when<00:00:33.040> i<00:00:33.070> have<00:00:33.309> a<00:00:33.340> layer

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
that question is when i have a layer

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.030 
that question is when i have a layer
moving<00:00:34.180> around<00:00:34.360> my<00:00:34.540> composition<00:00:35.170> and<00:00:35.379> i<00:00:35.770> want

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
moving around my composition and i want

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.850 
moving around my composition and i want
to<00:00:36.100> add<00:00:36.309> an<00:00:36.640> echo<00:00:37.030> trail<00:00:37.330> I<00:00:37.570> can't<00:00:38.260> seem<00:00:38.530> to<00:00:38.680> do

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
to add an echo trail I can't seem to do

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.729 
to add an echo trail I can't seem to do
it<00:00:39.010> nothing<00:00:39.460> happens<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.840> if<00:00:41.110> you<00:00:41.320> select<00:00:41.650> your

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
it nothing happens so if you select your

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:48.299 
it nothing happens so if you select your
layer<00:00:41.980> and<00:00:42.190> choose<00:00:42.989> effect<00:00:44.280> time<00:00:45.629> echo<00:00:46.629> as<00:00:47.309> you

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
layer and choose effect time echo as you

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.969 
layer and choose effect time echo as you
can<00:00:48.460> see<00:00:48.729> you<00:00:49.420> don't<00:00:49.720> get<00:00:50.050> an<00:00:50.170> echo<00:00:50.500> although

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:50.979 
can see you don't get an echo although

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:52.860 
can see you don't get an echo although
your<00:00:51.400> layer<00:00:51.580> does<00:00:51.879> seem<00:00:52.120> to<00:00:52.269> brighten<00:00:52.600> up<00:00:52.720> a

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
your layer does seem to brighten up a

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.630 
your layer does seem to brighten up a
bit<00:00:53.080> not<00:00:53.530> quite<00:00:53.800> the<00:00:53.949> effect<00:00:54.040> you<00:00:54.280> were<00:00:54.400> going

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
bit not quite the effect you were going

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.610 
bit not quite the effect you were going
for<00:00:54.699> I<00:00:54.850> gather<00:00:55.150> now<00:00:55.780> I'll<00:00:55.989> get<00:00:56.170> to<00:00:56.260> the<00:00:56.379> answer

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
for I gather now I'll get to the answer

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.530 
for I gather now I'll get to the answer
in<00:00:56.710> a<00:00:56.799> moment<00:00:57.129> but<00:00:57.250> first<00:00:57.640> I<00:00:58.150> think<00:00:58.420> it's

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
in a moment but first I think it's

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.090 
in a moment but first I think it's
really<00:00:58.780> appropriate<00:00:59.049> that<00:00:59.470> this<00:00:59.650> is<00:00:59.830> a<00:00:59.860> lesson

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
really appropriate that this is a lesson

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.189 
really appropriate that this is a lesson
related<00:01:00.610> to<00:01:00.729> time<00:01:00.970> because<00:01:01.720> it<00:01:01.900> gives<00:01:01.989> me<00:01:02.170> the

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
related to time because it gives me the

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:03.750 
related to time because it gives me the
opportunity<00:01:02.530> to<00:01:02.949> take<00:01:03.159> a<00:01:03.190> moment<00:01:03.430> and<00:01:03.670> talk

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
opportunity to take a moment and talk

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.700 
opportunity to take a moment and talk
about<00:01:04.150> time<00:01:04.479> you<00:01:04.989> may<00:01:05.110> have<00:01:05.199> noticed<00:01:05.500> that<00:01:05.560> the

are<00:01:16.630> a<00:01:16.660> few<00:01:16.780> reasons<00:01:16.840> we've<00:01:17.260> expanded<00:01:17.560> the

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
are a few reasons we've expanded the

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.440 
are a few reasons we've expanded the
podcast<00:01:18.220> team<00:01:18.460> to<00:01:18.670> include<00:01:19.000> these<00:01:19.150> fine

podcast team to include these fine

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.810 
podcast team to include these fine
gentlemen<00:01:19.480> first<00:01:20.440> they<00:01:20.890> do<00:01:20.950> great<00:01:21.280> stuff<00:01:21.310> if

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
gentlemen first they do great stuff if

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.670 
gentlemen first they do great stuff if
you've<00:01:22.270> not<00:01:22.420> come<00:01:22.660> to<00:01:22.870> creative<00:01:23.230> cow<00:01:23.410> and

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
you've not come to creative cow and

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.590 
you've not come to creative cow and
watch<00:01:23.920> their<00:01:24.160> tutorials<00:01:24.490> you're<00:01:25.150> missing<00:01:25.480> out

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
watch their tutorials you're missing out

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.970 
watch their tutorials you're missing out
I've<00:01:25.810> learned<00:01:26.080> a<00:01:26.230> lot<00:01:26.260> from<00:01:26.410> watching<00:01:26.680> their

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 
I've learned a lot from watching their

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.290 
I've learned a lot from watching their
stuff<00:01:27.220> and<00:01:27.430> I<00:01:27.550> know<00:01:27.610> that<00:01:27.760> you<00:01:27.910> will<00:01:28.030> too

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
stuff and I know that you will too

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.020 
stuff and I know that you will too
another<00:01:29.200> reason<00:01:29.440> is<00:01:29.710> that<00:01:29.880> watching<00:01:30.880> their

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
another reason is that watching their

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.420 
another reason is that watching their
stuff<00:01:31.300> inspires<00:01:31.750> me<00:01:32.020> in<00:01:32.230> this<00:01:32.560> case<00:01:32.800> I<00:01:33.010> hadn't

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
stuff inspires me in this case I hadn't

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.280 
stuff inspires me in this case I hadn't
thought<00:01:33.580> of<00:01:33.640> doing<00:01:33.910> this<00:01:34.120> tutorial<00:01:34.660> until<00:01:35.260> I

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
thought of doing this tutorial until I

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.130 
thought of doing this tutorial until I
saw<00:01:35.530> Iran<00:01:35.890> so<00:01:36.250> there<00:01:36.490> you<00:01:36.610> go<00:01:36.780> but<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:37.960> other

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
saw Iran so there you go but the other

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.410 
saw Iran so there you go but the other
reason<00:01:38.380> is<00:01:38.680> that<00:01:38.740> well<00:01:39.370> I've<00:01:39.820> been<00:01:39.880> working<00:01:40.330> on

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
reason is that well I've been working on

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.940 
reason is that well I've been working on
a<00:01:40.480> long-term<00:01:40.750> project<00:01:41.200> that's<00:01:41.560> going<00:01:41.650> to<00:01:41.800> take

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
a long-term project that's going to take

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.860 
a long-term project that's going to take
up<00:01:42.130> a<00:01:42.280> lot<00:01:42.460> of<00:01:42.520> my<00:01:42.730> time<00:01:42.760> in<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.330> coming<00:01:43.630> months

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
up a lot of my time in the coming months

up a lot of my time in the coming months
you<00:01:44.020> know<00:01:44.560> what<00:01:44.710> it'll<00:01:45.490> be<00:01:45.580> easier<00:01:45.790> if<00:01:45.820> I<00:01:45.970> show

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
you know what it'll be easier if I show

i'm<00:01:54.520> told<00:01:54.790> they<00:01:54.970> take<00:01:55.210> even<00:01:55.540> more<00:01:55.570> time<00:01:55.780> once

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
i'm told they take even more time once

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.350 
i'm told they take even more time once
they're<00:01:56.530> born<00:01:56.770> so<00:01:57.460> rather<00:01:57.850> than<00:01:58.090> just<00:01:58.270> doing

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
they're born so rather than just doing

you're planning on coming over here and
helping<00:02:11.739> me<00:02:11.800> change<00:02:12.069> diapers<00:02:12.550> I<00:02:12.730> don't<00:02:13.300> want

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
helping me change diapers I don't want

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.809 
helping me change diapers I don't want
to<00:02:13.480> hear<00:02:13.629> any<00:02:13.780> complaints<00:02:14.230> ok<00:02:15.220> back<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.580> the

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
to hear any complaints ok back to the

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.910 
to hear any complaints ok back to the
lesson<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.780> answer<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.200> this<00:02:17.319> question<00:02:17.379> is

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
lesson the answer to this question is

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.589 
lesson the answer to this question is
simple<00:02:18.310> but<00:02:18.730> you<00:02:18.849> have<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.060> understand<00:02:19.450> how

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
simple but you have to understand how

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.360 
simple but you have to understand how
the<00:02:19.659> echo<00:02:19.989> effect<00:02:20.319> works<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:20.829> what<00:02:21.099> it<00:02:21.129> does

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
the echo effect works and what it does

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.789 
the echo effect works and what it does
the<00:02:22.150> echo<00:02:22.420> effect<00:02:22.780> blends<00:02:23.109> frames<00:02:23.530> from

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
the echo effect blends frames from

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.350 
the echo effect blends frames from
different<00:02:24.159> times<00:02:24.400> in<00:02:24.670> your<00:02:24.849> footage

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
different times in your footage

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.300 
different times in your footage
it<00:02:25.480> does<00:02:25.780> not<00:02:25.990> look<00:02:26.350> at<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.770> motion<00:02:27.160> of<00:02:27.220> a

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
it does not look at the motion of a

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.730 
it does not look at the motion of a
layer<00:02:27.490> to<00:02:27.700> create<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:28.180> echo<00:02:28.510> but<00:02:29.050> rather<00:02:29.290> it

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
layer to create the echo but rather it

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.950 
layer to create the echo but rather it
looks<00:02:30.070> on<00:02:30.220> a<00:02:30.250> layer<00:02:30.550> and<00:02:30.730> sees<00:02:31.210> how<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.450> pixels

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
looks on a layer and sees how the pixels

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.080 
looks on a layer and sees how the pixels
have<00:02:32.080> changed<00:02:32.500> from<00:02:32.740> frame<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.040> frame<00:02:33.250> so<00:02:33.970> if

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
have changed from frame to frame so if

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.670 
have changed from frame to frame so if
you<00:02:34.180> animate<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.720> position<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.290> layer<00:02:35.470> that

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
you animate the position of a layer that

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.980 
you animate the position of a layer that
has<00:02:35.740> echo<00:02:36.280> time<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:37.090> only<00:02:37.510> change<00:02:37.750> that

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
has echo time the only change that

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.080 
has echo time the only change that
you'll<00:02:38.140> see<00:02:38.440> is<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.980> echo<00:02:39.010> created<00:02:39.910> by<00:02:40.030> the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
you'll see is the echo created by the

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.570 
you'll see is the echo created by the
pixels<00:02:40.600> changing<00:02:41.110> within<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.770> footage<00:02:42.100> the

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
pixels changing within the footage the

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.820 
pixels changing within the footage the
motion<00:02:43.030> will<00:02:43.150> be<00:02:43.300> ignored<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:44.530> means

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
motion will be ignored and that means

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.100 
motion will be ignored and that means
that<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.400> can<00:02:45.640> add<00:02:45.850> echo<00:02:46.240> trails<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:46.810> layers

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
that you can add echo trails to a layers

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.490 
that you can add echo trails to a layers
motion<00:02:47.620> or<00:02:48.220> can<00:02:48.790> you<00:02:49.030> well<00:02:49.690> actually<00:02:50.050> you<00:02:50.290> can

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
motion or can you well actually you can

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.530 
motion or can you well actually you can
and<00:02:50.740> you<00:02:50.770> can<00:02:51.130> do<00:02:51.370> it<00:02:51.490> by<00:02:51.640> using<00:02:51.880> our<00:02:52.120> old

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
and you can do it by using our old

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.230 
and you can do it by using our old

short though pre composing is taking the

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.790 
short though pre composing is taking the
layer<00:03:03.910> or<00:03:04.150> layers<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:04.840> putting<00:03:05.290> them<00:03:05.470> in<00:03:05.709> a

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
layer or layers and putting them in a

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.949 
layer or layers and putting them in a
separate<00:03:06.130> composition<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:06.910> then<00:03:07.300> placing<00:03:07.810> or

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
separate composition and then placing or

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.710 
separate composition and then placing or
nesting<00:03:08.709> that<00:03:09.250> composition<00:03:09.670> into<00:03:10.420> another

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
nesting that composition into another

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.110 
nesting that composition into another
composition<00:03:11.110> so<00:03:11.890> in<00:03:12.040> this<00:03:12.190> case<00:03:12.489> in<00:03:12.760> the

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
composition so in this case in the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.240 
composition so in this case in the
project<00:03:13.600> panel<00:03:13.630> I'll<00:03:14.410> take<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:15.040> pre

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
project panel I'll take the pre

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.640 
project panel I'll take the pre
composition<00:03:15.970> with<00:03:16.239> our<00:03:16.450> animation<00:03:17.080> and<00:03:17.230> I'll

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
composition with our animation and I'll

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.560 
composition with our animation and I'll
place<00:03:17.920> it<00:03:18.130> into<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.489> main<00:03:18.700> composition<00:03:19.120> and

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
place it into the main composition and

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.810 
place it into the main composition and
then<00:03:20.200> with<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.830> nested<00:03:21.220> composition

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
then with the nested composition

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.900 
then with the nested composition
selected<00:03:22.270> i'll<00:03:22.480> choose<00:03:23.050> effect<00:03:24.000> time<00:03:25.650> echo<00:03:26.650> as

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
selected i'll choose effect time echo as

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.120 
selected i'll choose effect time echo as
you<00:03:27.910> can<00:03:28.090> see<00:03:28.420> we're<00:03:29.140> now<00:03:29.320> getting<00:03:29.530> an<00:03:29.769> echo

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
you can see we're now getting an echo

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.550 
you can see we're now getting an echo
maybe<00:03:30.700> not<00:03:31.000> quite<00:03:31.360> what<00:03:31.570> you<00:03:31.690> want<00:03:31.930> but<00:03:32.410> it's

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
maybe not quite what you want but it's

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.580 
maybe not quite what you want but it's
there<00:03:32.799> let's<00:03:33.519> make<00:03:33.700> some<00:03:33.880> adjustments<00:03:34.450> in<00:03:35.320> the

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
there let's make some adjustments in the

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.680 
there let's make some adjustments in the
effects<00:03:35.920> panel<00:03:36.040> I'll<00:03:36.519> set<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.269> number<00:03:37.480> of

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
effects panel I'll set the number of

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.100 
effects panel I'll set the number of
echos<00:03:38.110> up<00:03:38.410> to<00:03:39.070> 15<00:03:39.850> which<00:03:40.360> will<00:03:40.570> add<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:40.900> number

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
echos up to 15 which will add the number

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.570 
of echos to the effect as you can see
this<00:03:43.660> creates<00:03:44.110> a<00:03:44.290> very<00:03:44.590> bright<00:03:44.890> effect<00:03:45.370> that's

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
this creates a very bright effect that's

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.490 
this creates a very bright effect that's
hard<00:03:45.880> to<00:03:46.000> make<00:03:46.150> sense<00:03:46.420> of<00:03:46.600> because<00:03:47.290> by<00:03:47.440> default

the<00:03:47.950> echo<00:03:48.130> effect<00:03:48.549> uses<00:03:48.910> the<00:03:49.090> add<00:03:49.239> transfer

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
the echo effect uses the add transfer

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.560 
the echo effect uses the add transfer
mode<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:50.650> mix<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:51.070> echoes<00:03:51.400> together<00:03:51.760> so<00:03:52.510> to

mode to mix the echoes together so to

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.050
