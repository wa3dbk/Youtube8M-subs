 correct goal alone destroy the living 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.049
 near the sheep wolves and in such fables 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.540
 like sheets and roots 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.729
 the pig under the oak is not the exploiter of the people 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.280
 only use the works of the very same 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.670
 people but also try their best 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.600
 humiliate by the typical face of mutual royal 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.340
 Russia has always been a judge in many fables 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.350
 grams tried to light up 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.659
 it is this image naturally 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.729
 satirically light the peasantry 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.270
 represented in such fables Krylov as 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.040
 wolf and lamb peasant and sheep 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.799
 the wing tries to show the peasant and 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.860
 worker he resorts to various 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.719
 by comparison to different metaphors 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.649
 all the same 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:00.509
 the main means of artistic 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.460
 expressiveness in this case remains 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.009
 metaphor wrong judgment 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.530
 shows you a wing in many fables 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.310
 the protagonist is in 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.489
 these towers 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.470
 the judge and the peasantry are such fables as 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.170

 means to show we need a judge 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.690
 and a farmer's worker, of course 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.550
 comparison but mainly artistic 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.760
 means this case remains 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:36.000
 metaphor to execute and sheep and meat to court 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:38.520

 let's talk this winter road 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.040
 it belongs to the elegy genre itself 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.560

 take this information 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.840
 note that the songs in this 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.450
 poem ring first 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.959

 picture note on 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.600
 use of actively homogeneous epithets 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:40.350
 definition reinforces the inversion of the road 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.989
 winter boring and detail 4 stanzas 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.970
 lack of any tropes that is 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:49.019
 Pushkin describes in this case 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.959
 The current situation is rather short 5 6

 Georgia is sad could easily night 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.690

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.250
 Pushkin's poem 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:37.160
 I loved you , it was written in the form of a message 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.380

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.750
 love metaphor faded away 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.540
 and now we'll touch on the poem 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.340
 Pushkin's the Bronze Horseman 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.220

 framework exams such as relate 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:58.190
 interests of the individual and the state itself 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:01.249
 the poem is built on the principle of contrast 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.799
 description of the life of a poor official 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:04.279
 given as the antithesis of the story of the great 

00:06:03.799 --> 00:06:07.579
 the king 

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:10.099
 reformer hero works evgeny 

00:06:07.579 --> 00:06:12.559
 as a result, the petty official 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:14.709
 crazy how do you think why 

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:17.779
 and where is the answer to this question 

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:20.119
 The answer to this question is presented in 

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:22.819
 climax scene when wandering around 

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:26.139
 the city of Eugene stumbles upon a monument 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:30.049
 Peter the first and starts him face 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:32.269
 Peter the first given monument is a symbol 

00:06:30.049 --> 00:06:34.699
 state power of the very power 

00:06:32.269 --> 00:06:37.729
 which was not able to protect 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:40.519
 that little man like that 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:43.729
 this work we will catch 

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:46.129
 once again the topic of the little man who 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:48.769
 starts karamzin in a piece 

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:51.469
 Poor Liza, what did Pushkin want to show 

00:06:48.769 --> 00:06:53.449
 with a similar ending he wanted to show that 

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:54.019
 interests of the little man no less 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:56.689
 are important 

00:06:54.019 --> 00:06:58.999
 than the interests of the state as a whole because 

00:06:56.689 --> 00:07:01.309
 that the state itself is 

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:04.279
