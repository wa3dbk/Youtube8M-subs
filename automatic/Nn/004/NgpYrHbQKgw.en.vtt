you<00:00:01.079> know<00:00:01.229> there<00:00:01.499> is<00:00:01.589> an<00:00:01.709> extreme<00:00:02.220> contrast

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
you know there is an extreme contrast

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.170 
you know there is an extreme contrast
there<00:00:03.450> and<00:00:06.649> so<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:07.709> must<00:00:08.370> say<00:00:08.580> that<00:00:08.820> today<00:00:09.150> I

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:09.180 
there and so I must say that today I

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.300 
there and so I must say that today I
have<00:00:09.690> in<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.110> certain<00:00:10.500> sense<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:11.010> have<00:00:11.100> more

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:11.310 
have in a certain sense I have more

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.770 
have in a certain sense I have more
sense<00:00:11.550> sympathy<00:00:12.240> for<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.480> traditionalist<00:00:13.320> I

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
sense sympathy for the traditionalist I

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.990 
sense sympathy for the traditionalist I
where<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.810> was<00:00:16.170> coming<00:00:16.470> from<00:00:16.620> I<00:00:17.340> mean<00:00:17.550> my

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
where I was coming from I mean my

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.190 
where I was coming from I mean my
concerns<00:00:18.510> were<00:00:18.840> basically<00:00:19.710> intellectual<00:00:20.610> and

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
concerns were basically intellectual and

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.470 
concerns were basically intellectual and
I<00:00:22.200> had<00:00:22.380> already<00:00:22.560> written<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.340> first<00:00:23.580> version

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
I had already written the first version

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.590 
I had already written the first version
of<00:00:24.539> philosophy<00:00:25.110> proper<00:00:25.650> before<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.610> came<00:00:27.300> down

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:27.600 
of philosophy proper before I came down

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.819 
of philosophy proper before I came down
here<00:00:28.140> very<00:00:29.150> important<00:00:30.440> so<00:00:31.759> I<00:00:33.200> mean<00:00:34.200> what<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.410> saw

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
here very important so I mean what I saw

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.710 
here very important so I mean what I saw
I<00:00:34.860> mean<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.250> word<00:00:35.430> peace<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.060> was<00:00:36.210> wildly

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
I mean the word peace is I was wildly

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.020 
I mean the word peace is I was wildly
enthusiastic<00:00:36.930> about<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.040> word<00:00:38.220> pieces<00:00:38.760> but<00:00:38.880> I

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
enthusiastic about the word pieces but I

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.630 
enthusiastic about the word pieces but I
saw<00:00:39.270> implications<00:00:40.050> for<00:00:40.350> them<00:00:40.590> for<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.460> so

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
saw implications for them for the so

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.389 
saw implications for them for the so
called<00:00:41.910> exact<00:00:42.360> Sciences<00:00:43.260> which<00:00:43.800> apparently

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
called exact Sciences which apparently

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.780 
called exact Sciences which apparently
nobody<00:00:44.760> else<00:00:45.059> saw<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.980> I<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.579> which

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
nobody else saw and I and and which

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.470 
nobody else saw and I and and which
nobody<00:00:48.059> else<00:00:48.450> intended<00:00:49.640> but<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.940> mean<00:00:51.239> my

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
nobody else intended but I mean my

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.510 
nobody else intended but I mean my
attitude<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.200> couldn't<00:00:52.530> see<00:00:52.829> why<00:00:53.129> why

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
attitude I couldn't see why why

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.229 
attitude I couldn't see why why
mathematics<00:00:54.420> logic<00:00:54.950> should<00:00:55.950> not<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
mathematics logic should not have the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.840 
mathematics logic should not have the
same<00:00:57.450> kind<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.930> upheaval<00:00:58.399> you<00:00:59.399> know<00:00:59.579> or<00:00:59.760> they

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
same kind of upheaval you know or they

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.170 
same kind of upheaval you know or they
say<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.090> mean<00:01:00.719> what<00:01:01.039> what<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.309> avant-garde

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
say I mean what what the the avant-garde

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.300 
say I mean what what the the avant-garde
did<00:01:03.719> for<00:01:04.019> me<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.199> guess<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.220> was<00:01:05.489> um<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:07.310> idea

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
did for me I guess so it was um the idea

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.570 
did for me I guess so it was um the idea
of<00:01:08.990> total<00:01:09.990> non<00:01:10.440> traditional<00:01:10.770> ISM<00:01:12.380> aggressive

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
of total non traditional ISM aggressive

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.340 
of total non traditional ISM aggressive
experimentation<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.790> mean<00:01:15.600> that's<00:01:15.780> what<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:15.990> got

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
experimentation I mean that's what I got

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.429 
experimentation I mean that's what I got
out<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.180> motivated<00:01:18.180> me<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.659> didn't<00:01:19.020> see

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
out of it that motivated me I didn't see

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.580 
out of it that motivated me I didn't see
why<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:20.280> should<00:01:20.340> not<00:01:20.790> be<00:01:20.820> transferred<00:01:21.720> to

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
why that should not be transferred to

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.770 
why that should not be transferred to
mathematics<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.670> logic<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.240> why<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.450> should

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
mathematics and logic and why you should

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.679 
mathematics and logic and why you should
not<00:01:24.900> have<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.439> mathematics<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.460> logic<00:01:26.970> that

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
not have a mathematics and a logic that

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.330 
not have a mathematics and a logic that
can<00:01:27.750> only<00:01:28.020> be<00:01:28.140> practiced<00:01:28.770> outside<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
can only be practiced outside the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.340 
can only be practiced outside the
university<00:01:30.090> for<00:01:30.330> example<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:32.270> so<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:34.020> was<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
university for example I so that was the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.399 
university for example I so that was the
direction<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.040> was<00:01:35.189> moving<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.299> mean<00:01:37.170> if

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
direction that I was moving in I mean if

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.920 
direction that I was moving in I mean if
you<00:01:37.590> if<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.130> look<00:01:38.369> at<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.670> avant-garde<00:01:39.210> you

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
you if you look at the avant-garde you

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.340 
you if you look at the avant-garde you
know<00:01:40.080> coldly<00:01:40.860> just<00:01:41.640> for<00:01:42.119> what<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.450> was<00:01:42.810> for

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
know coldly just for what it was for

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.399 
know coldly just for what it was for
what<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.650> presented<00:01:44.520> itself<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.869> public

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
what it presented itself to the public

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.219 
what it presented itself to the public
you<00:01:47.369> know<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.549> mean<00:01:47.880> today<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.240> look<00:01:48.570> back<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:49.049> it

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
you know I mean today I look back on it

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.670 
you know I mean today I look back on it
not<00:01:49.680> only<00:01:49.860> with<00:01:50.130> total<00:01:50.490> contempt<00:01:51.320> but<00:01:52.320> it

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
not only with total contempt but it

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.370 
not only with total contempt but it
actually<00:01:53.180> horrifies<00:01:54.180> me<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:54.960> was<00:01:55.170> like

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
actually horrifies me that this was like

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.069 
actually horrifies me that this was like
sort<00:01:55.650> of<00:01:55.710> an<00:01:55.829> ordeal<00:01:56.360> you<00:01:57.360> know<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.720> had<00:01:57.930> to

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
sort of an ordeal you know that I had to

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.210 
sort of an ordeal you know that I had to
pass<00:01:58.350> through<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.280> order<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.770> you<00:02:01.770> know<00:02:01.799> gain

sixty<00:02:14.490> when<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.180> came<00:02:15.480> down<00:02:15.750> here<00:02:16.550> I<00:02:17.690> mean<00:02:18.690> you

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
sixty when I came down here I mean you

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.230 
sixty when I came down here I mean you
know<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.470> had<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.950> prove<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.520> I<00:02:20.580> went<00:02:20.940> further

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
know I had to prove that I went further

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.550 
know I had to prove that I went further
than<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.780> others<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.770> know<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.270> I<00:02:24.630> mean<00:02:25.440> it

I give my lecture on nearness and and
this<00:05:38.380> is<00:05:38.560> the<00:05:38.710> point<00:05:38.949> at<00:05:39.280> which<00:05:39.460> I<00:05:40.860> you<00:05:41.860> know

this is the point at which I you know
begin<00:05:42.340> to<00:05:42.520> speak<00:05:42.819> sort<00:05:43.539> of<00:05:43.630> prophetic<00:05:44.050> aliy

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349 
begin to speak sort of prophetic aliy

begin to speak sort of prophetic aliy
you<00:05:44.500> know<00:05:44.620> against<00:05:45.509> my<00:05:46.509> hosts<00:05:48.960> because<00:05:49.960> you

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
you know against my hosts because you

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.749 
you know against my hosts because you
know<00:05:50.710> I<00:05:50.740> argued<00:05:51.669> that<00:05:52.110> newness<00:05:53.110> cannot<00:05:54.039> be<00:05:54.370> the

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:54.759 
know I argued that newness cannot be the

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:59.159 
know I argued that newness cannot be the
sole<00:05:55.889> characteristic<00:05:56.889> of<00:05:56.979> a<00:05:57.099> work<00:05:57.900> it<00:05:58.900> just

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
sole characteristic of a work it just

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:00.839 
sole characteristic of a work it just
can't<00:05:59.440> be<00:05:59.590> I<00:05:59.919> mean<00:06:00.130> in<00:06:00.250> other<00:06:00.370> words<00:06:00.460> that

can't be I mean in other words that

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:04.110 
can't be I mean in other words that
mistake<00:06:01.270> of<00:06:01.419> nearness<00:06:01.659> was<00:06:01.990> with<00:06:02.289> nonsense<00:06:03.120> it

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
mistake of nearness was with nonsense it

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.860

also<00:06:04.389> cannot<00:06:04.900> be<00:06:04.960> the<00:06:05.229> most<00:06:05.440> important

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
also cannot be the most important

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.349 
also cannot be the most important
