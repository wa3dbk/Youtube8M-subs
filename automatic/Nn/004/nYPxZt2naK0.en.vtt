way that means you can only connect to

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.640 
way that means you can only connect to
it<00:02:30.790> if<00:02:30.970> you're<00:02:31.120> in<00:02:31.240> your<00:02:31.360> own<00:02:31.650> wireless

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
install this as well and yeah once that

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.090 
install this as well and yeah once that
is<00:03:13.959> installed<00:03:14.110> make<00:03:14.650> sure<00:03:14.860> you<00:03:16.050> enter<00:03:17.050> the<00:03:17.350> to

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100

and to the right information wouldn't

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.220 
and to the right information wouldn't
ask<00:03:22.630> your<00:03:22.840> IP<00:03:23.070> click<00:03:24.070> on<00:03:24.360> detect<00:03:25.360> IP<00:03:25.780> address

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
ask your IP click on detect IP address

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.009 
ask your IP click on detect IP address
yeah<00:03:27.100> that's<00:03:27.489> pretty<00:03:27.700> straightforward<00:03:28.510> and

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
yeah that's pretty straightforward and

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.410 
yeah that's pretty straightforward and
go<00:03:29.560> through<00:03:29.769> the<00:03:29.860> install<00:03:30.220> then<00:03:30.850> it<00:03:31.239> will

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
go through the install then it will

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.490 
go through the install then it will
start<00:03:31.630> up<00:03:31.780> like<00:03:31.959> this

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
start up like this

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.320 
start up like this
it'll<00:03:32.830> originally<00:03:33.220> be<00:03:33.340> green<00:03:33.610> and<00:03:33.880> then<00:03:34.030> turn

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
it'll originally be green and then turn

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.720 
it'll originally be green and then turn
red<00:03:34.630> red<00:03:35.500> means<00:03:35.830> it<00:03:36.010> is<00:03:36.100> connected<00:03:36.580> to<00:03:36.610> the

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
red red means it is connected to the

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.759 
red red means it is connected to the
Internet<00:03:37.239> green<00:03:37.900> means<00:03:38.140> it's<00:03:38.410> only<00:03:38.560> on

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
Internet green means it's only on

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.620 
Internet green means it's only on
localhost<00:03:39.280> it<00:03:39.519> will<00:03:39.610> immediately<00:03:39.880> turn<00:03:40.330> red

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
localhost it will immediately turn red

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.320 
localhost it will immediately turn red
um<00:03:41.220> that<00:03:42.220> that<00:03:42.700> is<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.660> IP<00:03:43.810> right<00:03:44.290> there<00:03:44.560> and

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
um that that is the IP right there and

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.910 
um that that is the IP right there and
right<00:03:46.330> here<00:03:46.830> um<00:03:48.840> now<00:03:49.840> that<00:03:49.870> means<00:03:50.290> that<00:03:50.650> it's

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
right here um now that means that it's

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.580 
right here um now that means that it's
on<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.370> internet<00:03:51.700> but<00:03:52.660> there<00:03:53.140> is<00:03:53.260> one<00:03:53.470> more

address<00:05:05.250> is<00:05:05.430> very<00:05:05.669> important<00:05:06.210> you<00:05:06.419> need<00:05:06.600> to

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
address is very important you need to

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.900 
address is very important you need to
know<00:05:06.750> what<00:05:07.350> your<00:05:07.590> IP<00:05:07.710> address<00:05:07.979> is<00:05:08.400> for<00:05:08.760> your

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
know what your IP address is for your

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.120 
know what your IP address is for your
computer<00:05:09.360> so<00:05:10.260> that<00:05:10.380> means<00:05:10.590> when<00:05:10.770> you<00:05:10.860> try<00:05:11.070> to

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
computer so that means when you try to

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.830 
computer so that means when you try to
connect<00:05:11.430> to<00:05:11.490> the<00:05:11.639> router<00:05:11.789> it'll<00:05:12.300> immediately

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840
