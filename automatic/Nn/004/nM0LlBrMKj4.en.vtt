like<00:01:42.960> super<00:01:43.470> medium<00:01:43.799> for<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.790> other

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
like super medium for that the other

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.280 
like super medium for that the other
thing<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.270> science<00:01:45.600> says<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.869> we're<00:01:45.990> happy

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
thing is science says that we're happy

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:55.180 
thing is science says that we're happy
to<00:01:46.409> degree<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:46.920> feel<00:01:47.220> mastery

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.250
