 province of Lecce worn and pregnant 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.070
 mind of vessel and shakes off 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.140
 the label of re soldier jane his 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.090

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.560
 orders 60 men and only men from 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.810
 crew arriving at 90 in 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.580
 mission its policy the authority of the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.500
 degree depends on the capacity not from the 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.810
 kind and derives from the right motivation 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.800
 by the professionalism and pride of 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.800
 a job that you live 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.230
 the moment I think I gave it up 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.330
 account if we wanted it was the moment in 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:51.520
 which I signed the newspaper of binnacle 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:54.230
 which said that at 08 00 of 19 June 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.780
 I became the commander of this ship 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.970
 the fact of being the first woman if 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.010
 we wanted was always a coincidence 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.260
 lived very naturally I am 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.720
 become first an official student in 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.910
 academy then I was a young man 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.930
 official embarked this state a 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:15.050
 young boss and now I'm a 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.739
 so young commander is not there 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.380
 distinction I can't say the woman e 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.010
 the officer for me is one thing 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.010
 versa 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.620
 proof 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:41.930
 I did and I'm doing my best for e 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.540
 I was counting and hoping with my crew 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.390
 to be able to work serenely to do them 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.810
 work with a smile and all together 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.350
 I can say that for now we are on the good side 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.600
 Street 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.440
 being a commander is not only 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.350
 maneuvering a unit is not only 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:05.240
 sign more or less important documents 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:06.740
 and above all to manage people and da 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.130
 these people who can give you 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.500
 a lot you have to learn and be 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.950
 able to bring out the best that 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.480
 everyone can give you that too 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.370
 very small to his contribution must 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.190
 be given you must be able to do it to him 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.860
 give just so you can carry on one 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.720
 ship on a personal level 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:33.350
 the goals are to succeed in 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.330
 give value to the little time you can in the 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.670
 our trade sometimes devote to 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.760
 the family affection to your loved ones 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.380
 so focus but how I try to do 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.070
 every moment of my life on 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.540
 quality and not the quantity that is one 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.190
 of the most beautiful experiences I have ever had 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.500
 done in my life in the navy 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.630
 certainly the most beautiful in life there 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.819
 they are many and vital different intensities 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:01.090
 but I can say different emotions now 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.889
 I must only advise you to live it to the full 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.249
 to have fun as I've always been 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:07.879
 said and not to waste even one 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:10.280
 second 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.799
 then what I will be after I will decide 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.139
 at the last minute or someone the bike 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.810
 but for me for what concerns me 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:21.680
 having assigned her this ship and mine 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:24.280
 trust and total wish a calm sea 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.280
 and wind at your back
