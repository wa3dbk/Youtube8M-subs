00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.763
 Let's ask Mr. Dolgov. Please. 

00:00:02.763 --> 00:00:12.183
 How do you personally represent the organization of municipal elections in DNR and LNR? 

00:00:12.183 --> 00:00:16.116
 Peter, I have the feeling that you are probably preparing yourself for broadcasting the program. 

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:19.256
 I think this question was current in March last year. 

00:00:19.256 --> 00:00:20.675
 And I have been asking for it since March ... 

00:00:20.675 --> 00:00:24.864
 From March? But now it is not March but February 2015! 

00:00:24.864 --> 00:00:28.774
 - And are you ready to answer my question? - This morning, before the Minnesota talks 

00:00:28.774 --> 00:00:31.586
 5 people died in Donetsk! 

00:00:31.586 --> 00:00:33.346
 Shelling led the Ukrainian side. 

00:00:33.346 --> 00:00:38.130
 People died at the entrance of the Donetsk Metallurgical Plant, a minibus driver burned down, 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.442
 a woman was deadly wounded at the bus station, died during the transport to the hospital. 

00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:46.412
 And that's what preceded the negotiations in Minsk! And the bombardment doesn't stop. 

00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:52.889
 And when a Czech representative talks about Europe being interested ... 

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:57.971
 The hotel where you lived - at the other end of Donetsk, 

00:00:57.971 --> 00:01:02.316
 on the opposite side of the airport, was shelling on Sunday. 

00:01:02.316 --> 00:01:06.388
 I spent the night there and got under the mortar shelling of a Ukrainian diverse group. 

00:01:06.388 --> 00:01:08.815
 And that is what preceded the Minsk negotiations! 

00:01:08.815 --> 00:01:11.951
 - You talk about Europe being interested in peace. - Yes ... 

00:01:11.951 --> 00:01:17.008
 No, Europe is not interested in peace! And let's divide the leadership of Europe ... 

00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:24.739
 Mrs Merkel, Mr Holland from the people of Europe, who are no doubt for peace! 

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:29.547
 Let's also remind you that international brigades are fighting in our country. 

00:01:29.548 --> 00:01:41.881
 Also remember that under the protection of Mrs Merkel, which you may consider to be a "peace negotiator", there are 100,000 US soldiers, 

00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:46.060
 25% of US military foreign crews are located in Germany. 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.550
 Germany - "EU locomotive" is an occupied state. 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.360
 And if you want to know what the reaction to today's meeting is in Donetsk, Luhansk and other cities, 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.440
 as they call them - the Normandy Four, or even "four European leaders" ... 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:09.765
 For us there is only one leader and one who deserves the respect of all the people of Novorussia - DNR and LNR, and that is Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin. 

00:02:09.765 --> 00:02:19.044
 It is the diplomatic support of the RF that people in Donetsk and Lugansk rely on every hour, every minute, under constant shelling. 

00:02:19.044 --> 00:02:26.144
 I would also like to remind you that when you talk about Merkel, the Netherlands being able to make decisions alone, they are not. 

00:02:26.144 --> 00:02:27.519
 I told you about Merkel. 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:38.721
 Explain to me what prevents the Netherlands from maintaining their subjectivity and giving Mistral to Russia? 

00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:45.275
 To show that France is a reliable partner as a state. 

00:02:45.275 --> 00:02:50.168
 Mistrals did not deliver, but flew to Minsk to show how he was capable of dealing with nothing. 

00:02:50.168 --> 00:02:52.744
 The same puppet driven by America! 

00:02:52.744 --> 00:02:55.953
 - And finally, I want to go back to the issue of arms delivery. - Yes. 

00:02:55.953 --> 00:02:58.896
 For example, Michael Bohm ... we have quite often disputes with each other. 

00:02:58.896 --> 00:03:01.498
 The program rounds up the supply of American weapons. 

00:03:01.498 --> 00:03:05.752
 I understand that the part of your CIA payout 

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:09.475
 goes from lobbyists of the US military industry. 

00:03:09.475 --> 00:03:15.527
 That is. those who produce deadly or non-lethal types of weapons ... 

00:03:15.527 --> 00:03:18.105
 - You don't even listen to me ... - Listen! 

00:03:18.105 --> 00:03:24.019
 US weapons in Donbas with Ukrainian army and karatelÅ¯m already! 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:31.123
 And we remember well when our army freed Donetsk Airport from Ukrainian fascists, 

00:03:31.123 --> 00:03:34.828
 we found everything there - M16, M4 and so on ... 

00:03:34.828 --> 00:03:38.683
 Where did the American weapons come from? Listen, where? 

00:03:38.683 --> 00:03:43.020
 Because you're already supplying them! 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.254
 And I want to tell you the following, and I think the pollinators agree with me that 

00:03:47.254 --> 00:03:53.459
 American tanks will burn in the Donbas as well as Ukrainian if you supply them! 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:59.285
 Because you will not find such idiots who would sit in your American tanks and go to Donbas! 

00:03:59.285 --> 00:04:04.949
 Mobilization is yours, yours, because the United States is in full control of the US. 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:12.715
 Now that you've had your address to Michael, Constantine, 

00:04:12.715 --> 00:04:16.890
 I repeat my question about the municipal elections, please reply. 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:24.695
 If they push you to make a decision like a compromise? For example, autonomy? 

00:04:24.696 --> 00:04:25.660
 What do you think? 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.790
 Donbas will never get Ukraine again and there will be no Ukrainian municipal elections! 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.568
 When you talk about the divorce, what do you mean? 

00:04:35.568 --> 00:04:37.427
 To leave Donetsk? I'm not leaving Donetsk! 

00:04:37.427 --> 00:04:40.014
 I'd rather die with a slot machine! I'm not leaving! 

00:04:40.014 --> 00:04:43.578
 You call a 70 km zone for the removal of our artillery. 

00:04:43.578 --> 00:04:47.563
 Where do we get him? The Border Crossing Success? 

00:04:47.563 --> 00:04:50.166
 Where is the border of the Donetsk People's Republic with Russia? 

00:04:50.166 --> 00:04:55.149
 And Donetsk let you? To go there with your American weapons? 

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:56.632
 Wait, wait ... Please speak one by one. 

00:04:56.632 --> 00:05:02.164
 Our basic standpoint is the ceasefire! 

00:05:02.164 --> 00:05:07.869
 We, when we agreed in Minsk, followed everything. 

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:12.305
 We pulled the heavy machinery, we didn't shoot the first, but they kept firing us. 

00:05:12.305 --> 00:05:14.032
 The killing of civilians continued. 

00:05:14.032 --> 00:05:21.301
 And since January's Christmas holidays, dark forces are being activated during Orthodox holidays ... 

00:05:21.301 --> 00:05:25.010
 Simply, the situation just escalated every day. 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:33.303
 When the BS tragedy happened when Ukrainian fascists shot a 13-person column ... 

00:05:33.303 --> 00:05:35.446
 We have similar tragedies with us every day! 

00:05:35.446 --> 00:05:37.391
 Nightmare! Such a number of casualties! 

00:05:37.391 --> 00:05:44.962
 And I want to ask where the Americans were, where your Obama was, where your Merkel was - absolutely dominated by the US! 

00:05:44.962 --> 00:05:46.762
 Where was Mr. Holand! 

00:05:46.762 --> 00:05:55.689
 Anyone who marched frantically with the "Ju Suise Charlie" sign, why didn't they stop the tens of thousands of civilians killed in the Donbas? 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:06:06.028
 Because you, Europeans - dominated by the US, absolutely don't care that people are dying in the Donbas - every day, every hour. 

00:06:06.028 --> 00:06:08.675
 Because you consider us menial people. 

00:06:08.675 --> 00:06:18.107
 Now he would like to point out that there is a need to clearly separate European leaders and American from the people of the United States and Europe. 

00:06:18.107 --> 00:06:24.690
 They do not want war, and today anti-fascists from all over the world come to fight in the ranks of oppressors. 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.040
 Against such as YOU - the warbreakers! 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.701
 Against those who earn the war against the American military industry 

00:06:30.701 --> 00:06:33.902
 - against the Ukrainian fascists and all the other fascists ... - Constantine, Constantine ... let me ...
