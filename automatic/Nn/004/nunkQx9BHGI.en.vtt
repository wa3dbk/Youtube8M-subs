00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.330
 Hello everyone Hetman today when 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.730
 I shoot this video on the calendar on July 1 and 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.840
 of course you know what will happen tomorrow 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.549
 yes who does not know I will prompt tomorrow 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.039
 there will be exactly half a year to 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.510
 the next Christmas tree of gifts and festive 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.790
 chimes 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.220
 but tomorrow the door will open and the world of 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:26.220
 war ps for everyone to play this 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.050
 therefore the game is second to you now 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.240
 issue transfer teach materiel 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.770
 and already inside the issue let's see 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.780
 according to the classes of aircraft and perhaps 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.040
 yesterday's tankers tomorrow in the air 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.040
 become a little easier to navigate 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.469
 Let's start with the fact that we forget the flare from the tanks 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.110
 air combat is far from tank 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.910
 rubilovo and so let's take it easy 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.129
 stamps and take a look at the game under another 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.230
 perspective today we analyze in order 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.820
 branches of study to make it easier 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.430
 choose at the start of the direction for 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.199
 comfortable game since the review will lead 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.570
 according to the classes of technology to give direct 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.520
 leadership under the action I will not I 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.220
 just put the framework I write a general 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.540
 the concept is not superfluous 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.880
 one of the most important 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.920
 general tips do not forget that everyone 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.270
 the plane is unique he has his 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.220
 a set of pros and cons 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.770
 proceeding from which it is better to think over the 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.030
 tactics of playing on it is good in the interface 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.979
 Now it is worth assessing the individual 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.350
 characteristics and you do not have to 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.509
 deflate all the technique to understand the pros and 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.000
 look at each of the minuses 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.369
 stars and you will find out what at this level 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.380
 compare to large and small indicators 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.570
 well now a quick overview of the classes 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.179
 which in the future I will consider a little more 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.640
 perhaps begin in detail with light 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.619
 fighters as possible guessed it 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.920
 basic unit of air calling 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.240
 which destroy exactly the air target 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.520
 forget the targets on land and sea 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.220
 video with them is not the fad of this class 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.530
 technics the freshest aircraft rubilovo 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.780
 maneuvering is a challenge to you and your 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.820
 Enemy Eradication Reactions 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.009
 airplanes and kept technicians in most 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.049
 cases it is your goal however not 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.880
 forget about allied attack aircraft that 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.110
 may also need your help 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.060
 so attack aircraft 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.430
 very often becomes almost the most 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.350
 the main target for the enemy forces of all on 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.329
 who often forgets about her own 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.820
 security and to attack in my opinion 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.680
 such pilots are better targets use this 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.010
 and watch out for the radar so as not to be 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.010
 in their place 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.099
 very similar to light fighters 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.260
 carrier fighters after one 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.870
 except they have a bomb which 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.580
 can destroy ground targets early 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.950
 battle throw bombs on the enemy 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.680
 land and go to war with hawks 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.230
 small note do not forget that your 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.819
 lh depends on your weight without bombs your 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.860
 maneuverability therefore your 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.349
 survival will only grow and this 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.390
 It concerns not only God but also rockets if 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.430
 choose this path for yourself know what 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.260
 usually hawks are not the best indicator 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.109
 firepower and strength level 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.030
 which are often below average but not without 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.980
 exceptions however speed 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.709
 characteristics and maneuverability of ordinary 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.780
 above average and therefore can be summarized 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.489
 taking this direction from you will need 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.359
 quick response strong vestibular 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.620
 apparatus 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.269
 good care not to 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.700
 miss the enemy who comes to you 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.040
 on 6 well and in the slightest degree knowledge of maneuvers 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.239
 do not be lazy and read the forum there 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.239
 good guides on this topic 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.260
 next in line for review from 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.879
 attack aircraft initially the task of this 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.400
 technology is to destroy 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.319
 all enemy ground forces earn 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.930
 superiority points due to which 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.150
 the game can also win this counterpart 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.040
 capture in a tank battle only for this 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.140
 you will need to clear the territory 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.450
 from the forces of the defense of warehouses and naturally 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.189
 enemy's main building for attack aircraft 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.329
 it is characteristic to have better speed and 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:51.579
 level maneuverability 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.549
 however, they are undoubtedly the leader 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.780
 steepness of weapons and overall strength 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.430
 structures that are displayed in the game 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.560
 a large number of hit points 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.299
 looking at these poor performance 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.129
 agility and speed understand that 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.079
 air combat, we basically do 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.480
 there is nothing to hope for allies who 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.900
 cover our backs and pump out the ground 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.970
 the enemy 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.799
 little advice try to do it 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.930
 without the help of bombs so how if yours 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.819
 stuck that tail and allies are not around 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.010
 only your present can quickly 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.380
 destroy the enemy descend by a small 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.110
 height and throw a bomb with experience you 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.000
 understand exactly how to defend them so 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.710
 now if you chose the attack path 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.880
 Know that I'm not worth it. 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.720
 count on strong support 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.880
 allies 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.310
 often your life is granted in the game 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.590
 only you yourself do not forget bummed 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.460
 who he is he shoots just up him 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.560
 tail cuts 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.900
 so don't forget to turn them on 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.000
 the enemy work michal than you drop 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.710
 bomb and maybe you finish big 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.630
 part of the fighting is still in the air when your 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.630
 hapless boasts will be long in the hangar 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.240
 finishes the review with heavy fighters 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.170
 This class of techniques is usually erroneously confused 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.450
 with attack aircraft 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.100
 I believe that in the German branch these aircraft 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.700
 designed to perform the role of work on 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.280
 ground 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.080
 and on this many newbies burn like that 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.030
 like who am i wrong they get no 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.100
 all possible plan from the game 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.530
 so here is the role of heavy fighters this 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.200
 cover allies having bombs do 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.060
 their part-time attack aircraft as well as 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.830
 pilgrims they are forced at the beginning of the battle 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.440
 lose weight but only after that 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.450
 war in the sky characteristic pluses 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.130
 This class of equipment is a good fire. 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.730
 the power that sometimes lose a little 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.100
 attack plane 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.140
 and speed but speed is unusual our 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.850
 Trump is the climb rate that is 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.130
 gain altitude on this plane easier 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.080
 rather than on others and this is very important 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.120
 enjoy constantly maintain and 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.860
 height and speed and when the homeless are not 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.530
 turn the engines off forget about 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.300
 flaps however the amount of strength y 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.320
 us average and maneuverability slightly higher 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.660
 than the stormtroopers 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.730
 so remember that you should not go to 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.830
 better maneuvering on this machine 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.390
 to work by passes that is to choose a goal 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.600
 try to shoot her as you can 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:59.700
 more accurately and fly farther and then 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.800
 choose a new target or turn around and 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.720
 repeat the operation again the main thing is not 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.850
 forget about the distance better fly off 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.740
 goal about a kilometer then for 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.800
 reversal you will have enough space and 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.110
 time for accurate shooting 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.240
 if you choose this path please do not 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.100
 try to storm remember good 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.200
 speeds and get ready for what your 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.760
 enemies will take away others but this is only 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.590
 as long as your accuracy is not on 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.580
 height and with experience when your hands are already 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.320
 stopped shaking 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.630
 you will be able to pick up the gaping in grief 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.510
 pilot 1 aiming queue 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.740
 Well, in general, that's all if you liked 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.750
 subscribe to my channel support 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.300
 video plus signs and leave comments 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.810
 Well, now flew to explore the world of 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.860
 warplanes 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.860
 see you in the air
