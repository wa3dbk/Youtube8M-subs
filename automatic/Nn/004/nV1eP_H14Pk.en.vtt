00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
shoulder this is going to create the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.189 
shoulder this is going to create the
same<00:00:17.100> slope<00:00:17.609> when<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.390> short<00:00:18.840> rode<00:00:19.020> the

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
same slope when I short rode the

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.700 
same slope when I short rode the
previous<00:00:19.680> shoulder<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.369> did<00:00:21.029> one<00:00:21.869> needle<00:00:22.260> then

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
previous shoulder I did one needle then

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.029 
previous shoulder I did one needle then
three<00:00:23.130> one<00:00:24.000> needle<00:00:24.359> then<00:00:24.840> three<00:00:25.170> one<00:00:25.680> needle

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
three one needle then three one needle

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.250 
three one needle then three one needle
then<00:00:26.369> three<00:00:26.640> one<00:00:27.210> needle<00:00:27.539> two<00:00:27.720> three<00:00:27.990> all<00:00:28.199> the

then three one needle two three all the
way<00:00:28.890> across<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:30.000> took<00:00:30.269> two<00:00:30.510> rows<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:31.050> decrease

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
way across it took two rows to decrease

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.520 
way across it took two rows to decrease
four<00:00:31.830> stitches<00:00:32.480> because<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.690> put<00:00:33.989> one<00:00:34.230> needle

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
four stitches because I put one needle

I'm still short rowing but I'm going to
take<00:00:41.969> four<00:00:42.420> needles<00:00:42.809> out<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.020> work<00:00:43.379> each<00:00:44.070> time

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
take four needles out of work each time

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.940 
take four needles out of work each time
that<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.730> short<00:00:45.030> row<00:00:45.239> take<00:00:46.200> four<00:00:46.469> needles<00:00:46.649> out

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
that I short row take four needles out

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.119 
that I short row take four needles out
of<00:00:47.100> work<00:00:47.480> two<00:00:48.480> rows<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.840> mini<00:00:49.320> four<00:00:49.890> needles

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
of work two rows of mini four needles

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.850 
of work two rows of mini four needles
out<00:00:50.460> two<00:00:50.969> rows<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.390> knitting<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:52.559> I'm

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
out two rows of knitting so I'm

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.740 
out two rows of knitting so I'm
beginning<00:00:53.129> with<00:00:53.430> carriage<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> right<00:00:54.420> and

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
beginning with carriage on the right and

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.350 
beginning with carriage on the right and
I<00:00:55.170> cannot<00:00:55.500> decrease<00:00:56.100> four<00:00:56.460> stitches<00:00:56.820> on<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
I cannot decrease four stitches on the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.380 
I cannot decrease four stitches on the
same<00:00:57.600> size<00:00:57.809> as<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.109> carriage<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:59.070> can<00:00:59.879> only<00:01:00.090> do

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
same size as a carriage I can only do

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.479 
same size as a carriage I can only do
that<00:01:00.570> when<00:01:00.930> I'm<00:01:01.079> over<00:01:01.410> on<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.649> opposite<00:01:02.190> side

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
that when I'm over on the opposite side

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.240 
that when I'm over on the opposite side
so<00:01:02.760> if<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.780> have<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:03.989> situation<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.979> pattern

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
so if you have a situation in a pattern

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.859 
so if you have a situation in a pattern
you<00:01:05.489> have<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.820> knit<00:01:05.970> over<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> opposite

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
you have to knit over to the opposite

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.050 
you have to knit over to the opposite
side<00:01:06.930> before<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:08.040> can<00:01:08.280> begin<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.640> short<00:01:08.909> row

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
side before you can begin to short row

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.109 
side before you can begin to short row
we're<00:01:10.020> going<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.500> opposite<00:01:10.950> side<00:01:11.280> to

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
we're going to the opposite side to

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.179 
we're going to the opposite side to
short<00:01:12.420> row<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> machines

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
short row you have to have the machines

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.789 
short row you have to have the machines
that<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.729> hold<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.720> machine<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.200> set<00:01:16.619> on

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
that on hold and this machine is set on

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.550 
that on hold and this machine is set on
hold<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.430> I'm<00:01:17.970> going<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.299> reduce<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:19.320> width

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
hold and I'm going to reduce the width

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.880 
hold and I'm going to reduce the width
of<00:01:19.740> my<00:01:19.799> row<00:01:20.159> by<00:01:20.670> two<00:01:20.869> stitches<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.860> a

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
of my row by two stitches so this is a

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.149 
of my row by two stitches so this is a
four<00:01:23.520> needle<00:01:24.060> short<00:01:24.570> road<00:01:24.810> decrease<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.710> I

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
four needle short road decrease and I

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.920 
four needle short road decrease and I
knit<00:01:26.369> back<00:01:27.619> it<00:01:28.619> knits<00:01:29.250> two<00:01:29.579> here<00:01:30.150> then<00:01:30.750> it

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
knit back it knits two here then it

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.200 
knit back it knits two here then it
comes<00:01:31.170> across<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.770> top<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.009> these<00:01:32.490> four<00:01:32.909> in

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
comes across the top of these four in

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.569 
comes across the top of these four in
the<00:01:33.900> previous<00:01:34.350> example<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.040> brought<00:01:35.280> another

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
the previous example I brought another

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.030 
the previous example I brought another
needle<00:01:36.000> out<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.540> avoid<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.869> hole<00:01:37.200> but<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:37.920> this

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
needle out to avoid a hole but in this

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.450 
needle out to avoid a hole but in this
example<00:01:38.549> I'm<00:01:38.820> going<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.180> wrap<00:01:39.860> so<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.280> was

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.360 
completes the shape is on the shoulder I
think<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:21.570> can<00:02:21.780> see<00:02:21.989> it<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.200> little<00:02:22.410> bit<00:02:22.680> but<00:02:23.280> it

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
think you can see it a little bit but it

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.670 
think you can see it a little bit but it
will<00:02:23.489> show<00:02:23.700> up<00:02:23.880> much<00:02:24.120> better<00:02:24.510> after<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:25.410> need<00:02:25.650> a

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
will show up much better after I need a

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.180 
will show up much better after I need a
few<00:02:25.920> years<00:02:26.220> few<00:02:26.850> rows<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.450> wasting<00:02:28.410> so<00:02:29.130> I'm

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
few years few rows of wasting so I'm

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.140 
few years few rows of wasting so I'm
going<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.489> cut<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.819> yarn<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:31.790> I'm<00:02:32.790> going<00:02:33.060> to

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
going to cut the yarn and I'm going to

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.809 
going to cut the yarn and I'm going to
thread<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:33.750> darker<00:02:34.290> purple<00:02:34.830> yarn<00:02:36.800> and<00:02:37.819> put

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
thread this darker purple yarn and put

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.580 
thread this darker purple yarn and put
some<00:02:39.000> lace<00:02:39.209> knitting<00:02:39.569> on<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.110> take<00:02:40.319> it<00:02:40.350> off

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
some lace knitting on and take it off

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.650 
some lace knitting on and take it off
the<00:02:40.769> machine<00:02:41.000> hold<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.150> in<00:02:42.269> front<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.540> the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
the machine hold it in front of the

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.380 
the machine hold it in front of the
camera<00:02:43.230> so<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:44.220> it's<00:02:44.489> easy<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.910> see<00:02:45.209> the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
camera so that it's easy to see the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.930 
camera so that it's easy to see the
slope<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:46.440> machine<00:02:46.860> has<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.340> be<00:02:47.459> put<00:02:47.700> in

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
slope the machine has to be put in

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.410 
slope the machine has to be put in
normal<00:02:48.930> instead<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:49.560> hold<00:02:49.860> setting<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:51.239> knit

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
normal instead of hold setting to knit

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.830 
normal instead of hold setting to knit
all<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.630> stitches<00:02:53.030> if<00:02:54.030> I<00:02:54.239> had<00:02:54.480> inadvertently

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
all the stitches if I had inadvertently

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.740 
all the stitches if I had inadvertently
left<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.739> in<00:02:55.860> a<00:02:55.890> hold<00:02:56.190> position<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:57.120> would<00:02:57.540> have

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
left it in a hold position it would have

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.140 
left it in a hold position it would have
just<00:02:58.250> knitted<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.370> ones<00:02:59.579> that<00:02:59.820> we're<00:02:59.940> back

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
just knitted the ones that we're back

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:07.520 
just knitted the ones that we're back
and<00:03:00.510> skipped<00:03:00.870> over<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.230> ones<00:03:01.410> on<00:03:01.620> top<00:03:05.989> and<00:03:06.989> now

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
and skipped over the ones on top and now

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.430 
and skipped over the ones on top and now
I'm<00:03:07.620> going<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:07.950> take<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.310> pins<00:03:08.640> off<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.440> I'm

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
I'm going to take the pins off and I'm

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:22.000 
I'm going to take the pins off and I'm
going<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.769> show<00:03:11.359> the<00:03:12.359> slope<00:03:12.720> that<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.049> created

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.360 

so<00:03:23.010> here<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.519> the<00:03:23.790> shoulder<00:03:24.090> shape<00:03:25.190> using<00:03:26.190> the

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
so here is the shoulder shape using the

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.910 
so here is the shoulder shape using the
second<00:03:26.910> method<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.840> let<00:03:28.290> me<00:03:28.410> turn<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:28.800> over

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
second method and let me turn it over

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.110 
second method and let me turn it over
and<00:03:29.099> show<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.670> on<00:03:29.849> the<00:03:30.000> stockinette<00:03:30.629> side<00:03:31.230> I

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
and show it on the stockinette side I

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.869 
and show it on the stockinette side I
think<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.450> with<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.959> little<00:03:34.230> stripes<00:03:34.879> that

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
think that with the little stripes that

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.080 
think that with the little stripes that
were<00:03:36.060> created<00:03:36.569> by<00:03:36.750> using<00:03:37.200> a<00:03:37.500> variegated<00:03:37.920> yarn

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
were created by using a variegated yarn

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.930 
were created by using a variegated yarn
you<00:03:39.090> can<00:03:39.120> really<00:03:39.750> see<00:03:40.049> these<00:03:40.920> rows<00:03:41.310> getting

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
you can really see these rows getting

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.890 
you can really see these rows getting
shorter<00:03:42.780> toward<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.349> top<00:03:44.180> so<00:03:45.180> that<00:03:45.360> is<00:03:45.540> short

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
shorter toward the top so that is short

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
shorter toward the top so that is short
row<00:03:46.080> shaping<00:03:46.440> of<00:03:46.910> shoulder
