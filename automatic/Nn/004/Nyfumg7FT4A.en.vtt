00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
chain from the hook so we have one and

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.170 
chain from the hook so we have one and
two<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.170> we<00:01:49.770> simply<00:01:49.979> turn<00:01:50.400> the<00:01:50.610> chain<00:01:50.850> around

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
two and we simply turn the chain around

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.050 
two and we simply turn the chain around
and<00:01:51.450> get<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.720> back<00:01:51.960> loop<00:01:52.560> only<00:01:52.909> that<00:01:53.909> is

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
and get the back loop only that is

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.429 
and get the back loop only that is
sticking<00:01:54.270> out<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> back<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:54.960> like<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.110> hump

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
sticking out the back it's like a hump

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.670 
sticking out the back it's like a hump
it's<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.040> top<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.640> sea<00:01:56.820> serpent<00:01:57.000> and

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
it's like the top of a sea serpent and

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.160 
it's like the top of a sea serpent and
basically<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.950> are<00:01:59.070> going<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.430> use<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.170> loop

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
basically you are going to use that loop

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.530 
basically you are going to use that loop
all<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:01.979> way<00:02:02.340> across<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:02.909> once<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.240> turn<00:02:03.420> it

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
all the way across so once you turn it

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.149 
all the way across so once you turn it
over<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.869> can<00:02:03.930> see<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.470> back<00:02:04.649> loops<00:02:04.950> are

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
over you can see that the back loops are

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.969 
over you can see that the back loops are
just<00:02:05.579> popping<00:02:06.210> out<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.600> it's<00:02:07.320> really<00:02:07.649> quick

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
on the back loops of your chain going

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.750 
on the back loops of your chain going
all<00:02:13.169> the<00:02:13.379> way<00:02:13.409> back<00:02:13.529> to<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.249> beginning

cross-stitch element right away unlike

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.180 
cross-stitch element right away unlike
some<00:02:22.200> of<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.319> other<00:02:22.470> stitch<00:02:22.709> occasion

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
some of the other stitch occasion

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.740 
some of the other stitch occasion
Afghans<00:02:23.549> while<00:02:23.760> we<00:02:23.879> have<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.239> build<00:02:24.450> up<00:02:24.629> the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
Afghans while we have to build up the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.080 
Afghans while we have to build up the
layers<00:02:24.780> in<00:02:25.409> order<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.739> start<00:02:26.129> this<00:02:26.580> one<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:26.879> not

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
layers in order to start this one is not

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.880 
layers in order to start this one is not
one<00:02:27.239> of<00:02:27.269> them<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:28.110> let's<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:28.440> begin<00:02:28.709> we're

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
one of them so let's that begin we're

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.280 
one of them so let's that begin we're
going<00:02:29.099> to<00:02:29.220> chain<00:02:29.459> three<00:02:29.730> one<00:02:30.180> two<00:02:30.840> three<00:02:30.870> and

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
going to chain three one two three and

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.289 
going to chain three one two three and
this<00:02:31.709> counts<00:02:32.010> as<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.250> double<00:02:32.670> crochet<00:02:32.819> in<00:02:33.180> the

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
this counts as a double crochet in the

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.530 
this counts as a double crochet in the
rules<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.780> crochet<00:02:34.709> we<00:02:35.519> are<00:02:35.670> going<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.150> skip

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
rules of crochet we are going to skip

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.380 
rules of crochet we are going to skip
the<00:02:36.959> first<00:02:36.989> stitch<00:02:37.799> and<00:02:38.190> we<00:02:38.670> are<00:02:38.819> going<00:02:39.120> to

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
the first stitch and we are going to

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.330 
the first stitch and we are going to
double<00:02:40.170> crochet<00:02:40.290> into<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.220> next<00:02:41.250> two<00:02:42.709> okay<00:02:43.739> so

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
double crochet into the next two okay so

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.039 
double crochet into the next two okay so
it's<00:02:44.519> just<00:02:44.640> very<00:02:44.790> easy<00:02:47.150> so<00:02:48.150> just<00:02:48.329> that<00:02:49.519> and

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
it's just very easy so just that and

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.539 
it's just very easy so just that and
this<00:02:52.049> is<00:02:52.260> where<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.739> gets<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:53.129> little<00:02:53.160> more

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
this is where it gets a little more

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.369 
this is where it gets a little more
interesting<00:02:54.030> because<00:02:54.209> it's<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.019> way<00:02:55.170> that

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
interesting because it's the way that

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.199 
interesting because it's the way that
you<00:02:55.470> access<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:56.069> is<00:02:56.250> slightly<00:02:56.519> different<00:02:56.819> than

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
you access it is slightly different than

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.930 
you access it is slightly different than
what<00:02:57.390> I'm<00:02:57.480> used<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.799> so<00:02:58.799> we<00:02:58.980> have<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.340> come<00:02:59.700> back

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
what I'm used to so we have to come back

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.330 
what I'm used to so we have to come back
to<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.329> stitch<00:03:00.599> that<00:03:00.629> we<00:03:01.019> skipped<00:03:01.500> so<00:03:02.250> in

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
to the stitch that we skipped so in

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.830 
to the stitch that we skipped so in
order<00:03:02.459> to<00:03:02.640> do<00:03:02.760> this<00:03:02.879> we<00:03:03.060> have<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.209> wrap<00:03:03.480> first

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
order to do this we have to wrap first

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.880 
order to do this we have to wrap first
and<00:03:04.170> we<00:03:04.859> have<00:03:05.069> to<00:03:05.250> come<00:03:05.819> back<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.480> come<00:03:07.319> in<00:03:07.560> to

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
and we have to come back and come in to

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.849 
and we have to come back and come in to
the<00:03:08.010> gapping<00:03:08.400> space<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:08.940> pop<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:10.409> hook<00:03:10.650> out

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
the gapping space and pop the hook out

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.130 
the gapping space and pop the hook out
through<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.370> front<00:03:11.640> so<00:03:12.239> I<00:03:12.269> basically<00:03:12.720> see<00:03:13.019> how

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
through the front so I basically see how

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.569 
through the front so I basically see how
it<00:03:13.260> went<00:03:13.379> into<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.769> gap<00:03:14.069> and<00:03:14.310> then<00:03:14.400> just

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
it went into that gap and then just

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.449 
it went into that gap and then just
popped<00:03:14.819> it<00:03:15.030> through<00:03:15.989> to<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.379> stitch<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:16.890> then

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
popped it through to the stitch and then

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.750 
popped it through to the stitch and then
we<00:03:17.640> double<00:03:17.909> crochet<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:19.190> this<00:03:20.190> one<00:03:20.430> here<00:03:20.730> is

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
we double crochet and this one here is

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.199 
we double crochet and this one here is
the<00:03:21.090> cross<00:03:21.359> that<00:03:21.390> will<00:03:21.870> leaning<00:03:22.349> over<00:03:23.060> so<00:03:24.060> we

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
the cross that will leaning over so we

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.120 
the cross that will leaning over so we
immediately<00:03:24.389> skipped<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.109> first<00:03:25.139> next

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
immediately skipped the first next

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.030 
immediately skipped the first next
stitch<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:26.579> then<00:03:26.880> we<00:03:27.060> just<00:03:27.269> go<00:03:27.569> into<00:03:27.750> the

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
stitch and then we just go into the

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.690 
stitch and then we just go into the
second<00:03:29.040> for<00:03:29.549> a<00:03:29.579> double<00:03:30.000> crochet<00:03:31.519> just<00:03:32.519> like

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
second for a double crochet just like

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.750 
second for a double crochet just like
this<00:03:33.590> so<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.680> next<00:03:34.859> two<00:03:35.040> are<00:03:35.129> double<00:03:35.400> crochets

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
this so the next two are double crochets

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.150 
this so the next two are double crochets
and<00:03:36.000> then<00:03:36.200> we<00:03:37.200> have<00:03:37.379> to<00:03:37.530> come<00:03:37.680> back<00:03:37.859> to<00:03:38.040> the

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
and then we have to come back to the

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.970 
and then we have to come back to the
stitch<00:03:38.400> again<00:03:38.579> so<00:03:39.299> we<00:03:39.419> just<00:03:39.599> wrap<00:03:39.930> come<00:03:40.829> it

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
stitch again so we just wrap come it

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.800 
stitch again so we just wrap come it
through<00:03:41.250> into<00:03:41.609> the<00:03:41.700> gap<00:03:41.879> space<00:03:42.209> out<00:03:42.450> through

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
through into the gap space out through

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.099 
through into the gap space out through
the<00:03:42.900> front<00:03:43.250> wrap<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:45.060> then<00:03:45.329> pulled<00:03:45.870> through

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
the front wrap and then pulled through

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.439 
the front wrap and then pulled through
and<00:03:46.349> do<00:03:46.560> your<00:03:46.709> regular<00:03:47.040> double<00:03:47.340> crochets<00:03:47.699> so

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
and do your regular double crochets so

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.659 
and do your regular double crochets so
again<00:03:48.780> so<00:03:49.139> restart<00:03:49.709> we<00:03:49.889> skip<00:03:50.129> the<00:03:50.250> first<00:03:50.430> one

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
again so restart we skip the first one

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:58.430 
again so restart we skip the first one
double<00:03:51.090> crochet<00:03:51.419> into<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.660> next<00:03:51.690> two<00:03:57.440> okay

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
double crochet into the next two okay

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.650 
double crochet into the next two okay
and<00:03:58.650> then<00:03:58.919> we<00:03:59.069> come<00:03:59.519> back<00:03:59.549> to<00:03:59.760> the<00:04:00.120> stitch<00:04:00.389> that

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
and then we come back to the stitch that

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.589 
and then we come back to the stitch that
we<00:04:01.440> skipped<00:04:01.680> come<00:04:02.370> into<00:04:02.849> the<00:04:02.970> gapping<00:04:03.389> out

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
we skipped come into the gapping out

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.240 
we skipped come into the gapping out
through<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.079> front

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.790 

double<00:04:08.940> crochet<00:04:09.090> so<00:04:09.960> that<00:04:10.140> double<00:04:10.470> crochet

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
double crochet so that double crochet

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.630 
double crochet so that double crochet
forces<00:04:11.700> itself<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.450> turn<00:04:12.660> over<00:04:13.050> onto<00:04:13.320> an<00:04:13.860> angle

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
forces itself to turn over onto an angle

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.690 
forces itself to turn over onto an angle
as<00:04:14.790> a<00:04:14.820> result<00:04:15.330> of<00:04:15.510> just<00:04:16.190> basically<00:04:17.190> crossing

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
as a result of just basically crossing

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.170 
as a result of just basically crossing
over<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.150> other<00:04:18.299> two<00:04:19.290> that<00:04:19.500> you<00:04:19.620> see<00:04:19.829> and<00:04:20.180> this

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
over the other two that you see and this

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.820 
over the other two that you see and this
is<00:04:21.390> how<00:04:21.570> you<00:04:21.630> simply<00:04:22.109> just<00:04:22.290> do<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.590> cross

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
is how you simply just do the cross

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.820 
is how you simply just do the cross
stitch<00:04:23.360> for<00:04:24.360> this<00:04:24.480> digication<00:04:24.870> Afghan<00:04:25.530> just

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830

stitch for this digication Afghan just
like<00:04:25.950> so<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:26.480> basically<00:04:27.480> it<00:04:27.840> looks

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
like so and basically it looks

something<00:04:34.440> that<00:04:34.470> I<00:04:34.590> thought<00:04:34.950> would<00:04:35.490> ever<00:04:35.730> be

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
something that I thought would ever be

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.520 
something that I thought would ever be
possible<00:04:35.940> because<00:04:36.540> I<00:04:36.750> forget<00:04:37.020> to<00:04:37.140> be<00:04:37.290> out<00:04:37.500> of

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
possible because I forget to be out of

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.920 
possible because I forget to be out of
balance<00:04:37.770> or<00:04:38.550> an<00:04:38.670> actual<00:04:39.000> fact<00:04:39.180> it's<00:04:39.600> in

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
balance or an actual fact it's in

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.840 
balance or an actual fact it's in
balance<00:04:40.140> and<00:04:40.530> it<00:04:40.710> looks<00:04:40.890> amazing

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
balance and it looks amazing

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.610 
balance and it looks amazing
we<00:04:42.270> continued<00:04:42.780> just<00:04:42.930> to<00:04:43.110> cross<00:04:43.350> stitch

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
we continued just to cross stitch

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.890 
we continued just to cross stitch
ourselves<00:04:44.370> across<00:04:44.669> and<00:04:45.120> very<00:04:45.270> easily<00:04:45.480> and

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
ourselves across and very easily and

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.720 
ourselves across and very easily and
when<00:04:46.440> we<00:04:46.530> come<00:04:46.710> back<00:04:46.890> where<00:04:47.370> I'll<00:04:47.430> be<00:04:47.550> at<00:04:47.640> the

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
when we come back where I'll be at the

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.070 
when we come back where I'll be at the
end<00:04:47.850> of<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.030> row<00:04:48.210> and<00:04:48.240> I'll<00:04:48.630> show<00:04:48.840> you<00:04:48.900> what<00:04:49.050> to

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
end of the row and I'll show you what to

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.080 
end of the row and I'll show you what to
do<00:04:49.290> next<00:04:49.320> because<00:04:49.770> we<00:04:50.130> only<00:04:50.610> are<00:04:50.880> going<00:04:50.910> to

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
do next because we only are going to

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.510 
do next because we only are going to
cross<00:04:51.360> stitch<00:04:51.660> on<00:04:51.919> every<00:04:52.919> other<00:04:53.070> row<00:04:53.340> we're

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
cross stitch on every other row we're

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.000 
cross stitch on every other row we're
not<00:04:53.640> cross<00:04:53.940> stitching<00:04:54.360> every<00:04:54.630> row<00:04:54.810> and<00:04:55.410> you'll

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
not cross stitching every row and you'll

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.890 
not cross stitching every row and you'll
notice<00:04:56.280> that<00:04:56.400> when<00:04:56.700> you<00:04:56.790> do<00:04:56.940> this<00:04:57.090> all<00:04:57.360> of<00:04:57.780> the

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
notice that when you do this all of the

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.450 
notice that when you do this all of the
cross<00:04:58.110> stitching<00:04:58.380> will<00:04:58.650> appear<00:04:58.919> on<00:04:59.010> one<00:04:59.220> side

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
cross stitching will appear on one side

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.700 
cross stitching will appear on one side
and<00:04:59.760> there<00:05:00.240> will<00:05:00.330> be<00:05:00.360> nothing<00:05:00.840> like<00:05:01.260> that<00:05:01.440> on

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
and there will be nothing like that on

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.159 
and there will be nothing like that on
the<00:05:02.010> back<00:05:02.190> so<00:05:02.820> let<00:05:02.970> me<00:05:03.600> check<00:05:03.780> the<00:05:03.900> end<00:05:04.020> of<00:05:04.080> the

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
the back so let me check the end of the

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:05.420 
the back so let me check the end of the
line<00:05:04.290> and<00:05:04.650> I'll<00:05:04.740> show<00:05:04.890> you<00:05:04.919> what<00:05:05.070> to<00:05:05.160> do<00:05:05.250> next

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
line and I'll show you what to do next

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.150 
line and I'll show you what to do next
so<00:05:06.240> I'm<00:05:06.360> just<00:05:06.510> finishing<00:05:06.690> up<00:05:07.020> the<00:05:07.560> row<00:05:07.800> here

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
so I'm just finishing up the row here

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.920 
so I'm just finishing up the row here
and<00:05:08.400> I'm<00:05:08.760> just<00:05:09.000> doing<00:05:09.180> my<00:05:09.300> two<00:05:09.360> double

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
and I'm just doing my two double

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.680 
and I'm just doing my two double
crochets<00:05:10.260> in<00:05:10.410> a<00:05:10.500> row<00:05:10.530> and<00:05:11.240> then<00:05:12.240> I'm<00:05:12.390> doing<00:05:12.600> my

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
crochets in a row and then I'm doing my

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.219 
crochets in a row and then I'm doing my
cross<00:05:13.140> and<00:05:13.820> if<00:05:14.820> your<00:05:15.030> math<00:05:15.240> is<00:05:15.450> done<00:05:15.690> right<00:05:15.930> you

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
cross and if your math is done right you

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.800 
cross and if your math is done right you
should<00:05:16.440> end<00:05:16.620> up<00:05:16.710> with<00:05:16.770> one<00:05:17.160> single<00:05:17.810> stitch

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
should end up with one single stitch

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.360 
should end up with one single stitch
left<00:05:20.180> and<00:05:21.320> mine<00:05:22.320> is<00:05:22.500> right<00:05:22.680> and<00:05:22.919> I<00:05:23.160> have<00:05:23.340> one

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
left and mine is right and I have one

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.260 
left and mine is right and I have one
left<00:05:23.820> and<00:05:24.120> it's<00:05:24.510> just<00:05:24.750> a<00:05:24.840> double<00:05:25.020> crochet<00:05:26.270> like

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
left and it's just a double crochet like

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.500 
left and it's just a double crochet like
this<00:05:27.560> and<00:05:28.560> so<00:05:29.250> basically<00:05:29.610> I've<00:05:29.910> done<00:05:30.120> my<00:05:30.270> cross

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
this and so basically I've done my cross

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.480 
this and so basically I've done my cross
stitching<00:05:30.900> all<00:05:31.020> the<00:05:31.050> way<00:05:31.140> across<00:05:31.440> and<00:05:31.830> now<00:05:32.280> I'm

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
stitching all the way across and now I'm
