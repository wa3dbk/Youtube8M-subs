or something where I can alter the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.650 
or something where I can alter the
signal<00:00:21.810> by<00:00:22.640> flicking<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.850> switch<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.359> boosting

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
signal by flicking a switch and boosting

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.109 
signal by flicking a switch and boosting
my<00:00:24.779> signal<00:00:25.140> or<00:00:25.199> anything<00:00:25.529> but<00:00:26.189> as<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.550> can<00:00:26.730> see

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
my signal or anything but as you can see

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:35.470 
my signal or anything but as you can see
that<00:00:28.400> oops<00:00:31.340> then<00:00:32.340> I'm<00:00:32.460> getting<00:00:32.610> fairly<00:00:33.120> decent

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
that oops then I'm getting fairly decent

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.740 
that oops then I'm getting fairly decent
signal<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.840> my<00:00:37.140> basement<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.739> got<00:00:38.640> about<00:00:38.850> three

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
signal in my basement I got about three

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.000

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
bars and I am on t-mobile so hopefully

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.360 
bars and I am on t-mobile so hopefully
you<00:00:44.789> know<00:00:44.879> they're<00:00:45.120> not<00:00:45.149> really<00:00:46.070> well<00:00:47.070> known

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
you know they're not really well known

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.690 
you know they're not really well known
for<00:00:47.910> their<00:00:48.239> service<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.289> their<00:00:49.410> their<00:00:50.010> bars

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
for their service and their their bars

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.150 
for their service and their their bars
but<00:00:51.120> um<00:00:51.300> I'm<00:00:52.079> going<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.469> try<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.649> see<00:00:52.949> if<00:00:53.039> this

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
but um I'm going to try to see if this

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.950 
but um I'm going to try to see if this
actually<00:00:53.219> works<00:00:53.610> or<00:00:53.940> not<00:00:53.969> hopefully<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.780> does

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
actually works or not hopefully it does

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.220 
actually works or not hopefully it does
cuz<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.500> barely<00:00:56.219> get<00:00:56.489> signal<00:00:56.699> anywhere<00:00:57.270> when

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
cuz I barely get signal anywhere when

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.520 
cuz I barely get signal anywhere when

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
hopefully this works hopefully we can

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.630 
hopefully this works hopefully we can
get<00:01:23.100> at<00:01:23.430> least<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.880> are<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:25.580> increase<00:01:27.500> so<00:01:28.640> it's

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
get at least the are to increase so it's

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.950 
get at least the are to increase so it's
going<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:30.000> kind<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.270> hard<00:01:30.479> trying<00:01:30.780> to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
going to be kind of hard trying to

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.310 
going to be kind of hard trying to
install<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.790> with<00:01:32.790> my<00:01:33.180> video<00:01:33.479> camera<00:01:33.689> here<00:01:34.140> so

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
install it with my video camera here so

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.740 
install it with my video camera here so
I'm<00:01:34.950> going<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.220> put<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.640> like<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.329> you

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
I'm going to put it on like that and you

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.640 
I'm going to put it on like that and you
can<00:01:36.930> see<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.909> still<00:01:38.909> here<00:01:39.299> not<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:40.020> don't<00:01:40.380> work

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
can see that still here not I don't work

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.380 
can see that still here not I don't work
for<00:01:40.680> antenna<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:41.700> 10<00:01:41.909> or<00:01:41.939> anything<00:01:42.360> like

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
for antenna I in 10 or anything like

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.510 
for antenna I in 10 or anything like
that<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.810> I'm<00:01:42.869> not<00:01:43.049> promoting<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.799> only<00:01:44.250> for

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
that so I'm not promoting it only for

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.630 
that so I'm not promoting it only for
worth<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.820> course<00:01:45.740> so<00:01:46.740> I'd<00:01:47.009> hopefully<00:01:47.430> that's

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
worth of course so I'd hopefully that's

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.020 
worth of course so I'd hopefully that's
good<00:01:47.880> enough<00:01:48.420> for<00:01:48.479> me<00:01:49.040> ok<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.399> as<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.670> can<00:01:50.790> see

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
good enough for me ok so as you can see

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.609 
good enough for me ok so as you can see
I<00:01:51.180> tena<00:01:52.159> label<00:01:53.159> says<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.640> not<00:01:54.200> touch<00:01:55.200> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
I tena label says to not touch the

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.330 
I tena label says to not touch the
backing<00:01:57.500> that's<00:01:58.500> what<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> instructions<00:01:59.100> say

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
backing that's what the instructions say

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.819 
backing that's what the instructions say
so<00:01:59.520> I'm<00:01:59.880> going<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.299> do<00:02:00.630> my<00:02:00.659> best<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.229> not<00:02:01.439> do

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
so I'm going to do my best to not do

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.100 
so I'm going to do my best to not do
that<00:02:03.320> ok

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
that ok

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:12.150 
that ok
a<00:02:06.360> little<00:02:07.360> corner<00:02:10.470> obviously<00:02:11.470> you<00:02:11.590> can't<00:02:11.920> see

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
a little corner obviously you can't see

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.540 
a little corner obviously you can't see
anything<00:02:12.370> but<00:02:12.580> there's<00:02:12.940> actually<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:14.550> little

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
anything but there's actually a little

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.280 
anything but there's actually a little
microchip<00:02:16.360> in<00:02:16.540> here<00:02:17.280> just<00:02:18.280> looks<00:02:18.970> like<00:02:19.060> one<00:02:19.450> of

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
microchip in here just looks like one of

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.550 
microchip in here just looks like one of
those<00:02:20.440> regular<00:02:21.780> chips<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:22.960> you<00:02:23.020> see<00:02:23.380> that

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
those regular chips that you see that

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.130 
those regular chips that you see that
you<00:02:23.680> stick<00:02:23.920> on<00:02:24.070> and<00:02:24.510> just<00:02:25.510> has<00:02:25.690> if<00:02:25.840> this<00:02:25.990> has
