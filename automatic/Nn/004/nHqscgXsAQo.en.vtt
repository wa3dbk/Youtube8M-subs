00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.710 
mascara the Maybelline one made my
lashes<00:02:56.170> a<00:02:56.799> little<00:02:57.340> more<00:02:57.489> clumpy<00:02:57.939> and<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.450> think

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
lashes a little more clumpy and I think

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.050 
lashes a little more clumpy and I think
you<00:02:58.840> could<00:02:58.989> only<00:02:59.260> do<00:02:59.950> one<00:02:59.980> coat<00:03:00.579> of<00:03:00.640> this

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
you could only do one coat of this

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.140 
you could only do one coat of this
mascara<00:03:01.480> whereas<00:03:02.409> the<00:03:02.829> cover<00:03:03.280> ground<00:03:03.519> mascara

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
mascara whereas the cover ground mascara

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.170 
mascara whereas the cover ground mascara
I<00:03:04.769> think<00:03:05.769> you<00:03:05.859> can<00:03:06.040> get<00:03:06.189> away<00:03:06.220> with<00:03:06.640> two<00:03:07.060> to

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
I think you can get away with two to

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.599 
I think you can get away with two to
three<00:03:07.420> coats<00:03:07.689> of<00:03:07.870> this<00:03:08.109> and<00:03:08.409> your<00:03:08.980> lashes<00:03:09.250> will

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
three coats of this and your lashes will

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.479 
three coats of this and your lashes will
look<00:03:09.760> really<00:03:09.790> really<00:03:10.180> nice<00:03:10.420> they<00:03:11.409> are<00:03:12.159> not

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
look really really nice they are not

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.110 
look really really nice they are not
clumpy<00:03:13.170> it<00:03:14.170> really<00:03:14.500> separated<00:03:15.099> my<00:03:15.250> lashes<00:03:15.489> and

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
clumpy it really separated my lashes and

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.619 
clumpy it really separated my lashes and
it<00:03:16.750> gave<00:03:17.079> them<00:03:17.290> a<00:03:17.349> lot<00:03:17.650> of<00:03:17.680> length<00:03:18.099> and<00:03:18.629> some

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
it gave them a lot of length and some

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.039 
it gave them a lot of length and some
volume<00:03:20.109> so<00:03:20.909> so<00:03:21.909> far<00:03:22.090> looks<00:03:22.359> really<00:03:22.599> good<00:03:22.780> I

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.040 
going to try to compare these two
mascaras<00:04:58.300> I<00:05:00.120> think<00:05:01.120> if<00:05:01.389> you're<00:05:01.720> the<00:05:01.870> type<00:05:02.020> of

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
mascaras I think if you're the type of

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.790 
mascaras I think if you're the type of
person<00:05:02.139> that<00:05:02.500> likes<00:05:02.800> more<00:05:03.160> of<00:05:03.190> a<00:05:03.520> clunkier

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
person that likes more of a clunkier

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.860 
person that likes more of a clunkier
look<00:05:05.800> to<00:05:06.160> your<00:05:06.280> lashes<00:05:06.580> and<00:05:07.180> you<00:05:07.270> like<00:05:07.449> them<00:05:07.660> to

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
look to your lashes and you like them to

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.710 
look to your lashes and you like them to
look<00:05:07.900> more<00:05:08.080> like<00:05:09.180> you're<00:05:10.180> wearing<00:05:10.360> false

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
look more like you're wearing false
