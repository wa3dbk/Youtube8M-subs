00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.220 
so I feel like that stuff that they're
doing<00:00:46.649> here<00:00:47.360> you<00:00:48.360> know<00:00:48.390> obviously<00:00:48.750> skating<00:00:49.170> a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
doing here you know obviously skating a

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.080 
doing here you know obviously skating a
super-fun<00:00:49.710> aspect<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.670> if<00:00:50.969> they

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
super-fun aspect of it and if they

super-fun aspect of it and if they
really<00:00:51.780> take<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.289> maybe<00:00:52.530> they<00:00:52.680> can<00:00:52.860> get

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
really take to it maybe they can get

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.010 
really take to it maybe they can get
better<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.820> have<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> future<00:00:54.360> here<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.719> skating

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
better and have a future here in skating

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.319 
better and have a future here in skating
itself<00:00:55.440> but<00:00:56.129> for<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.460> most<00:00:56.640> part<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.940> feel<00:00:56.969> like

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
itself but for the most part I feel like

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.700 
itself but for the most part I feel like
skating<00:00:57.629> teaches<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.320> many<00:00:58.379> other<00:00:58.649> things

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
skating teaches you so many other things

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.389 
skating teaches you so many other things
about<00:00:59.219> self-confidence<00:00:59.969> about<00:01:01.399> perseverance

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
about self-confidence about perseverance

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.579 
about self-confidence about perseverance
about<00:01:02.579> determination<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.690> also<00:01:04.260> about

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
about determination and also about

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:12.210 
about determination and also about
believing<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.369> yourself

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.300 

I<00:01:12.340> think<00:01:13.180> that<00:01:13.330> there<00:01:13.600> are<00:01:13.980> huge<00:01:14.980> challenges

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
I think that there are huge challenges

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.330 
I think that there are huge challenges
for<00:01:16.060> women<00:01:16.870> in<00:01:17.050> Cambodia<00:01:17.950> and<00:01:18.130> there's

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
for women in Cambodia and there's

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.460 
for women in Cambodia and there's
there's<00:01:18.850> a<00:01:18.910> long<00:01:19.090> way<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.300> go<00:01:19.570> I<00:01:19.810> think<00:01:19.990> sport

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
there's a long way to go I think sport

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.090 
there's a long way to go I think sport
can<00:01:20.770> play<00:01:21.070> a<00:01:21.400> very<00:01:21.730> important<00:01:22.360> role<00:01:22.450> in

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
can play a very important role in

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.820 
can play a very important role in
creating<00:01:24.100> new<00:01:24.490> opportunities<00:01:24.780> giving<00:01:25.830> making

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
creating new opportunities giving making

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.740 
creating new opportunities giving making
them<00:01:26.980> feel<00:01:27.910> empowered<00:01:28.530> giving<00:01:29.530> them<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:31.090> sense

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
them feel empowered giving them a sense

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.610 
them feel empowered giving them a sense
of<00:01:31.930> confidence<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:33.220> then<00:01:33.970> that<00:01:34.660> hopefully<00:01:35.440> can

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
of confidence to then that hopefully can

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.920 
of confidence to then that hopefully can
be<00:01:35.770> applied<00:01:36.100> in<00:01:36.340> other<00:01:36.460> parts<00:01:36.850> of<00:01:37.030> other<00:01:37.570> parts
