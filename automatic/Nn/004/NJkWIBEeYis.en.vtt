00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
French studies is of national interest

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.539 
French studies is of national interest
and<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.750> also<00:02:00.990> opens<00:02:01.710> avenues<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.399> variety

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
and it also opens avenues to a variety

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.690 
and it also opens avenues to a variety
of<00:02:02.880> careers

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
of careers

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.240 
of careers
and<00:02:03.940> I<00:02:04.210> do<00:02:04.270> believe<00:02:04.570> that<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:05.320> MA<00:02:05.530> program<00:02:05.710> is

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
and I do believe that the MA program is

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.900 
and I do believe that the MA program is
more<00:02:07.000> and<00:02:07.270> more<00:02:07.510> showing<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:09.220> sign<00:02:09.550> of

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
more and more showing the sign of

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.750 
more and more showing the sign of

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
becoming an extra degree for a lot of
