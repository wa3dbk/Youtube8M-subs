00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:52.190
 15 dates this is a date that is going to 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.860
 turn into an average date candy 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.780
 cup of almonds and I put them to the 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.420
 blender to be crushed 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.360
 well and this we are going to use it to cover 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.280
 some of our apples for 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.970
 add flavor to these apples where 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.420
 use cinnamon and nutmeg a quarter of 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.789
 water apples you want, although there 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.039
 good friends first of all I'm going to 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:18.890
 explain how to make date candy 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:22.250
 and what you're going to do is that you're going to win 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.880
 your dates and you are going to put them 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:30.860
 in a container so filled filled with 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:35.590
 water and I left them approximately 8 to 9 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.590
 hours that is at night while they slept 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.130
 already in the morning they are ready and what 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.610
 you're going to do is make your date 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:49.180
 you take the seed inside for 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.149
 outside and what's left of the date you put it 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.649
 the blender is going to be filled and so 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.470
 these are the 15 dates they are going to fill 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.840
 then it will be easier to liquefy it and 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.479
 you are only going to put a fourth cup 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.229
 of water so that it is thicker 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.420

 refrigerator two to three hours for 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.010
