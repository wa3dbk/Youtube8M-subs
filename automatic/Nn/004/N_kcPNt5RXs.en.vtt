the right ball at the right time with

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.840 
the right ball at the right time with
the<00:03:04.870> right<00:03:05.020> line<00:03:05.500> because<00:03:06.010> it's<00:03:06.160> a<00:03:06.250> one<00:03:06.580> game

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
the right line because it's a one game

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:14.400 
the right line because it's a one game
match<00:03:11.430> that's<00:03:12.430> good<00:03:12.760> about<00:03:12.850> reaction<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:14.200> so

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
match that's good about reaction and so

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.080 
match that's good about reaction and so
tricky<00:03:14.710> because<00:03:14.980> we're<00:03:15.310> on<00:03:15.430> this<00:03:15.670> scorpion

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
tricky because we're on this scorpion

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.230 
tricky because we're on this scorpion
pattern<00:03:17.160> it's<00:03:18.160> breaking<00:03:18.640> down<00:03:18.670> this<00:03:19.090> is<00:03:19.180> the

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
pattern it's breaking down this is the

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.600 
pattern it's breaking down this is the
third<00:03:19.480> match<00:03:19.950> so<00:03:20.950> it's<00:03:21.070> much<00:03:21.220> different<00:03:21.370> for

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
third match so it's much different for
