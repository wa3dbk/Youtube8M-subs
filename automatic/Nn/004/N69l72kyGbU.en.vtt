00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
little brownish is because some of the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.289 
little brownish is because some of the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
more expensive and it takes forever for

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.140 
more expensive and it takes forever for
us<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.290> send<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.620> them<00:02:34.830> but<00:02:35.310> from<00:02:35.520> them<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:36.000> us

superb<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.180> fit<00:03:36.810> very<00:03:37.500> nicely<00:03:37.680> so<00:03:38.840> it<00:03:39.840> might

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
superb and fit very nicely so it might

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.520 
superb and fit very nicely so it might
be<00:03:40.320> about<00:03:40.560> this<00:03:40.799> size<00:03:40.859> actually<00:03:42.140> but<00:03:43.140> we'll

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
be about this size actually but we'll

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
25 even anyway it's gonna be about this

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:57.259 
25 even anyway it's gonna be about this
size<00:03:55.160> what<00:03:56.160> else<00:03:56.340> it's<00:03:56.700> about<00:03:56.790> it's<00:03:57.120> been<00:03:57.239> a

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
just never did a really good job in

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.700 
just never did a really good job in
sanding<00:04:42.720> the<00:04:43.720> backs<00:04:43.990> of<00:04:44.169> them<00:04:44.380> are<00:04:44.500> working

sanding the backs of them are working
them<00:04:45.009> too<00:04:45.190> much<00:04:45.370> so<00:04:45.729> I'm<00:04:46.060> sure<00:04:46.270> they've

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
them too much so I'm sure they've

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.629 
them too much so I'm sure they've
they've<00:04:46.990> messed<00:04:47.349> my<00:04:47.530> gums<00:04:47.740> up<00:04:47.949> quite<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.400> bit

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.499 
but I mean that that's error on my part
because<00:04:51.310> I<00:04:51.490> haven't<00:04:51.669> really<00:04:51.880> taken<00:04:52.150> the<00:04:52.330> time

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
because I haven't really taken the time

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.240 
because I haven't really taken the time
to<00:04:52.690> sand<00:04:53.139> them<00:04:53.259> down<00:04:53.440> that<00:04:53.620> well<00:04:53.830> I<00:04:53.860> mean<00:04:54.220> I
