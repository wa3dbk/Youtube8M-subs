00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
regained any power stering so the pumps

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.000

about<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.570> see<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.050> if<00:01:34.200> I'm<00:01:34.410> just<00:01:34.650> parked<00:01:34.920> it

you<00:02:34.379> know<00:02:34.500> hopefully<00:02:34.709> I<00:02:34.920> can<00:02:35.010> get<00:02:35.129> them<00:02:35.280> all<00:02:35.400> on

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
you know hopefully I can get them all on

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.039 
you know hopefully I can get them all on
the<00:02:35.610> bank<00:02:35.790> again<00:02:35.970> that's<00:02:36.480> my<00:02:36.599> goal<00:02:36.780> for<00:02:36.810> this

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
the bank again that's my goal for this

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.589 
the bank again that's my goal for this
event<00:02:37.319> but<00:02:37.620> my<00:02:38.310> cars<00:02:38.549> going<00:02:38.760> strong<00:02:39.120> we<00:02:39.480> had<00:02:39.569> a

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
event but my cars going strong we had a

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.970 
event but my cars going strong we had a
little<00:02:39.750> bit<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:39.959> a<00:02:40.049> problem<00:02:40.230> in<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.590> last

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
little bit of a problem in the last

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.130 
little bit of a problem in the last
couple<00:02:41.159> of<00:02:41.310> stages<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:42.269> we<00:02:42.450> broke<00:02:42.629> a<00:02:42.659> sway<00:02:42.930> bar

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
couple of stages and we broke a sway bar

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.720 
couple of stages and we broke a sway bar
link<00:02:43.379> so<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.739> car<00:02:43.920> was<00:02:44.010> just<00:02:44.069> under<00:02:44.489> steering

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
link so the car was just under steering

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.210 
link so the car was just under steering
a<00:02:44.819> little<00:02:45.000> bit<00:02:45.120> but<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:46.410> know<00:02:46.530> it's<00:02:47.040> pretty

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
a little bit but you know it's pretty

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.130 
a little bit but you know it's pretty
rough<00:02:47.489> out<00:02:47.610> there<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:48.060> it's<00:02:48.299> incredibly

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
rough out there and it's incredibly

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.930 
rough out there and it's incredibly
tough<00:02:49.410> so<00:02:49.680> I'm<00:02:50.160> very<00:02:50.340> happy<00:02:50.610> at<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.730> moment

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.160 

generating<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.030> National<00:02:54.390> motorsport<00:02:54.900> car

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
generating the National motorsport car

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.740 
generating the National motorsport car
is<00:02:55.349> performing<00:02:55.860> well<00:02:55.890> again<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:57.209> see<00:02:57.510> this

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
is performing well again you see this

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:27.020 
is performing well again you see this
made<00:02:58.079> my<00:02:58.379> study<00:02:58.829> break

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.470 

look<00:03:28.030> it's<00:03:28.210> pretty<00:03:28.540> tight<00:03:28.780> we've<00:03:29.140> got<00:03:29.460> veal

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
look it's pretty tight we've got veal

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.810 
look it's pretty tight we've got veal
Spencer<00:03:31.480> Eli<00:03:32.200> we'll<00:03:33.010> just<00:03:33.520> hang<00:03:33.610> it<00:03:33.700> on<00:03:33.790> the

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
Spencer Eli we'll just hang it on the

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.310 
Spencer Eli we'll just hang it on the
back<00:03:34.030> as<00:03:34.150> well<00:03:34.180> so<00:03:34.600> it's<00:03:34.720> a<00:03:34.810> really<00:03:35.050> tight

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
back as well so it's a really tight

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.520 
back as well so it's a really tight
tussle<00:03:35.560> two<00:03:36.250> stages<00:03:36.610> left<00:03:36.940> in<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.360> DAR<00:03:38.170> see<00:03:38.500> a

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
tussle two stages left in the DAR see a

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.740 
tussle two stages left in the DAR see a
lot<00:03:38.740> of<00:03:38.770> things<00:03:38.950> about<00:03:39.300> foot<00:03:40.300> probably<00:03:40.480> 30

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
lot of things about foot probably 30

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.390 
lot of things about foot probably 30
just<00:03:40.960> over<00:03:41.200> 30<00:03:41.380> formula<00:03:41.770> so<00:03:41.860> it's<00:03:42.010> going<00:03:42.100> to<00:03:42.190> be

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
just over 30 formula so it's going to be

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.310 
just over 30 formula so it's going to be
maximum<00:03:43.210> attack<00:03:43.450> for<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.750> ASE<00:03:44.290> so<00:03:46.170> like<00:03:47.170> the

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
maximum attack for the ASE so like the

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.810 
maximum attack for the ASE so like the
way<00:03:47.440> since<00:03:47.740> we<00:03:47.890> consider<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.400> new<00:03:48.520> face
