couple of minutes while we work on the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.600 
couple of minutes while we work on the
elastics<00:01:59.150> so<00:01:59.900> in<00:02:00.050> order<00:02:00.230> to<00:02:00.410> make<00:02:01.190> the

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
elastics so in order to make the

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.300 
elastics so in order to make the
elastics<00:02:02.480> I'm<00:02:02.750> going<00:02:02.990> to<00:02:03.110> be<00:02:03.230> taking<00:02:03.710> my<00:02:03.860> sour

trying not to get the other colors onto
the<00:02:21.170> ribbon<00:02:21.590> but<00:02:22.099> that<00:02:22.459> might<00:02:22.700> happen<00:02:22.940> it's

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
the ribbon but that might happen it's

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.270 
the ribbon but that might happen it's
not<00:02:23.599> a<00:02:23.720> big<00:02:23.900> deal<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.140> can<00:02:24.290> snip<00:02:24.769> it<00:02:24.890> off<00:02:25.010> later

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
not a big deal you can snip it off later

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.339 
not a big deal you can snip it off later
so<00:02:26.030> yeah<00:02:26.150> I'm<00:02:26.269> just<00:02:26.330> going<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.750> keep<00:02:27.050> cutting

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
so yeah I'm just going to keep cutting

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.130 
so yeah I'm just going to keep cutting

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
my pieces of the sour belts cut out here

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.380 
my pieces of the sour belts cut out here
and<00:02:36.349> now<00:02:36.769> we're<00:02:36.980> going<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.430> be<00:02:37.550> measuring<00:02:38.000> this

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
and now we're going to be measuring this

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.360 
and now we're going to be measuring this
them<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:38.930> size<00:02:39.170> in<00:02:39.590> order<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:40.069> make<00:02:40.220> the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
them to size in order to make the

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.270 
them to size in order to make the
elastics<00:02:40.930> so<00:02:41.930> what<00:02:42.349> we're<00:02:42.500> going<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:42.769> do<00:02:42.980> next

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
elastics so what we're going to do next

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.039 
elastics so what we're going to do next
is<00:02:43.640> you're<00:02:43.910> going<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.150> choose<00:02:44.269> your<00:02:44.840> color

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
is you're going to choose your color

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.350 
is you're going to choose your color
that<00:02:45.379> you<00:02:45.560> want<00:02:45.769> for<00:02:45.950> your<00:02:46.069> first<00:02:46.310> elastic<00:02:47.150> and

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
that you want for your first elastic and

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.020 
that you want for your first elastic and
then<00:02:47.840> around<00:02:48.170> these<00:02:48.470> two<00:02:48.739> pegs<00:02:49.099> you're<00:02:49.790> going

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
then around these two pegs you're going

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.920 
then around these two pegs you're going
to<00:02:50.150> cut<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.840> sour<00:02:51.440> belt<00:02:51.799> piece<00:02:52.190> to

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
to cut the sour belt piece to

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.360 
to cut the sour belt piece to
approximately<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.079> size<00:02:54.319> that<00:02:54.920> will<00:02:55.310> fit

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
approximately the size that will fit

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.370 
approximately the size that will fit
around<00:02:55.910> those<00:02:56.209> two<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:56.720> what's<00:02:56.840> using<00:02:57.110> a<00:02:57.170> pair

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
around those two and what's using a pair

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.309 
around those two and what's using a pair
of<00:02:57.410> scissors<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:58.209> then<00:02:59.209> you're<00:02:59.959> going<00:03:00.200> to

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
of scissors and then you're going to

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.300 
of scissors and then you're going to
hold<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.489> two<00:03:01.760> ends<00:03:02.360> of<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.780> candy<00:03:03.349> slightly

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
hold the two ends of the candy slightly

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.339

away<00:03:04.519> from<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:04.790> flame<00:03:05.180> now<00:03:05.720> you<00:03:05.780> don't<00:03:06.140> want

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
away from the flame now you don't want

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:07.960 
away from the flame now you don't want
to<00:03:06.470> burn<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.920> candy<00:03:07.340> you<00:03:07.400> don't<00:03:07.579> want<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.790> burn

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
to burn the candy you don't want to burn

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.910 
to burn the candy you don't want to burn
your<00:03:08.120> fingers<00:03:08.360> you<00:03:08.690> just<00:03:08.870> want<00:03:09.079> to<00:03:09.170> warm<00:03:09.680> up

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
your fingers you just want to warm up

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.460 
your fingers you just want to warm up
the<00:03:10.190> ends<00:03:10.549> of<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.760> candy<00:03:11.209> in<00:03:11.329> order<00:03:12.049> for<00:03:12.319> them

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
the ends of the candy in order for them

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.220 
the ends of the candy in order for them
to<00:03:12.500> slightly<00:03:13.280> start<00:03:13.760> to<00:03:13.910> soften<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.510> melt<00:03:14.569> so

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
to slightly start to soften and melt so

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.780 
to slightly start to soften and melt so
that<00:03:15.380> you<00:03:15.500> can<00:03:15.709> get<00:03:15.890> them<00:03:16.099> to<00:03:16.280> stick<00:03:16.549> together

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
that you can get them to stick together

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.780 
that you can get them to stick together
so<00:03:17.269> it's<00:03:17.510> about<00:03:17.660> five<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.349> ten<00:03:18.560> seconds<00:03:19.130> so<00:03:19.700> I'm

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
so it's about five to ten seconds so I'm

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.569 
so it's about five to ten seconds so I'm
just<00:03:19.940> going<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.269> hold<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.630> two<00:03:20.900> ends<00:03:21.260> together

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
just going to hold the two ends together

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.849 
just going to hold the two ends together
squeeze<00:03:22.579> them<00:03:22.850> together<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.540> we've<00:03:24.380> got<00:03:24.680> a

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
squeeze them together and we've got a

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.000 
squeeze them together and we've got a
solid<00:03:25.730> elastic<00:03:26.269> that<00:03:26.720> can<00:03:26.930> go<00:03:27.109> around<00:03:27.470> your

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
solid elastic that can go around your

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.340 
solid elastic that can go around your
first<00:03:28.340> set<00:03:28.639> of<00:03:28.670> pegs<00:03:29.030> so<00:03:29.780> I'm<00:03:29.930> going<00:03:30.139> to<00:03:30.200> do

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
first set of pegs so I'm going to do

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.920 
first set of pegs so I'm going to do
elastics<00:03:30.920> for<00:03:31.130> all<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.880> pegs<00:03:32.120> I'm<00:03:32.540> going<00:03:32.840> to

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
elastics for all the pegs I'm going to

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.910 
elastics for all the pegs I'm going to
do<00:03:33.019> red<00:03:33.380> green<00:03:34.160> and<00:03:34.489> some<00:03:35.150> blue<00:03:35.600> so<00:03:36.440> I've<00:03:36.620> put

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
do red green and some blue so I've put

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.000 
do red green and some blue so I've put
my<00:03:36.950> red<00:03:37.400> and<00:03:37.430> my<00:03:38.060> blue<00:03:38.359> elastics<00:03:39.049> down<00:03:39.350> but<00:03:39.889> if

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
my red and my blue elastics down but if

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.460 
my red and my blue elastics down but if
you're<00:03:40.130> not<00:03:40.250> familiar<00:03:40.549> with<00:03:40.850> making<00:03:41.359> a<00:03:41.720> like<00:03:42.440> a

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
you're not familiar with making a like a
