see<00:01:12.299> how<00:01:12.360> mine's<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.689> little<00:01:12.869> bit<00:01:12.960> bent<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.500> a

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
see how mine's a little bit bent it's a

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.800 
see how mine's a little bit bent it's a
little<00:01:13.770> extra<00:01:14.010> twisted<00:01:14.729> that's<00:01:15.390> because<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
little extra twisted that's because the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.330 
little extra twisted that's because the
rope<00:01:16.470> broke<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.909> won't<00:01:18.090> back<00:01:18.360> up<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:22.340> next

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
rope broke and it won't back up in next

you're going to want to actually unwind

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:33.320 
you're going to want to actually unwind
the<00:01:26.070> string<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:27.150> old<00:01:27.360> string

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.410 

carefully<00:01:34.330> as<00:01:34.510> to<00:01:35.020> not<00:01:36.000> do<00:01:37.000> any<00:01:37.150> more<00:01:37.360> damage

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
carefully as to not do any more damage

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.370 
carefully as to not do any more damage
as<00:01:38.140> you<00:01:38.350> can<00:01:38.470> see<00:01:38.620> mine<00:01:39.840> really<00:01:40.840> broke<00:01:41.080> when<00:01:41.290> it

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
as you can see mine really broke when it

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.660 
as you can see mine really broke when it
broke<00:01:41.590> it<00:01:41.830> just<00:01:42.040> let<00:01:42.490> go<00:01:42.670> all<00:01:42.820> of<00:01:42.970> a<00:01:43.060> sudden<00:01:43.470> but

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
broke it just let go all of a sudden but

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.890 
broke it just let go all of a sudden but
sometimes<00:01:45.670> you<00:01:45.850> have<00:01:45.940> to<00:01:46.060> cut<00:01:46.240> these<00:01:46.420> excess

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
sometimes you have to cut these excess

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.200 
sometimes you have to cut these excess
strings<00:01:47.290> out<00:01:47.520> because<00:01:48.520> they'll<00:01:49.030> actually

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
strings out because they'll actually

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.330 
strings out because they'll actually
fray<00:01:49.690> back<00:01:49.960> up<00:01:50.170> into<00:01:50.440> a<00:01:50.590> big<00:01:50.800> ball<00:01:50.830> like<00:01:51.310> that

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
fray back up into a big ball like that

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.810 
fray back up into a big ball like that
that's<00:01:52.090> what<00:01:52.240> happened<00:01:52.540> with<00:01:52.660> mine<00:01:53.729> what<00:01:54.729> you

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
that's what happened with mine what you

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.340 
that's what happened with mine what you
want<00:01:54.970> to<00:01:55.030> do<00:01:55.150> then<00:01:55.330> is<00:01:55.479> just<00:01:55.510> simply<00:01:55.990> pull<00:01:56.200> it

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
want to do then is just simply pull it

want to do then is just simply pull it
like<00:01:56.770> this<00:01:56.979> just<00:01:59.010> pull<00:02:00.010> it<00:02:00.130> along<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.580> rope

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
like this just pull it along the rope

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.350 
like this just pull it along the rope
and<00:02:02.440> get<00:02:02.560> all<00:02:02.680> just<00:02:03.640> pull<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.000> excess

and get all just pull the excess

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.630 
and get all just pull the excess
straight<00:02:04.960> up<00:02:05.080> alone<00:02:05.259> see<00:02:06.009> the<00:02:06.070> Rope<00:02:06.310> is<00:02:06.430> now

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
straight up alone see the Rope is now

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.859 
straight up alone see the Rope is now
back<00:02:07.540> to<00:02:07.570> its<00:02:07.840> normal<00:02:08.080> shape<00:02:09.540> from<00:02:10.540> here

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
back to its normal shape from here

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.620 
back to its normal shape from here
you'll<00:02:11.230> see<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.650> little<00:02:11.830> knot<00:02:12.420> just<00:02:13.420> simply

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
you'll see the little knot just simply

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.650 
you'll see the little knot just simply
want<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.810> grab<00:02:14.020> that<00:02:14.050> pull<00:02:14.920> that<00:02:15.070> out<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:19.600> then

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
want to grab that pull that out and then

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.850 
want to grab that pull that out and then
you<00:02:20.080> now<00:02:20.530> have<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:21.130> nice<00:02:21.580> clean<00:02:21.940> recoil<00:02:22.860> when

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
you now have a nice clean recoil when

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.920 
you now have a nice clean recoil when
you<00:02:23.920> get<00:02:24.100> your<00:02:24.250> new<00:02:24.370> rope<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:25.300> very<00:02:25.480> ends<00:02:25.840> of

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
you get your new rope the very ends of

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.979 
you get your new rope the very ends of
your<00:02:25.959> rope<00:02:26.290> need<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.040> be<00:02:27.160> seared<00:02:27.820> so<00:02:28.690> that<00:02:28.870> way

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
your rope need to be seared so that way

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.170 
your rope need to be seared so that way
they'll<00:02:29.170> stay<00:02:29.200> together<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:30.670> want<00:02:30.820> to<00:02:30.910> start

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
they'll stay together you want to start

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.660 
they'll stay together you want to start
by<00:02:31.750> feeding<00:02:32.170> one<00:02:32.770> into<00:02:32.980> your<00:02:33.100> rope<00:02:33.280> through

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
by feeding one into your rope through

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.310 
by feeding one into your rope through
this<00:02:33.820> hole<00:02:34.410> coming<00:02:35.410> back<00:02:35.620> up

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
this hole coming back up

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.039 
this hole coming back up
coming<00:02:38.320> around<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.650> here<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:40.480> feeding<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:40.840> up

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
coming around to here and feeding it up

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.430 
coming around to here and feeding it up
into<00:02:41.799> your<00:02:42.340> recoil<00:02:42.910> this<00:02:43.900> can<00:02:44.140> be<00:02:44.260> a<00:02:44.290> bit

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
into your recoil this can be a bit

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.850 
into your recoil this can be a bit
tricky<00:02:44.620> if<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.459> don't<00:02:45.640> have<00:02:45.760> your<00:02:45.850> little<00:02:46.060> paw

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
tricky if you don't have your little paw

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.960 
tricky if you don't have your little paw
if<00:02:47.860> you<00:02:47.950> don't<00:02:48.100> if<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.459> don't<00:02:48.489> feed<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:48.880> up

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
if you don't if you don't feed it up

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.030 
if you don't if you don't feed it up
through<00:02:49.000> here<00:02:49.330> properly<00:02:49.680> sometimes<00:02:50.680> it'll

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
through here properly sometimes it'll

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.770 
through here properly sometimes it'll
fray<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.430> rope<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:52.090> then<00:02:52.209> you've<00:02:52.330> got<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.570> cut

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
fray the rope and then you've got to cut

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.870 
fray the rope and then you've got to cut
it<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.170> sear<00:02:53.440> it<00:02:53.470> it's<00:02:54.070> a<00:02:54.100> good<00:02:54.280> idea<00:02:54.610> to<00:02:54.730> get

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
it and sear it it's a good idea to get

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.910 
it and sear it it's a good idea to get
about<00:02:55.180> an<00:02:55.330> extra<00:02:55.690> foot<00:02:55.989> of<00:02:56.080> rope<00:02:56.260> when<00:02:56.709> you<00:02:56.799> get

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
about an extra foot of rope when you get

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.949 
about an extra foot of rope when you get
your<00:02:57.100> rope<00:02:57.269> for<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.330> first<00:02:58.600> time<00:02:58.780> you're

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
your rope for the first time you're

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.780 
your rope for the first time you're
doing<00:02:58.989> this<00:02:59.290> just<00:02:59.739> so<00:02:59.799> that<00:02:59.980> way<00:03:00.100> if<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:00.640> do

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
doing this just so that way if you do

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.440 
doing this just so that way if you do
screwed<00:03:01.150> up<00:03:01.299> it<00:03:02.970> doesn't<00:03:03.970> require<00:03:04.330> you

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
screwed up it doesn't require you

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.570 
screwed up it doesn't require you
actually<00:03:05.019> having<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.320> go<00:03:05.440> out<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:05.799> buy<00:03:06.549> a

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
actually having to go out and buy a

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.180 
actually having to go out and buy a
whole<00:03:06.850> nother<00:03:07.060> rope<00:03:07.360> again<00:03:07.840> just<00:03:08.739> for<00:03:08.920> a

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
whole nother rope again just for a

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.100 
whole nother rope again just for a
simple<00:03:10.120> mistake<00:03:12.600> once<00:03:13.600> you<00:03:13.720> get<00:03:13.840> your<00:03:13.989> rope

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
simple mistake once you get your rope

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.710 
simple mistake once you get your rope
pulled<00:03:14.380> through<00:03:14.709> pull<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:15.670> into<00:03:15.910> a<00:03:15.970> knot<00:03:16.209> pull

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
pulled through pull it into a knot pull

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.259 
pulled through pull it into a knot pull
it<00:03:16.780> nice<00:03:16.989> and<00:03:17.019> tight<00:03:17.440> just<00:03:17.709> like<00:03:17.829> that<00:03:18.269> and

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
it nice and tight just like that and

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.410 
it nice and tight just like that and
then<00:03:19.390> pull<00:03:19.570> it<00:03:19.720> down<00:03:19.930> into<00:03:20.829> here<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:22.299> it

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
then pull it down into here and it

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.539 
then pull it down into here and it
should<00:03:22.690> tuck<00:03:23.350> in<00:03:23.500> there<00:03:23.620> nice<00:03:23.829> and<00:03:23.860> tight<00:03:24.250> you

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
should tuck in there nice and tight you

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.900 
should tuck in there nice and tight you
can<00:03:25.420> then<00:03:25.540> pull<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:27.040> see<00:03:27.310> how<00:03:27.370> it's<00:03:27.519> now<00:03:27.700> in

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
can then pull it to see how it's now in

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.870 
can then pull it to see how it's now in
there<00:03:28.799> you<00:03:29.799> then<00:03:30.070> want<00:03:30.579> to<00:03:30.760> actually<00:03:30.910> wind<00:03:31.360> it

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
there you then want to actually wind it

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.630 
there you then want to actually wind it
clockwise

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
clockwise

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:46.540 
clockwise
around<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.630> pulley<00:03:45.040> what<00:03:46.040> this<00:03:46.220> is<00:03:46.370> going<00:03:46.490> to

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
around the pulley what this is going to

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.260 
around the pulley what this is going to
do<00:03:46.760> is<00:03:46.910> it's<00:03:47.090> going<00:03:47.120> to<00:03:47.240> wind<00:03:47.600> up<00:03:47.750> your<00:03:47.930> rope

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
do is it's going to wind up your rope

do is it's going to wind up your rope
around<00:03:50.270> the<00:03:50.630> recoil<00:03:51.140> so<00:03:52.040> that<00:03:52.190> way<00:03:52.340> you<00:03:52.400> can

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
around the recoil so that way you can

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.900 
around the recoil so that way you can
set<00:03:53.630> it<00:03:53.780> back<00:03:53.900> down<00:03:54.170> into<00:03:54.350> position<00:03:54.530> and<00:03:55.130> lock

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
set it back down into position and lock

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.720 
set it back down into position and lock
it<00:03:56.090> into<00:03:56.210> place<00:03:57.040> you<00:03:58.040> want<00:03:58.220> to<00:03:58.280> leave<00:03:58.400> a<00:03:58.430> little

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
it into place you want to leave a little

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.650 
it into place you want to leave a little
bit<00:03:58.850> of<00:03:59.000> rope<00:03:59.150> out<00:03:59.450> here<00:04:00.320> so<00:04:01.280> that<00:04:01.430> we<00:04:01.580> when<00:04:02.540> you

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
bit of rope out here so that we when you

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.390 
bit of rope out here so that we when you
do<00:04:02.810> actually<00:04:03.050> get<00:04:03.350> this<00:04:03.500> set<00:04:03.770> up<00:04:03.800> that<00:04:04.280> it

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
do actually get this set up that it

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.350 
do actually get this set up that it
doesn't<00:04:04.750> bind<00:04:05.750> back<00:04:06.080> in<00:04:06.910> you<00:04:07.910> then<00:04:08.090> want<00:04:08.240> to

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
doesn't bind back in you then want to

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.330 
doesn't bind back in you then want to
slide<00:04:08.570> it<00:04:08.720> back<00:04:08.930> over<00:04:09.200> the<00:04:09.440> mast<00:04:09.650> make<00:04:10.190> sure

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
slide it back over the mast make sure

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.370 
slide it back over the mast make sure
the<00:04:10.459> rope<00:04:10.640> stays<00:04:10.940> tucked<00:04:11.300> in<00:04:11.510> from<00:04:12.080> the<00:04:12.170> side

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
the rope stays tucked in from the side

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.260 
the rope stays tucked in from the side
it<00:04:12.530> likes<00:04:12.709> to<00:04:12.800> do<00:04:12.890> that<00:04:13.130> you<00:04:13.730> can<00:04:13.880> fix<00:04:14.090> that<00:04:14.150> by

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
it likes to do that you can fix that by

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.400 
it likes to do that you can fix that by
just<00:04:14.630> pulling<00:04:14.810> it<00:04:14.989> tight<00:04:15.640> and<00:04:16.930> then<00:04:17.930> just<00:04:18.169> spin

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
just pulling it tight and then just spin

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:26.670 
just pulling it tight and then just spin
it<00:04:19.540> and<00:04:20.540> I<00:04:20.630> believe<00:04:20.989> it's<00:04:21.739> counterclockwise

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:38.790 

until<00:04:27.680> it<00:04:27.919> actually<00:04:28.040> catches<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:30.970> spring

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.739 

okay<00:04:39.849> now<00:04:40.849> once<00:04:41.120> it's<00:04:41.270> down<00:04:41.419> down<00:04:41.599> there

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:41.749 
okay now once it's down down there

back on it's always going to be this and

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.369 
back on it's always going to be this and
here<00:05:09.319> we'll<00:05:09.409> be<00:05:09.529> facing<00:05:09.770> out<00:05:10.069> and<00:05:10.550> the<00:05:11.379> spring

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:12.379 
here we'll be facing out and the spring

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:14.439 
here we'll be facing out and the spring
guide<00:05:12.590> is<00:05:12.860> going<00:05:13.009> to<00:05:13.069> go<00:05:13.159> against<00:05:13.400> this<00:05:13.639> so

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449 
guide is going to go against this so

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:19.860 
guide is going to go against this so
when<00:05:14.539> you<00:05:14.629> put<00:05:14.810> it<00:05:14.930> in<00:05:15.050> Bend<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:15.590> spring<00:05:15.949> back

it goes out and back up and back in

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.150 
it goes out and back up and back in
we're<00:06:17.270> then<00:06:17.419> and<00:06:17.539> put<00:06:17.659> our<00:06:17.750> nut<00:06:17.990> over<00:06:18.169> it

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.129 

this<00:06:22.160> knot<00:06:22.430> helps<00:06:22.910> to<00:06:23.060> hold<00:06:23.210> this<00:06:23.599> piece<00:06:23.840> in

this knot helps to hold this piece in

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:26.710 
this knot helps to hold this piece in
place<00:06:24.289> so<00:06:24.590> even<00:06:24.800> if<00:06:24.889> it<00:06:24.979> is<00:06:25.129> worn<00:06:25.610> it<00:06:26.479> will

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 
place so even if it is worn it will

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.629 
place so even if it is worn it will
still<00:06:26.990> do<00:06:27.169> its<00:06:27.319> job<00:06:27.530> just<00:06:27.919> simply<00:06:28.280> because

still do its job just simply because

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:32.290 
still do its job just simply because
it's<00:06:29.860> it's<00:06:30.860> tightened<00:06:31.370> down<00:06:31.400> to<00:06:31.849> that<00:06:32.030> piece

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
it's it's tightened down to that piece

that clip on the inside catches the
spring<00:06:40.879> it<00:06:41.810> pushes<00:06:42.229> that<00:06:42.349> piece<00:06:42.590> of<00:06:42.740> early<00:06:43.449> but

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:44.449 
spring it pushes that piece of early but
