levels but in a basic level I believe

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.410 
levels but in a basic level I believe
the<00:01:01.829> claw<00:01:02.039> hammer<00:01:02.280> style<00:01:02.609> will<00:01:02.879> result<00:01:03.270> in

the claw hammer style will result in
more<00:01:03.570> progress<00:01:04.110> more<00:01:04.350> quickly<00:01:04.710> than<00:01:05.489> any

of<00:01:12.930> increasing<00:01:13.439> difficulty<00:01:13.890> I'll<00:01:14.790> explain<00:01:15.210> a

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
of increasing difficulty I'll explain a

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.300 
of increasing difficulty I'll explain a
little<00:01:15.390> bit<00:01:15.720> about<00:01:15.780> each<00:01:16.140> level<00:01:16.409> here<00:01:16.770> but

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
little bit about each level here but

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.740 
little bit about each level here but
there<00:01:17.430> will<00:01:17.490> be<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.610> separate<00:01:18.060> video<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.720> each

there will be a separate video for each
of<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> techniques<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.890> different<00:01:20.430> levels

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
of the techniques and different levels

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.550 
of the techniques and different levels
that<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.299> can<00:01:21.479> view<00:01:21.689> when<00:01:22.200> you're<00:01:22.290> ready

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560

the level 1 arrangements are the most

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.719 
the level 1 arrangements are the most
basic<00:01:29.020> and<00:01:29.229> consists<00:01:29.680> of<00:01:29.799> only<00:01:29.950> individual

want to get a good grasp of this

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.530 
want to get a good grasp of this
technique<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:51.520> good<00:01:51.700> news<00:01:51.940> is<00:01:52.180> that<00:01:52.210> there

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
technique the good news is that there

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.969 
technique the good news is that there
are<00:01:52.600> many<00:01:52.750> different<00:01:53.170> level<00:01:53.440> one<00:01:53.590> clawhammer

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
are many different level one clawhammer

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.280

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
worry about learning any new techniques

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.190 
worry about learning any new techniques
until<00:02:00.910> you're<00:02:01.060> ready<00:02:01.210> to<00:02:01.420> move<00:02:01.600> on<00:02:01.840> to<00:02:01.869> the
