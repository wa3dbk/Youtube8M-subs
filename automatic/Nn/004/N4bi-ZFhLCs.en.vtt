the lowest strength over in here that

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.399 
the lowest strength over in here that
you<00:01:05.729> could<00:01:05.850> purchase<00:01:06.090> because<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:06.990> cheap

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
you could purchase because it's so cheap

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.980 
you could purchase because it's so cheap
and<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:08.610> way<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.060> make<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> hair

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
and the way that it make it and the hair

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.320 
and the way that it make it and the hair
itself<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.530> not<00:01:10.650> withstand<00:01:11.189> heat<00:01:11.790> very<00:01:12.210> well

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
itself is not withstand heat very well

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.080 
itself is not withstand heat very well
meaning<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.229> dries<00:01:13.470> out<00:01:13.680> really<00:01:13.979> quick<00:01:14.220> can't

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
meaning it dries out really quick can't

meaning it dries out really quick can't
put<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> lot<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.570> there<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.020> can't<00:01:16.229> do<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.439> out

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
put a lot on there you can't do it out

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.539 
put a lot on there you can't do it out
to<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:17.630> saga<00:01:18.630> I've<00:01:19.020> used<00:01:19.350> before<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:20.040> I've
