there

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.020 

webbings<00:02:18.799> a<00:02:18.920> little<00:02:19.159> short<00:02:19.489> and<00:02:19.670> that's<00:02:19.819> why

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
webbings a little short and that's why

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.970 
webbings a little short and that's why
it<00:02:20.180> makes<00:02:20.360> it<00:02:20.629> so<00:02:20.930> much<00:02:21.140> easier<00:02:21.200> that<00:02:21.620> this

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
it makes it so much easier that this

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.600 
it makes it so much easier that this
webbing<00:02:22.370> is<00:02:22.489> removable<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.420> replaceable<00:02:24.610> so

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
webbing is removable and replaceable so

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.729 
webbing is removable and replaceable so
that<00:02:25.819> we<00:02:26.530> can<00:02:27.530> add<00:02:27.829> and<00:02:28.099> subtract<00:02:29.560> long<00:02:30.560> and

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
that we can add and subtract long and
