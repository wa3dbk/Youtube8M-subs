00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.370
 3fm 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.859
 this week is the 3fm album of the week 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.599
 from sir go orphan 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.190
 john chasers hot plate you can get them 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.559
 of course teacher weather 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.940
 and actually the rest of the album is 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.170
 well worth it 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.789
 there is no nice place for everything 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.410
 listen in the car so I go with that 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.490
 you do the new already from circo 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.160
 to start we draw a natural 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.779
 that's calloway and calloway is right away 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.869
 a good entry listens 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.869
 with it 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.210
 I said it all such weigh student 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.200
 a child of 10 chad further the ex 3fm 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.879
 mega hit 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.860
 and then I was pull two on the album 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.269
 you think which one is it up again 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.590
 you immediately notice the snow again oh yes 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:45.590
 it's the b of great food 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.789
 it is and that they are already coming a bit 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.469
 little editors and then do them on one 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.760
 very smart way tension spring for example 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.739
 unfortunately this 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.010
 and loosely that is also what I think 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.859
 enter a festival 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.900
 with them all jumping and just warming up 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:08.710
 then point out laurens 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.710
 I see this happening 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.570
 donkey mono 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.040
 everything comes 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.680
 someone is funny but backside 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.710
 our this gives the line and that line 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.690
 about half of album on 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.830
 and that line that also seems a bit 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.540
 to say 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.460
 everything above the line there we are 100% 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.720
 behind those are songs that we whole 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.040
 wanted to make 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.420
 but yes we need those other fillers 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.800
 must have a few songs and 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.150
 which they all after the line 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.090
 color then comes towards the end of 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.830
 the album comes the lock-house god and that 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.759
 is something completely different than 40 dollars 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.759
 in 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.780
 all my top three should give then 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.120
 you would still be number 1 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.200
 t-shirt on two I have you too 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.450
 let's hear that was 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.310
 charge this and this is my number 3 pulled 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.000
 late is a great final agreement 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.000
 a great idea 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.940
 of course also really did not find it 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.980
 new album of about meat and yes me 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.860
 said it's fine it's a great album 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.480
 and I would have given it an 8 if it wasn't 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.459
 here and there was so repetitive 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.350
 fallen then i thought well this is one 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.030
 all really still the rest of the 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.980
 years of listening but I think now 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.570
 it is primarily a record to make sense 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.959
 get into the festival summer 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.410
 get our child in the festival summer 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.820
 final judgment 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.380
 for young chasers it is all of the 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.600
 week of approximately is true of this week as 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.080
 you ask me well-deserved 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.080
 fat 7
