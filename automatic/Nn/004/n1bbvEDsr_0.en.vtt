those OS muscle is actually attached

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.209 
those OS muscle is actually attached
from<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.840> lumbar<00:00:10.110> spine<00:00:10.170> goes<00:00:10.860> through<00:00:11.099> the

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
from the lumbar spine goes through the

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.100 
from the lumbar spine goes through the
hip<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.580> then<00:00:11.880> attaches<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.599> thigh<00:00:12.840> bone

hip and then attaches to the thigh bone
which<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.740> femur<00:00:14.070> bone<00:00:14.190> now<00:00:14.969> this<00:00:15.120> muscle

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
which is the femur bone now this muscle

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.240 
which is the femur bone now this muscle
can<00:00:15.690> spasm<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.260> get<00:00:16.500> tightened<00:00:16.859> quite<00:00:17.100> easily

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
can spasm and get tightened quite easily

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.490 
can spasm and get tightened quite easily
just<00:00:17.609> because<00:00:18.180> how<00:00:18.359> we<00:00:18.420> use<00:00:18.690> our<00:00:18.840> body<00:00:19.020> for

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
just because how we use our body for

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.200 
just because how we use our body for
example<00:00:19.590> driving<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.490> sitting<00:00:20.789> for<00:00:21.090> long

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
example driving and sitting for long

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.150 
example driving and sitting for long
periods<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.600> time<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.260> muscle<00:00:22.619> can<00:00:22.740> spasm

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
periods of time this muscle can spasm

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.070 
periods of time this muscle can spasm
and<00:00:23.310> get<00:00:23.550> tightened<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.090> obviously<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.930> can

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
and get tightened and obviously it can

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.080 
and get tightened and obviously it can
cause<00:00:25.230> some<00:00:25.410> pain<00:00:25.590> as<00:00:25.769> well<00:00:25.920> now<00:00:26.760> if<00:00:26.880> you're<00:00:27.000> an

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
a lot of times this muscle can spare

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.049 
a lot of times this muscle can spare
them<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.620> get<00:00:37.980> tightened<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.489> even<00:00:38.760> causes

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
tightens up it also can rotate the hip

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.729 
tightens up it also can rotate the hip
joint<00:00:44.489> now<00:00:45.180> by<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> rotating<00:00:46.140> hip<00:00:46.350> joint<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.620> can

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
joint now by a rotating hip joint it can

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.590 
joint now by a rotating hip joint it can
cause<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.250> lot<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.550> issues<00:00:47.730> for<00:00:48.239> example

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
cause a lot of issues for example

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.540 
cause a lot of issues for example
changing<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> way<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.770> use<00:00:50.010> your<00:00:50.160> body<00:00:50.250> so

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
changing the way you use your body so

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.090 
changing the way you use your body so
obviously<00:00:51.120> misaligning<00:00:51.870> spine<00:00:52.289> misaligning

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
obviously misaligning spine misaligning

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.430 
obviously misaligning spine misaligning
the<00:00:53.340> knee<00:00:53.489> misaligned<00:00:54.210> ankle<00:00:54.629> as<00:00:54.750> well<00:00:54.960> so

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
the knee misaligned ankle as well so

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.290 
the knee misaligned ankle as well so
it's<00:00:55.590> best<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.890> see<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> chiropractor<00:00:56.430> get

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300

just a little bit lower they burn about

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.820 
just a little bit lower they burn about
two<00:01:15.090> finger<00:01:15.360> breaths<00:01:15.570> then<00:01:16.350> put<00:01:16.530> your<00:01:16.650> body

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
weight onto the ball like so and you

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.859 
weight onto the ball like so and you
hold<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.250> position<00:01:20.430> for<00:01:20.909> about<00:01:21.000> 20<00:01:21.479> seconds

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
hold that position for about 20 seconds

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.649 
hold that position for about 20 seconds
or<00:01:22.320> up<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.770> eight<00:01:22.950> breaths<00:01:23.250> now<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.509> also

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
or up to eight breaths now you can also

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.899 
or up to eight breaths now you can also
it<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> muscle<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:25.950> there's<00:01:26.130> just<00:01:26.520> not<00:01:26.670> one

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
it is a muscle and there's just not one

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.060 
it is a muscle and there's just not one
point<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.720> also<00:01:27.990> pivot<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:28.680> that

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
point so you can also pivot on that

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.270 
point so you can also pivot on that
muscle<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.320> that's<00:01:31.320> quite<00:01:31.650> tender<00:01:31.920> already

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
muscle and that's quite tender already

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.819 
muscle and that's quite tender already
for<00:01:32.520> me<00:01:33.079> we're<00:01:34.079> gonna<00:01:34.200> hold<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.619> for<00:01:34.650> 20

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
for me we're gonna hold it for 20

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.580 
for me we're gonna hold it for 20
seconds<00:01:35.340> or<00:01:35.689> eight<00:01:36.689> long<00:01:36.960> breaths<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
seconds or eight long breaths and the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.280 
seconds or eight long breaths and the
muscles<00:01:37.979> should<00:01:38.159> release<00:01:38.720> now<00:01:39.720> it's<00:01:39.900> actually

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
muscles should release now it's actually
