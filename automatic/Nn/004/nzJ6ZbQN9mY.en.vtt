00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.290 
my blog now I always thought the

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.990 
my blog now I always thought the
funniest<00:00:19.619> thing<00:00:19.890> was<00:00:20.130> seeing<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.640> very<00:00:20.849> large

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
funniest thing was seeing a very large

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.560 
funniest thing was seeing a very large
person<00:00:21.869> by<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.320> bigmac<00:00:22.919> large<00:00:23.460> fries<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.180> top

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
person by a bigmac large fries and top

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.299 
person by a bigmac large fries and top
it<00:00:24.750> off<00:00:24.869> with<00:00:25.079> a<00:00:25.140> diet<00:00:25.500> coke

00:00:26.299 --> 00:00:26.309 
it off with a diet coke

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:29.030 
it off with a diet coke
now<00:00:26.520> I<00:00:27.000> also<00:00:27.419> found<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:27.989> peculiar<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.739> I

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.040 
now I also found it peculiar that I

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.400 
now I also found it peculiar that I
rarely<00:00:29.369> saw<00:00:29.759> thin<00:00:30.149> people<00:00:30.599> drinking<00:00:31.200> diet

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
rarely saw thin people drinking diet

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.260 
rarely saw thin people drinking diet
sodas<00:00:31.860> so<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.430> began<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.820> wonder<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.149> know

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
sodas so I began to wonder you know

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.090 
sodas so I began to wonder you know
could<00:00:33.719> there<00:00:33.870> be<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:34.020> link<00:00:34.350> between<00:00:34.530> drinking

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
could there be a link between drinking

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.880 
could there be a link between drinking
diet<00:00:35.280> sodas<00:00:35.850> or<00:00:36.000> diet<00:00:36.210> drinks<00:00:36.600> are<00:00:37.559> using

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
diet sodas or diet drinks are using

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.920 
diet sodas or diet drinks are using
artificial<00:00:38.219> sweeteners<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.910> obesity<00:00:39.239> well

artificial sweeteners and obesity well

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.229

as<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.469> began<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.980> explore<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.489> notion<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.999> came

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
as I began to explore this notion I came

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.060 
as I began to explore this notion I came
upon<00:00:42.359> a<00:00:42.660> number<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.469> different<00:00:43.800> research

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
to salivate in anticipation of food

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.569 
to salivate in anticipation of food
simply<00:01:33.630> by<00:01:33.810> ringing<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.320> bell<00:01:34.560> without<00:01:35.130> any

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
simply by ringing the bell without any

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.749 
simply by ringing the bell without any
food<00:01:35.939> at<00:01:36.210> all<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:37.170> think<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.710> diet<00:01:38.039> sodas<00:01:38.609> and

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
food at all so think of diet sodas and

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.090 
food at all so think of diet sodas and
artificial<00:01:39.509> sweeteners<00:01:39.750> are<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.740> ringing

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
artificial sweeteners are like ringing

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.580 
artificial sweeteners are like ringing
the<00:01:41.159> bell<00:01:41.490> for<00:01:41.520> your<00:01:41.939> physiology<00:01:42.659> but<00:01:43.350> why<00:01:43.530> is

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
the bell for your physiology but why is

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.459 
the bell for your physiology but why is
that<00:01:43.740> bad<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.549> why<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.149> even<00:01:45.689> worse<00:01:45.960> to

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
that bad and and why is it even worse to

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:48.260 
that bad and and why is it even worse to
ring<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.829> bell<00:01:47.070> with<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.880> artificial

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
ring the bell with the artificial

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.240 
ring the bell with the artificial
sweeteners<00:01:48.869> but<00:01:49.320> then<00:01:49.469> not<00:01:49.649> provide<00:01:49.979> any

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
sugar along with the Bell what happens

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:56.060

change<00:04:08.310> in<00:04:08.840> core<00:04:09.840> body<00:04:10.200> temperature<00:04:10.860> of<00:04:10.980> the

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
change in core body temperature of the

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.370 
change in core body temperature of the
rats<00:04:11.310> fed<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:11.850> artificial<00:04:12.510> sweeteners<00:04:12.870> their

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
rats fed the artificial sweeteners their

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.550 
rats fed the artificial sweeteners their
core<00:04:13.830> body<00:04:14.220> temperature<00:04:14.880> decreased<00:04:15.780> meaning

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
core body temperature decreased meaning

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.340 
core body temperature decreased meaning
their<00:04:16.709> metabolism<00:04:17.580> slowed<00:04:17.850> down<00:04:18.060> so<00:04:18.840> not<00:04:19.049> only

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
their metabolism slowed down so not only

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.190 
their metabolism slowed down so not only
did<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.220> rats<00:04:20.370> eat<00:04:20.729> more<00:04:21.120> gained<00:04:21.900> more<00:04:22.140> weight

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
did the rats eat more gained more weight

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.680 
did the rats eat more gained more weight
and<00:04:22.590> have<00:04:22.919> more<00:04:23.100> body<00:04:23.370> fat<00:04:23.490> but<00:04:24.390> they<00:04:24.510> actually

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
and have more body fat but they actually

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.890 
and have more body fat but they actually
also<00:04:25.410> lowered<00:04:26.070> their<00:04:26.580> core<00:04:27.000> body<00:04:27.270> temperature

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
also lowered their core body temperature

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.460 
also lowered their core body temperature
and<00:04:28.080> slowed<00:04:28.650> their<00:04:28.950> metabolism<00:04:29.640> and<00:04:30.479> as<00:04:31.320> I've

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
and slowed their metabolism and as I've

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.620 
and slowed their metabolism and as I've
said<00:04:31.650> many<00:04:31.860> times<00:04:32.010> before<00:04:32.490> all<00:04:32.910> calories<00:04:33.330> are
