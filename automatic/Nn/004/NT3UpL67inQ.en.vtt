it<00:02:11.450> should<00:02:11.720> work<00:02:11.930> I<00:02:12.280> tried<00:02:13.280> it<00:02:13.430> before<00:02:13.550> on

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
it should work I tried it before on

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.390 
it should work I tried it before on
other<00:02:14.450> projects<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.769> really<00:02:15.980> works<00:02:16.220> and

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
other projects and it really works and

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.320 
other projects and it really works and
once<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:17.480> have<00:02:17.660> this<00:02:18.010> so<00:02:19.010> your<00:02:19.910> caper<00:02:20.120> is

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
once you have this so your caper is

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.360 
once you have this so your caper is
ready<00:02:20.540> when<00:02:20.750> you<00:02:20.840> have<00:02:20.989> this<00:02:21.349> end<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:22.069> end<00:02:22.250> up

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
ready when you have this end the end up

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.910 
ready when you have this end the end up
goes<00:02:22.550> to<00:02:22.580> PlayStation<00:02:23.140> so<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.260> next<00:02:24.440> step<00:02:24.709> is

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
goes to PlayStation so the next step is

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.390 
goes to PlayStation so the next step is
just<00:02:25.540> why<00:02:26.540> you<00:02:26.569> have<00:02:26.989> HDMI<00:02:27.230> cable<00:02:27.980> connected

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
just why you have HDMI cable connected

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.089 
just why you have HDMI cable connected
connect<00:02:28.819> this<00:02:29.000> cable<00:02:29.060> as<00:02:29.569> well<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.080> then<00:02:30.739> this

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
connect this cable as well and then this

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.890 
connect this cable as well and then this
side<00:02:31.489> of<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.849> cable<00:02:32.239> you<00:02:32.299> connect<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:32.870> your

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
side of the cable you connect to your

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.500 
side of the cable you connect to your
speaker's<00:02:33.680> directly<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.670> from<00:02:35.420> the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
speaker's directly and from the

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.600 
speaker's directly and from the
technical<00:02:35.989> point<00:02:36.140> of<00:02:36.319> view<00:02:36.440> that's<00:02:36.890> all<00:02:37.190> they

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
technical point of view that's all they

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.920 
technical point of view that's all they
don't<00:02:37.670> have<00:02:37.849> to<00:02:37.970> make<00:02:38.120> some<00:02:38.390> changes<00:02:38.569> in<00:02:38.810> the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
don't have to make some changes in the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.229 
don't have to make some changes in the
PlayStation<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:39.769> you're<00:02:40.489> ready<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:40.760> go

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239

sub buffer and two small speakers so

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.440 
sub buffer and two small speakers so
from<00:02:50.810> my<00:02:50.959> computer<00:02:51.739> I<00:02:51.980> have<00:02:52.160> one<00:02:52.579> cable<00:02:52.910> that

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
from my computer I have one cable that

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.600 
from my computer I have one cable that
goes<00:02:53.480> to<00:02:53.750> my<00:02:53.900> computer<00:02:54.349> and<00:02:54.470> then<00:02:55.280> there<00:02:55.489> is<00:02:55.579> a

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
goes to my computer and then there is a

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.869 
goes to my computer and then there is a
to<00:02:56.090> lug<00:02:56.810> that<00:02:56.840> goes<00:02:57.290> to<00:02:57.440> my<00:02:57.590> son<00:02:57.829> buffer<00:02:58.220> so

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
to lug that goes to my son buffer so

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.660 
to lug that goes to my son buffer so
actually<00:02:59.480> I<00:02:59.660> don't<00:02:59.810> have<00:03:00.140> to<00:03:00.260> do<00:03:00.410> this<00:03:00.590> step<00:03:00.920> so

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
actually I don't have to do this step so

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.780 
actually I don't have to do this step so
in<00:03:01.879> fact<00:03:02.060> I<00:03:02.180> just<00:03:02.599> up<00:03:02.750> my<00:03:02.780> cable<00:03:03.610> for<00:03:04.610> me

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
buffer so on the sub buffer the cables

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.080 
buffer so on the sub buffer the cables
go<00:04:05.480> to<00:04:05.540> input<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.889> white<00:04:07.190> one<00:04:07.459> and<00:04:07.639> the<00:04:07.880> red

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.710 

at<00:04:22.280> this<00:04:22.520> moment<00:04:22.759> we<00:04:22.970> don't<00:04:23.000> have<00:04:23.180> any<00:04:23.419> sound

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
at this moment we don't have any sound

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.670 
at this moment we don't have any sound
