00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
and teasing it a little bit you can skip

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.649 
and teasing it a little bit you can skip
the<00:01:28.590> step<00:01:28.829> if<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.310> don't<00:01:29.579> need<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.360> extra

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
going back to the bottom so i start at

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.989 
going back to the bottom so i start at
the<00:02:26.049> base<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.590> curling<00:02:27.010> iron<00:02:27.159> and<00:02:27.549> i<00:02:27.700> wrap

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:29.970 
the base of the curling iron and i wrap
my<00:02:28.030> hair<00:02:28.450> all<00:02:28.659> the<00:02:28.689> way<00:02:28.900> around<00:02:29.139> to<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.769> very

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
my hair all the way around to the very

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.580 
my hair all the way around to the very
top<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.609> I<00:02:31.030> hold<00:02:31.269> it<00:02:31.450> there<00:02:31.629> for<00:02:31.659> about<00:02:32.019> three

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
top and I hold it there for about three

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.440 
top and I hold it there for about three
to<00:02:32.620> five<00:02:33.010> seconds<00:02:33.579> I<00:02:33.730> don't<00:02:33.939> actually<00:02:34.120> leave

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
to five seconds I don't actually leave

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.629 
to five seconds I don't actually leave
it<00:02:34.599> on<00:02:34.689> for<00:02:34.750> very<00:02:35.170> long<00:02:35.409> and<00:02:35.950> I<00:02:36.040> just<00:02:36.310> gently

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:36.639 
it on for very long and I just gently

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:38.550 
it on for very long and I just gently
release<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.180> clamp<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.659> kind<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:38.019> guide<00:02:38.319> the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
release the clamp and kind of guide the

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.890 
release the clamp and kind of guide the
curl<00:02:38.799> downward<00:02:39.579> I<00:02:39.849> think<00:02:40.299> it<00:02:40.419> gives<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.780> a

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
curl downward I think it gives it a

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.830 
curl downward I think it gives it a
really<00:02:41.169> soft<00:02:41.739> and<00:02:42.099> loose<00:02:42.549> spiral<00:02:43.180> which<00:02:43.659> I

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
really soft and loose spiral which I

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.209 
really soft and loose spiral which I
really<00:02:44.019> like<00:02:44.349> so<00:02:44.590> I'm<00:02:44.620> just<00:02:44.829> going<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.040> show

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
because it does give good hold and it

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.159 
because it does give good hold and it
does<00:04:50.039> keep<00:04:50.250> your<00:04:50.430> hair<00:04:50.610> really<00:04:50.789> volumize<00:04:51.479> so

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.529 
so now that all the hair is curled and
it's<00:05:11.800> all<00:05:12.039> done<00:05:12.310> I<00:05:12.460> like<00:05:12.639> to<00:05:12.819> go<00:05:13.029> back<00:05:13.210> in<00:05:13.389> and

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
it's all done I like to go back in and

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.110 
it's all done I like to go back in and
brush<00:05:13.810> everything<00:05:14.409> out<00:05:14.620> again<00:05:15.039> and<00:05:15.340> spray<00:05:16.090> it

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.179 
brush everything out again and spray it
with<00:05:16.210> some<00:05:16.360> hairspray<00:05:16.990> so<00:05:17.319> it<00:05:17.439> does<00:05:17.650> keep<00:05:17.919> the

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:18.189 
with some hairspray so it does keep the

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:20.999 
with some hairspray so it does keep the
shape<00:05:18.610> but<00:05:19.270> usually<00:05:19.749> this<00:05:19.960> doesn't<00:05:20.439> take<00:05:20.710> me

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009
