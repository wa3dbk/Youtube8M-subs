00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
color 1b because it is synthetic and I

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:54.690

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
synthetic units and I wasn't really too

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.150

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.590 
sure how this one the texture was and I
know<00:01:00.220> a<00:01:00.310> lot<00:01:00.489> of<00:01:00.520> times<00:01:00.790> synthetic<00:01:01.270> units

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
know a lot of times synthetic units

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.090 
know a lot of times synthetic units
especially<00:01:01.989> like<00:01:02.380> different<00:01:02.800> types<00:01:02.829> of

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
especially like different types of

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.819 
especially like different types of
styles<00:01:03.640> they<00:01:04.359> kind<00:01:04.719> of<00:01:04.780> look<00:01:05.019> like<00:01:05.049> shiny<00:01:05.560> or

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:05.829 
styles they kind of look like shiny or

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:07.109 
styles they kind of look like shiny or
they<00:01:05.979> might<00:01:06.130> look<00:01:06.340> a<00:01:06.399> little<00:01:06.549> more<00:01:06.759> fake

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
they might look a little more fake

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.090 
they might look a little more fake
depending<00:01:07.539> on<00:01:07.659> the<00:01:08.079> colors<00:01:08.439> that<00:01:08.619> you<00:01:08.740> get<00:01:08.920> so

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
depending on the colors that you get so

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.289 
depending on the colors that you get so
I<00:01:09.159> was<00:01:09.310> like<00:01:09.460> you<00:01:09.549> know<00:01:09.670> what<00:01:09.850> I'm<00:01:09.969> going<00:01:10.210> to

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
I was like you know what I'm going to

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.410 
I was like you know what I'm going to
stick<00:01:10.810> to<00:01:11.079> something<00:01:11.380> that<00:01:11.829> is<00:01:12.640> more<00:01:13.090> on<00:01:13.119> a

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
stick to something that is more on a

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.069 
stick to something that is more on a
neutral<00:01:14.229> kind<00:01:14.799> of<00:01:14.979> 1v<00:01:15.609> type<00:01:15.909> of<00:01:16.090> tone<00:01:16.329> because

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079 
neutral kind of 1v type of tone because

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:18.300 
neutral kind of 1v type of tone because
I<00:01:17.109> think<00:01:17.409> would<00:01:17.560> look<00:01:17.740> a<00:01:17.950> little<00:01:18.130> more

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
I think would look a little more

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.190 
I think would look a little more
realistic

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
realistic

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.330 
realistic
especially<00:01:20.200> when<00:01:20.289> I<00:01:20.319> did<00:01:20.590> see<00:01:20.799> like<00:01:21.039> the<00:01:21.189> way

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
especially when I did see like the way

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.700 
especially when I did see like the way
that<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:22.060> bags<00:01:22.329> and<00:01:22.659> stuff<00:01:22.840> are<00:01:23.079> shaped<00:01:25.499> and<00:01:26.499> I

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
that the bags and stuff are shaped and I

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.709 
that the bags and stuff are shaped and I
did<00:01:26.920> go<00:01:27.069> to<00:01:27.130> their<00:01:27.369> website<00:01:27.819> as<00:01:28.060> well<00:01:28.389> their

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
the tags like I normally do oh okay and

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.739 
the tags like I normally do oh okay and
the<00:01:48.340> next<00:01:48.369> thing<00:01:48.700> that<00:01:48.729> I'm<00:01:48.939> going<00:01:49.179> to<00:01:49.209> do<00:01:49.450> is

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:49.749 
the next thing that I'm going to do is

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:52.769 
the next thing that I'm going to do is
take<00:01:49.990> it<00:01:50.020> out<00:01:50.200> and<00:01:50.819> I<00:01:51.819> usually<00:01:51.969> don't<00:01:52.539> keep

00:01:52.769 --> 00:01:52.779 
take it out and I usually don't keep

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.719 
take it out and I usually don't keep
these<00:01:53.259> just<00:01:53.829> because<00:01:54.100> they<00:01:54.219> take<00:01:54.399> up<00:01:54.549> too<00:01:54.700> much

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
these just because they take up too much

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:55.199 
these just because they take up too much
space

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
space

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:58.589

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
they're there like virtually is none and

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.170 
they're there like virtually is none and
I<00:02:31.709> got<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.980> combs<00:02:32.220> in<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.550> back<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:32.940> didn't

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
I got the combs in the back I didn't

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.880 
I got the combs in the back I didn't
even<00:02:33.269> mention<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:33.989> you<00:02:34.140> got<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.440> two<00:02:34.680> at

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
even mention that and you got the two at

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.940 
even mention that and you got the two at
the<00:02:35.010> sides<00:02:35.310> as<00:02:35.700> well<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.410> one<00:02:37.410> actually<00:02:37.650> in

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
the sides as well and one actually in

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.309 
the sides as well and one actually in
the<00:02:38.040> middle<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.430> guess<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:39.239> it<00:02:39.360> doesn't<00:02:39.660> go<00:02:39.780> move

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
the middle I guess so it doesn't go move

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.729 
the middle I guess so it doesn't go move
back<00:02:42.620> so<00:02:43.620> here<00:02:44.190> we<00:02:44.400> go<00:02:44.640> well<00:02:45.630> here<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.049> goes<00:02:46.080> I

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739
