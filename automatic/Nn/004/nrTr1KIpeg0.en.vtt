then it would turn off by itself from

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:59.090

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
the lens and nothing happened so I just

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.350 
the lens and nothing happened so I just

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
thought was the battery but then when I

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.880 
thought was the battery but then when I
went<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.630> go<00:02:03.720> buy<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.869> battery<00:02:04.289> it<00:02:04.560> was<00:02:04.710> like

went to go buy the battery it was like
forty<00:02:05.340> dollars<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.940> I<00:02:05.970> didn't<00:02:06.210> want<00:02:06.330> to<00:02:06.390> pay

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
cute and um about watermelon for them it

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.580 
cute and um about watermelon for them it
was<00:03:33.030> only<00:03:33.150> three<00:03:33.510> dollars<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:34.110> i<00:03:34.140> bought<00:03:34.410> it

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
was only three dollars so i bought it

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.170 
was only three dollars so i bought it
normally<00:03:35.100> they're<00:03:35.280> like<00:03:35.400> five<00:03:35.610> dollars<00:03:35.790> over

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
normally they're like five dollars over

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.140 
normally they're like five dollars over
here<00:03:36.360> so<00:03:36.600> it<00:03:37.410> was<00:03:37.530> great<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:37.950> they<00:03:38.790> got<00:03:38.940> some

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
here so it was great and they got some

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.940 
here so it was great and they got some
parsley<00:03:39.750> which<00:03:39.989> they<00:03:40.230> normally<00:03:40.380> don't<00:03:40.709> get

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
parsley which they normally don't get

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.040 
parsley which they normally don't get
because<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.430> parsley<00:03:42.030> makes<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.360> cage<00:03:42.570> stink

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.680 
faster so i don't normally buy it but
they<00:03:45.930> really<00:03:46.110> liked<00:03:46.410> it<00:03:47.209> so<00:03:48.209> i<00:03:48.239> bought<00:03:48.450> a<00:03:48.480> few
