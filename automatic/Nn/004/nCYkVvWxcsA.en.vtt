00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.869
 Hello and welcome to our third shutout what to do 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.039
 in this tutorial if we explain as Dr and 11 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.500
 my dream in a noticeable 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.520
 First of all, as always with the Hammer Avatar for the desired 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.830
 Place to start 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.860
 the sheet chooses 2 lit 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.860
 Navigation mostly off 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.660
 only need to be wax in the order of 2 percent they are in the 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.830
 Side view, however, still believes in the desired size stroke on the 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.220
 Height of smoking 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.360
 by commuters 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.610
 and it creates a leaf in the desired size at eye level 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.730
 click on the bike or go to the 3 in the vicinity of the 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.220
 Blockes German have built 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.620
 we can see 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.410
 because as the block the standard text Urte Steinberg Haas 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.660
 is based on the sex symbol concrete thought made with control and 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.590
 Hair or 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.620
 Right-click on a hundred and get a new window 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.640
 here we have to specify the width of the turn to get the room 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.730
 For this purpose, use too broad the turn with listening or driving low 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.120
 Of course, the turn could make it even thicker or thinner 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.890
 No you can currently take the financial markets and in the room 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:33.479
 fly 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.930
 Gummersbach once that he did and how on the one hand the band bedded out 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.160
 notice that now all walls are selected 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.300
 That's because we did not do the hand well 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.950
 have set that the turn no longer hang together 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.030
 use controls and or right-click 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.340
 also Brandenburg to separate the walls of Venice has made 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.640
 knows each and every single wall independently of the other edit 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.510
 speak with different textures beautify energy tax and he gropes 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.520
 Haiti TNT meets several walls, for example, selecting the outer walls 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.249
 to remember with a selected text 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:11.609
 whether bankruptcy and skits tour give the same textures 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:15.819
 you do not have to edit every single wall 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.189
 From the one texture placed on the walls Clegg in the Federal Congress 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.779
 to look at from you 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:26.139
 on you the walls so fallen before they have processed 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:30.409
 Of course you can also process the ceiling and the floor of the room 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.319
 beautify 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.370
 click on the button 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.019
 Karsten combination Shift and g on the left navigation 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.409
 fight on the right side and see that the standard 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.639
 Penta prefers pronounced in the pre-playoffs act 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:49.180

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:49.919

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:53.839
 now he has already set up a point on the map where their way playable in March 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:56.359
 is gonna start 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.639
 Use the whole team to go on "and put a light on the map this 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:01.879
 goes as followed 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.320
 click on the desired position in the room 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.440
 in the group after view and then to the desired height in the 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.849
 sideview 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.290
 You will now perceive a Green Line with a Green Park 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.589
 the box is the point where that is not placed 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:21.679
 just replaced in the navigation right if he pity it goes back to 

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:24.659
 3d view and press the n button couple 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.879
 Now you can see a small lightbulb in the map where he is just shining the light 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:29.969
 has placed 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:33.430
 In the Weiherfeld geneva-servette Spanta attracts as a small box 

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:39.609
 with a double click on the light in the 3d window FTD the settings of 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:40.429
 light 

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:42.829
 I could change a lot of things 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.429
 strictly from now on and to adjust the setting of the light color 

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:51.559
 It used to be chicken and Pickhardt also knows the light 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:54.599
 red green blue and so on 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.389
 Now we have created an arm with a crystal clear one light 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.139
 to save this map clicks on free since then 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:04.259
 and Dr Phnom Penh rooms 

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:07.709
 after all, these markets 2 JÃ©rÃ´me Valcke 1 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.959
 the saved file is a 2 vm AP 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.539
 then he announces that their attention can not yet play 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:18.969
 b Vm AP file is important to be able to change the markets again later 

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.899
 In order to be able to stand in the markets, the markets should now be Kampa 

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:27.979
 click wait for everyone and as sure that everything is set correctly in 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:31.039
 a following attitude 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.129
 SP again and again when he is also normal 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:40.669
 Brand Arpe also makes it normal to hang a hook around it 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.650
 Achterkamp all or he will later in the some problems 

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:45.330
 to have 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.910
 but okay and wait until the process is complete there are some 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:52.460
 Take seconds or even hours 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.930
 That's because of the fast new PCs 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.789
 now everything is ready 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.669
 You can now start the game and select your Mac which you have just 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.879
 If necessary, the markets would need to have the console commanded 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:08.909
 Goods in March Arnstadt 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:12.539
 and we can see you have a first room of the city and you can 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.539
 move freely in it 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.680
