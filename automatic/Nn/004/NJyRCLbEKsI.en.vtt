00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
 this is how the ghost empress gets warm 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.770
 welcome to the next little one after 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.809
 annotated gameplay from the wwu 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.300
 debeka we are back in high field 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.780
 11 as I said as a discipline is here 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.910
 on the road today and at the third 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.980
 fourth something in the adria post 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.769
 namely tattoos that is such a beautiful 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.779
 new elements lord princely with this 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.180
 Nice new model like these three 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.130
 smaller minibusses we already here 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.449
 but they are quite right 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.769
 quickly have no significant 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.660
 skills and I have to be honest 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.940
 say the boss fight against texas 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.250
 I did not really have a clue what 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.170
 Let's see how you're doing 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.579
 try to say what's up against 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.800
 try to say something to note 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.700
 I also try to say what we are 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.890
 have made 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.020
 but what the boss actually does 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.789
 and why at the end was dead have the 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.280
 we probably in the course of the video 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.250
 find out yourself very important if the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.320
 Fischer overturn the bus arrives immediately 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.120
 ie away datums away petz away at 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.199
 best one last almost away from the milieu 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.970
 and watch texas elemental there that 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.000
 means we have to fight with earth 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.799
 spur elemental lords from the earth 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.720
 Splitter and also like to network 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.390
 we have it all the full 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.130
 program and cool composition there like that 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.530
 out of the sand was really cool like me 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.479
 and the boss fight starts you see 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.890
 you have the weapon the living miner 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.479
 can not kill him currently different 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.619
 and the brook is not that powerful 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.780
 that he does not stop that I have you 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.240
 yes spoiled already we see first 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.380
 this red then steam there you should 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.640
 go out and you should as well 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.310
 Of course, from the marked places 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.259
 get out of those mountains there 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.369
 Come out of joke is the 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.930
 lasting quite a while and are 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.820
 Block your sight and everything 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.049
 relatively interesting new mechanics in 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.079
 the boss fight there again a smaller one 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.540
 sting red steam makes evil aua running 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.600
 arbitrarily in the whole areal and 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.219
 watch out run out that you 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.689
 look at the boss have to watch that 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.390
 Healer view of you first of all 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.770
 as tanks and yes the boss then just 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.930
 accordingly, draw a little bit into the necessary 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.369
 because of the steam and the spikes 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.380
 rauslaufen so now just seen 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.610
 it's falling net 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.200
 this is not a problem, it's definitely coming 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.610
 you just have to cross away this one there 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.720
 to take 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.880
 he 'll get a skull right away 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.080
 so it is important that can be marked 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.390
 one does not collect the second one 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.300
 tank which must be slipped away 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.800
 this is nothing new it was for many fr 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.950
 It will always be something new to members 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.900
 but were in the end must 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.460
 also in texas is now at half 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.410
 life of the boss fathers not already up 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.150
 then the mechanics of this dies 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.160
 not that in this regard already 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.780
 I am really very cool that 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.770
 model i find this model very much 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.470
 made cool by these new ones 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.700
 elementary and yes I have then 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.959
 Determined or the group will not 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.120
 really hurt everyone has it 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.250
 get out of the red steam is yes 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.010
 also red-red evil but all get that 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.239
 just so out and about the sting 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.440
 still to run out 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.300
 the problem is of course that we 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.980
 relatively fast and we have too 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.260
 so made cuddly groups arise something 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.950
 not always cheap because one is 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.530
 then of course 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.000
 this steam and everything has one 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.880
 bigger attack surface and that of course 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.260
 problematic also these spines here 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.510
 one should have to prevent the 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.209
 you just do not even run together 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.070
 yes more breath to kill the go to 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.170
 Luckily, that's why it takes a lot of luck 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.549
 could see here or the focus itself 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.690
 could be changed here and texas 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.549
 slowly daun 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.440
 By the way, that's just the most intense 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.810
 phase the airbus has on it next to us 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.280
 have no vision to each other if he 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.080
 his energy has fire then he jumps 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.400
 that's what tectonic restlessness means 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.230
 I think that's such an earthquake 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.549
 as we tweak it from the ground 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.540
 speak another bus we yes in the 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.890
 have had video or will soon have the 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.000
 as much as the ability to have 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.500
 speaks the slash on the floor or 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.260
 Airbus is just on the ground and makes 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.850
 Good near where you have to say 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.680
 could my sons bang on the boss 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.959
 that means the cure was not here 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.200
 quite so blatantly the bus is crumbling in 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:57.200
 his sandy items and yes now 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.500
 come splitter of cactus several 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.549
 harmless and also have this thing 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.560
 was not good 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:08.360
 they have the brook growth where theirs 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.670
 city ​​a bit increase in 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.440
 different aspects of the but 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.690
 kept low if it harms 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.280
 that means you have to get up 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.959
 These splitters also split up groups 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.940
 technically otherwise the one reveals itself high 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.739
 the tank alone probably gets that 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.539
 not kept down then he has one 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.400
 europe 600 percent increased damage 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:27.190
 not so cool 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.449
 you see her like the areal more and more 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.340
 more is being built so it will 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.720
 really hard if you have several 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.430
 then there are different groups 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.320
 spontaneously change the target times and 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.250
 so very much in view 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.449
 interesting and problematic here too 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.979
 with which man does not speak the 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.050
 both have the same skills too 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.979
 I do not quite believe in making a bus again 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.060
 hurt as much as now have the 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:49.050
 acceleration because no new ones 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.370
 skills double speed 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.660
 hurt more than the boss in itself is there 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.850
 I think overall not so there 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.199
 have to come even before article more 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.820
 or the fragmentation and the come 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:59.260
 definitely the case of the groups 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.449
 harm takes the addition of logically 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.979
 split the whole are uncoordinated 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:04.110
 Speaks the sharks have not 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:06.190
 divided for that 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.870
 we did not know what happened yet 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.280
 was one of the few bosses where there is no 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.020
 Explanation degree because of that are again 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.180
 brave and good things just pure 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.520
 otherwise he always writes someone 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.110
 like an explanation and be it only up 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.470
 french quickly the word ball becomes 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.539
 Of course, that's how we fall 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.039
 then moved back and forth here 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.660
 the player destroyed then it was off and 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.009
 sometimes tight then you ignite cool there and 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.270
 if you can not get out of the whole 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:28.919
 as they come out with the whole 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.330
 group 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.800
 and yes that's the problem is all the more 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.539
 the fight lasts, the tighter it gets 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.729
 the areal have more contact point 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.340
 of course the skills of the post 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:41.169
 or be still splitter and 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.510
 we then had to pretty much 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.460
 last one for that we have completely 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.199
 normally played down more damage 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.520
 there was not only skills there was 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.169
 not and so on and so forth 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.699
 now and then now 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.780
 because of the tight course 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:54.849
 a little bit more healed 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.349
 because the steam then demands more victims 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:59.550
 and also the season go into the group 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:02.470
 can not and does not get yelled the 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.300
 us-consumption the speech output 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.360
 or the city still on 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:11.860
 English and there were one more 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.449
 heap smaller sliver we as well 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.370
 defeated years he is here with the steam 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:17.800
 and the stones will slow right 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.780
 tight and it was getting tighter the 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.030
 logically several of these start up 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.650
 then had stone slabs at once 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.510
 would be because of the several small ones 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.070
 splintered animal as well as the 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.419
 fall around our tanks then have 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.039
 just moved out sees the 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:32.770
 Gooseberries become more spontaneous 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:33.880
 become stronger zack course three 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.650
 different places at once 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.509
 rausgeschossen 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.270
 and we have the last one now 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:43.810
 fight later and yes then lies 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:45.880
 so the bus may not ask me 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:47.770
 missing now the total display 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.960
 with every death of such a splitter 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.639
 maybe ten percent of that 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.830
 Boss down or so there had none 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:55.690
 Unfortunately I can not show you anything 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.910
 but to say something in itself 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.380
 boss fight with enough gps and one 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.520
 bit of coordination pretty nice down 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.289
 is to play and for third 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.240
 or fourth boss is that 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:06.699
 I think a pretty nice and too 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.220
 a pretty sophisticated mechanic for 

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:10.780
 any potential success hunter the 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.690
 because certain fun one or the other 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.620
 will have and also for higher year 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.000
 for wheels with higher 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.130
 degrees of difficulty the higher 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.720
 difficulty levels are said so by 

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.949
 therefore write me your opinion in 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.479
 the comments write me like if 

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:25.000
 I forgot something when you boss 

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:26.020
 somehow if you like this mechanics differently 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.130
 have understood or others 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.840
 possibilities see what's there 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:31.599
 happened except what i meant 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.740
 have and then I hope the video has 

00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:34.660
 like you always and we see 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.199
 us if you want in the next 

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.199
 See you 

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:47.270
 the way is 

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.840
 Andrist 

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.840
 would you have 

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.870
