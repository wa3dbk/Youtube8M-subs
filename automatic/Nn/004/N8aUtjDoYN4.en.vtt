00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.750
 hello boys and girls well south sec here 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.430
 one more time and we bring I think that one of 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.220
 the latest news that we are going to have 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.130
 of version 4 since we almost know everything and 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.950
 be waiting for the beta not today 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.419
 we bring the camouflage all the weapons 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.220
 from vero field 4 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.410
 so let's start, I'm going to put 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.869
 soon 10 seconds each image will not 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.690
 the first is supposedly adaptation 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.210
 This will change depends on where you are 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.920
 on the map if yes you have it on and you 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.570
 you forget to change them a snow map goes 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.670
 to change to snow if you're going to change the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.490
 desert that is going to change desert 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.080
 just et cetera etcetera I guess it's 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.640
 the one that is going to carry around the world so 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.270
 except I 'm true because I always 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.190
 forget here we have the fall now and 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.920
 can see see action is a very good 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.079
 variety can see quite a lot here but 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.810
 worry there are more we also have the 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.030
 of desert and keep in mind that 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.880
 means that they are going to give us more maps or 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.159
 less what are the categories not to 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.350
 then we have the naval one and then 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.810
 we look among the stones that we have 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.659
 true naval battles we have 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.780
 and blue colors also after here 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.860
 Of course, the snow follows many people 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.570
 like maps with snow 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.720
 unfortunately in but phil 3 no more 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.670
 we had a true map but continuing 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.990
 we have then one can be one of the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.090
 favorites from around the world that is the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.509
 urban are also not the same 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.880
 patterns in all more the type of painting 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.090
 it's a little different truth in everyone 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.310
 and continuing with the volume or forest 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.110
 maybe we can see here the types of 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.840
 colors that then yes what style 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.240
 not forest and now we're going to the last 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.700
 which is the miscellany that supposedly 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.500
 inside not laying well the note the law 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.049
 several times but here we can see that 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.959
 they are enough and it still seems that there 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.299
 more down and supposedly each 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:02.280
 that has the 16 patterns that we can 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.590
 see in the previous ones speed of all 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.810
 we are going to see more we do not know how 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.030
 work necessarily and also 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.920
 remember that in vehicles they have 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.590
 camouflage we do not know if also the 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.020
 same amount as the soldier 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.480
 true 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.970
 we're not really sure right but if 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.160
 we know we have enough camouflage 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.530
 many people may bother you now 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.540
 because we like to see rust by type 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.430
 of game the people that like the 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.920
 camouflages as they play call of duty 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.380
 now yes and there are some up ridiculous 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.480
 not these if they stay a little inside 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.670
 of the scene of what it is to see or field and 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.830
 what is this now what kind 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.260
 army no and well I hope they have 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.880
 enjoyed that was all and tell me there 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.760
 down in the comments 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.620
 which was your favorite which was the worst and 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.870
 which are they going to use within the field of 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.480
 battle when it arrives but field 4 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.480
 experts have enjoyed wells the set
