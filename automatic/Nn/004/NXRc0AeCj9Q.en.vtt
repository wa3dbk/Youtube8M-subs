00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.730 
I don't really care and it's just going
to<00:02:32.250> find<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:32.970> see<00:02:33.390> if<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.630> can<00:02:33.750> connect<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.620> the

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
to find and see if it can connect to the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.410 
to find and see if it can connect to the
Internet<00:02:35.190> at<00:02:35.310> all<00:02:35.400> connect<00:02:35.820> or<00:02:35.940> route<00:02:36.240> or

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
Internet at all connect or route or

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.520 
Internet at all connect or route or
anything<00:02:36.780> see<00:02:36.960> what<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.230> network

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
anything see what the network

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.000 
anything see what the network
configuration<00:02:37.740> is<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:39.410> then<00:02:40.410> it'll<00:02:40.680> take<00:02:40.860> you

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
configuration is and then it'll take you

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.420 
configuration is and then it'll take you
to<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.250> next<00:02:41.400> screen

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
to the next screen

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.740 
to the next screen
so<00:02:44.430> now<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:44.610> just<00:02:44.700> need<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.090> put<00:02:45.240> in<00:02:45.360> your<00:02:45.510> time

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
so now you just need to put in your time

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.700 
so now you just need to put in your time
zone<00:02:45.920> which<00:02:47.420> I'm<00:02:48.420> in<00:02:48.630> Australia<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:49.410> I'll<00:02:49.530> go

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
zone which I'm in Australia so I'll go

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.320 
zone which I'm in Australia so I'll go
down<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:49.950> find<00:02:50.250> Melbourne<00:02:50.910> because<00:02:51.150> that's

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
down and find Melbourne because that's

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.680 
down and find Melbourne because that's
the<00:02:51.540> closest<00:02:51.990> to<00:02:52.200> me<00:02:53.930> just<00:02:54.930> keep<00:02:55.140> going<00:02:55.740> up<00:02:56.690> so

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
the closest to me just keep going up so

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.410 
the closest to me just keep going up so
there<00:02:57.840> we<00:02:57.960> go<00:02:57.990> Melbourne<00:02:58.520> hit<00:02:59.520> ok<00:02:59.910> now<00:03:00.150> this<00:03:00.270> is

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
there we go Melbourne hit ok now this is

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.650 
there we go Melbourne hit ok now this is
all<00:03:00.540> done<00:03:00.720> by<00:03:00.780> via<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.680> keyboard<00:03:02.390> no<00:03:03.390> mouse

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
all done by via the keyboard no mouse

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.990 
all done by via the keyboard no mouse
interaction<00:03:04.590> so<00:03:05.160> now<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:05.370> just<00:03:05.520> need<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.790> set

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
interaction so now you just need to set

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.180 
interaction so now you just need to set
your<00:03:06.120> root<00:03:06.300> password<00:03:06.650> so<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.710> will<00:03:07.830> just<00:03:07.980> set

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
your root password so I will just set

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.420 
your root password so I will just set
mine<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:09.620> you<00:03:10.620> need<00:03:10.770> to<00:03:10.890> confirm<00:03:11.190> the

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
mine and you need to confirm the

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.180 
mine and you need to confirm the
password<00:03:11.640> make<00:03:12.240> sure<00:03:12.270> they're<00:03:12.600> right<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.410> you

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
password make sure they're right and you

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.860 
password make sure they're right and you
should<00:03:14.220> really<00:03:14.640> write<00:03:14.940> these<00:03:15.150> passwords<00:03:15.660> down

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
should really write these passwords down

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.290 
should really write these passwords down
because<00:03:16.320> if<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:16.650> lose<00:03:16.890> them<00:03:17.130> it's<00:03:17.940> really

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
because if you lose them it's really

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:28.410 
because if you lose them it's really
annoying

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.870 

and<00:03:28.660> now<00:03:29.170> it<00:03:29.290> just<00:03:29.500> goes<00:03:30.310> through<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:30.730> does

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
and now it just goes through and does

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.850 
and now it just goes through and does
its<00:03:31.180> insulation<00:03:31.720> there's<00:03:32.080> not<00:03:32.230> much<00:03:32.380> more<00:03:32.620> to

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
its insulation there's not much more to

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.390 
its insulation there's not much more to
it<00:03:32.890> for<00:03:33.250> this<00:03:33.400> part<00:03:34.709> so<00:03:35.709> now<00:03:35.740> I've<00:03:35.980> just<00:03:36.010> sped

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
it for this part so now I've just sped

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.630 
it for this part so now I've just sped
this<00:03:36.580> up<00:03:36.760> this<00:03:37.000> actually<00:03:37.540> takes<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:38.640> little

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
this up this actually takes a little

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.470 
this up this actually takes a little
while<00:03:39.819> and<00:03:40.090> I<00:03:40.660> actually<00:03:41.080> I'll<00:03:41.380> just<00:03:41.410> skip<00:03:41.830> it

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
while and I actually I'll just skip it

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.740 
while and I actually I'll just skip it
so<00:03:43.480> now<00:03:43.660> at<00:03:44.020> reboots<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:45.760> you<00:03:46.090> just<00:03:46.330> met<00:03:46.600> with

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
so now at reboots and you just met with

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.350 
so now at reboots and you just met with
this<00:03:46.870> little<00:03:47.170> rebooting<00:03:47.620> screen<00:03:48.270> test<00:03:49.270> for

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
this little rebooting screen test for

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.850 
this little rebooting screen test for
internet<00:03:49.780> access<00:03:49.810> get<00:03:50.380> its<00:03:50.530> network

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
internet access get its network

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.180 
internet access get its network
connections<00:03:51.340> all<00:03:51.550> good<00:03:51.910> and<00:03:52.240> gone<00:03:53.190> started

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
connections all good and gone started

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.350 
connections all good and gone started
services<00:03:55.060> and<00:03:55.980> then<00:03:56.980> we<00:03:57.340> should<00:03:57.610> be<00:03:57.790> met<00:03:58.060> with

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
services and then we should be met with

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.320 
services and then we should be met with
a<00:03:58.920> login<00:03:59.920> screen<00:04:00.280> so<00:04:00.730> now<00:04:00.880> I'm<00:04:01.000> going<00:04:01.150> to<00:04:01.209> log
