00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
we're ready to make it so that the

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.640 
we're ready to make it so that the
player<00:00:09.030> can<00:00:09.059> take<00:00:09.510> damage<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.110> lose<00:00:10.320> lives

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
player can take damage and lose lives

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.200 
player can take damage and lose lives
and<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:10.950> first<00:00:11.160> thing<00:00:11.340> we're<00:00:11.490> going<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.759> do<00:00:11.969> is

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
and the first thing we're going to do is

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.580 
and the first thing we're going to do is
make<00:00:12.389> it<00:00:12.420> so<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:12.780> when<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.019> player<00:00:13.230> gets

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
make it so that when the player gets

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.220 
make it so that when the player gets
hurt<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:14.219> blows<00:00:14.639> up<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.120> then<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.450> regenerated

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
hurt it blows up and then is regenerated

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.330 
hurt it blows up and then is regenerated
but<00:00:16.410> then<00:00:16.560> has<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.800> little<00:00:17.160> bit<00:00:17.279> of

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
but then has a little bit of

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.460 
but then has a little bit of
invulnerability<00:00:18.000> for<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.630> few<00:00:18.840> seconds<00:00:19.350> so

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
invulnerability for a few seconds so

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.980 
invulnerability for a few seconds so
over<00:00:20.250> here<00:00:20.400> in<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.580> assets<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.180> have<00:00:21.330> created<00:00:21.600> a

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
over here in the assets I have created a

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.560 
over here in the assets I have created a
sprite<00:00:22.410> player<00:00:22.769> hurt<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.820> identical

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
sprite player hurt and this is identical

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.200 
sprite player hurt and this is identical
to<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.930> sprite<00:00:25.230> player<00:00:25.590> it's<00:00:26.490> just<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:27.000> I

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
to the sprite player it's just that I

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.439 
to the sprite player it's just that I
have<00:00:27.330> added<00:00:27.539> an<00:00:27.900> empty<00:00:28.650> frame<00:00:28.949> here<00:00:29.400> after<00:00:30.330> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
have added an empty frame here after the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.930 
have added an empty frame here after the
first<00:00:30.810> image<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.470> showing<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> preview

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
first image and showing the preview

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.630 
first image and showing the preview
it'll<00:00:33.420> just<00:00:33.450> flicker<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:33.989> way<00:00:34.640> there's

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
it'll just flicker that way there's

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.729 
it'll just flicker that way there's
another<00:00:35.850> way<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.120> doing<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.600> using<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.500> draw

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
another way of doing this using a draw

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.290 
another way of doing this using a draw
events<00:00:38.280> but<00:00:38.640> we're<00:00:38.790> not<00:00:38.879> going<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.059> do<00:00:39.180> that

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
events but we're not going to do that

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.810 
events but we're not going to do that
for<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.600> game<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.050> now<00:00:40.950> we<00:00:41.010> can<00:00:41.250> open<00:00:41.430> up<00:00:41.640> our

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
for this game and now we can open up our

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.709 
for this game and now we can open up our
object<00:00:42.420> player<00:00:46.520> so<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.879> create<00:00:48.180> event<00:00:48.360> we

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
object player so in the create event we

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.600 
object player so in the create event we
are<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.230> create<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.649> new<00:00:49.920> variable<00:00:50.129> so

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
are going to create a new variable so

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.360 
are going to create a new variable so
kind<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.910> control<00:00:51.300> set<00:00:52.230> variable<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
kind of control set variable and the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.290 
kind of control set variable and the
variable<00:00:53.850> we<00:00:54.000> are<00:00:54.030> going<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.390> make<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.949> is

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
variable we are going to make is is

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.060 
variable we are going to make is is
underscore<00:00:57.300> hurt<00:00:57.750> we're<00:00:58.469> going<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.770> set<00:00:58.890> that

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
underscore hurt we're going to set that

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.049 
underscore hurt we're going to set that
to<00:00:59.309> false<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.890> we're<00:01:01.890> going<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.219> make<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.940> so

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
to false and we're going to make it so

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.579 
to false and we're going to make it so
the<00:01:03.149> player<00:01:03.359> can<00:01:03.600> be<00:01:03.629> hurt<00:01:03.930> when<00:01:04.080> they<00:01:04.260> collide

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
the player can be hurt when they collide

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.950 
the player can be hurt when they collide
with<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:05.280> enemy<00:01:05.820> bullets<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.659> enemies

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
with the enemy bullets and the enemies

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.990 
with the enemy bullets and the enemies
themselves<00:01:07.340> we'll<00:01:08.340> start<00:01:08.549> with<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.729> bullets

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
themselves we'll start with the bullets

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.469 
themselves we'll start with the bullets
so<00:01:09.210> add<00:01:09.420> event<00:01:10.250> collision<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.400> we'll<00:01:12.360> be

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
so add event collision and we'll be

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.570 
so add event collision and we'll be
looking<00:01:12.750> for<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.110> object<00:01:13.350> bullet<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
looking for this object bullet the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.609 
looking for this object bullet the
object<00:01:14.939> bullet<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.390> also<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> parent<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.500> the

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
object bullet is also a parent of the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.350 
object bullet is also a parent of the
object<00:01:16.950> boss<00:01:17.159> bullets<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.880> will<00:01:18.030> affect

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
object boss bullets so this will affect

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.170 
object boss bullets so this will affect
that<00:01:18.630> as<00:01:18.869> well<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.520> first<00:01:20.520> we<00:01:20.640> need<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.909> test

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
that as well and first we need to test

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.740 
that as well and first we need to test
and<00:01:21.420> see<00:01:21.840> if<00:01:22.080> we<00:01:22.380> are<00:01:22.799> not<00:01:23.640> invulnerable<00:01:24.119> in

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
and see if we are not invulnerable in

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.200 
and see if we are not invulnerable in
other<00:01:25.650> words<00:01:25.860> if<00:01:26.040> we're<00:01:26.159> not<00:01:26.310> hurt<00:01:26.670> already

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
other words if we're not hurt already

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.620 
other words if we're not hurt already
so<00:01:27.960> let's<00:01:28.140> come<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.590> test<00:01:29.159> variable<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.820> we

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
so let's come to test variable and we

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.679 
so let's come to test variable and we
are<00:01:30.720> going<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.990> test<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.500> underscore<00:01:32.490> hurt<00:01:32.790> and

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
are going to test is underscore hurt and

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.999 
are going to test is underscore hurt and
if<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.320> equal<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.860> false<00:01:36.710> bring<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.829> some

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
if it's equal to false bring in some

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.460 
if it's equal to false bring in some
blocks<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.840> first<00:01:39.840> thing<00:01:40.020> we<00:01:40.110> are<00:01:40.200> going<00:01:40.380> to

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
blocks and first thing we are going to

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.450 
blocks and first thing we are going to
do<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.950> set<00:01:41.460> variable<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.590> turn<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.950> variable

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
do is set variable and turn the variable

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.399 
do is set variable and turn the variable
is<00:01:44.780> underscore<00:01:45.780> hurt<00:01:46.759> to<00:01:47.759> true<00:01:48.049> this<00:01:49.049> way<00:01:49.229> we

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
is underscore hurt to true this way we

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.219 
is underscore hurt to true this way we
cannot<00:01:49.680> be<00:01:49.890> damaged<00:01:50.340> by<00:01:50.880> multiple<00:01:51.630> bullets<00:01:52.020> at

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
cannot be damaged by multiple bullets at

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.530 
cannot be damaged by multiple bullets at
the<00:01:52.619> same<00:01:52.799> time<00:01:53.070> we<00:01:53.670> could<00:01:53.850> set<00:01:54.119> up<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.360> hit

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
the same time we could set up a hit

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.620 
the same time we could set up a hit
point<00:01:54.810> system<00:01:55.229> for<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.500> player<00:01:55.909> but<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.240> these

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
point system for the player but in these

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.289 
point system for the player but in these
types<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.110> games<00:01:58.320> usually<00:01:59.189> one<00:01:59.490> hit<00:01:59.759> kills<00:02:00.149> the

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
types of games usually one hit kills the

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.810 
types of games usually one hit kills the
player<00:02:00.540> which<00:02:01.049> makes<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.619> challenging<00:02:01.820> so

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
player which makes it so challenging so

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.639 
player which makes it so challenging so
when<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.180> player<00:02:03.600> gets<00:02:03.899> hit<00:02:04.079> by<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.290> bullet

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
when the player gets hit by the bullet

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.920 
when the player gets hit by the bullet
we<00:02:05.100> need<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.369> make<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.610> bullet<00:02:05.880> disappear<00:02:06.390> so

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
we need to make the bullet disappear so

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.410 
we need to make the bullet disappear so
come<00:02:07.380> over<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.770> main<00:02:07.950> one<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.489> our<00:02:08.910> destroy

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
come over to main one and our destroy

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.510 
come over to main one and our destroy
instance<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.170> we<00:02:10.590> are<00:02:10.709> going<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:11.009> destroy<00:02:11.370> the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
instance and we are going to destroy the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.760 
instance and we are going to destroy the
other<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.390> object<00:02:12.720> bullet

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
other the object bullet

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.910 
other the object bullet
and<00:02:13.940> before<00:02:14.940> we<00:02:15.090> destroy<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.600> player<00:02:15.870> we<00:02:16.740> need

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
and before we destroy the player we need

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.390 
and before we destroy the player we need
to<00:02:17.040> make<00:02:17.190> an<00:02:17.310> explosion<00:02:17.550> so<00:02:18.060> create<00:02:18.810> instance

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
to make an explosion so create instance

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.710 
to make an explosion so create instance
and<00:02:20.400> we<00:02:20.490> are<00:02:20.610> going<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:21.000> create<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:23.040> object

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
and we are going to create the object

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.900 
and we are going to create the object
explosion<00:02:24.720> large<00:02:25.100> and<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.280> coordinates<00:02:26.760> I'm

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
explosion large and the coordinates I'm

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.610 
explosion large and the coordinates I'm
going<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.210> give<00:02:27.450> this<00:02:27.630> is<00:02:27.900> in<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.170> exposition

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
going to give this is in the exposition

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.370 
going to give this is in the exposition
a<00:02:29.070> negative<00:02:30.740> sprite<00:02:31.740> underscore<00:02:32.490> width

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
a negative sprite underscore width

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.600 
a negative sprite underscore width
divided<00:02:34.380> by<00:02:34.500> 2<00:02:35.180> 2<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.650> set<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.770> relative<00:02:38.190> the

divided by 2 2 and set to relative the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.970 
divided by 2 2 and set to relative the

to<00:02:43.620> get<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:43.920> explosion<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.520> appear<00:02:44.850> in<00:02:44.970> the

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
to get the explosion to appear in the

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.000 
to get the explosion to appear in the
center<00:02:45.300> we<00:02:45.570> need<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.870> use<00:02:46.020> this<00:02:46.200> formula<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.950> a

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
center we need to use this formula of a

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.010 
center we need to use this formula of a
negative<00:02:47.250> sprite<00:02:47.730> width<00:02:47.970> divided<00:02:48.480> by<00:02:48.570> 2<00:02:48.630> and

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
negative sprite width divided by 2 and

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.870 
negative sprite width divided by 2 and
that<00:02:49.140> should<00:02:49.440> put<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.830> right<00:02:50.460> in<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.760> middle

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
that should put it right in the middle

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.320 
that should put it right in the middle
of<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.150> sprite<00:02:51.710> click<00:02:52.710> OK<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.310> instead<00:02:54.180> of

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
of the sprite click OK and instead of

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.090 
of the sprite click OK and instead of
actually<00:02:54.840> destroying<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.560> player<00:02:55.830> we're

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
actually destroying the player we're

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.380 
actually destroying the player we're
just<00:02:56.220> going<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.370> move<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:56.670> off<00:02:56.790> screen<00:02:57.240> and

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
just going to move it off screen and

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.660 
just going to move it off screen and
then<00:02:57.540> have<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.810> pop<00:02:58.020> back<00:02:58.260> on<00:02:58.290> this<00:02:59.250> will<00:02:59.520> make

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
then have it pop back on this will make

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.460 
then have it pop back on this will make
it<00:02:59.820> easier<00:03:00.120> for<00:03:00.390> us<00:03:00.570> rather<00:03:00.960> than<00:03:01.140> just

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
it easier for us rather than just

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.590 
it easier for us rather than just
creating<00:03:01.740> a<00:03:02.100> new<00:03:02.130> object<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:03.030> determining

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
creating a new object and determining

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.820 
creating a new object and determining
whether<00:03:03.750> or<00:03:03.870> not<00:03:04.020> it's<00:03:04.260> hurt<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:04.590> all<00:03:04.650> that

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
whether or not it's hurt and all that

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.980 
whether or not it's hurt and all that
complicated<00:03:05.490> stuff<00:03:05.730> we<00:03:06.420> can<00:03:06.540> just<00:03:06.720> use<00:03:06.840> the

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
complicated stuff we can just use the

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.900 
complicated stuff we can just use the
same<00:03:07.230> object<00:03:07.680> so<00:03:08.130> we're<00:03:08.250> going<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.550> come<00:03:08.730> to

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
same object so we're going to come to

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.800 
same object so we're going to come to
move<00:03:09.240> and<00:03:09.590> jump<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.770> position<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:12.630> we're

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
move and jump to position and we're

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.340 
move and jump to position and we're
going<00:03:12.960> to<00:03:13.020> set<00:03:13.260> it<00:03:13.350> to<00:03:13.400> negative<00:03:14.400> 50<00:03:14.790> and

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
going to set it to negative 50 and

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.130 
going to set it to negative 50 and
negative<00:03:16.350> 50<00:03:16.740> and<00:03:16.980> this<00:03:17.340> will<00:03:17.490> set<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:17.820> off<00:03:18.140> the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
negative 50 and this will set it off the

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.830 
negative 50 and this will set it off the
screen<00:03:19.500> off<00:03:19.790> above<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:21.030> top<00:03:21.270> left<00:03:21.540> corner

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
screen off above the top left corner

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.350 
screen off above the top left corner
click<00:03:22.110> OK<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.070> then<00:03:23.340> finally<00:03:23.910> we<00:03:24.060> need<00:03:24.090> to

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
click OK and then finally we need to

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.330 
click OK and then finally we need to
make<00:03:24.540> it<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:24.900> that<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.290> player<00:03:25.500> comes<00:03:25.770> back<00:03:26.100> on

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
make it so that the player comes back on

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.870 
make it so that the player comes back on
screen<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:27.450> we'll<00:03:27.570> use<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:27.750> timer<00:03:28.110> for<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.880> go

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
screen so we'll use a timer for that go

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.440 
screen so we'll use a timer for that go
to<00:03:29.910> main<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.390> set<00:03:31.290> alarm<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:32.150> we'll<00:03:33.150> set<00:03:33.330> the

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
to main to set alarm and we'll set the

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.050 
to main to set alarm and we'll set the
alarm<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.780> say<00:03:34.230> 10<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:34.890> we'll<00:03:35.400> give<00:03:35.580> it<00:03:35.610> alarm

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
alarm to say 10 and we'll give it alarm

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.390 
alarm to say 10 and we'll give it alarm
1<00:03:37.670> let's<00:03:38.670> go<00:03:38.820> to<00:03:38.910> add<00:03:39.240> event<00:03:39.600> alarm<00:03:40.530> alarm<00:03:41.010> 1

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
1 let's go to add event alarm alarm 1

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.610 
1 let's go to add event alarm alarm 1
and<00:03:41.640> we're<00:03:42.300> going<00:03:42.330> to<00:03:42.540> have<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:42.780> jump<00:03:43.080> back<00:03:43.320> to

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
and we're going to have it jump back to

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.740 
and we're going to have it jump back to
where<00:03:44.100> it<00:03:44.220> originally<00:03:44.700> was<00:03:44.850> so<00:03:45.360> let's<00:03:45.540> go<00:03:45.690> to

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
where it originally was so let's go to

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.070 
where it originally was so let's go to
move<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.910> come<00:03:47.910> down<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.330> jump<00:03:48.570> category

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
move and come down to the jump category

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.880 
move and come down to the jump category
jump<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.800> start<00:03:51.170> we<00:03:52.170> need<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:52.440> change<00:03:52.650> the

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
jump to start we need to change the

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.910 
jump to start we need to change the
sprite<00:03:53.220> to<00:03:53.459> our<00:03:53.730> sprite<00:03:54.240> hurt<00:03:54.600> so<00:03:55.500> let's<00:03:55.740> go<00:03:55.860> to

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
sprite to our sprite hurt so let's go to

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.750 
sprite to our sprite hurt so let's go to
main<00:03:56.360> change<00:03:57.360> sprite<00:03:58.010> we<00:03:59.010> will<00:03:59.160> change<00:03:59.459> this

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
main change sprite we will change this

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.930 
main change sprite we will change this
to<00:04:00.090> our<00:04:00.240> sprite<00:04:00.990> player<00:04:01.290> hurt<00:04:01.650> we<00:04:02.640> can<00:04:02.790> leave

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
to our sprite player hurt we can leave

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.910 
to our sprite player hurt we can leave
everything<00:04:03.120> as<00:04:03.540> is<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.140> then<00:04:04.170> we're<00:04:04.770> going<00:04:04.860> to

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
everything as is and then we're going to

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.100 
everything as is and then we're going to
have<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.160> set<00:04:05.340> up<00:04:05.459> another<00:04:05.820> alarm<00:04:06.270> so<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:07.020> we

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
have to set up another alarm so that we

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.390 
have to set up another alarm so that we
can<00:04:07.260> change<00:04:07.500> back<00:04:07.800> to<00:04:07.830> normal

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
can change back to normal

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.260 
can change back to normal
and<00:04:08.660> get<00:04:09.660> rid<00:04:09.810> of<00:04:09.840> our<00:04:10.050> invulnerability<00:04:11.270> so

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
and get rid of our invulnerability so

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.199 
and get rid of our invulnerability so
let's<00:04:12.450> go<00:04:12.570> to<00:04:12.630> main<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:13.250> set<00:04:14.250> alarm<00:04:14.580> again<00:04:14.940> and

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
let's go to main to set alarm again and

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.940 
let's go to main to set alarm again and
we'll<00:04:15.690> set<00:04:15.900> this<00:04:16.049> to<00:04:16.350> 60<00:04:17.190> steps<00:04:17.430> so<00:04:17.880> 2<00:04:18.299> seconds

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
we'll set this to 60 steps so 2 seconds

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.760 
we'll set this to 60 steps so 2 seconds
we<00:04:19.950> want<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.280> change<00:04:20.520> this<00:04:20.700> to<00:04:20.760> alarm<00:04:21.330> -<00:04:21.770> click

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
we want to change this to alarm - click

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.040 
we want to change this to alarm - click
OK

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
OK

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.430 
OK
and<00:04:24.139> then<00:04:24.379> add<00:04:24.620> event<00:04:24.979> alarm<00:04:25.550> alarm<00:04:26.270> -<00:04:26.569> so<00:04:27.319> now

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
and then add event alarm alarm - so now

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.860 
and then add event alarm alarm - so now
we<00:04:27.500> can<00:04:27.740> change<00:04:27.979> our<00:04:28.370> sprite<00:04:28.819> back<00:04:29.150> to<00:04:29.720> the

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
we can change our sprite back to the

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.059 
we can change our sprite back to the
original<00:04:30.710> lens<00:04:30.889> so<00:04:31.039> main<00:04:31.250> one<00:04:31.490> change<00:04:32.360> sprite

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:33.069 
original lens so main one change sprite

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:36.659 
original lens so main one change sprite
we<00:04:34.069> will<00:04:34.190> change<00:04:34.430> it<00:04:34.610> to<00:04:34.789> sprite<00:04:35.240> player<00:04:35.569> and

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
we will change it to sprite player and

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.890 
we will change it to sprite player and
then<00:04:37.669> we<00:04:37.789> need<00:04:37.970> to<00:04:38.240> turn<00:04:38.599> out<00:04:38.780> the

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
then we need to turn out the

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.510 
then we need to turn out the
invulnerability<00:04:39.409> so<00:04:39.800> ctrl<00:04:40.250> set<00:04:40.849> variable<00:04:41.360> is

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
invulnerability so ctrl set variable is

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.619 
invulnerability so ctrl set variable is
underscore<00:04:43.520> hurt<00:04:43.759> back<00:04:44.569> to<00:04:44.870> false<00:04:45.530> and<00:04:46.190> that

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:46.629 
underscore hurt back to false and that

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:48.700 
underscore hurt back to false and that
should<00:04:47.629> do<00:04:47.750> it<00:04:47.870> so<00:04:48.020> let's<00:04:48.199> go<00:04:48.319> ahead<00:04:48.409> and<00:04:48.590> run

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
should do it so let's go ahead and run

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.589 
should do it so let's go ahead and run
the<00:04:48.860> game<00:04:49.569> and<00:04:51.669> the<00:04:52.669> boss<00:04:52.849> will<00:04:53.060> come<00:04:53.180> on<00:04:53.360> and

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 
the game and the boss will come on and

shoot take a hit blow up come back

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.570 
shoot take a hit blow up come back
flickering<00:04:57.319> for<00:04:57.500> a<00:04:57.560> while<00:04:57.710> but<00:04:57.919> you<00:04:58.009> see<00:04:58.190> that

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
flickering for a while but you see that

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.839 
flickering for a while but you see that
I<00:04:58.789> do<00:04:58.879> have<00:04:59.150> invulnerability<00:04:59.840> for<00:05:00.199> a<00:05:00.229> while

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:00.849 
I do have invulnerability for a while

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:03.249 
I do have invulnerability for a while
right<00:05:01.849> now<00:05:02.030> though<00:05:02.300> we've<00:05:02.629> got<00:05:02.810> it<00:05:02.900> set<00:05:03.110> up<00:05:03.139> so

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:03.259 
right now though we've got it set up so

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:05.110 
right now though we've got it set up so
that<00:05:03.740> the<00:05:03.889> player<00:05:04.099> just<00:05:04.460> sort<00:05:04.759> of<00:05:04.849> goes

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
that the player just sort of goes

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.040 
that the player just sort of goes
forever<00:05:07.090> we'll<00:05:08.090> have<00:05:08.210> to<00:05:08.330> set<00:05:08.509> up<00:05:08.599> a<00:05:08.780> life

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
forever we'll have to set up a life

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.469 
forever we'll have to set up a life
counter<00:05:09.469> system<00:05:09.860> but<00:05:10.009> first<00:05:10.250> let's<00:05:10.909> also<00:05:11.120> set

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
counter system but first let's also set

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.379 
counter system but first let's also set
up<00:05:11.710> functionality<00:05:12.710> so<00:05:12.949> that<00:05:13.219> the<00:05:14.120> player<00:05:14.360> can

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
up functionality so that the player can

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.270 
up functionality so that the player can
be<00:05:14.569> destroyed<00:05:14.990> if<00:05:15.289> it<00:05:15.469> collides<00:05:15.860> with<00:05:16.009> an

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
be destroyed if it collides with an

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.670 
be destroyed if it collides with an
enemy<00:05:16.750> and<00:05:17.750> all<00:05:17.870> we<00:05:17.990> have<00:05:18.110> to<00:05:18.229> do<00:05:18.349> for<00:05:18.500> that<00:05:18.650> is

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
enemy and all we have to do for that is

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.860 
enemy and all we have to do for that is
duplicate<00:05:19.490> this<00:05:19.759> collision<00:05:20.180> with<00:05:20.449> object

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
duplicate this collision with object

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.350 
duplicate this collision with object
bullet<00:05:21.199> so<00:05:22.099> come<00:05:22.639> right-click<00:05:23.210> it<00:05:23.330> and

bullet so come right-click it and
duplicate<00:05:23.810> event<00:05:24.139> I'm<00:05:24.889> going<00:05:25.280> to<00:05:25.430> do

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:25.699 
duplicate event I'm going to do

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:32.320 
duplicate event I'm going to do

collision with object enemy parent when

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.659 
collision with object enemy parent when
we<00:05:32.479> collide<00:05:32.779> with<00:05:32.990> the<00:05:33.139> enemy<00:05:33.650> I<00:05:33.860> also<00:05:34.190> want<00:05:34.580> to

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:39.259 
itself so let's duplicate this create

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:42.790 
itself so let's duplicate this create
instance<00:05:39.969> copy<00:05:40.969> and<00:05:41.300> paste<00:05:42.110> and<00:05:42.500> I'm<00:05:42.590> going<00:05:42.740> to

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
instance copy and paste and I'm going to

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.830 
instance copy and paste and I'm going to
take<00:05:42.949> the<00:05:43.099> other<00:05:43.279> one<00:05:44.650> apply<00:05:45.650> it<00:05:45.710> to<00:05:45.979> other<00:05:46.279> and

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
take the other one apply it to other and

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.120 
take the other one apply it to other and
instead<00:05:47.840> of<00:05:47.930> a<00:05:47.990> negative<00:05:48.289> sprite<00:05:48.770> width<00:05:48.979> I'm

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
instead of a negative sprite width I'm

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.800 
instead of a negative sprite width I'm
going<00:05:49.310> to<00:05:49.370> give<00:05:49.490> it<00:05:49.580> a<00:05:49.639> positive<00:05:49.940> sprite<00:05:50.569> width

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
going to give it a positive sprite width

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.830 
going to give it a positive sprite width
and<00:05:51.020> then<00:05:51.770> finally<00:05:52.219> I<00:05:52.250> want<00:05:52.669> to<00:05:52.909> have<00:05:53.479> the<00:05:53.629> same

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
and then finally I want to have the same

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.959 
and then finally I want to have the same
thing<00:05:54.110> happen<00:05:54.560> when<00:05:54.830> we<00:05:54.979> collide<00:05:55.370> with<00:05:55.699> the

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:55.969 
thing happen when we collide with the

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:58.059 
thing happen when we collide with the
boss<00:05:56.210> so<00:05:56.659> let's<00:05:56.930> duplicate<00:05:57.770> the<00:05:57.949> object

00:05:58.059 --> 00:05:58.069 
boss so let's duplicate the object

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:02.249 
boss so let's duplicate the object
bullet<00:05:58.639> again<00:05:59.710> let's<00:06:00.710> have<00:06:00.830> it<00:06:00.889> collide<00:06:01.279> with

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:02.259 
bullet again let's have it collide with

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:05.890 
bullet again let's have it collide with
object<00:06:03.259> boss<00:06:03.440> and<00:06:04.150> we<00:06:05.150> don't<00:06:05.360> want<00:06:05.629> a

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
object boss and we don't want a

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.629 
object boss and we don't want a
collision<00:06:06.469> with<00:06:06.620> the<00:06:06.650> boss<00:06:06.919> to<00:06:07.190> destroy<00:06:07.490> the

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 
collision with the boss to destroy the

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:10.019 
collision with the boss to destroy the
boss<00:06:07.789> so<00:06:08.029> let's<00:06:08.210> get<00:06:08.360> rid<00:06:08.509> of<00:06:08.599> this<00:06:08.840> action<00:06:09.620> and

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:10.029 
boss so let's get rid of this action and
