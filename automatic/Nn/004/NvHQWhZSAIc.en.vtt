00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
though they were interesting I didn't

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.719

really<00:01:04.140> feel<00:01:04.260> super<00:01:04.710> invested<00:01:05.220> there<00:01:05.610> were

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
really feel super invested there were

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:06.920 
really feel super invested there were
some<00:01:05.880> really<00:01:06.060> funny<00:01:06.360> moments<00:01:06.750> where<00:01:06.900> i

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
some really funny moments where i

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.990 
some really funny moments where i
actually<00:01:07.439> laughed<00:01:07.860> out<00:01:08.100> loud<00:01:08.159> which<00:01:08.670> doesn't

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
actually laughed out loud which doesn't

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.640 
actually laughed out loud which doesn't
happen<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.330> whole<00:01:09.420> lot<00:01:09.630> um<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.110> illustrations

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
happen a whole lot um the illustrations

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.740 
happen a whole lot um the illustrations
are really<00:01:10.979> cool<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:12.030> guess<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.420> stories

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
are really cool and I guess the stories

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.870 
are really cool and I guess the stories
fine<00:01:13.260> maybe<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.770> gets<00:01:14.159> even<00:01:14.340> better<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
fine maybe it gets even better the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.580 
fine maybe it gets even better the
farther<00:01:15.000> into<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.479> series<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.990> go<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.470> i'll

standards<00:03:41.190> for<00:03:41.310> it<00:03:41.549> just<00:03:41.700> because<00:03:41.790> it<00:03:42.180> is

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
standards for it just because it is

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.090 
standards for it just because it is
middle<00:03:42.569> grade<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:42.989> that's<00:03:43.200> really<00:03:43.440> fun<00:03:43.620> so<00:03:43.889> if

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
middle grade and that's really fun so if

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.039
