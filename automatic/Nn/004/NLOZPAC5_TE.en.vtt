00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
you're just going to blend it in a

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.130 
you're just going to blend it in a
blender<00:04:22.190> and<00:04:22.580> that's<00:04:22.750> basically<00:04:23.750> all<00:04:23.870> there

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
blender and that's basically all there

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.930 
blender and that's basically all there
is<00:04:24.230> to<00:04:24.380> this<00:04:24.530> recipe<00:04:24.890> because<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:25.490> next<00:04:25.790> thing

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
is to this recipe because the next thing

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:26.820 
is to this recipe because the next thing
you're<00:04:26.030> doing<00:04:26.090> is<00:04:26.510> you're

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
you're doing is you're

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.249 
you're doing is you're
use<00:04:27.009> a<00:04:27.039> strainer<00:04:27.490> to<00:04:27.819> pour<00:04:28.479> the<00:04:28.659> mixture<00:04:28.960> into

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
use a strainer to pour the mixture into

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:33.510 
use a strainer to pour the mixture into
some<00:04:30.159> ice<00:04:30.340> cube<00:04:31.060> trays<00:04:31.599> and<00:04:32.129> the<00:04:33.129> reason<00:04:33.400> for

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
some ice cube trays and the reason for

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.279 
some ice cube trays and the reason for
this<00:04:33.639> is<00:04:33.699> because<00:04:33.849> you<00:04:34.240> don't<00:04:34.270> want<00:04:34.539> any<00:04:34.870> kind

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
this is because you don't want any kind

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.399 
this is because you don't want any kind
of<00:04:35.379> seed<00:04:35.740> weird<00:04:36.729> parts<00:04:37.419> inside<00:04:37.960> your

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:38.409 
of seed weird parts inside your

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:41.189 
of seed weird parts inside your
watermelon<00:04:39.310> ice<00:04:39.520> cubes<00:04:40.000> so<00:04:40.569> basically<00:04:40.930> once

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
watermelon ice cubes so basically once

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.390 
watermelon ice cubes so basically once
you've<00:04:41.319> done<00:04:41.500> that<00:04:41.710> you're<00:04:41.889> just<00:04:42.009> going<00:04:42.250> to

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
you've done that you're just going to

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.490 
you've done that you're just going to
place<00:04:42.639> this<00:04:42.819> in<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.150> freezer<00:04:43.360> and<00:04:43.719> I<00:04:44.020> left

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
place this in the freezer and I left

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.990 
place this in the freezer and I left
mine<00:04:44.710> in<00:04:44.740> overnight<00:04:45.370> but<00:04:45.610> you<00:04:45.669> could<00:04:45.789> probably

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
mine in overnight but you could probably

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.689 
mine in overnight but you could probably
do<00:04:46.300> about<00:04:46.599> seven<00:04:47.349> hours<00:04:47.469> something<00:04:48.430> like<00:04:48.550> that

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
do about seven hours something like that
