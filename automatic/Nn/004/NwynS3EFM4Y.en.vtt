00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.900
 something more techno fanatic dotcom and 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.790
 here good comes a small business box 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.890
 find out if you are the name and the 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.480
 link in which a tweet two cases 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.980
 one for what comes to be the high 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.610
 third generation and the other for the 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.020
 iphone 44 s so let's go the opening and 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.920
 see how these cases are in the 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.920
 mobile devices 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.990
 then we go to the opening 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:47.010
 and well let's explain more or less 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.659
 what does this two of us have this one 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.390
 it is very interesting that afterwards this one 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:54.329
 I will show you this record is for 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.820
 the iphone 44 that is called michaels and 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.170
 comes with interchangeable caps and what 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.460
 interesting is all this site in 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.650
 thanks to the website that you are going 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.589
 to be able to customize the cap on 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.229
 case of perhaps placing the logo or a 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.790
 picture of your child from your family in which 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.770
 you are going to be able to do it 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.530
 upload you the photo the page of the 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.990
 company and customize one of the potatoes 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.560
 and this way you will be able this 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.970
 let's say buy it and exchange them 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.140
 along with the others that come in the 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.840
 product so this let's leave it 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.640
 for this Thursday so that you can 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.799
 see how interesting this type of 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.120
 group or studio and producer so 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.680
 it comes to be the iphone 4 4 is 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.950
 let's focus on this case that 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.990
 the garrison model is the model 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.440
 This case is made of a type material 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.240
 leather is not leather turn the part of 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.030
 down let's say the base of the plastic and 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.980
 comes with and is smart so 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.400
 So you're going to see now 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.640
 product comes with a protective sheet 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:02.100
 in the front that will help 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.100
 let's go that's not going to hurt 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.310
 because when one places such is a 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:13.870
 blade so what we say as protects 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.970
 in turn can also cause a bit of 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.010
 do not eliminate the quality of the screen 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.799
 but maybe it does not possibly do it at 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.150
 just like when you do not have the blade 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.610
 protective but the advantage of this 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.670
 sheet that comes or that includes in the 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.920
 package is that it will allow not to reduce 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.690
 the quality of the image of what the 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.879
 screen offers but it's going to 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.560
 keep it well do the quality in hd and 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.950
 in turn will not allow 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.659
 fingerprints that are stuck on 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.780
 the case for doha on the screen 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:47.440
 thanks to this screen saver that 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.859
 is as much money as it is in its case no 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.319
 and what he gave is going to help 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:56.410
 maintain image quality at the moment 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.200
 that one is watching movies not in their 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:03.010
 then we remove this from here and go 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.659
 to bring our ipad and see how the 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.489
 inside you can see that 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.620
 in the heart of plastic but for 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.060
 inside you have a cloth and what 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.930
 comes to make soft microfiber for 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.030
 protect the screen of the ipad the 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.740
 installation is very simple 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.380
 let's put it 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:24.860
 and that's all we've heard the clicks 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.440
 what can we say is installed and the 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.300
 close that they will have a tongue what 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.960
 can place here and this way has 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.670
 completely secured your tablet and 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.780
 let's go to the accessibility part 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.300
 you are going to see that you have access to 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.180
 noise eliminator headset on 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.810
 turn off the volume 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:48.349
 so what do the speakers here 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.299
 you have holes and in turn 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.400
 here they have entry for what is the 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.359
 connector let's see if it's smart 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.180
 as specified by the company 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:00.650
 it is effectively intelligent and the other 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.500
 advantage that we will be able to use 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.170
 this case in turn to be able to place 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.690
 the tablet in two positions in the 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.340
 first position 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.550
 personally is inserting the tongue 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.790
 there 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.290
 and to watch movies in this way and the 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.989
 second position case of you says 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.900
 write emails simply what 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.880
 place in this position 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.160
 we will not be able to write without any 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.639
 problem then that listen well 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.039
 complete aresco to the company varig arts 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:34.280
 for sending us that case and 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:36.259
 allow us to do the review protects as 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.470
 you have been able to see for all 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:41.810
 sides the tablet does not and in the part of 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:46.039
 back what they are seeing is plastic 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:48.610
 and in turn because it has this type sheet 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:52.639
 leather that also helps in the background to 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:55.280
 absorb the edges are the falls that 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.380
 they want not to pass and let's say 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.949
 they keep the tablet protected in all 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:03.110
