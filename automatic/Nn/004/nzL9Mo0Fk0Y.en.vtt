00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.939
 let's make an endive salad and 

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:09.340
 chicken with mayonnaise ideal for this 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:13.260
 recipe we are going to use a milk can 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:18.240
 ideal a chicken breast cooked corn 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:20.650
 endivias lemon avocado old mustard 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.300
 and a mixture of olive oil and 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.270
 sunflower that will be to make mayonnaise 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.340
 let's start with the breast we're going 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.710
 to open in half if we see some 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.649
 nerve some fat we could 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.019
 and we're going to season it with a little bit of 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:38.069
 lemon juice for later 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:38.069
 pass it to the plate 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.570
 let's use the iron for this we have 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.699
 put a pan previously we leave it 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.070
 heat is important we always load 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.839
 grilled either a breast yet 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.449
 mixed beef that we have 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:55.339
 previously warm the pan of this 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.900
 way we will avoid being cooked 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:01.800
 we put a little salt 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.800
 and pepper 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.600
 once we have it browned by a band 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.300
 we throw them away and let her finish 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.340
 browning equally for the other part we're going to 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.710
 prepare the mayonnaise for it we have 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.259
 here already the mixture in equal parts of 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.850
 olive oil and sunflower oil and we're going 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.100
 to add another part of ideal milk 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.000
 we put a few drops of lemon and a 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.620
 little salt 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.780
 now let's proceed as if 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.540
 we made a mayonnaise with egg with 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.710
 turning we put it down first and go 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.710
 to go up little by little 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.630
 have seen how fast the 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.850
 we have ready and now we are going to put 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.770
 a little bit of old mustard 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.229
 we are going well and we will have what is 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.380
 ideal mayonnaise prepared now let's 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.860
 prepare the avocado we cut it by the 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.860
 half 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.620
 until we reach the bone we separate the two 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.950
 halves and in the part that has the bone 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.750
 we hit a little with the knife 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.900
 we rotate and in this way we get very 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.440
 easy the bone now so that we stay 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.820
 perfect the peeled avocado with a 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.490
 spoon in this way we are supporting the 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.890
 in all the skin in this way we 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.470
 will be totally peeled now we cut 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.730
 the avocado 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:45.300
 every two it is important that when the 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.750
 Handle in the avocado if you are not going to 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.960
 quickly consume a trick is to leave 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.090
 the bone and apart also add a 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.500
 little lemon juice 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.500
 we put it in a bowl 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.520
 and later we will be adding the 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.500
 rest of ingredients once we have the 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.250
 breast ready we are going to cut 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.250
 every two 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.530
 and we incorporate the breast to the bowl where 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.420
 we have the avocado we put a 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.420
 little lemon juice 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.610
 now let's defoliate the endive for 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.900
 the technique is instead of taking it 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.730
 by the tip 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.680
 we would take it from the bottom of 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.040
 this way we do not break it 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.000
 we cut a little bit of the trunk and go 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.490
 defoliating in this way 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.100
 the buds are reserved for 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:46.630
 after chopping we cut them 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.630
 Endive buds 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.790
 and we add it to the bowl where we already have the 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.150
 rest of the ingredients we add the 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.180
 Cooked corn 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.390
 the mayonnaise a little the rest the 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.599
 we will use to dress the leaves 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:10.840
 we mix all the ingredients well 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:12.640
 will be ready to place 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.170
 proceed to place the salad for 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.329
 we are going to help from a hoop 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.100
 metallic if you do not have it too what 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.919
 can manufacture even with a bottle 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.130
 of plastic we place it in the center 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.470
 from the dish 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.620
 Y 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:31.460
 we put the mixture here 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:34.550
 of the avocado with the corn the chicken and the 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:38.000
 endive to the around we are placing 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.820
 the leaves in Libya and finally the 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.620
 let's season with the ideal mayonnaise 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.320
 previously we have clarified it with a 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.660
 little bit more milk and we put it 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.820
 on top of the leaves of libya this 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.650
 salad goes very well in summer as 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.320
 is older by not containing egg 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.310
 we can avoid the problem of 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.860
 salmonella 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.340
 finally we improve with a little bit of 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.340
 chopped chives 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.560
 and a little cherry 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:13.350
 we take out the hoop 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.350
 and we have a list, I hope you like it
