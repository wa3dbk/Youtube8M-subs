we actually got to see them compete and

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.410 
we actually got to see them compete and
they<00:00:18.600> were<00:00:18.660> using<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:19.140> in<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.470> soccer

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
they were using this in the soccer

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.150 
they were using this in the soccer
competition<00:00:21.420> as<00:00:21.570> well<00:00:21.600> as<00:00:21.930> roaming<00:00:22.710> about<00:00:22.890> on

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
competition as well as roaming about on

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.130 
competition as well as roaming about on
the<00:00:23.250> main<00:00:23.400> floor<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:24.390> let's<00:00:24.600> start<00:00:24.869> off<00:00:24.960> by

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
the main floor so let's start off by

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.050 
the main floor so let's start off by
just<00:00:25.170> simply<00:00:25.710> hoping<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.279> opening<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:26.880> up

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
just simply hoping this opening this up

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.759 
just simply hoping this opening this up
and<00:00:27.269> see<00:00:27.390> what's<00:00:27.570> inside<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.960> box<00:00:29.720> so<00:00:30.769> it's

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
and see what's inside the box so it's

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.760 
and see what's inside the box so it's
pretty<00:00:31.920> big<00:00:32.189> heavy<00:00:32.910> box<00:00:33.149> now<00:00:34.969> as<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.120> can<00:00:36.210> see

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
pretty big heavy box now as you can see

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.500 
pretty big heavy box now as you can see
before<00:00:37.770> we<00:00:37.860> open<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.160> up<00:00:38.280> we're<00:00:39.149> going<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.420> have

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
before we open it up we're going to have

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.010 
before we open it up we're going to have
a<00:00:39.660> lot<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.230> servos<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:41.160> lot<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.790> them<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.450> get

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
a lot of servos a lot of them so get

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.020 
a lot of servos a lot of them so get
ready<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.500> sit<00:00:43.710> down<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.250> start<00:00:44.850> building

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
ready to sit down and start building

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.000 
ready to sit down and start building
this<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> lot<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.320> time<00:00:46.559> available

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
this and have a lot of time available

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.069 
this and have a lot of time available
because<00:00:47.239> anything<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.450> has<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.870> many

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
because anything that has this many

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.450 
because anything that has this many
servos<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.710> going<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.980> take<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> lot<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.370> time

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
servos is going to take a lot of time

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.580 
servos is going to take a lot of time
not<00:00:51.059> only<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.239> but<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.629> wiring<00:00:52.110> involved

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
not only that but the wiring involved

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.900 
not only that but the wiring involved
everything<00:00:52.949> that's<00:00:53.190> really<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.579> tedious

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
everything that's really the tedious

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.389 
everything that's really the tedious
part<00:00:54.170> you<00:00:55.170> can<00:00:55.289> imagine<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.980> know<00:00:56.070> purse

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
part you can imagine that you know purse

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.459 
part you can imagine that you know purse
/<00:00:56.670> oh<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.850> probably<00:00:57.000> have<00:00:57.210> four<00:00:57.480> screws<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.140> 4

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
/ oh you probably have four screws so 4

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.590 
/ oh you probably have four screws so 4
times<00:00:58.500> however<00:00:59.340> many<00:00:59.550> servos<00:01:00.059> plus<00:01:00.390> however

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
times however many servos plus however

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.869 
times however many servos plus however
many<00:01:00.750> more<00:01:01.109> screws<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.250> need<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.550> mount<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
many more screws you need to mount the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.820 
many more screws you need to mount the
actual<00:01:03.149> servo<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.199> lot<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.439> screwing<00:01:04.650> in

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
actual servo it's a lot of screwing in

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.730 
actual servo it's a lot of screwing in
so<00:01:05.010> let's<00:01:05.670> get<00:01:05.790> started<00:01:06.380> we're<00:01:07.380> going<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.590> put

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
so let's get started we're going to put

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:17.600 
so let's get started we're going to put
this<00:01:07.830> off<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.130> side<00:01:11.869> okay<00:01:13.790> so<00:01:16.400> okay<00:01:17.400> so

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
this off to the side okay so okay so

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.249 
this off to the side okay so okay so
we'll<00:01:18.180> quickly<00:01:18.420> note<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.780> we<00:01:18.869> have<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
we'll quickly note that we have the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.730 
we'll quickly note that we have the
server<00:01:19.650> commander<00:01:20.130> 16<00:01:21.170> very<00:01:22.170> similar<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.560> what

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
server commander 16 very similar to what

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.890 
server commander 16 very similar to what
we<00:01:22.830> did<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> mini<00:01:23.520> hexapod<00:01:23.970> II<00:01:24.000> know<00:01:24.210> we

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
we did in the mini hexapod II know we

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.300 
we did in the mini hexapod II know we
were<00:01:24.960> used<00:01:25.200> server<00:01:25.380> commando<00:01:25.680> but<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.830> believe

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
were used server commando but I believe

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.679 
were used server commando but I believe
that<00:01:26.369> was<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.610> 32<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.420> not<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.659> 16<00:01:29.570> we<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.659> a

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
that was the 32 and not the 16 we have a

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.319 
that was the 32 and not the 16 we have a
bunch<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:31.049> we<00:01:31.470> have<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.619> CD<00:01:31.920> now<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.820> city's

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
bunch of we have the CD now the city's

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.850 
bunch of we have the CD now the city's
I'm<00:01:33.450> not<00:01:33.570> sure<00:01:33.720> if<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.439> guys<00:01:34.530> are<00:01:34.710> familiar

I'm not sure if you guys are familiar

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.350 
I'm not sure if you guys are familiar
with<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.280> or<00:01:35.340> not<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:35.700> all<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.060> innovative

with it or not but all the innovative
products<00:01:36.720> come<00:01:36.840> with<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.020> same<00:01:37.200> CD<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.799> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
products come with the same CD and the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.830 
products come with the same CD and the
CD<00:01:38.610> contains<00:01:39.000> all<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.329> documentation

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
CD contains all the documentation

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.899 
CD contains all the documentation
typically<00:01:40.350> for<00:01:40.500> all<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.950> their<00:01:41.070> products<00:01:41.460> I'm

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
typically for all of their products I'm

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.280 
typically for all of their products I'm
not<00:01:42.090> sure<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.299> that's<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.509> case<00:01:42.689> here<00:01:43.020> but<00:01:43.200> I'm

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
not sure if that's the case here but I'm

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.480 
not sure if that's the case here but I'm
pretty<00:01:43.530> sure<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:43.950> because<00:01:44.189> they<00:01:44.220> look

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
pretty sure it is because they look

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.649 
pretty sure it is because they look
almost<00:01:44.790> identical<00:01:47.119> bunch<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.240> components

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
almost identical bunch of components

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.819 
almost identical bunch of components
here<00:01:48.810> they're<00:01:48.960> gonna<00:01:49.049> be<00:01:49.170> used<00:01:49.350> for<00:01:49.560> mounting

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
here they're gonna be used for mounting

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.649 
here they're gonna be used for mounting
the<00:01:49.860> servos<00:01:50.280> we<00:01:50.430> got<00:01:50.579> plastic<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.210> metal<00:01:51.329> ones

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
the servos we got plastic and metal ones

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.880 
the servos we got plastic and metal ones
i<00:01:53.149> know<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.450> this<00:01:54.630> knowing<00:01:55.320> anybody<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.829> how

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
i know that this knowing anybody and how

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.109 
i know that this knowing anybody and how
they<00:01:56.009> package<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.700> one<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.000> AC

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
they package it this is one of the AC

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.380 
they package it this is one of the AC
adapters<00:01:57.630> usually<00:01:58.439> get<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.829> there's<00:01:59.759> one<00:02:00.060> and

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
adapters usually get to there's one and

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.870 
adapters usually get to there's one and
yours<00:02:00.570> too<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.920> we're<00:02:02.189> not<00:02:02.280> going<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.520> we<00:02:02.790> don't

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
yours too so we're not going to we don't

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.149 
yours too so we're not going to we don't
need<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.149> open<00:02:03.360> those<00:02:03.450> up<00:02:03.509> but<00:02:04.229> pretty<00:02:05.100> much

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
need to open those up but pretty much

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.230 
need to open those up but pretty much
know<00:02:05.430> what<00:02:05.549> they're<00:02:05.700> going<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.850> being<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.060> bit

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
know what they're going to being a bit

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.910 
know what they're going to being a bit
and<00:02:06.689> then<00:02:07.020> when<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:07.229> get<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.560> will<00:02:07.740> be<00:02:07.860> able

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
and then when we get to it will be able

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.290 
and then when we get to it will be able
to<00:02:08.069> see<00:02:08.220> what<00:02:08.369> they're<00:02:08.489> in<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.640> use<00:02:08.759> for<00:02:11.300> again

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
to see what they're in the use for again

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.260 
to see what they're in the use for again
another<00:02:12.510> USB<00:02:13.290> cable<00:02:13.800> almost<00:02:14.640> robotic<00:02:14.790> they

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
another USB cable almost robotic they

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.619 
another USB cable almost robotic they
always<00:02:15.420> package<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:15.900> up<00:02:15.959> for<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.730> these<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:18.270> can

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
always package it up for you these I can

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.119 
always package it up for you these I can
quickly<00:02:18.840> see<00:02:19.200> are<00:02:19.319> either<00:02:19.470> be<00:02:19.739> used<00:02:19.920> for<00:02:20.040> the

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
quickly see are either be used for the

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.860 
quickly see are either be used for the
sensors<00:02:20.459> or<00:02:20.640> for<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.879> servos<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.720> see

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
sensors or for the servos you see

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.050 
sensors or for the servos you see
there's<00:02:22.020> gonna<00:02:22.110> be<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.230> lot<00:02:22.379> of<00:02:22.440> these<00:02:22.590> wires

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
there's gonna be a lot of these wires

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.240 
there's gonna be a lot of these wires
and<00:02:24.060> let's<00:02:24.720> see<00:02:24.840> here<00:02:25.080> here<00:02:25.530> we<00:02:25.620> have<00:02:25.739> all<00:02:25.950> the

and let's see here here we have all the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.490 
and let's see here here we have all the
servos<00:02:26.720> I'm<00:02:27.720> not<00:02:27.870> gonna<00:02:27.989> take<00:02:28.200> them<00:02:28.319> out<00:02:28.470> for

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
servos I'm not gonna take them out for

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.830 
servos I'm not gonna take them out for
so<00:02:28.920> many<00:02:28.980> followed<00:02:29.730> black<00:02:29.940> pieces<00:02:30.180> easy<00:02:30.480> there

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
so many followed black pieces easy there

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.070 
so many followed black pieces easy there
for<00:02:31.110> all<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.349> servos<00:02:32.599> this<00:02:33.599> looks<00:02:33.840> like<00:02:33.900> the

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
for all the servos this looks like the

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.860 
for all the servos this looks like the
chest<00:02:34.319> plate<00:02:35.239> and<00:02:36.239> let's<00:02:36.480> see<00:02:36.599> what's<00:02:36.750> inside

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
chest plate and let's see what's inside

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.520 
chest plate and let's see what's inside

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
are all going to be used to build the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.809 
are all going to be used to build the
actual<00:02:53.550> reality<00:02:53.910> no<00:02:55.280> battery<00:02:56.280> pack<00:02:56.550> which<00:02:56.730> is

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
actual reality no battery pack which is

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.610 
actual reality no battery pack which is
nice<00:02:57.030> of<00:02:57.209> them<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.510> lot<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:57.959> robot<00:02:58.170> kits<00:02:58.349> do<00:02:58.470> not

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
nice of them a lot of robot kits do not

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.119 
nice of them a lot of robot kits do not
include<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.040> battery<00:02:59.280> pack<00:02:59.459> they<00:02:59.849> do<00:03:01.129> and

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
include the battery pack they do and

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.210 
include the battery pack they do and
that's<00:03:02.550> about<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.849> as<00:03:03.569> simple<00:03:04.080> as<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.230> so

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220
