00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.580
 that gives you the desire dale batasuna up 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:14.639
 May it be tomorrow 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:17.279
 so dance it dances dance dances dance dances sea 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.439
 that I can buy coins with 5% 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.650
 discount and they are sent to me in less than 10 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.939
 minutes until then cousin the one who passes 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.619
 guys how are we here in a new 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.789
 video and good today I bring you a new 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.650
 chapter of the channel is worth it 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.869
 I was already playing an empty week 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.250
 almost two weeks I did not upload it and well 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.809
 I already had to teach some channels that 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.850
 It's worth it as you always know 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.620
 I usually notify on twitter that you pass me 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.059
 channels to take a look I'm going 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.620
 pointing out the ones that I like and such 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.180
 and well, here I am with three channels 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.160
 that I think is worth going up a 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.600
 pretty good good quality content 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.059
 they comment pretty well they do 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.460
 entertaining and what is worth it but 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.850
 before as you already know this series is very 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.590
 important that you support these 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.090
 channels because I really are the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.500
 only channels I try to comment a little 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.120
 what is up they are worth it or 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.070
 no and already you are the ones that you have to 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.320
 help these channels going through their 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.240
 videos like if you like them and 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.000
 subscribing to your channel yes 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.770
 content is worth as you know how to start at 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.930
 Youtube is very difficult and I try 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.810
 give that little push but really 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.430
 push me is not worth it if you do not 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.080
 you do well then this would be you know 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.610
 that depends a lot on you so 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.500
 I hope you share this video for 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.060
 that everyone can see a lot 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.770
 people can see these channels and they give 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.130
 a little push that I think they 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.659
 can come in handy you know like 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.369
 comments subscribe to your channels and 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.960
 you like them but especially if you like them 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.549
 It is very important that because 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.439
 I want them to have psuv without assets and such 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.909
 so if you like its content or if you 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.110
 have a good time with your videos you give 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.819
 lay people subscribe and all those things 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.409
 so we're not going to start with the 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:45.690
 first channel in this case is called kings 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.670
 of the counterattack are two guys that good 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.110
 makes a pretty entertaining video that 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.810
 You can find a bit of everything in your 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.340
 channel they have squat build those you can already 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.170
 find some cheap equipment like this 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.700
 also some sandwich you can find 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.409
 also some review you can find 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.119
 paco open and sara have started a league 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.649
 with other youtuber that I think 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.959
 It can also be quite entertaining 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.640
 see there youtubers there in 2.0 as 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.049
 they have a hard time when they are playing against 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.030
 your colleagues and such is that I think that 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.100
 I'm pretty good about everything I think 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.360
 that are entertaining videos not that it's a 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.540
 little like that for also 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.740
 from time to time with their gestures and such and 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.000
 I think it is a channel that is worth a 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.320
 the boys the truth is that they comment 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.330
 pretty good they have some video too 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.860
 explaining some little thing and I think that 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.510
 they explain it pretty well so I 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.340
 I think you can like the channel so 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.690
 nothing to go through your channel look at some 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.180
 video give you the one you liked 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.740
 subscribe and all those little things we're going 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.260
 to move on to the next one in this in this 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.460
 case it's called x frank is it worth this 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.010
 channel had it targeted for 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.930
 time and good then I think that it already touches 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.280
 to take it out is a boy that the truth is 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.630
 which comments pretty well I think that 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.190
 about everything you most want your channel 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.070
 is how he says he has a way of 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.940
 talk that entertains I believe and that you 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.800
 lets good hypnotized is not the word 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.940
 but we're going to use it until the 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.550
 end of the video or comment 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.570
 pretty good and it makes you entertaining and 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.910
 That's why you stay until the end of 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.959
 video does not upload also original equipment 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.970
 has a series called equipment 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.890
 original the original lieutenant I do not know to 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.330
 I really like the videos that 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.980
 you go up on all the comments very well 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.420
 It has good quality I think it is 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.670
 pretty well also has now gone up a 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.410
 rap of football that the truth is that it's 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.630
 pretty cool and I do not know I think a 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.130
 channel that we may like is pretty 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.310
 entertained also a career scam 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.470
 I do not know is a 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.060
 that I think is pretty good 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.800
 very good quality and I think if it continues 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.870
 so it will continue to grow a lot because 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.849
 it shows there are not many channels and such and 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.530
 when one stands out a little for the way 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.940
 to comment on the quality of the videos 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.620
 it stands out above the rest, not so 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.970
 nothing and you have your channel as I say 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.530
 you pass you leave your like if it has 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.160
 liked in your videos subscribe to your 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.130
 channel 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.780
 if you like how the boy comments as 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.190
 as it brings the videos whatever it is worth and 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.319
 the last channel in this case would be the one 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.180
 I recorded stars, it's worth to me, the truth is 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.400
 that reminds me a lot to quique or 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.280
 kiki food fifa by the way of speaking a 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.380
 little and also a little in its aspect by 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.450
 so to say that he says he does not look like 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.790
 but hey, it's a boy who also brings 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.350
 some interesting series brings and about 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.400
 all templates and player reviews 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.110
 that I think is pretty good 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.000
 because lately you do not see so many 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.890
 reviews and I think it's worth it 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.510
 although people still receiving from 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.549
 players because there are many people who 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.170
 no help and well your last video is a 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.400
 draw you're doing for Christmas like this 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.140
 that you can also take advantage of to win 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.209
 some of some coins if you have the 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.220
 lucky to win and I think it's 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.750
 quite well the channel comments well brings 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.340
 many videos in 2.0 also that is 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.169
 entertaining then see 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.400
 to your youtube was and well spent 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.110
 bad in games and all that that 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.100
 we have said before too and I believe that 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.440
 it's a channel that's also worth it 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.550
 has good templates also goes up 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.620
 Occasionally some for their opinion I 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.690
 I think it's a channel that brings good 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.639
 videos good quality and that deserves the 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.080
 It's a shame to spend some time and keep an eye on him 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.430
 it's worth it so you know very important 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.320
 go through the three channels that 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.580
 taught that if you like your content 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.620
 As I said before, you like it 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.030
 subscribe ais because that's what they need 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.380
 these guys and like I said before 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.639
 also because it is very important that 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.410
 share this video with all the 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.180
 people that you can as I said 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.590
 before it's also very difficult to start in 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.690
 youtube when you start uploading videos 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.520
 that people know you and such and such 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.979
 well this little push if you do not 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.210
 you support because it will not serve much 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.340
 that nothing I know that you are going to 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.840
 do you always do it so I trust 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.760
 totally in you so nothing of 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.930
 I leave the channels you can comment on 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.400
 has appeared these channels you can 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.169
 comment also if you have any channel and 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.789
 You want me to leave because I sign it and 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.500
 I'm looking at you and nothing else 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:17.080
 really thank you for the help 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.789
 what do you give these channels that 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.410
 true, I'm sure with what to thank 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.639
 very much and we see ourselves in the 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.930
 next video is worth so nothing a 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.930
 I greet everyone and goodbye
