probably work also on a 2008 2009 2010

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.660 
probably work also on a 2008 2009 2010
or<00:00:09.269> even<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.870> latest<00:00:10.200> model<00:00:10.800> of<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.309> Versa

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
the trunk and then look inside this area

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.349 
the trunk and then look inside this area
of<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.619> trunk<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.010> you'll<00:00:20.189> see<00:00:20.520> two<00:00:20.820> little

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
of the trunk and you'll see two little

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.090 
of the trunk and you'll see two little
doors<00:00:21.539> one<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.140> little<00:00:22.529> bit<00:00:22.619> bigger<00:00:22.830> than<00:00:22.980> the

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
doors one a little bit bigger than the

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.759 
doors one a little bit bigger than the
other<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:24.480> have<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.810> pop<00:00:25.080> them<00:00:25.380> open<00:00:27.769> pry

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
other and you have to pop them open pry

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.720 
other and you have to pop them open pry
them<00:00:28.949> open<00:00:29.090> using<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.300> screwdriver<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:31.019> inside

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.740 
them open using a screwdriver and inside
then<00:00:32.730> you'll<00:00:32.910> find<00:00:33.300> two<00:00:34.399> hex<00:00:35.399> screws<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.149> you

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
then you'll find two hex screws and you

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.569 
then you'll find two hex screws and you
have<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.960> loosen<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.410> hex<00:00:37.680> screws<00:00:37.950> with<00:00:38.190> a

ten millimeter socket I don't have a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.010 
ten millimeter socket I don't have a
deep<00:00:43.320> socket<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.980> managed<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.750> loosen<00:00:45.750> it

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
deep socket so I managed to loosen it

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.869 
deep socket so I managed to loosen it
using<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:47.420> wrench<00:00:48.420> right<00:00:48.750> here<00:00:51.530> magnetised

or<00:01:01.410> just<00:01:02.100> if<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.460> don't<00:01:02.640> have<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> magnetized

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
or just if you don't have a magnetized

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.240 
or just if you don't have a magnetized
wrench<00:01:03.930> just<00:01:04.580> you<00:01:05.580> know<00:01:05.700> losing<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:07.159> using<00:01:08.159> a

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
wrench just you know losing it using a

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.429 
wrench just you know losing it using a

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
take it off using a finger and then the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.390 
take it off using a finger and then the
next<00:01:15.150> step<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.780> actually<00:01:15.990> take<00:01:16.350> take<00:01:17.130> apart

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
next step is to actually take take apart

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.539 
next step is to actually take take apart
this<00:01:18.350> plastic<00:01:19.350> housing<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
this plastic housing and this is the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.130 
this plastic housing and this is the
most<00:01:20.729> challenging<00:01:20.880> part<00:01:21.240> because<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.990> don't

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
most challenging part because you don't

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.109 
most challenging part because you don't
want<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.470> be<00:01:22.619> because<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.580> don't<00:01:23.729> know<00:01:23.850> where

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
want to be because you don't know where

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.289 
want to be because you don't know where
this<00:01:24.869> thing<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.110> anger<00:01:25.530> onto<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.070> body<00:01:26.299> so

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
this thing is anger onto the body so

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.670 
this thing is anger onto the body so
what<00:01:27.450> I'm<00:01:27.570> going<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.750> show<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.290> they're

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
what I'm going to show you is they're

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.960 
what I'm going to show you is they're
actually<00:01:28.770> four<00:01:29.189> anchor<00:01:29.400> points<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.820> first

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
actually four anchor points the first

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.700 
actually four anchor points the first
anchor<00:01:30.299> point<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.659> towards<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.170> skinny<00:01:31.500> part

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
anchor point is towards the skinny part

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.069 
anchor point is towards the skinny part
of<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.100> plastic<00:01:32.310> housing<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.960> a

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
of the plastic housing and it's a

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.980 
of the plastic housing and it's a
u-shape<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.979> attaches<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.689> the<00:01:36.689> quarter

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
u-shape and it attaches to the quarter

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.810 
u-shape and it attaches to the quarter
panel<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:38.189> like<00:01:38.400> that

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
panel just like that

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.330 
panel just like that
and<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.079> second<00:01:40.470> anchor<00:01:40.619> point<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.070> just<00:01:41.250> a

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
and the second anchor point is just a

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.749 
and the second anchor point is just a
straight<00:01:41.700> pin<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.479> goes<00:01:42.689> into<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.229> hole<00:01:43.759> in

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
straight pin that goes into the hole in

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.539 
straight pin that goes into the hole in
the<00:01:45.560> inner<00:01:46.560> corner<00:01:46.829> panel<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.399> third

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the inner corner panel and in a third

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.789 
the inner corner panel and in a third
anchor<00:01:48.180> point<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.689> actually<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> hex<00:01:49.530> screw

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
anchor point is actually the hex screw

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.889 
anchor point is actually the hex screw
and<00:01:50.549> then<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> fourth<00:01:51.060> anchor<00:01:51.420> point<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
and then a fourth anchor point is the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.050 
and then a fourth anchor point is the
other<00:01:51.990> hex<00:01:52.229> code<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.340> actually<00:01:53.610> take<00:01:53.939> this

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
other hex code so to actually take this

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.160 
other hex code so to actually take this
off<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:55.259> don't<00:01:55.409> want<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.649> be<00:01:55.770> prying<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.460> way

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
off you don't want to be prying this way

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.270 
off you don't want to be prying this way
because<00:01:58.170> you'll<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.740> be<00:01:58.890> breaking

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
because you'll just be breaking

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.569 
because you'll just be breaking
something<00:01:59.840> and<00:02:00.840> just<00:02:01.009> yanking<00:02:02.009> on<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.280> part

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
something and just yanking on this part

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.090 
something and just yanking on this part
it's<00:02:02.820> not<00:02:02.880> enough<00:02:03.270> because<00:02:03.450> we<00:02:03.780> have<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.100> you

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
it's not enough because we have this you

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.069 
it's not enough because we have this you
know<00:02:05.130> anchor<00:02:06.060> point<00:02:06.299> right<00:02:06.390> here<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.840> it's

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
know anchor point right here and it's

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.469 
know anchor point right here and it's
held<00:02:07.290> on<00:02:07.409> pretty<00:02:07.680> tight<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.910> what<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.090> find<00:02:09.360> out

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
held on pretty tight so what I find out

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.910 
held on pretty tight so what I find out
the<00:02:09.629> most<00:02:09.780> effective

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
wipe the lens pretty good so it's all

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.400 
wipe the lens pretty good so it's all
smooth<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.959> dry<00:02:25.849> that<00:02:26.849> way<00:02:27.319> there's<00:02:28.319> more

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
smooth and dry that way there's more

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.940

right here push it in this way while at
the<00:02:37.470> same<00:02:37.530> time<00:02:37.680> apply<00:02:38.250> force<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:39.120> way<00:02:39.330> and

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
the same time apply force that way and

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.449 
the same time apply force that way and
simultaneously<00:02:42.269> with<00:02:42.810> your<00:02:42.959> other<00:02:43.110> hand<00:02:43.459> yank

on this corner and after yanking it a

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.170 
on this corner and after yanking it a
couple<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.540> times<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:50.790> whole<00:02:50.910> thing<00:02:51.060> will

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
couple of times the whole thing will

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.570 
couple of times the whole thing will
come<00:02:51.209> off<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:52.850> inside<00:02:53.850> you'll<00:02:54.209> see<00:02:55.580> three

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
come off and inside you'll see three

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:03.140 
come off and inside you'll see three
electrical<00:03:00.560> contacts<00:03:01.560> this<00:03:02.489> one<00:03:02.760> I<00:03:02.790> believe

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
electrical contacts this one I believe

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.420 
electrical contacts this one I believe
is<00:03:03.299> brake<00:03:03.600> light<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:04.769> one<00:03:05.010> is<00:03:05.100> probably<00:03:05.370> a

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
is brake light this one is probably a

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.610 
is brake light this one is probably a
signal<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.660> then<00:03:06.780> this<00:03:06.930> one<00:03:07.170> is<00:03:07.350> still

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
signal and then this one is still

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.190 
signal and then this one is still
regular<00:03:08.010> parking<00:03:08.220> light<00:03:08.459> so<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.720> put<00:03:10.080> this

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
regular parking light so to put this

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.470 
regular parking light so to put this
back<00:03:10.410> together<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:11.100> lot<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.360> component

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
back together a lot and component

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.080 
back together a lot and component
push<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.690> in<00:03:15.780> this<00:03:15.989> way<00:03:16.459> put<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.609> hex<00:03:17.790> nuts

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
push it in this way put the hex nuts

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.710 
push it in this way put the hex nuts
back<00:03:18.239> on<00:03:18.480> carefully<00:03:19.109> so<00:03:19.290> we<00:03:19.350> don't<00:03:19.530> drop<00:03:20.070> them

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
back on carefully so we don't drop them

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.250 
back on carefully so we don't drop them
inside<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:22.820> inside<00:03:23.820> here<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.209> then<00:03:24.720> put

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
inside the inside here and then put

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.840 
inside the inside here and then put
these<00:03:25.410> two<00:03:25.799> little<00:03:26.040> things<00:03:26.130> back<00:03:26.430> on<00:03:26.609> and

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
these two little things back on and

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.090 
these two little things back on and
you're<00:03:26.910> done
