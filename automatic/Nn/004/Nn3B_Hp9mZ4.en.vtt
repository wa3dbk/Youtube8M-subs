00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.580
 I have to be able to strengthen my life 

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:11.349
 Singer Lee Seung-hwan said something last year 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:12.210
 I 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.090
 I wanted to go, but the other officials 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.890
 I think only the fourth natural result. It's never possible. 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.909
 No 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:29.390
 mb Because the order is made in succession 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.829
 If you think it's one, 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.030
 A part of today 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.450
 Well, even if it's opened like that, 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.070
 Will not enter 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.710
 However, 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.140
 Best not to do 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.570
 And the second is Korea 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.610
 I'll tell you how to keep it. 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.700
 Just before Cho Pharmaceuticals. 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.990
 The number of discrimination in the health care of citizens who felt burdened 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.180
 I have it 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.440
 Inhibition and the same thing until the third quarter 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.299
 Even if we reduce US consumption, we are in recession. 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.200
 Four things are the same. 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.200
 If you get stuck, 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.520
 The phenomenon is likely to happen 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.520
 As Park Ji-won continues to wave, 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.500
 While the deduction will disappear, it is safe to go inside. 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.109
 It's the best way to keep it. 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:25.410
 asx Turkmenistan 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.810
 Gm's sense of applause and applause is not much 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.980
 Nysterage and publicity, 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.800
 Arrived the same day 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.920
 Remember that 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.300
 To go 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.140
 Come with me at Cheonan 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.120
 In front of students who are in need 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.120
 The car is dancing, including the new one. 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:49.540
 Sometimes, 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.600
 I do not have blood on my head. 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.490
 I can not. 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.670
 It will continue to run in the third quarter. 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.690
 Economy 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.900
 Because it's passed on to the elected candidate, 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.910
 I may not buy it.
