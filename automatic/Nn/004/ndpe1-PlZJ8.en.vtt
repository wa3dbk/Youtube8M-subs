00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
the technician to stop because it was

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:07.340 
the technician to stop because it was
too<00:00:06.660> painful

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
too painful

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.140 
too painful
it<00:00:07.589> was<00:00:07.680> painful<00:00:07.919> on<00:00:08.160> areas<00:00:08.550> that<00:00:08.760> my<00:00:08.880> bones

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
it was painful on areas that my bones

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.730 
it was painful on areas that my bones
are<00:00:09.389> more<00:00:09.510> prominent<00:00:09.780> like<00:00:10.290> say<00:00:10.500> on<00:00:10.620> my

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
are more prominent like say on my

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.039 
are more prominent like say on my
jawline<00:00:11.070> but<00:00:11.790> on<00:00:11.849> areas<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.480> are<00:00:12.630> fleshy

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
jawline but on areas that are fleshy

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.169 
jawline but on areas that are fleshy
like<00:00:13.530> my<00:00:13.679> cheeks<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.370> didn't<00:00:14.670> hurt<00:00:14.790> that<00:00:15.000> old

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
like my cheeks it didn't hurt that old

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.359 
like my cheeks it didn't hurt that old
it's<00:00:15.540> kind<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:15.960> led<00:00:16.109> me<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.410> assume<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:17.160> those

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
it's kind of led me to assume that those

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.250 
it's kind of led me to assume that those
areas<00:00:17.640> weren't<00:00:18.000> being<00:00:18.180> covered<00:00:18.480> because<00:00:19.050> I

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
areas weren't being covered because I

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.140 
areas weren't being covered because I
wasn't<00:00:19.439> feeling<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.890> same<00:00:20.160> intense<00:00:20.520> pain<00:00:20.820> as

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
wasn't feeling the same intense pain as

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.000 
wasn't feeling the same intense pain as
I<00:00:21.300> was<00:00:21.539> before<00:00:21.930> but<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.410> just<00:00:22.560> turns<00:00:22.769> out<00:00:22.949> that

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
I was before but it just turns out that

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.029 
I was before but it just turns out that
different<00:00:23.730> areas<00:00:24.300> work<00:00:25.230> differently<00:00:25.710> now

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
different areas work differently now

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.710
