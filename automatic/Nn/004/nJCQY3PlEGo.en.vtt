00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
the pitch and actually the only real

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.650 
the pitch and actually the only real
goal<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.050> we<00:00:49.230> have<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.829> we<00:00:50.010> are<00:00:50.660> totally

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
goal that we have is that we are totally

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.209 
goal that we have is that we are totally
prepared<00:00:52.230> when<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> first<00:00:52.739> whistle<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.190> blown

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
prepared when the first whistle is blown

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.209 
prepared when the first whistle is blown
so<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.750> how<00:00:54.989> we<00:00:55.050> start<00:00:55.469> how<00:00:55.770> we<00:00:55.829> make<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
so just how we start how we make the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.670 
so just how we start how we make the
position<00:00:56.370> how<00:00:56.910> we<00:00:56.969> will<00:00:57.690> communicate<00:00:57.960> how<00:00:58.620> we

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
position how we will communicate how we

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.490 
position how we will communicate how we
will<00:00:59.010> start<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.730> game<00:00:59.760> how<00:01:00.180> will<00:01:00.539> read<00:01:00.870> the

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
will start the game how will read the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.740 
will start the game how will read the
game<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.010> how<00:01:02.219> we<00:01:02.280> react<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:02.820> some<00:01:03.120> some

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
game and how we react on some some

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.170 
game and how we react on some some
happens<00:01:04.650> things<00:01:05.280> which<00:01:05.489> would<00:01:05.640> happen<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
happens things which would happen in the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.120 
happens things which would happen in the
game<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.540> that's<00:01:06.780> there's<00:01:07.290> microphones<00:01:07.650> it's

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
game so that's there's microphones it's

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.429 
game so that's there's microphones it's
nothing<00:01:08.580> very<00:01:08.700> important<00:01:09.420> but<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.260> to

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
nothing very important but it's just to

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.740 
nothing very important but it's just to

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.370 

some<00:01:49.520> rituals<00:01:50.030> that<00:01:50.270> you<00:01:50.630> have<00:01:50.780> for<00:01:50.990> before<00:01:51.320> a

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
some rituals that you have for before a

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.469 
some rituals that you have for before a

that<00:01:56.750> someone<00:01:57.049> up<00:01:57.200> there<00:01:58.119> that's<00:01:59.119> but<00:01:59.420> such<00:01:59.810> as

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
that someone up there that's but such as

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.149 
that someone up there that's but such as
my<00:02:00.170> private<00:02:00.439> servant<00:02:01.219> patrol<00:02:01.789> in<00:02:02.479> gym<00:02:02.659> I<00:02:03.159> think

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
my private servant patrol in gym I think

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.740 
my private servant patrol in gym I think
every<00:02:04.399> umpire<00:02:04.729> has<00:02:04.969> a<00:02:05.000> few<00:02:05.270> of<00:02:05.299> these<00:02:05.479> things

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
every umpire has a few of these things

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.419 
every umpire has a few of these things
that<00:02:05.990> he<00:02:06.110> needs<00:02:06.319> to<00:02:06.530> do<00:02:06.679> to<00:02:06.950> make<00:02:06.979> sure<00:02:07.189> that

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
that he needs to do to make sure that

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.339 
that he needs to do to make sure that
everything<00:02:08.090> every<00:02:08.390> preparation<00:02:08.690> has<00:02:09.170> been
