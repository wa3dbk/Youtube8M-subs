00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
dumping syndrome and what causes ours is

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.130 
dumping syndrome and what causes ours is
eating<00:03:49.250> on<00:03:49.430> an<00:03:49.549> empty<00:03:49.790> stomach<00:03:50.120> too<00:03:50.690> late<00:03:50.989> in

eating on an empty stomach too late in
the<00:03:51.170> day<00:03:51.400> you<00:03:52.400> know<00:03:52.430> 3:00<00:03:52.850> p.m.<00:03:53.030> maybe<00:03:53.450> too

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
the day you know 3:00 p.m. maybe too

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.199 
the day you know 3:00 p.m. maybe too
late<00:03:54.280> and<00:03:55.280> also<00:03:55.700> eating<00:03:56.269> sour<00:03:56.660> foods

late and also eating sour foods

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.879 
late and also eating sour foods
that's<00:03:59.209> what<00:03:59.389> causes<00:03:59.569> mine<00:03:59.989> some<00:04:00.440> people<00:04:00.739> get

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
that's what causes mine some people get

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:03.039 
that's what causes mine some people get
it<00:04:01.010> from<00:04:01.190> fatty<00:04:01.609> and<00:04:01.850> sugar<00:04:02.120> foods<00:04:02.420> I<00:04:02.569> also<00:04:02.870> get

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
it from fatty and sugar foods I also get

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.010 
it from fatty and sugar foods I also get
it<00:04:03.139> from<00:04:03.230> sugary

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
it from sugary

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.400 
it from sugary
it's<00:04:04.140> like<00:04:04.320> if<00:04:04.440> I<00:04:04.560> were<00:04:04.740> to<00:04:04.920> eat<00:04:05.090> a<00:04:06.090> pastry<00:04:06.930> on

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
it's like if I were to eat a pastry on

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.500 
it's like if I were to eat a pastry on
an<00:04:08.010> empty<00:04:08.250> stomach<00:04:08.550> I<00:04:08.880> would<00:04:09.060> definitely<00:04:09.480> have

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
an empty stomach I would definitely have

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.660 
an empty stomach I would definitely have
dumping<00:04:10.080> syndrome<00:04:10.290> for<00:04:10.770> about<00:04:10.950> an<00:04:11.100> hour

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
dumping syndrome for about an hour

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.810 
dumping syndrome for about an hour
what<00:04:12.270> dumping<00:04:12.630> syndrome<00:04:12.870> feels<00:04:13.500> like<00:04:13.800> is<00:04:14.190> it's

set my body up for eating from 3 to 9
p.m.<00:05:26.400> just<00:05:26.880> a<00:05:27.060> six<00:05:27.330> hour<00:05:27.510> window<00:05:27.630> not<00:05:28.620> an<00:05:28.800> eight

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
p.m. just a six hour window not an eight

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.270 
p.m. just a six hour window not an eight
hour<00:05:29.190> window<00:05:29.670> I<00:05:29.820> think<00:05:30.770> there's<00:05:31.770> too<00:05:32.130> much

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
hour window I think there's too much

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.440 
hour window I think there's too much
room<00:05:32.670> for<00:05:32.910> error<00:05:33.780> when<00:05:34.680> you<00:05:34.860> go<00:05:35.270> the<00:05:36.270> eight

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
room for error when you go the eight

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.310 
room for error when you go the eight
hours<00:05:36.870> so<00:05:37.410> six<00:05:37.890> hours<00:05:38.300> maybe<00:05:39.300> even<00:05:39.600> five<00:05:39.810> hours

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
hours so six hours maybe even five hours

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.010 
hours so six hours maybe even five hours
you<00:05:40.590> know<00:05:40.770> from<00:05:41.190> 3:00<00:05:41.460> to<00:05:41.490> 8:00<00:05:41.850> or<00:05:42.750> whatever

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
you know from 3:00 to 8:00 or whatever

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.110
