00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.270 

backlash<00:00:00.750> is<00:00:01.050> probably<00:00:01.589> one<00:00:01.740> of<00:00:01.770> the<00:00:01.979> first

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
backlash is probably one of the first

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.640 
backlash is probably one of the first
things<00:00:02.760> that<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:03.060> machinist<00:00:03.659> needs<00:00:04.230> to<00:00:04.500> learn

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
things that a machinist needs to learn

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.710 
things that a machinist needs to learn
about<00:00:04.890> not<00:00:05.339> only<00:00:05.609> what<00:00:05.819> it<00:00:05.940> is<00:00:06.120> but<00:00:06.509> how<00:00:06.660> to

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
about not only what it is but how to

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.870 
about not only what it is but how to
deal<00:00:07.020> with<00:00:07.049> it<00:00:07.440> for<00:00:07.770> example<00:00:08.069> here<00:00:08.490> on<00:00:08.760> the

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
deal with it for example here on the

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.390 
deal with it for example here on the
carriage<00:00:09.240> of<00:00:09.420> this<00:00:09.630> lathe<00:00:09.929> you<00:00:10.410> can<00:00:10.920> see<00:00:11.190> as

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
carriage of this lathe you can see as

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.570 
carriage of this lathe you can see as
the<00:00:12.179> direction<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.780> feed<00:00:13.049> has<00:00:13.290> changed<00:00:13.920> there

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
the direction of feed has changed there

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.779 
the direction of feed has changed there
is<00:00:14.820> some<00:00:15.360> play<00:00:15.630> or<00:00:15.870> backlash<00:00:16.619> up<00:00:17.190> higher<00:00:17.490> on

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
is some play or backlash up higher on

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.230 
is some play or backlash up higher on
the<00:00:18.119> cross<00:00:18.359> slide<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.230> compound<00:00:20.060> we<00:00:21.060> are

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
the cross slide and the compound we are

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:36.500 
the cross slide and the compound we are
graduated<00:00:21.960> in<00:00:33.770> 1802<00:00:34.770> lit<00:00:34.950> engages<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.820> we<00:00:36.329> can

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
graduated in 1802 lit engages and we can

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.780 
graduated in 1802 lit engages and we can
see<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.140> have<00:00:37.350> about<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:38.129> little<00:00:38.520> less

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
see that we have about a little less

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.819 
see that we have about a little less
than<00:00:39.030> four<00:00:39.360> thousandths<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.110> an<00:00:40.469> inch

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
than four thousandths of an inch

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.580 
than four thousandths of an inch
backlash<00:00:41.550> before<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.660> talk<00:00:42.870> about<00:00:43.020> how<00:00:43.530> to

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
backlash before we talk about how to

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.150 
backlash before we talk about how to
deal<00:00:44.250> with<00:00:44.280> backlash<00:00:45.260> let's<00:00:46.260> talk<00:00:46.680> about<00:00:46.829> what

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
deal with backlash let's talk about what

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
deal with backlash let's talk about what
backlash<00:00:47.670> actually<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:49.039> probably<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.370> good<00:00:51.000> way

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
backlash actually is probably a good way

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.500 
backlash actually is probably a good way
to<00:00:51.239> describe<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.430> the<00:00:53.430> play<00:00:53.760> or<00:00:54.120> slop

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
to describe it is the play or slop

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.740 
to describe it is the play or slop
between<00:00:55.230> two<00:00:56.070> mechanical<00:00:56.850> parts<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.360> engage

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
between two mechanical parts that engage

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.979 
between two mechanical parts that engage
each<00:00:57.989> other<00:00:58.260> for<00:00:58.949> example<00:00:59.059> this<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.600> feed

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
each other for example this is a feed

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.369 
each other for example this is a feed
screw<00:01:01.350> if<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:02.670> look<00:01:02.910> very<00:01:02.940> closely<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:04.350> can

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
screw if we look very closely we can

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.570 
screw if we look very closely we can
wiggle<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:05.129> nut<00:01:05.430> right<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.510> feed<00:01:06.720> screw

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
wiggle this nut right on the feed screw

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.240 
wiggle this nut right on the feed screw
that's<00:01:08.580> because<00:01:09.119> they<00:01:09.570> are<00:01:09.869> not<00:01:10.380> perfectly

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
that's because they are not perfectly

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.280 
that's because they are not perfectly
engaged<00:01:11.760> there<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> little<00:01:12.780> bit<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.080> room

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
engaged there is a little bit of room

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.980 
engaged there is a little bit of room
between<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.799> threads<00:01:14.240> so<00:01:15.240> believe<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.750> or<00:01:15.840> not

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
between the threads so believe it or not

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.230 
between the threads so believe it or not
this<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.470> by<00:01:16.650> design<00:01:16.890> without<00:01:17.520> backlash

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
this is by design without backlash

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.719 
this is by design without backlash
mechanical<00:01:19.110> devices<00:01:19.439> could<00:01:19.979> bind<00:01:20.220> up<00:01:20.490> and

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
mechanical devices could bind up and

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.649 
mechanical devices could bind up and
break<00:01:21.450> themselves<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:23.700> cause<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:23.970> backlash

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
break themselves the cause of backlash

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.230 
break themselves the cause of backlash
can<00:01:25.110> be<00:01:25.290> easily<00:01:25.680> explained<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.790> simple

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
can be easily explained with a simple

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.080 
can be easily explained with a simple
diagram<00:01:27.650> here<00:01:28.650> are<00:01:28.860> some<00:01:29.130> threads<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.790> here's

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
diagram here are some threads and here's

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.569 
diagram here are some threads and here's
the<00:01:30.299> threads<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.930> engage<00:01:31.409> now<00:01:32.100> typically

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
the threads that engage now typically

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.550 
the threads that engage now typically
when<00:01:32.850> threads<00:01:33.210> engage<00:01:33.630> they<00:01:33.960> don't<00:01:34.170> bottom

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
when threads engage they don't bottom

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.020 
when threads engage they don't bottom
out<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.890> each<00:01:35.040> other<00:01:35.250> they<00:01:35.460> look<00:01:35.670> something

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
out on each other they look something

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.260 
out on each other they look something
like<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.979> can<00:01:38.009> see<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.759> there<00:01:39.030> is

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
like this so you can see that there is

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.060 
like this so you can see that there is
some<00:01:39.630> clearance<00:01:39.990> between<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.470> threads<00:01:40.740> and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
some clearance between the threads and

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.069 
some clearance between the threads and
when<00:01:41.460> we<00:01:41.610> start<00:01:41.880> feeding<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.450> direction

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
when we start feeding this direction

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.210 
when we start feeding this direction
we're<00:01:43.590> going<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:44.009> encounter<00:01:44.340> backlash<00:01:45.329> where

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
we're going to encounter backlash where

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.889 
we're going to encounter backlash where
there<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.369> movement<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.090> part<00:01:48.420> but<00:01:48.659> not

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
there is movement of this part but not

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.980 
there is movement of this part but not
of<00:01:49.229> our<00:01:49.500> part<00:01:50.220> up<00:01:50.430> top<00:01:50.729> now<00:01:51.479> we've<00:01:51.750> made

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
of our part up top now we've made

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.770 
of our part up top now we've made
contact<00:01:52.579> if<00:01:53.579> we<00:01:53.850> continue<00:01:54.299> feeding<00:01:54.659> this

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
contact if we continue feeding this

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.840 
contact if we continue feeding this
direction<00:01:55.320> we<00:01:55.470> will<00:01:55.619> have<00:01:55.860> smooth<00:01:56.280> movement

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
direction we will have smooth movement

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.780 
direction we will have smooth movement
we've<00:01:57.329> taken<00:01:57.840> up<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.320> backlash<00:01:58.799> where<00:01:59.610> you're

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
we've taken up the backlash where you're

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.940 
we've taken up the backlash where you're
going<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.000> see<00:02:00.180> backlash<00:02:00.689> again<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.350> when<00:02:01.860> you

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
going to see backlash again is when you

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.280 
going to see backlash again is when you
reverse<00:02:02.340> direction<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:03.450> start<00:02:03.750> coming<00:02:03.960> this

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
reverse direction you start coming this

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.260 
reverse direction you start coming this
way<00:02:04.500> we're<00:02:04.740> encountering<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.460> backlash<00:02:05.939> and

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
way we're encountering the backlash and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.660 
way we're encountering the backlash and
there<00:02:06.810> we've<00:02:07.020> taken<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.560> up<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.920> now<00:02:08.399> our

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
there we've taken it up and now our

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.630 
there we've taken it up and now our
upper<00:02:09.090> part<00:02:09.360> will<00:02:09.569> start<00:02:09.840> moving<00:02:10.110> smoothly

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
upper part will start moving smoothly

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.500 
upper part will start moving smoothly
now<00:02:11.730> some<00:02:12.450> backlash<00:02:12.930> is<00:02:13.260> important<00:02:13.770> because

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
now some backlash is important because

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.270 
now some backlash is important because
binding<00:02:15.510> will<00:02:15.780> occur<00:02:16.110> if<00:02:16.380> all<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.830> this<00:02:17.010> stuff

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
binding will occur if all of this stuff

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.540

at other potential causes of backlash if

at other potential causes of backlash if
we<00:02:30.209> look<00:02:30.420> at<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.690> feet<00:02:30.930> on<00:02:31.110> this<00:02:31.260> mini<00:02:31.560> mill

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.690 

we<00:02:41.670> move<00:02:42.270> it<00:02:42.420> backwards<00:02:42.930> until<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.440> engages<00:02:43.800> we

lot of problems the little nut here that

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.250 
lot of problems the little nut here that

loose and when that happens
we've<00:03:03.750> got<00:03:03.989> play<00:03:04.260> there<00:03:05.780> now<00:03:06.780> if<00:03:07.470> we<00:03:07.769> go<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.760> we

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
we've got play there now if we go and we

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.840 
we've got play there now if we go and we
pick<00:03:10.050> up<00:03:10.080> our<00:03:10.380> slack<00:03:10.739> we've<00:03:11.220> taken<00:03:11.489> up<00:03:11.700> the

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
pick up our slack we've taken up the

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.220 
pick up our slack we've taken up the
backlash<00:03:12.300> we<00:03:13.080> stop<00:03:13.350> there<00:03:14.600> then<00:03:15.600> you<00:03:15.750> can<00:03:15.959> see

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
backlash we stop there then you can see

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.970 
backlash we stop there then you can see
going<00:03:17.160> back<00:03:17.400> now<00:03:18.030> we<00:03:18.090> have<00:03:18.510> about<00:03:20.209> 26<00:03:21.209> 27

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
going back now we have about 26 27

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.009 
going back now we have about 26 27
thousandths<00:03:22.980> of<00:03:23.070> an<00:03:23.220> inch<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:24.450> backlash

thousandths of an inch to backlash

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.770 
thousandths of an inch to backlash
that's<00:03:25.680> pretty<00:03:26.010> extreme<00:03:26.549> so<00:03:27.299> this<00:03:27.540> goes<00:03:27.750> to

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
that's pretty extreme so this goes to

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.140 
that's pretty extreme so this goes to
show<00:03:27.989> how<00:03:28.410> there<00:03:28.860> are<00:03:29.040> other<00:03:29.280> things<00:03:29.640> that<00:03:29.850> can

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
show how there are other things that can

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.590 
show how there are other things that can
affect<00:03:30.350> backlash<00:03:31.350> such<00:03:32.190> as<00:03:32.459> this<00:03:33.120> little<00:03:33.390> nut

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
affect backlash such as this little nut

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.509 
affect backlash such as this little nut
here<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.290> tightness<00:03:34.530> of<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:34.980> handle<00:03:35.370> a

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
here the tightness of the handle a

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.880 
here the tightness of the handle a
simple<00:03:36.150> fix<00:03:36.360> for<00:03:36.600> this<00:03:36.720> is<00:03:36.959> a<00:03:37.019> second<00:03:37.680> nut

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
simple fix for this is a second nut

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.979 
simple fix for this is a second nut
that's<00:03:38.220> supposed<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:38.670> be<00:03:38.760> on<00:03:39.000> there<00:03:39.239> to<00:03:39.840> keep

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
that's supposed to be on there to keep

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.949 
that's supposed to be on there to keep
the<00:03:40.170> first<00:03:40.410> one<00:03:40.590> from<00:03:40.799> backing<00:03:41.010> off<00:03:41.959> another

the first one from backing off another
source<00:03:43.320> of<00:03:43.530> play<00:03:43.769> can<00:03:44.100> be<00:03:44.220> easily<00:03:44.430> represented

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
source of play can be easily represented

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.270 
source of play can be easily represented
by<00:03:45.989> looking<00:03:46.440> at<00:03:46.620> how<00:03:47.100> our<00:03:47.130> feed<00:03:47.640> screw<00:03:48.030> nut

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
by looking at how our feed screw nut

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.140 
by looking at how our feed screw nut
interfaces<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:51.180> our<00:03:51.329> device<00:03:52.820> simply<00:03:53.820> with<00:03:54.120> a

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
interfaces to our device simply with a

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.930 
interfaces to our device simply with a
screw<00:03:54.600> that<00:03:55.380> screw<00:03:55.680> is<00:03:56.070> loose<00:03:57.019> and<00:03:58.019> that

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
screw that screw is loose and that

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.690 
screw that screw is loose and that
results<00:03:59.940> in<00:04:00.000> play<00:04:00.600> of<00:04:00.840> this<00:04:01.829> whole<00:04:02.070> nut<00:04:02.370> and

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
results in play of this whole nut and

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.660 
results in play of this whole nut and
that's<00:04:03.450> also<00:04:03.690> going<00:04:04.110> to<00:04:04.290> result<00:04:05.130> in<00:04:05.250> play

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
that's also going to result in play

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.020 
that's also going to result in play
during<00:04:06.540> movement<00:04:06.900> so<00:04:07.880> checking<00:04:08.880> your

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
during movement so checking your

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.319 
during movement so checking your
machines<00:04:09.390> for<00:04:10.140> things<00:04:10.350> as<00:04:10.590> simple<00:04:10.950> as<00:04:11.190> that<00:04:11.970> is

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
machines for things as simple as that is

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.990 
machines for things as simple as that is
another<00:04:13.049> good<00:04:13.320> way<00:04:13.500> to<00:04:13.530> reduce<00:04:13.920> backlash<00:04:14.670> and

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
another good way to reduce backlash and

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.870 
another good way to reduce backlash and
fine-tune<00:04:15.780> things<00:04:16.130> once<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.280> understand

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
fine-tune things once you understand

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.539 
fine-tune things once you understand
backlash<00:04:18.450> working<00:04:19.320> with<00:04:19.470> it<00:04:19.620> is<00:04:19.769> simple<00:04:20.220> let's

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
backlash working with it is simple let's

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.670 
backlash working with it is simple let's
say<00:04:20.669> that<00:04:20.970> we<00:04:21.120> want<00:04:21.330> to<00:04:21.479> move<00:04:21.630> ten<00:04:22.109> thousandths

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
say that we want to move ten thousandths

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.580 
say that we want to move ten thousandths
in<00:04:22.800> that<00:04:22.950> direction<00:04:23.160> but<00:04:24.060> here<00:04:24.930> we've<00:04:25.260> got

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
in that direction but here we've got

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.070 
in that direction but here we've got
our<00:04:25.680> backlash<00:04:26.220> to<00:04:26.460> deal<00:04:26.669> with<00:04:26.910> what<00:04:27.810> we<00:04:27.930> will

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
our backlash to deal with what we will

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.320 
our backlash to deal with what we will
first<00:04:28.320> do<00:04:28.590> is<00:04:28.800> will<00:04:29.190> move<00:04:29.430> in<00:04:29.639> the<00:04:29.760> opposite

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
first do is will move in the opposite

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.800 
first do is will move in the opposite
direction<00:04:30.510> and<00:04:31.610> then<00:04:32.610> now<00:04:33.030> we're<00:04:33.419> gonna<00:04:33.540> move

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
direction and then now we're gonna move

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.980 
direction and then now we're gonna move
in<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.199> direction<00:04:34.530> of<00:04:34.889> travel<00:04:35.430> and<00:04:35.990> right

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
in the direction of travel and right

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.960 
in the direction of travel and right
there<00:04:37.260> we've<00:04:37.650> just<00:04:37.949> removed<00:04:38.130> our<00:04:38.520> backlash

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
there we've just removed our backlash

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.480 
there we've just removed our backlash
from<00:04:39.810> this<00:04:39.960> point<00:04:40.229> forward<00:04:40.560> our<00:04:40.800> readings<00:04:41.250> on

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
from this point forward our readings on

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.800 
from this point forward our readings on
the<00:04:41.639> graduated<00:04:42.270> dial<00:04:42.510> will<00:04:42.870> be<00:04:43.050> accurate<00:04:43.760> and

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
the graduated dial will be accurate and

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.840 
the graduated dial will be accurate and
we<00:04:45.810> can<00:04:46.020> go<00:04:46.139> ahead<00:04:46.290> and<00:04:46.710> now<00:04:47.190> take<00:04:47.669> our

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
we can go ahead and now take our

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.020 
we can go ahead and now take our
10,000th<00:04:48.780> and<00:04:49.080> we<00:04:49.949> know<00:04:50.160> that<00:04:50.430> that's<00:04:50.669> truly

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
10,000th and we know that that's truly

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.450 
10,000th and we know that that's truly
what<00:04:51.419> we<00:04:51.570> got<00:04:52.100> now<00:04:53.100> if<00:04:53.460> we<00:04:54.030> started<00:04:54.960> here<00:04:55.440> and<00:04:55.560> I

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
what we got now if we started here and I

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.980 
what we got now if we started here and I
just<00:04:56.490> turned<00:04:56.910> in<00:04:57.120> the<00:04:57.210> opposite<00:04:57.810> direction

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
just turned in the opposite direction

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.610 
just turned in the opposite direction
and<00:04:58.500> we<00:04:59.100> tried<00:04:59.340> to<00:04:59.520> cut<00:04:59.729> ten<00:05:00.000> thousandths<00:05:00.630> well

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
and we tried to cut ten thousandths well

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.770 
and we tried to cut ten thousandths well
we<00:05:01.860> just<00:05:02.040> lost<00:05:02.310> four<00:05:02.610> thousands<00:05:03.150> to<00:05:03.300> backlash

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
we just lost four thousands to backlash

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.550 
we just lost four thousands to backlash
and<00:05:04.110> our<00:05:04.650> cut<00:05:04.950> is<00:05:05.160> now<00:05:05.790> only<00:05:06.510> six<00:05:06.870> thousands

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
and our cut is now only six thousands

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.210 
and our cut is now only six thousands
the<00:05:08.430> same<00:05:08.700> concept<00:05:09.330> goes<00:05:09.660> for<00:05:09.960> milling<00:05:10.350> if<00:05:10.470> you

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
the same concept goes for milling if you

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.370 
the same concept goes for milling if you
want<00:05:11.490> your<00:05:12.000> readings<00:05:12.389> to<00:05:12.600> be<00:05:12.720> accurate<00:05:13.200> in

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
want your readings to be accurate in

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.770 
want your readings to be accurate in
that<00:05:13.560> direction<00:05:13.910> first<00:05:14.910> you<00:05:15.270> move<00:05:15.510> in<00:05:15.690> the

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
that direction first you move in the

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.909 
that direction first you move in the
opposite<00:05:16.350> direction<00:05:16.500> and<00:05:17.070> then<00:05:18.110> reverse<00:05:19.110> so

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
opposite direction and then reverse so

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.340 
opposite direction and then reverse so
take<00:05:20.190> up<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:20.520> backlash<00:05:21.030> and<00:05:21.450> at<00:05:21.840> that<00:05:22.080> point

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
take up the backlash and at that point

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.279 
take up the backlash and at that point
you<00:05:22.860> can<00:05:23.130> make<00:05:23.580> your<00:05:23.820> cuts<00:05:24.150> one<00:05:24.720> thing<00:05:24.990> to<00:05:25.139> keep

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
you can make your cuts one thing to keep

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.230 
you can make your cuts one thing to keep
in<00:05:25.500> mind<00:05:25.560> is<00:05:26.210> making<00:05:27.210> cuts<00:05:27.570> that<00:05:28.080> will<00:05:28.260> fight

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
in mind is making cuts that will fight

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.750 
in mind is making cuts that will fight
against<00:05:30.240> your<00:05:30.780> direction<00:05:31.320> of<00:05:31.470> feed<00:05:31.710> here's<00:05:32.669> a

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
against your direction of feed here's a

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.540 
against your direction of feed here's a
very<00:05:33.030> simple<00:05:33.479> example<00:05:33.600> on<00:05:34.260> the<00:05:34.770> mill<00:05:35.010> let's

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
very simple example on the mill let's

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.940 
very simple example on the mill let's
say<00:05:35.789> this<00:05:36.030> is<00:05:36.240> your<00:05:36.419> feed<00:05:36.750> screw<00:05:37.139> and<00:05:37.410> this

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
say this is your feed screw and this

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.000 
say this is your feed screw and this
represents<00:05:38.789> the<00:05:39.210> table<00:05:39.720> and<00:05:39.930> our<00:05:40.560> piece<00:05:40.800> of

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
represents the table and our piece of

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.960 
represents the table and our piece of
work<00:05:41.280> that<00:05:41.520> we're<00:05:41.700> cutting<00:05:41.970> now

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
work that we're cutting now

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.080 
work that we're cutting now
here<00:05:44.970> we<00:05:45.150> have<00:05:45.389> taken<00:05:46.050> up<00:05:46.349> the<00:05:46.500> slack<00:05:46.910> so<00:05:47.910> we're

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
here we have taken up the slack so we're

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.029 
here we have taken up the slack so we're
in<00:05:48.240> contact<00:05:48.810> here<00:05:49.139> we're<00:05:49.440> feeding<00:05:49.740> that

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
in contact here we're feeding that

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.690 
in contact here we're feeding that
direction<00:05:50.630> everything's<00:05:51.630> good<00:05:51.930> and<00:05:52.700> our

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
direction everything's good and our

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.529 
direction everything's good and our
cutter<00:05:54.080> is<00:05:55.080> turning<00:05:55.620> like<00:05:55.800> this<00:05:55.830> and<00:05:56.550> life<00:05:57.300> is

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 
cutter is turning like this and life is

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:00.379 
cutter is turning like this and life is
good<00:05:57.750> or<00:05:58.229> milling<00:05:58.710> well<00:05:59.460> what<00:05:59.940> if<00:06:00.060> we<00:06:00.240> were

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
good or milling well what if we were

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:03.350 
good or milling well what if we were
feeding<00:06:00.630> the<00:06:00.930> opposite<00:06:01.500> direction<00:06:01.940> well<00:06:02.940> then

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
feeding the opposite direction well then

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.120 
feeding the opposite direction well then
the<00:06:03.539> cutter<00:06:03.780> would<00:06:04.080> be<00:06:04.229> interfacing<00:06:04.950> like

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
the cutter would be interfacing like

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.830 
the cutter would be interfacing like
this<00:06:05.570> and<00:06:06.570> when<00:06:07.349> it<00:06:07.470> bites<00:06:07.710> down<00:06:08.039> right<00:06:08.370> here

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 
this and when it bites down right here

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.810 
this and when it bites down right here
it's<00:06:09.840> going<00:06:10.169> to<00:06:10.289> want<00:06:10.500> to<00:06:10.620> yank<00:06:11.010> this

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
it's going to want to yank this

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.570 
it's going to want to yank this
workpiece<00:06:12.650> forward<00:06:13.650> in<00:06:13.830> the<00:06:14.070> direction<00:06:14.370> of

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
workpiece forward in the direction of

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.900 
workpiece forward in the direction of
travel<00:06:14.880> and<00:06:15.419> because<00:06:16.229> we've<00:06:16.860> got<00:06:17.190> this<00:06:17.610> play

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
travel and because we've got this play

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.020 
travel and because we've got this play
right<00:06:18.210> here<00:06:18.860> it's<00:06:19.860> able<00:06:20.130> to<00:06:20.250> do<00:06:20.520> that<00:06:20.700> which

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
right here it's able to do that which

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.570 
right here it's able to do that which
means<00:06:21.300> now<00:06:21.720> we've<00:06:22.080> introduced<00:06:22.770> some

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
means now we've introduced some

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.450 
means now we've introduced some
instability<00:06:24.090> to<00:06:24.780> our<00:06:24.930> work<00:06:25.260> now<00:06:25.889> simply

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
instability to our work now simply

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.330 
instability to our work now simply
planning<00:06:26.760> your<00:06:27.060> cuts<00:06:27.360> so<00:06:28.169> that<00:06:28.200> the<00:06:28.500> cutter<00:06:28.860> is

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
planning your cuts so that the cutter is

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.450 
planning your cuts so that the cutter is
moving<00:06:30.229> against<00:06:31.229> the<00:06:31.560> direction<00:06:32.070> of<00:06:32.190> travel

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
moving against the direction of travel

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.360 
moving against the direction of travel
is<00:06:32.789> the<00:06:33.360> way<00:06:33.539> to<00:06:33.960> compensate<00:06:34.289> and<00:06:34.800> avoid<00:06:35.070> that

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
is the way to compensate and avoid that

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.300 
is the way to compensate and avoid that
on<00:06:35.610> most<00:06:36.539> devices<00:06:37.409> you're<00:06:37.620> going<00:06:37.830> to<00:06:37.950> want<00:06:38.159> to

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.310 
on most devices you're going to want to

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.830 
on most devices you're going to want to
have<00:06:38.520> at<00:06:38.789> least

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 
have at least

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.680 
have at least
a<00:06:39.900> couple<00:06:40.590> thousandth<00:06:41.160> inch<00:06:41.400> of<00:06:41.850> backlash<00:06:42.360> and

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690 
a couple thousandth inch of backlash and

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.680 
a couple thousandth inch of backlash and
as<00:06:43.380> mentioned<00:06:44.250> previously<00:06:44.330> that's<00:06:45.330> to<00:06:45.570> allow

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690 
as mentioned previously that's to allow

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.310 
as mentioned previously that's to allow
room<00:06:46.680> to<00:06:46.919> prevent<00:06:47.310> binding<00:06:47.520> in<00:06:47.910> to<00:06:48.120> allow

mechanical interfaces and remember even
large<00:06:54.780> amounts<00:06:55.260> of<00:06:55.350> backlash<00:06:55.830> which<00:06:56.520> can<00:06:56.820> be

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 
large amounts of backlash which can be

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.330 
large amounts of backlash which can be
the<00:06:57.090> result<00:06:57.479> of<00:06:57.600> worn<00:06:57.870> parts<00:06:58.139> can<00:06:58.979> be<00:06:59.130> easily

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 
the result of worn parts can be easily

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.610 
the result of worn parts can be easily
dealt<00:06:59.790> with<00:06:59.910> as<00:07:00.210> long<00:07:00.630> as<00:07:00.780> you<00:07:00.900> get<00:07:01.139> used<00:07:01.350> to
