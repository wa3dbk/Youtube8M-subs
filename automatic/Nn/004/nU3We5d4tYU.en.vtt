just from our first preview is this

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.500 
just from our first preview is this
squad<00:00:18.660> idea<00:00:18.960> isn't<00:00:19.199> like<00:00:19.529> squads<00:00:20.010> close<00:00:20.730> by<00:00:21.090> it

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510

squad idea isn't like squads close by it
is<00:00:21.689> still<00:00:21.900> small<00:00:22.199> sales<00:00:22.500> combat<00:00:23.010> but<00:00:23.609> on<00:00:24.330> a

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
is still small sales combat but on a

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.089 
is still small sales combat but on a
very<00:00:24.480> large<00:00:24.750> map<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.199> how<00:00:25.710> are<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:25.949> guys

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
very large map so how are you guys

very large map so how are you guys
making<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.580> maps<00:00:26.880> work<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.539> these

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
making the maps work so that these

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.060 
making the maps work so that these
squads<00:00:27.990> are<00:00:28.199> spread<00:00:28.500> out<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.769> have<00:00:28.920> all<00:00:29.010> these

that's all these squads are doing and

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:47.990 
that's all these squads are doing and
independent<00:00:47.280> things<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.700> then<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.879> also

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
independent things and then it also

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.549 
independent things and then it also
knows<00:00:48.360> like<00:00:48.600> what's<00:00:48.780> going<00:00:49.020> on<00:00:49.289> with<00:00:49.500> the

knows like what's going on with the
different<00:00:49.770> squad<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.129> if<00:00:50.219> one<00:00:50.340> squad<00:00:50.640> is

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
different squad so if one squad is

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.910 
different squad so if one squad is
losing<00:00:51.210> badly<00:00:51.420> squee<00:00:52.140> hey<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.680> guys<00:00:52.770> are

doing really well hey go reinforce them
so<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.469> game<00:00:55.649> really<00:00:55.890> keeps<00:00:56.129> track<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.399> what

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
so the game really keeps track of what

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.619 
so the game really keeps track of what
the<00:00:56.670> different<00:00:56.879> squads<00:00:57.059> are<00:00:57.270> doing<00:00:57.449> its

I know you guys are evolving this as it

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.990 
I know you guys are evolving this as it
goes<00:01:35.159> along<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.579> one<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.880> new<00:01:35.970> ones

goes along is that one of the new ones
you<00:01:36.210> put<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.689> whole<00:01:37.049> concept<00:01:37.380> goes<00:01:37.560> back

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
you put in the whole concept goes back

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.740 
you put in the whole concept goes back
to<00:01:37.950> rewarding<00:01:38.520> players<00:01:38.729> for<00:01:39.000> doing<00:01:39.299> what<00:01:39.600> we

want them to do in playing a fun

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.560 
want them to do in playing a fun
competitive<00:01:41.189> game<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.060> if<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.270> do<00:01:42.390> that

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
competitive game and if you do that

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.730 
competitive game and if you do that
you're<00:01:42.720> going<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.869> advance<00:01:43.229> through<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.530> game

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
you're going to advance through the game

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.310 
you're going to advance through the game
modes<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.310> advanced<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.939> multiplayer<00:01:45.329> so

modes and advanced and multiplayer so

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.200 
modes and advanced and multiplayer so
what<00:01:46.710> I'm<00:01:46.770> understanding<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.490> if<00:01:47.759> it

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
what I'm understanding that is if it

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.539 
what I'm understanding that is if it
spawns<00:01:48.570> not<00:01:48.750> doing<00:01:49.020> well<00:01:49.170> then<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.399> get<00:01:50.520> to

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
spawns not doing well then you get to

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.920 
spawns not doing well then you get to

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.109 
their own thing exactly so one squad
after<00:02:07.890> you've<00:02:08.129> completed<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.580> attack<00:02:08.910> than

that
you<00:02:10.140> reinforce<00:02:10.560> might<00:02:10.769> stay<00:02:10.950> behind<00:02:11.099> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
you reinforce might stay behind the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.679 
you reinforce might stay behind the
defend<00:02:11.610> will<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.909> go<00:02:12.060> reinforced<00:02:12.510> someone

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:12.689 
defend will you go reinforced someone

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:14.030 
defend will you go reinforced someone
else<00:02:12.810> or<00:02:12.989> go<00:02:13.079> attack<00:02:13.319> something<00:02:13.680> else<00:02:13.860> a

else or go attack something else a

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.059 
else or go attack something else a
regroup<00:02:14.519> so<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.689> objectives<00:02:16.650> for<00:02:16.709> each<00:02:16.769> squad

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
regroup so the objectives for each squad

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.649 
regroup so the objectives for each squad
will<00:02:17.220> change<00:02:17.489> after<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.909> squad's<00:02:18.150> merge<00:02:18.420> and

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
will change after the squad's merge and

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:19.880 
will change after the squad's merge and
they'll<00:02:18.780> kind<00:02:18.989> of<00:02:19.110> go<00:02:19.409> their<00:02:19.560> separate<00:02:19.829> ways

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
they'll kind of go their separate ways

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.979 
they'll kind of go their separate ways
again<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:20.700> along<00:02:20.909> with<00:02:20.970> alone<00:02:21.659> is<00:02:21.780> playing

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
again so along with alone is playing

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.240 
again so along with alone is playing
with<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.319> way<00:02:22.530> they<00:02:22.680> look<00:02:22.709> you've<00:02:23.159> obviously

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
with the way they look you've obviously

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.740 
with the way they look you've obviously

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
they come up behind you or there is a

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.470 
they come up behind you or there is a
small<00:03:08.280> little<00:03:08.430> gap<00:03:08.670> right<00:03:08.879> where<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.120> nozzle

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
small little gap right where the nozzle

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.369 
small little gap right where the nozzle
comes<00:03:09.629> out<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:09.840> if<00:03:09.900> they're<00:03:10.019> a<00:03:10.049> good<00:03:10.200> sniper

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
comes out so if they're a good sniper

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:11.569 
comes out so if they're a good sniper
they<00:03:10.680> might<00:03:10.799> be<00:03:10.889> able<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.069> hit<00:03:11.159> you<00:03:11.280> right<00:03:11.400> to

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
they might be able to hit you right to

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.460 
they might be able to hit you right to
the<00:03:11.670> gap<00:03:11.849> but<00:03:12.120> chances<00:03:12.989> are<00:03:13.109> you're<00:03:13.230> gonna<00:03:13.290> be

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
the gap but chances are you're gonna be

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.530 
the gap but chances are you're gonna be
pretty<00:03:13.590> safe<00:03:13.859> for<00:03:14.069> a<00:03:14.099> little<00:03:14.250> bit<00:03:14.430> alright<00:03:15.389> so

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
pretty safe for a little bit alright so

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.849 
pretty safe for a little bit alright so
the<00:03:15.810> way<00:03:15.900> we're<00:03:16.049> seeing<00:03:16.230> this<00:03:16.319> game<00:03:16.500> run<00:03:16.709> right

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
the way we're seeing this game run right

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.349 
the way we're seeing this game run right
now<00:03:17.010> is<00:03:17.250> that<00:03:17.370> you<00:03:17.489> got<00:03:17.609> a<00:03:17.639> couple<00:03:17.819> of<00:03:17.970> bars<00:03:18.150> up

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
now is that you got a couple of bars up

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.449 
now is that you got a couple of bars up
here<00:03:18.569> that<00:03:18.780> show<00:03:18.989> how<00:03:19.709> each<00:03:19.859> team's<00:03:20.160> doing

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
here that show how each team's doing

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:21.680 
here that show how each team's doing
blue<00:03:20.639> versus<00:03:20.940> red<00:03:20.970> right<00:03:21.329> and<00:03:21.480> then<00:03:21.569> you've

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
blue versus red right and then you've

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.879 
blue versus red right and then you've
got<00:03:21.720> like<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:21.959> push-pull<00:03:22.379> meter<00:03:22.560> underneath

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
got like a push-pull meter underneath

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:24.890 
got like a push-pull meter underneath
the<00:03:22.949> map<00:03:23.160> is<00:03:23.699> that<00:03:23.879> how<00:03:24.359> else<00:03:24.540> do<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:24.750> see

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
the map is that how else do you see

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.110 
the map is that how else do you see
these<00:03:25.139> 60<00:03:25.530> man<00:03:25.680> maps<00:03:26.099> going<00:03:26.430> because<00:03:26.669> it's

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
these 60 man maps going because it's

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.729 
these 60 man maps going because it's
something<00:03:27.299> where<00:03:27.510> you<00:03:27.720> could<00:03:27.840> really<00:03:27.959> have<00:03:28.319> a

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
something where you could really have a

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.520 
something where you could really have a
like<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.579> big<00:03:29.909> win<00:03:30.180> moment<00:03:30.629> if<00:03:30.720> your<00:03:30.840> teams<00:03:31.079> are

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
like a big win moment if your teams are

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.319 
like a big win moment if your teams are
all<00:03:31.680> able<00:03:31.829> to<00:03:31.980> work<00:03:32.099> together<00:03:32.250> right<00:03:32.669> yeah<00:03:33.299> I

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
all able to work together right yeah I

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.000 
all able to work together right yeah I
mean<00:03:33.599> we<00:03:33.720> haven't<00:03:33.870> gotten<00:03:34.109> to<00:03:34.230> all<00:03:34.680> of<00:03:34.889> those

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
mean we haven't gotten to all of those

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.710 
mean we haven't gotten to all of those
details<00:03:35.310> yet<00:03:35.639> so<00:03:35.790> it's<00:03:35.909> like<00:03:36.060> we're<00:03:36.299> not

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
details yet so it's like we're not

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.939 
details yet so it's like we're not
showing<00:03:37.049> everything<00:03:37.290> we're<00:03:37.620> still<00:03:37.799> working

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:37.949 
showing everything we're still working

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:40.069 
showing everything we're still working
out<00:03:38.280> everything<00:03:38.669> and<00:03:38.790> how<00:03:38.909> the<00:03:38.970> exact<00:03:39.870> end

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
out everything and how the exact end

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.420 
out everything and how the exact end
game<00:03:40.260> plays<00:03:40.470> out<00:03:40.680> right<00:03:40.709> now<00:03:41.010> it's<00:03:41.159> point

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
game plays out right now it's point

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.490 
game plays out right now it's point
based<00:03:41.669> who<00:03:42.299> can<00:03:42.449> score<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.720> most<00:03:42.810> points<00:03:42.959> but

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
based who can score the most points but

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.990 
based who can score the most points but
we<00:03:43.919> think<00:03:44.310> they'll<00:03:44.489> probably<00:03:44.639> a<00:03:44.849> few

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
we think they'll probably a few

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.969 
we think they'll probably a few
surprises<00:03:45.120> before<00:03:45.569> we<00:03:46.319> show<00:03:46.470> it<00:03:46.590> again<00:03:46.680> you

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:46.979 
surprises before we show it again you

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:48.920 
surprises before we show it again you
also<00:03:47.129> talked<00:03:47.459> about<00:03:47.489> using<00:03:48.030> some<00:03:48.269> mechanics

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
also talked about using some mechanics

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.479 
also talked about using some mechanics
like<00:03:49.079> pulling<00:03:49.440> squads<00:03:49.799> together<00:03:50.220> in

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
like pulling squads together in

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.099 
like pulling squads together in
different<00:03:50.609> ways<00:03:50.879> so<00:03:51.209> she<00:03:51.269> could<00:03:51.510> because<00:03:52.049> the

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
different ways so she could because the
