00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.839
 on this bike we will perform the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.820
 dance setting we then chained this 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:21.359
 machine actually we can see well 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.529
 that the chain is very relaxed we 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.099
 let's check that she did not have 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:31.260
 particular hard points the first 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:34.320
 operation is going to be loosening the kz2 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.340
 rear wheel then to loosen our 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.980
 rear wheel nut the thing not to 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:46.020
 to do is to position oneself like that 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.600
 and two shots and so towards me everything 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.129
 simply 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.559
 because the motorcycle risks this crime 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.850
 who is there by going forward we are going 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.489
 to position oneself like that and that we are going 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.489
 press in the loosening direction 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.420
 the second operation 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.020
 we are going to be loosening their country 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:14.680
 costs that mobilizes the adjustment courses 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:19.600
 of the rigors the chain because here the 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.260
 weight of costs and loosen the same 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.360
 your side 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.090
 this dessert more 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.930
 so I'm going to check the arrow of the 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:34.600
 string by positioning at anglet 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:36.370
 I take like to redo the access of a 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.820
 chain link so here I got 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:43.120
 quickly on 0 I go up and there I have five 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.920
 centimeters of snow what is common 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:53.830
 you remove my accident backwards 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:59.650
 so I'm going to tight here big 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:01.630
 settings I positioned myself at 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.670
 third big here I'm going to me 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.709
 reposition third in 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:11.650
 the other side so well then for the 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.380
 cute of chain what will be 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.850
 important is the benchmarks that we go 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:21.640
 ability to visualize on the swingarm 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.480
 its landmarks here we have 1 2 3 of the other 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.760
 side we must have the same thing 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.040
 watch out for some machines the 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.860
 washer that is here can have some play 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.430
 is skewed 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.960
 the judgment to make an audit 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.380
 complementary we can have here we 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.880
 can measure the passing of the rod 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.310
 allowing 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.010
 the setting if one has 5 mm of overtaking 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.710
 of rods from the 5 mm side then the tool 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.100
 ultimate verification is the device 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.770
 which allows the laser alignment of the 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.460
 check chain here we see a point 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.810
 laser one must find it at the same 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.530
 place ie on the plate 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.900
 outside that that until the end the 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:12.690
 chain 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:15.810
 I'm stuck here no against echoes on 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:23.370
 my husband dragging to rally the other 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:25.850
 side a mom I serve my wheel nut 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.850
 back
