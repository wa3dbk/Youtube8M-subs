00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.939
 and later 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.110
 so is 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.800
 that day all this forward 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.990
 pass 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:55.680
 why 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.020
 But look 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.660
 they are pushing 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:44.160
 to yourselves then we will be in 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.160
 church 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.850
 good 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.500
 I remember with kilos in weeks 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.810
 through music 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.060
 ah 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.270
 spirit of the Lord is on me because 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.060
 has consecrated me to bring good 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.160
 news to the poor has sent me to 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.640
 announce freedom to the prisoners and give 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.790
 sight to the blind and set at liberty to 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.320
 the oppressed and to announce the year 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.320
 favorable of the lord 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.009
 today this script has been fulfilled 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.659
 in front of you 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:36.159
 the writing was fulfilled but if 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:39.529
 only the messiah can fulfill that 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:42.349
 surely you will tell me the saying 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:44.449
 with you cured yourself and then they will tell me 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:47.059
 what we heard you did in capernaum 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:49.069
 something also here in your own land 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:51.159
 I assure you that no one is a prophet in his 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:51.159
 land 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:12.560
 but they wanted to throw it into the crag 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.560
 Jesus passed in their midst and he left
