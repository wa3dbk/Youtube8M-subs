writing<00:00:07.290> songs<00:00:07.649> it's<00:00:07.890> one<00:00:08.069> thing<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.460> know<00:00:08.730> all

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
writing songs it's one thing to know all

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.160 
writing songs it's one thing to know all
this<00:00:09.000> theory<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.570> know<00:00:09.690> how<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.929> play<00:00:10.110> all

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
this theory to know how to play all

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.290 
this theory to know how to play all
these<00:00:10.380> chords<00:00:10.860> or<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.639> be<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:11.849> know<00:00:11.940> just<00:00:12.179> be

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
these chords or to be you know just be

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.089 
these chords or to be you know just be
whittling<00:00:12.660> away<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.990> be<00:00:13.410> practicing<00:00:13.830> all<00:00:13.950> your

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
whittling away to be practicing all your

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.049 
whittling away to be practicing all your
technique<00:00:14.400> but<00:00:14.580> it's<00:00:14.700> another<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.940> actually

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
technique but it's another to actually

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.609 
technique but it's another to actually
put<00:00:15.599> all<00:00:15.719> those<00:00:15.839> things<00:00:15.900> together

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
put all those things together

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.980 
put all those things together
and<00:00:16.770> start<00:00:17.369> writing<00:00:17.640> music<00:00:18.060> because<00:00:18.390> when<00:00:18.869> you

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
and start writing music because when you

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.150 
and start writing music because when you
think<00:00:19.199> about<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.560> that's<00:00:19.710> probably<00:00:19.830> one<00:00:20.130> of

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
think about it that's probably one of

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.230 
think about it that's probably one of
the<00:00:20.310> biggest<00:00:20.550> reasons<00:00:20.850> why<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.090> actually

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
the biggest reasons why you actually

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.240 
the biggest reasons why you actually
started<00:00:21.840> playing<00:00:21.960> guitar<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.619> begin<00:00:22.890> with<00:00:23.070> was

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
started playing guitar to begin with was

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.429 
started playing guitar to begin with was
to<00:00:23.340> actually<00:00:23.519> get<00:00:24.390> your<00:00:24.539> voice<00:00:24.720> out<00:00:24.930> there<00:00:25.199> and

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
to actually get your voice out there and

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.019 
to actually get your voice out there and
to<00:00:25.560> write<00:00:25.769> your<00:00:26.039> own<00:00:26.070> music<00:00:26.670> whether<00:00:26.849> it's

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
to write your own music whether it's

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.160 
to write your own music whether it's
instrumentals<00:00:27.689> whether<00:00:27.960> you're<00:00:28.140> a

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
instrumentals whether you're a

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.929 
instrumentals whether you're a
singer-songwriter<00:00:28.920> doesn't<00:00:29.580> matter<00:00:29.699> it's

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
singer-songwriter doesn't matter it's

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.179 
singer-songwriter doesn't matter it's
all<00:00:30.150> really<00:00:30.869> easy<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.260> we<00:00:31.349> can<00:00:31.470> instantly<00:00:31.949> get

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
all really easy and we can instantly get

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.979 
all really easy and we can instantly get
started<00:00:32.669> okay<00:00:32.910> now<00:00:33.360> we're<00:00:33.480> going<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.690> quickly

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
started okay now we're going to quickly

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.690 
started okay now we're going to quickly
wrap<00:00:34.380> through<00:00:34.620> all<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.219> theory<00:00:35.550> knowledge

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
wrap through all the theory knowledge

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.130 
wrap through all the theory knowledge
that<00:00:35.969> we've<00:00:36.059> done<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.360> fast<00:00:36.540> if<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:36.960> already

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
that we've done so fast if you already

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.900 
that we've done so fast if you already
know<00:00:37.410> how<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.649> theory<00:00:37.890> knowledge<00:00:38.100> go<00:00:38.760> ahead

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
know how that theory knowledge go ahead

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.119 
know how that theory knowledge go ahead
and<00:00:39.090> skip<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.750> time<00:00:40.050> skip<00:00:40.770> should<00:00:41.040> be

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
and skip to this time skip should be

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.580 
and skip to this time skip should be
somewhere<00:00:41.399> over<00:00:41.460> here<00:00:41.579> just<00:00:42.420> skip<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:43.500> that

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
somewhere over here just skip to that

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.920 
somewhere over here just skip to that
time<00:00:43.860> frame<00:00:44.070> okay<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:44.969> now<00:00:45.180> if<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.600> already

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
time frame okay but now if you already

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.810 
time frame okay but now if you already
know<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.079> that's<00:00:46.559> great<00:00:46.890> skip<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.550> time

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
know that that's great skip to that time

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.760 
know that that's great skip to that time
to<00:00:48.239> get<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.570> time<00:00:48.719> again<00:00:49.020> but<00:00:49.530> otherwise

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
to get to that time again but otherwise

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.799 
to get to that time again but otherwise
we'll<00:00:50.190> start<00:00:50.520> ahead<00:00:50.640> okay<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:51.360> we're<00:00:51.600> starting

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
we'll start ahead okay so we're starting

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.900 
we'll start ahead okay so we're starting
at<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.350> very<00:00:52.649> very<00:00:52.739> beginning<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.550> theory

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
at the very very beginning of theory

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.819 
at the very very beginning of theory
okay<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.270> hopefully<00:00:55.230> if<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.530> know<00:00:55.680> all<00:00:55.800> this

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
okay so hopefully if you know all this

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.560 
okay so hopefully if you know all this
stuff<00:00:56.010> then<00:00:56.699> skip<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.090> time<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:57.449> if<00:00:57.510> you

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
stuff then skip to this time but if you

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.819 
stuff then skip to this time but if you
don't<00:00:57.750> then<00:00:57.989> we'll<00:00:58.079> just<00:00:58.230> keep<00:00:58.379> going

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
don't then we'll just keep going

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.860 
don't then we'll just keep going
so<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.489> music<00:00:59.940> there's<00:01:00.120> intervals<00:01:00.629> called

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
so in music there's intervals called

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.990 
so in music there's intervals called
tones<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.500> semitones<00:01:01.739> archaic<00:01:02.460> tones<00:01:02.699> and

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
tones and semitones archaic tones and

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.969 
tones and semitones archaic tones and
semitones<00:01:03.840> now<00:01:04.350> we're<00:01:04.619> going<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.799> abbreviate

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
semitones now we're going to abbreviate

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.440 
semitones now we're going to abbreviate
we're<00:01:05.369> gonna<00:01:05.489> make<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.760> nice<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:05.939> small<00:01:06.270> and

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
we're gonna make it nice and small and

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.830 
we're gonna make it nice and small and
easy<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.750> remember<00:01:06.930> T<00:01:07.650> means<00:01:08.100> two<00:01:08.460> frets<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.090> s

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
easy to remember T means two frets and s

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.630 
easy to remember T means two frets and s
means<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.650> single<00:01:11.070> fret

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
means a single fret

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.280 
means a single fret
nice<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.060> easy<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.299> if<00:01:12.479> you're<00:01:12.600> playing<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:13.020> C

semitone<00:01:27.780> away<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:28.560> just<00:01:28.619> going<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.890> be<00:01:29.009> a

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
semitone away it's just going to be a

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.510 
semitone away it's just going to be a
single<00:01:29.549> fret<00:01:30.860> okay<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.100> that's<00:01:32.400> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
single fret okay so that's the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.550 
single fret okay so that's the
difference<00:01:32.790> between<00:01:32.820> tones<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.540> semitones<00:01:33.689> T

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
difference between tones and semitones T

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.460 
difference between tones and semitones T
equals<00:01:34.950> two<00:01:35.130> frets<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.549> s<00:01:36.150> equals<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.990> single

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
equals two frets and s equals a single

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.149 
equals two frets and s equals a single
frame<00:01:37.650> okay

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
frame okay

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.859 
frame okay
now<00:01:38.280> bearing<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.270> mind<00:01:39.299> we're<00:01:39.689> going<00:01:39.780> to

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
now bearing that in mind we're going to

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.170 
now bearing that in mind we're going to
make<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.320> major<00:01:40.710> scale<00:01:41.130> now<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.700> major<00:01:41.909> scale

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
make a major scale now the major scale

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.060 
make a major scale now the major scale
is<00:01:42.299> great<00:01:42.659> because<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.259> basis<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.710> all

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
is great because it is the basis of all

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.770 
is great because it is the basis of all
the<00:01:44.369> theory<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.790> we<00:01:45.000> do<00:01:45.119> it's<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.329> basis<00:01:45.659> of

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
the theory that we do it's the basis of

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.149 
the theory that we do it's the basis of
the<00:01:45.840> key<00:01:45.990> signatures<00:01:46.439> creating<00:01:46.770> chords

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
the key signatures creating chords

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.859 
the key signatures creating chords
looking<00:01:47.700> different<00:01:47.939> scales<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.299> modes<00:01:48.450> all

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
looking different scales and modes all

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.630 
looking different scales and modes all
that<00:01:49.200> stuff<00:01:49.439> okay<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:49.799> it's<00:01:50.040> really<00:01:50.100> important

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
that stuff okay so it's really important

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.649 
that stuff okay so it's really important
that<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.790> know<00:01:50.909> how<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.030> make<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.420> major

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
that you know how to make this major

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.480 
that you know how to make this major
scale<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.170> all<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.439> major<00:01:52.649> scale<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.340> it's

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
scale so all the major scale is is it's

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.770 
scale so all the major scale is is it's
a<00:01:53.579> series<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.000> tones<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.570> semitones

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
a series of tones and semitones

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.780 
a series of tones and semitones
everything<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.680> we<00:01:55.740> looked<00:01:55.920> at<00:01:55.979> before<00:01:56.130> is

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
everything that we looked at before is

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.969 
everything that we looked at before is
just<00:01:57.000> either<00:01:57.119> two<00:01:57.420> frets<00:01:57.689> or<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.960> single<00:01:58.799> fret

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
just either two frets or a single fret

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.399 
just either two frets or a single fret
away<00:01:59.189> really<00:02:00.000> easy<00:02:00.299> okay<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:00.719> we're<00:02:01.020> gonna<00:02:01.140> do

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.520 
away really easy okay so we're gonna do
this<00:02:01.920> song<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.640> key<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:03.180> C<00:02:03.420> major<00:02:03.659> because

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
this song in the key of C major because

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.499 
this song in the key of C major because
there's<00:02:04.740> no<00:02:05.040> sharps<00:02:05.640> or<00:02:05.759> flats<00:02:05.820> if<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.360> don't

there's no sharps or flats if you don't
know<00:02:06.659> what<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.840> key<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.079> we're<00:02:07.740> just<00:02:07.770> about<00:02:08.039> to

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
know what the key is we're just about to

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.540 
know what the key is we're just about to
get<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
get to the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
- so let's start on the C note then the

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.300 
- so let's start on the C note then the
next<00:02:12.360> note<00:02:12.480> in<00:02:12.660> C<00:02:12.810> major<00:02:12.990> is<00:02:13.350> D<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.010> move<00:02:14.160> up

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.690 
a tone or two frets then you move up
another<00:02:17.970> two<00:02:18.240> frets<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.690> e<00:02:19.340> then<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.430> move<00:02:20.580> up

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
another two frets to e then you move up

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.770 
another two frets to e then you move up
a<00:02:20.850> single<00:02:21.540> threat<00:02:21.780> or<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.020> semitone<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:23.010> F

can build a chord from it's really easy
to<00:03:08.790> remember<00:03:09.090> it's<00:03:09.570> just<00:03:09.840> this<00:03:10.320> order<00:03:10.740> it's

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
to remember it's just this order it's

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.770 
to remember it's just this order it's
just<00:03:11.040> another<00:03:11.310> order<00:03:11.760> it's<00:03:11.970> just<00:03:12.180> like<00:03:12.330> a<00:03:12.360> math

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
just another order it's just like a math

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.030 
just another order it's just like a math
problem<00:03:13.080> you've<00:03:13.350> figured<00:03:13.560> out<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.770> formula

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
problem you've figured out the formula

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.210 
problem you've figured out the formula
you've<00:03:14.730> got<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.030> order<00:03:15.120> so<00:03:15.690> we<00:03:15.810> press<00:03:16.050> on<00:03:16.260> so

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
you've got the order so we press on so

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.970 
you've got the order so we press on so
the<00:03:17.310> order<00:03:17.610> is<00:03:17.760> major<00:03:18.480> minor<00:03:19.200> minor<00:03:19.530> major

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
the order is major minor minor major

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.630 
the order is major minor minor major
major<00:03:20.820> minor<00:03:21.270> diminished<00:03:22.110> and<00:03:22.860> then<00:03:23.340> back<00:03:23.610> to

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
major minor diminished and then back to

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.850 
major minor diminished and then back to
C<00:03:24.000> only<00:03:24.480> an<00:03:24.540> octave<00:03:24.900> higher<00:03:24.930> so<00:03:25.500> you've<00:03:25.650> got

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
C only an octave higher so you've got

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.070 
C only an octave higher so you've got
another<00:03:26.250> major<00:03:26.550> chord<00:03:26.910> that's<00:03:27.510> all<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:27.990> it

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
another major chord that's all that it

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.070 
another major chord that's all that it
is<00:03:28.230> so<00:03:28.470> you've<00:03:28.590> got<00:03:28.830> C<00:03:29.310> major<00:03:29.550> D<00:03:30.000> minor<00:03:30.420> E<00:03:30.840> minor

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
is so you've got C major D minor E minor

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.940 
is so you've got C major D minor E minor
F<00:03:31.740> major<00:03:31.920> G<00:03:32.610> major<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.510> minor<00:03:33.810> B<00:03:34.050> diminished<00:03:34.590> and

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
F major G major a minor B diminished and

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.520 
F major G major a minor B diminished and
then<00:03:35.550> C<00:03:36.000> major<00:03:36.240> again<00:03:36.600> that's<00:03:36.990> all<00:03:37.260> there<00:03:37.500> is
