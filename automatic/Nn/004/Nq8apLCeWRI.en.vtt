00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.869
 so welcome people to a good old one 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.690
 round 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:17.070
 Ronja who had remembered me once 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.779
 a video of which also made it as is 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.910
 but just since published now 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.040
 nine months or three years 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.040
 exaggerated but months nothing more 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.530
 made in any case yes there is now 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.480
 again a snail without a chance 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.189
 video today at noon are small 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.989
 Minecraft follow if you do not hurt 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.520
 Just a little old school york 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.410
 That's why I wanted to ask who 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.239
 I remember and fix crafter and 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.300
 not all with nonchalance 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.600
 but also a guest exploration 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.130
 made videos that means we have each other 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.380
 the natixis service looked at but still 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.239
 the lobby event is different and that 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.960
 was nice thought that each other 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.210
 biggest server one of the biggest servers 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.910
 the world will be so he was great therefore 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.360
 already clear but not so big now 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.610
 expected 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.930
 and since I have no topic for a long time 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.890
 more played so i have it one 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.759
 short time or quite active worried 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.170
 I 'm a bit gone now 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.579
 from the half pixel server not because of me 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.319
 do not like but no idea 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:19.380
 just do not get away from it 

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:21.200
 clue happens so sometimes look like 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:28.100
 we come through 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:28.100
 I think I have to go that way 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:48.280
 let's have a look so the train can be found 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.660
 So in any case the next service 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.790
 yes so many game mode but over 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.830
 the time we just do not have as 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.930
 many pledges promised but does not mean 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.010
 directly that I am bad 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.690
 I definitely do not want that 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.810
 Not promised was just not mine 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.280
 So I'm meanwhile something sg 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.050
 friend gas gives the lightning is go but 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.950
 no idea I would go to 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.800
 kind of nice and worth something then with me 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.540
 So on the base and yes , no 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.860
 Otherwise, just do not know 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.330
 By then I am a city around 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.900
 I have more action to play 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.670
 not or not more time 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.110
 to play with it 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.890
 a little thing further course of the 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:31.270
 project is about title best too 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.370
 it does not matter a bit in any case 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.920
 soon on the canal again 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.489
 go right off as it states states 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.630
 now two big projects coming soon 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.890
 both still quite secret as one 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.660
 will you drive something over the other? 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.150
 world first at start noticed that 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.920
 is really my god oh my 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:53.560
 god oh my god that was stupid of me 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:55.320
 that you can find me and on it 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.140
 can you really enjoy it? 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.930
 two mega projects and i say so 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.350
 No tips so gardening tips say 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:08.019
 So, that's one more pvp thing 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:13.209
 other than just a pvp that 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:14.260
 another is pvp with pack let's play more 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.070
 I'm not saying you can even a few 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.440
 give tips 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.049
 you can come to both as 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.290
 tip on both could come to you so 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:26.170
 but that's enough for you 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.769
 In any case, that will be really great me 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.970
 I'm really looking forward to both projects 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.350
 both start now in a short time 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.890
 maybe that one even in the 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.329
 december so that's it comes calculator 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.430
 still a small number, I can say it 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.780
 will be with the dom so 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.090
 then you can if I already 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.219
 say so you can already imagine 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.250
 here what it might be noticeable strong 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:50.400
 desired thing from you so yes it 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.329
 will be cool 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.420
 especially because you can not stand on the 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.900
 So names come so that's 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.359
 something new 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.049
 Well wait and see in any case 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:03.459
 I beast on it and you can 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.849
 yes as I said the means to in the 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.060
 Comments 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.709
 So no comment quasi inappropriate 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.750
 Do not comment on how to comment 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.260
 You can say both to yourself 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.229
 but do not come to the names yet 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.549
 generally on building the entire Sun 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.889
 but you can think so if 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:25.389
 I'm in the cathedral there are then sap pc 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:28.570
 God and God in the other 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:32.099
 players still somewhere alive times 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.099
 Slowly this will be close to me 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:41.210
 my god oh god, and usually are 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:46.750
 all players then already long out and 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:50.420
 this time skip jeff over for now 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.370
 I know maybe he's there before or 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.080
 After that , they are definitely up there 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.630
 we're only doing the second round of it myself 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:03.260
 did not come right now 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:05.090
 i do not like a us or usa like that 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:11.590
 actually overpowering games with the 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:22.910
 animals are getting so few in there now 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:27.970
 Ancelotti was a full full time 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:32.960
 The postbrief is the animal then ran 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:36.320
 the land oasis would like me 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.240
 more the map that's good, so that's it 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.010
 So I 'm just so happy 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.670
 so it will hardly be a small one 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:45.980
 his crash landing europe was over 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.360
 home for reasons of time against the 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.830
 not that's why project is going though 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.970
 to be finished soon that means we set 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.520
 we now only once back or 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.720
 sometimes nice completion was following me 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.550
 also by was definitely a hammer 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.860
 cool project times with rings 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.230
 make challenge so it really was 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.850
 a difficult thing 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:04.030
 And I definitely thought that was cool and 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:07.760
 has also made a bock 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:10.280
 So just nice was already three 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.950
 wide gabler so missing witch 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:16.040
 let it be and then understandably as at 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:18.620
 my fun factor the coolest I found 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.730
 almost exit so wat was really new to me 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.140
 am now just it can also 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:25.670
 walking slowly although it's better 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:27.930
 and then place two was 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.790
 actually crash landing and it is missing 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.910
 I did not find anything very cool together 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:37.290
 so if my crop and so on 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:38.430
 what can be done in any case what 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.930
 I can only tell you, but I said 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.370
 a notebook display i will join 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.180
 The moped ultimately with the bus 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.320
 employ 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:49.200
 that is not like Selanne and 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:53.550
 good 4 tb if you like me so deep 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:59.840
 I'm not only pleased 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:07:02.280
 I create a platform where the 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:06.840
 Tip here so manually that you can 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:07.470
 likes to do his new job 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.910
 leave 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.580
 In any case, I want too 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.110
 deal with the mods that is there 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.640
 I'll ever be a pro with it 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.020
 because simply the interest and the meter 

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.100
 But I will now enjoy it 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.320
 to deal with it 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.790
 especially because a few mods here 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.680
 are I know 

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.150
 Of course we will do that again 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.710
 a bit easier that means with the 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.510
 kernel mix from i know what that 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.980
 is what you can do about or 

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.840
 but I am even complete 

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.590
 So that will be cool in any case 

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.590
 cool 

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:39.030
 okay okay that 's the video 

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.180
 I hope you like it more now 

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:46.170
 informative as gameplay said guess 

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:48.720

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:52.950

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:55.500
 be happy you write a completely free 

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:57.860
