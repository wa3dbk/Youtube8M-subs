00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello, I 'm Mark beck and I 'm asking and I'm 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.270
 here to make a video about the 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.510
 materials that you use to make my 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.259
 videos of the kit esquete and I make videos 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.420
 straight to the pen and markers then 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.789
 has been working on videos with a pencil or 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.670
 pencil holder then I eat trade 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:26.880
 directly with the staedtler pen 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.330
 pigment lainer zero point so it's a 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.910
 Good thing she's a German singer. 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.980
 easily found here in Brazil in 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.570
 various sizes various kits 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.710
 different 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:44.670
 She has a point of envy, she's not thin. 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.239
 I particularly thought she was going to 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.370
 pass 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.149
 she is quite enduring the tip of it 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.520
 It takes too long to ruin it. 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.699
 start giving those ones failed 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.590
 children usually give and she does not 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.020
 stain when used with markers 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.550
 so this was very advantageous for me 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.210
 that even when I work with 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.610
 watercolor or any type of 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.720
 work with water does not stain the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.330
 very good career also has 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.310
 worked lately with the pen 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:22.110
 kopke multiner that is specially made 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.200
 to work with kopke markers 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.570
 in this case it is also waterproof 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.060
 besides being proof of the material made 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.049
 with alcohol that is the case of markers 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.619
 It's made in Japan but here in Brazil. 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.939
 you can find on the site coppe 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.579
 official website they sell there 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.119
 It was there that I even bought this 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.020
 if here 10.05 is thinner than the 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.579
 previous 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.729
 I like working with a fine stroke. 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.310
 fine when I make the diskettes 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:56.460
 but it has a disadvantage in relation to 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.540
 debut that I believe not to be 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.590
 very cool 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.110
 her point does not last as long as 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.340
 state tip 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.530
 then in this case here sometimes the 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.060
 investment is not worth it. 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.180
 but it's a very good thing I liked it 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.450
 enough of her quality 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.659
 weighed durability not be the best 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.950
 I work with my videos with the kit 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.400
 the gay man 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.810
 ascop origin was not a funk that 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.510
 been for a long time so it's 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.549
 quite durable only two or three 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.920
 pens I needed to buy 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.379
 recharge because, as it is copy and 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.700
 original it can only be recharged 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.379
 some of them I had to buy 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.920
 recharge and they have a durability 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:43.260
 very good 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.439
 She has this thick tip that is great. 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:52.139
 to cover large areas and also to 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:54.659
 do gradient and has a fine tip for 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:57.719
 power to cover from details 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:59.579
 certain a minor thing detail nothing that 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:01.290
 you can do 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:04.109
 maybe a little corner of my eye at some 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.349
 thing so you can work with this 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:08.489
 the top end the source cup is not the copy 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.980
 more expensive 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.590
 It's because she lasts the longer she has this. 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:18.229
 more square format and all the 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.229
 colors are marked on the front 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:24.989
 All right, they all have this mark here. 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:27.299
 and what number is I have a kit the 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.790
 man gre edition are hot colors nÃ© 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:33.269
 then there are 11 shades of gray in this case 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.449
 but warm tones did not come a gray 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:41.359
 and is very good at working with 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:44.849
 11 skin colors the effect really cool and 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:48.930
 has also been working with the 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:51.239
 gay kit strap cup can not 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.750
 that it is a little different from the 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.939
 right original copy a little more 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.479
 and she has a great advantage in 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:02.819
 my opinion that beyond this tip 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:06.180
 great that it is now demonstrated 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:09.389
 her original copy, she also has 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.609
 a tip brush that is very good this 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:14.269
 brush tip she allows us to 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:18.109
 much more interesting effects like 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.810
 thin and thick I can work with 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.330
 Details 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.330
 like it was with a brush on my mother 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.389
 so to do the skit job 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.540
 very good 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.040
 in this case the currey kit he works with 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.740
 cold tones right 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.830
 then these cold tones they give a 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.960
 complement that those tones of the 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.400
 kit the gay man that I spoke to 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.220
 previously that is the first one I 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.139
 I worked with a kit copper with kit one 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.030
 church can we get some 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.840
 interesting tone differentiation for 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.840
 do the skits 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.460
 these are the materials you use to 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.199
 make my videos 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.699
 if you like do not forget about unmik there 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:03.229
