00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello friends stay jorge of that place 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.400
 point of showing these cases of 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.620
 manufacturer in which in this is the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.740
 reference and software we have them in 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.630
 four different capacities in 0.60 75 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.210
 a liter and liter in average capacity 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.180
 These covers are designed for people 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.130
 for the subject of high mountain or good that 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.250
 want to protect the bottle of any 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.830
 blow dust and everything since the bottle the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.359
 we will have kept in the ring in the 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.820
 interior that I have here the model 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.619
 classic but we can use it with the 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.840
 bottle from which the future model to 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.360
 class 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.120
 what has this has a great power of 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.770
 thermal insulation since it has a 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.680
 10 mm thick foam 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.610
 polyurethane the outside is fine 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.200
 protected holds abrasion very well 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.390
 As you can see, there's a tape here 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.699
 leads from the bottom to the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.910
 superior so we would take 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.239
 totally hidden our bottle 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.430
 take a tab here I want to take it 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.129
 here by the hand although you see in our 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.900
 belt a big hook to take it 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.070
 hung a carabiner to take it in the 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.530
 backpack and down here we get another appointment 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.270
 I commented the four capacities for 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.740
 example I put here in the bottle 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.479
 of the future model that has everything a 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.220
 diameter of 74 thousand meters the height 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.490
 approximate of this of the small would be 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.490
 of 20 24 26 here we would have for greater 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.830
 capacity of the liter and a half like 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.460
 checked as I told you permito 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:39.750
 has a zipper 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.990
 we would give access to the bottle of 10 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.920
 millimeters of publishing to endure 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.420
 quite the temperature so that 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.430
 keep our drinks so cold 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.820
 hot and do not steal us from the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.820
 Exterior 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.009
 It is a little more bulky than other 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.659
 typical covers that adapt to the 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.969
 bottle we have this is wider but 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.440
 good is we protect it even more 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.150
 of the blows and that we use it 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.370
 in place where the temperature the 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.390
 changes of problems are greater 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.560
 I hope the information we have 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.560
 help hello
