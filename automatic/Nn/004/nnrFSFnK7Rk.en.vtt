00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.500 
may be fine in that self-contained a
little<00:02:08.070> capsule<00:02:08.580> but<00:02:08.760> do<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.000> really<00:02:09.240> want<00:02:09.420> to

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510 
little capsule but do you really want to

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.800 
little capsule but do you really want to
be<00:02:09.630> bounced<00:02:10.110> around<00:02:10.830> everywhere<00:02:11.540> but<00:02:12.540> just

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
be bounced around everywhere but just

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.090 
be bounced around everywhere but just
about<00:02:12.960> anything<00:02:13.290> on<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.650> road

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
about anything on the road

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.740 
about anything on the road
I<00:02:14.130> don't<00:02:14.580> trust<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.940> car<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.360> can<00:02:15.510> pick<00:02:15.720> up

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
I don't trust a car that I can pick up

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.310 
I don't trust a car that I can pick up
for<00:02:16.320> me<00:02:16.500> it's<00:02:16.800> toss<00:02:17.580> up<00:02:17.820> Prius<00:02:18.210> smart<00:02:18.810> car

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
for me it's toss up Prius smart car

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.170 
for me it's toss up Prius smart car
I<00:02:19.350> think<00:02:19.800> this<00:02:19.950> marker<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.400> actually<00:02:20.850> smarter

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
I think this marker is actually smarter

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.510 
I think this marker is actually smarter
than<00:02:21.210> Prius<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:22.080> think<00:02:22.380> at<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.040> end<00:02:23.070> of<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.340> day

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
than Prius I think at the end of the day

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.000 
than Prius I think at the end of the day
I<00:02:24.080> don't<00:02:25.080> like<00:02:25.200> Prius<00:02:25.500> drivers<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:27.830> would<00:02:28.830> say

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
I don't like Prius drivers I would say

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.190 
I don't like Prius drivers I would say
the<00:02:29.130> only<00:02:29.160> car<00:02:29.610> out<00:02:29.790> there<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:30.450> really

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
the only car out there that I really

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.460 
the only car out there that I really
want<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.470> drive<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.120> I<00:02:33.120> would<00:02:33.930> do<00:02:34.050> just<00:02:34.080> about

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
want to drive and I would do just about

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.980 
want to drive and I would do just about
anything<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:35.280> make<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.790> happen<00:02:35.940> is<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.510> Formula

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
anything to make it happen is a Formula

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.010 
anything to make it happen is a Formula
One<00:02:37.020> car<00:02:37.380> unfortunately<00:02:38.040> I'm<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:39.120> tipping<00:02:39.960> the

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
One car unfortunately I'm a tipping the

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.350 
One car unfortunately I'm a tipping the
scales<00:02:40.290> at<00:02:40.440> about<00:02:40.620> 270<00:02:41.310> right<00:02:41.520> now<00:02:41.700> so<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.210> don't

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
scales at about 270 right now so I don't

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.990 
scales at about 270 right now so I don't
believe<00:02:42.960> there's<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.290> Formula<00:02:43.740> One<00:02:43.770> car<00:02:44.070> in

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
believe there's a Formula One car in

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.449 
believe there's a Formula One car in
existence<00:02:45.660> that<00:02:45.990> was<00:02:46.560> big<00:02:46.800> enough<00:02:46.830> for<00:02:47.250> me<00:02:47.370> to

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
existence that was big enough for me to

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.460 
existence that was big enough for me to
drive<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.880> but<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:48.600> will<00:02:48.690> be<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.840> lifelong<00:02:49.230> quest

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
drive it but it will be a lifelong quest

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.590 
drive it but it will be a lifelong quest
