 hospitalized in pharmacological coma in the 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.090
 hospital resuscitation department 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.859
 cisanello of pisa 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.539
 their conditions are very serious and 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.010
 kept under strict observance of the 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.170
 doctors while the other two 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.210
 seventeen years overwhelmed by the SUV this morning 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.279
 at the bus stop in Zambra in Pisa 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.740
 they are in confidential prognosis but not 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.649
 they would run the risk of life to one of 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.000
 their spleen was removed 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.680
 conditions not worrying for instead 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.230
 the driver of the toyota land cruiser 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.180
 who finished his mad race a 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.309
 hundred meters ahead after having 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.739
 knocked down the wall of a house 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.629
 the 47-year-old man is hospitalized 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.789
 lots of pontedera and exams 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.559
 toxicological and alcohol tests have 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.480
 excluded that he was driving in the state of 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.699
 alcoholic intoxication or under the influence of 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.140
 drugs is under shock and not 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.539
 reminds almost nothing of the accident 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.070
 the most likely hypothesis is that he has 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.170
 accused an illness and lost 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.060
 knowledge while driving was 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.470
 reported for negligent injuries and is 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.800
 license has been withdrawn 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.200
 I was if stake heard once 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.630
 3 4 ball instead of hearing it stop 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.820
 here in front I looked out and I have 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.860
 since there were four gases lying in 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:27.530
 ground then post of the stop 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.840
 and then Calabrians and ambulances 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.299
 and then we saw this machine that 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.670
 he had beaten here he came from here 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:38.150
 started here and then go to the right ha 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.040
 got the four guys there and then they have 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.200
 datini against that wall has broken through the 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.240
 wall of that house speed either 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.460
 look at it but it would seem that this 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.130
 sir now I don't know if it's rumors that 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.890
 they say he felt bad here 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.200
 because what happened happened 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.330
 the two most serious sixteen instead are 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.310
 been sedated and the Pisan doctors are 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.679
 keeping in strict observance the 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.750
 concussions of which they remained 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.610
 victim to proceed as soon as possible 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.890
 at surgery capable of 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.720
 remove blood clots from the head 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.030
 the clinical picture will be evaluated in 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.930
 next 48 hours to decide when 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.930
 intervene surgically
