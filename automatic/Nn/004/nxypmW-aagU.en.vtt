I'm not control plus a USB power cable
and<00:01:00.660> plug<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.649> case<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.890> need<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.039> plug<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.340> in

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
and plug in case you need to plug it in

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.609 
and plug in case you need to plug it in
what<00:01:03.120> I'll<00:01:03.239> probably<00:01:03.359> do<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.899> put<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.350> into

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
what I'll probably do is put this into

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.100 
what I'll probably do is put this into
my<00:01:04.949> TV<00:01:05.339> itself<00:01:05.850> sleep<00:01:06.150> dead<00:01:06.330> power<00:01:06.540> on<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.780> TV

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
my TV itself sleep dead power on the TV

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.740 
my TV itself sleep dead power on the TV
so<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.290> plugged<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.670> now<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.299> think

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
so I plugged it in and it's now I think

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.560 
so I plugged it in and it's now I think
it's<00:01:10.049> pairing<00:01:10.380> up<00:01:10.500> with<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.740> remote<00:01:11.490> control

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
it's pairing up with the remote control

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:22.609 
it's pairing up with the remote control
here<00:01:16.820> so<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.850> can<00:01:18.000> pick<00:01:18.180> my<00:01:18.210> language<00:01:20.060> and<00:01:21.619> now
