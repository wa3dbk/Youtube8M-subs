00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.370 
defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti was
pretty<00:01:05.970> outspoken<00:01:06.270> about<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:07.080> hit<00:01:07.350> and

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
pretty outspoken about that hit and

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.140 
pretty outspoken about that hit and
about<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> ejection<00:01:08.280> because<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:08.970> had<00:01:09.090> this

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
about the ejection because we had this

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.490 
about the ejection because we had this
afterwards<00:01:09.830> it's<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.070> rule<00:01:12.200> they're<00:01:13.200> trying

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
afterwards it's the rule they're trying

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.250 
afterwards it's the rule they're trying
to<00:01:13.560> look<00:01:13.650> out<00:01:13.770> for<00:01:13.830> safety<00:01:14.370> I<00:01:14.400> understand<00:01:14.880> that

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
to look out for safety I understand that

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.950 
to look out for safety I understand that
but<00:01:16.260> I<00:01:16.910> just<00:01:17.910> hope<00:01:18.300> that<00:01:18.360> there's<00:01:18.660> a<00:01:18.750> lot<00:01:18.900> more

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
but I just hope that there's a lot more

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.530 
but I just hope that there's a lot more
common<00:01:19.590> sense<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.910> calling<00:01:21.450> of

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
common sense in the in the calling of

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.450 
common sense in the in the calling of
those<00:01:21.720> kind<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.050> penalties<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.680> think<00:01:23.220> he<00:01:23.310> was

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
those kind of penalties I think he was

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.610 
those kind of penalties I think he was
coming<00:01:23.790> up<00:01:23.880> hard<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.480> just<00:01:24.930> think<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.260> timing

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
coming up hard I just think the timing

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.530 
coming up hard I just think the timing
was<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> bang-bang<00:01:26.100> thing<00:01:26.700> I'd<00:01:27.090> like<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.300> see

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
was a bang-bang thing I'd like to see

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.790 
was a bang-bang thing I'd like to see
the<00:01:27.630> film<00:01:27.810> but<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.110> was<00:01:28.200> my<00:01:28.350> take<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.740> it

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
the film but that was my take on it

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.860 
the film but that was my take on it
maybe<00:01:29.400> I'm<00:01:29.610> biased<00:01:29.850> because<00:01:30.240> if<00:01:30.420> our<00:01:30.600> team

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
maybe I'm biased because if our team

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.560 
maybe I'm biased because if our team
that<00:01:31.680> was<00:01:31.830> my<00:01:32.010> take<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.520> 15-year<00:01:33.150> pony<00:01:33.390> i

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
that was my take on it 15-year pony i
