00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
black and that means that he will have

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.720 
black and that means that he will have
it<00:02:43.900> far<00:02:44.680> more<00:02:44.830> easier<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.520> begin<00:02:45.970> his<00:02:46.210> attack

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
it far more easier to begin his attack

King side attack but the move does also

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
allow Bishop to g5 which would open up

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.410 
allow Bishop to g5 which would open up
the<00:03:32.470> F<00:03:32.620> line<00:03:32.920> simultaneously<00:03:33.760> as<00:03:33.940> it<00:03:34.240> would

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
the F line simultaneously as it would

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.370 
the F line simultaneously as it would
block<00:03:34.660> black<00:03:35.380> from<00:03:35.680> developing<00:03:36.250> his<00:03:36.459> g8<00:03:36.970> night

so<00:03:38.380> in<00:03:38.680> order<00:03:38.860> to<00:03:39.040> prevent<00:03:39.400> this<00:03:39.670> black<00:03:40.120> plays

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
so in order to prevent this black plays

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.830

a<00:03:40.630> six<00:03:41.200> this<00:03:42.040> move<00:03:42.340> has<00:03:42.580> it<00:03:42.790> weaknesses<00:03:43.390> since

a six this move has it weaknesses since

a six this move has it weaknesses since
this<00:03:44.080> doesn't<00:03:44.410> allow<00:03:44.830> a<00:03:44.860> black<00:03:45.250> castle<00:03:45.760> since

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
this doesn't allow a black castle since

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.600 
this doesn't allow a black castle since
the<00:03:46.510> eight<00:03:46.660> six<00:03:47.080> pawn<00:03:47.380> would<00:03:47.739> be<00:03:47.920> too<00:03:48.220> poorly

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
the eight six pawn would be too poorly

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.690 
the eight six pawn would be too poorly
predicted<00:03:49.320> the<00:03:50.320> white<00:03:50.530> position<00:03:51.010> is<00:03:51.250> without

predicted the white position is without
a<00:03:51.730> doubt<00:03:51.930> superior<00:03:52.930> but<00:03:53.500> one<00:03:54.040> has<00:03:54.340> to<00:03:54.580> be

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
a doubt superior but one has to be

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.210 
a doubt superior but one has to be
careful<00:03:55.060> because<00:03:55.750> white<00:03:56.170> is<00:03:56.200> still<00:03:56.500> far<00:03:57.040> from

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
a clear one but with that I'll have to

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.680 
a clear one but with that I'll have to
