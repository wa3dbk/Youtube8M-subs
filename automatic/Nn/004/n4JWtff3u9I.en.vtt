00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.169

 forty minutes later he called the flight controller they wanted to hear 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.600
 and reported being threatened by what appeared to be the largest ship on the river 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.600

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.230
 around his plane will be unlike anything he has ever seen 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.300
 at this moment club was convinced 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.300
 that it was something out of the ordinary 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.050
 the midfield against the importance that this work 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.310

 rubens has started to communicate again 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.490
 but Tite seems to be totally panicking 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.000
 every horror scene 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 station 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.830
 bathrooms not on the street 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.380
 lupi heard I'm a christmas stranger against christmas it took a few seconds 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.600
 and then 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.250
 nothing more 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.340
 he kept the communication channel open for another 17 seconds 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.130

 fred reynaldo gianecchini says ana jÃºlia should also have tried to restore 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.730
 contact with politicians but it was useless 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.379
 for exposed feet 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:29.359
 the club gave the alarm precisely at 19 hours and 12 minutes twenty-one minutes 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:33.999
 after actor and from Kenai before reported there was no sign of the arrival of the plane of 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:37.069
 barents 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.069
 a rescue mission was quickly organized 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.179
 led by a maritime reconnaissance aircraft 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:50.219
 several boats and small planes scoured the waters around 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:51.639
 qinghai 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:56.559
 although success of type c valentines who pado with radios flag nobody 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:59.629
 was able to capture any signal 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.019
 found only one oil spot a few miles north of the island 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.329
 but she was not of the cessna 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.109
 if not the official press month of the ministry of transportation sa 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.919

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:17.969
 disappeared 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:20.619
 all the people pointed out 

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:22.519
 now I'm going back 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.729
 but whatever 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:28.359
 with that if the team 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.359
 every person 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:35.089
 on Friday 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.329
 the search was abandoned after four and a half days 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.150
 there was no trace of Valentine or his plane 

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:49.839
 as soon as speculation appeared on the fate of the young pilot 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.640
 today the father was eager to discover the truth 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:00.839
 with the lack of results 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.909
 Besides that 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:13.249
 other people at the time being humiliated I was intrigued by the 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:16.249
 possibility of a movement involved 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.180
 tents 2011 master 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.669
 in the last four rounds 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.669
 still on Tuesday outside d 

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:28.279
 it was a party 

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:31.650
 tarsus 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.390
 with the story of the strange disappearance of brave was headline 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:36.580
 in the world 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.800
 by incident and soon became the most famous case of contact with the movement 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.080
 in Australia 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.470
 especially after the details of his last radio broadcast 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.470
 became known 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.539
 seemed to be no logical explanation for what they are worth 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.669
 tite had described to the air traffic controller I was rubinho 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:03.929
 many began to believe that tite had been taken away by aliens 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.699
 When the news spread, there were other reports of young people 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.159
 the strait of bass on the same day 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:17.090
 all apparently occurring between 12 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.699
 it's twenty-two hours 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.639
 roll 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:26.499
 the most intriguing was an account by four people who were on a 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:29.509
 hill near euros abobo indicated the tweet 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:32.509
 with direct view to the strait of bass 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:40.080
 though fearing to be ridiculed he will only reveal it a twelve 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.349
 years later 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:48.529
 they claimed to have seen a huge cigar-shaped object with 4 light 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:51.689
 was disputing directly on a small airplane 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.929
 the object was accompanying the plane as if I were following 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.940
 the only river ship known to have been in the area on that day was a cessna 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.940
 lively 

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:19.389
 all the reports mentioned a dark spot on the show that stirred the most 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:22.389
 quiet 

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:30.709
 still others described the two large cigar-shaped objects flying in 

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:33.849
 high speed on the sea but in total silence 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.449

 hour or shortly after the disappearance of ballet poll of the Straits of 10 

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:02.550
 when they reached the Royal Australian Air Force 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.569
 such cases were generally dismissed as misleading to confuse 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:10.750
 cloud formations with an unknown flying object 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:16.350
 none of the specialists were able to explain what they are doing 

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.910
