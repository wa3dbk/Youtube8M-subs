00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.220
 good to all youtube friends 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:10.350
 Welcome to the analysis and here 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:13.050
 I bring black ops 2 finally but one 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.970
 so white way his name no longer suit 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.670
 in white 2 to detail as 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.900
 you will remember that you live in two parts 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.850
 explaining everything there was to the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.610
 date is ok but I had never brought a 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.520
 gameplay of the black ops commenting and 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.410
 good and what better than to bring a game of 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.720
 weapons that it seems to me that it is a to a 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.279
 amazing way and those that I most 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.620
 I like the truth of whites I think 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.050
 super fun is not nearly impossible 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.909
 get bored of him and good first thing 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.800
 I made when turning on the console with the 

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:42.239
 blackburn has been playing the game of 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.999
 weapons and I'm going to upload a set of weapons already 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.710
 that I love this way and good you 

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:48.629
 I'll bring a little bit of all of you suit 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.239
 gameplay in the blank ways upload 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.100
 blank is clear is not with the same 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.479
 often I upload modern warfare 3 or 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.789
 modern warfare 2 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.049
 but there will also be black ops on my channel 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.569
 It's worth as I told you, there's going to be everything 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:02.940
 in my channel that's about having 

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:04.390
 variety on my channel and good friends 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.240
 I hope you like it 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.520
 quality good quality yes I believe 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.490
 which is the new quality that I have made in 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.050
 my channel regarding the videos the first 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.780
 video that used this that had been the 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.400
 yesterday's video if you remember the buap that 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.930
 it is here where it is worth in the live 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.850
 streaming and good what I 've done has 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.850
 has been regulating a bit the saturation of 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.440
 video and focus it and if I think it looks 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.210
 much better and you already told me 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.290
 the comments that nothing else enter what 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.250
 first thing I've seen is that there was 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.490
 improved to him 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.280
 the video valÃ¨ncia the quality of the video 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.280
 well I hope you like it here we are 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.210
 in the black ops 2 in the weapon game and 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.380
 here you see me I'm already on the 6th gun 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.660
 there is a moment in which he advanced very 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.790
 fast but then at the end as always 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.500
 I try to do good here is the campero 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.869
 of shift up there or will you tell me 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.670
 you say uncle what are you doing up there since I 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:04.310
 are you counting shooting is up there 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:07.429
 also why I am here 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:13.709
 I'm very angry that when there's a 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:16.620
 change from one moment to another like that 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.930
 all sides came to me an authentic 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.959
 Desmadre and good at the end what 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.820
 I like it and there it is and good here 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.560
 I think it is the moment in which step 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.110
 fast weapon is worth there comes the 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.130
 friend and it's going to be on the other side but 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.400
 Now he comes and kills me from behind 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.670
 like I have not played for a long time 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.280
 I really do not have my head very well 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.620
 the backups in some game like you 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.530
 know well the responsive where to shoot 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.280
 and how to move you already have the game and 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.260
 you have the 20 to 0 walesa you can kill 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.480
 all without getting killed is very difficult 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.580
 but it is possible I have ever 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.370
 fact is true, although it has clearly not 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.950
 had capturing to capture it and 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.620
 well 6 the water tank that I put with him is 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.330
 nike for and here I am with the other 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.880
 sniper that I do not remember what it's called 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.480
 I think it was the wow wow if the wow 200 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.540
 boxes or 200 in effect and here the cup 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.370
 dad and I put two shiver and here I am 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.260
 with the little friend and here you see that what 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.260
 I do, I think they're going to go out there 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.900
 pulled from 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.549
 of recognition that is if I throw and gave 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.540
 one and he killed him perfect and if I see him 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:30.909
 I hurt I know there's nobody out there 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.709
 what happens if I do not hurt because I have 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:34.959
 free way to get a lot you have to 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.239
 control a bit let's say the whole area 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.269
 I play here a little crazy as I 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.879
 I said that I do not know myself very well 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:46.109
 paus of the enemies but if there 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:49.930
 played a while longer if there was 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:51.970
 I could not have made a game 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.709
 much better than this one this is a 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.930
 good game the truth I do not know I thought 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.799
 fun and I said was the channel 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:02.379
 head and as you will see now I am already 17 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:06.010
 it's worth 18 here I'm with the crossbow 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:08.409
 and here I make an uncle law me that always 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.900
 ok I try to flip a lot in planche 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:13.989
 I'm going to shoot to see if he sticks one 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.600
 from the other point of the map by the 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:19.269
 friend but I'm quite above 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.829
 him so there's no problem and here I am 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.320
 with the crossbow that this is the moment 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.849
 yes yes yes yes yes the pack and I read natural 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.470
 dead without nailing it and well here is 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:29.140
 flippant moment in which I say 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.030
 I'm going to kill one but not like you see here 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.880
 in the end 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.460
 let's say I'm going a little bit more flipo 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.190
 ok tried to kill from afar and I do not know if 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.900
 they kill me I think it does not kill me in any 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.780
 time but good try to shoot here a 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.490
 couple of times to the uncle but in the end as 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.080
 you will see I am going to get a death the 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.720
 it 's pretty good, I think 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.880
 that once 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.680
 and as you will see I will get a death 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.930
 pretty good I do not know also what I 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.060
 like to make a good camps and look 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.010
 If they kill me more times, I do not care 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.460
 what I want is a little show that is what 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.140
 what does the show that you generate matter and what does not 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.540
 good to see if you will see here he shot 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.090
 again more and is without the definitive 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.370
 head fixed and pac throughout the jack has 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.040
 lied the uncle will have to give the wadding 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.770
 fac nothing all the head and here you go to 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.510
 see the repetition and humiliation of 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.970
 valley sherd shoots me the do not give me 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.830
 the turn no no I do not know what happens to the baby 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.770
 but it was too late because the bug 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.860
 was on the way and there the whole eye was 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.970
 I put to mode as a flower on top of the 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.470
 ear and good I hope you liked it
