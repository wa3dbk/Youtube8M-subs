00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
shows will do the same because there's

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.820 
shows will do the same because there's
several<00:02:54.880> TV<00:02:55.210> shows<00:02:55.240> that<00:02:55.390> i<00:02:55.570> really<00:02:56.200> enjoy<00:02:56.530> but

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
several TV shows that i really enjoy but

several TV shows that i really enjoy but
it<00:02:57.010> just<00:02:57.160> doesn't<00:02:58.060> really<00:02:58.270> work<00:02:58.690> out<00:02:58.840> on<00:02:59.050> the

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
it just doesn't really work out on the

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.830 
it just doesn't really work out on the
network<00:03:00.370> television<00:03:01.090> because<00:03:01.510> mainly

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
network television because mainly

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.360 
network television because mainly
there's<00:03:02.290> a<00:03:02.470> number<00:03:02.770> of<00:03:02.950> factors<00:03:03.040> but

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
there's a number of factors but

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.800 
there's a number of factors but
sometimes<00:03:03.700> it<00:03:03.880> just<00:03:04.030> has<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.330> do<00:03:04.450> with<00:03:04.630> the

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
sometimes it just has to do with the

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.420 
sometimes it just has to do with the
time<00:03:05.110> slot<00:03:05.410> that<00:03:05.590> their<00:03:05.740> that<00:03:06.280> they're

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
time slot that their that they're

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.350 
time slot that their that they're
getting<00:03:06.610> because<00:03:07.000> they're<00:03:07.120> competing

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
getting because they're competing

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.210 
getting because they're competing
against<00:03:07.660> several<00:03:08.050> other<00:03:08.260> shows<00:03:08.530> that<00:03:08.770> people
