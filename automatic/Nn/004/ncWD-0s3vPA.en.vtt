00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.309
 then real men operations so 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.750
 one piece has 13 kg and then we wait 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.690

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.990
 Better single can be easy in the meat 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.060
 retract with spoonful of others 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.400
 you already know that we have the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.979
 chance raps of beef are 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.299
 beautifully marbled so German 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.780
 Meat is much better than it is 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.460
 call 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.890
 we were also total in taste 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.430
 the whole thing then in one 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.850
 big bowl really nice 1 rappen 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.790
 what has got you a workplace clean and 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.820
 there could be really massive grip 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.020
 I'm getting started with the work 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.450
 something very special 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.640
 that is a grace love of the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.110
 capital class manufactory zur 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.290
 have been provided 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.100
 the soon to market I go 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.520
 may already reveal so much that it is one 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.740
 Quitten will be great for Reebok rapeseed 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.640
 Here is the first time with magic that good 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.580
 then we use one 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.450
 dark john barclays for the short 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.629
 ribs the mainzer see for the same 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.300
 we 'll use it like philips right now 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:14.310
 I have something sharper rapp 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.409
 taken a bit more child 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.760
 written is so magic, the one with 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:22.290
 little shovel still incorporated 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.330
 as well rub in well again without 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.060
 any adhesive so no oil 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.540
 has used or sense 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.840
 not necessary again on both sides 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:37.550
 clean the place and if you use it 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.620
 are done then I was I the right 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.819
 nice to see one here and leave 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.819
 We feed the rub overnight 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.650
 The meeting took place at a good 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.260
 girlfriend and colleague of the group held 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.760
 and so we were allowed to do it ourselves 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.630
 use built smoker 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.780
 You'll see how I get the spareribs 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:02.330
 one shift for three hours, too 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.209
 that's why 321 method three hours too 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.709
 after the free lessons come in the smoke 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.290
 then the reddish ones out we do one 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.530
 bowl of apple juice and I have now 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.010
 already filled with honey 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.810
 then we send the ribs 1 that is 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.349
 as you will soon see heaps 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.959
 become 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.220
 I have the chopsticks again 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.560
 half cut through then we have 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.480
 seen that it really too big pieces 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.190
 are lying to each other and we 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.140
 wanted to go everywhere 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.519
 we see it is also quite well done 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.350
 we already have beautiful colors 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:39.640
 after the three hours of this steam room 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.620
 what will take now in this shell 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.280
 is very important to the connective tissue 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.209
 to convert egg white into the ribs in 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.549
 gelatin 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.040
 as a result, they were only tender and juicy 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:54.650
 and readable 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.709
 otherwise they are already right 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.639
 nice i can do it for you here 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:05.049
 with aluminum foil from behind a train 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:07.760
 on top lay well on the edge 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.500
 but they are not entirely up to you 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.019
 close in the middle with a third 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.150
 firma therefore after that would the 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.739
 after that scenes huge advantage that me 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.979
 First, the average driving can decrease 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.030
 he may be able to escape 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.489
 So you're asking yourself, too 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.150
 finger 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.430
 because it is so steam already with 110 degrees 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.550
 relatively fast disgusting fire 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.780
 caused and that's nothing what you 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.690
 Have a nice green afternoon 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.550
 wish the whole thing is now 150 degrees 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.410
 in the smoker lined by this time already 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.759
 the two hours through here I have 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.639
 you now 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:42.680
 and as you can see that is already one 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.669
 nice package 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.139
 I have a manual here 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.099
 placed around the tables bit by bit 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.020
 to shield heat 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:51.720
 You can now see the middle one 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.400
 Treatment can be easily removed from the selection 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.400
 then the fingers burn 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.210
 and then you can do it both ways 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:03.060
 The outer fairway does not look it 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.120
 terrific on the only thing left 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.699
 the rest is our ribs nice 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.440
 to paint as I said the glaces 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:12.930
 from the capital or something 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.199
 manufactory the dark currant the 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.569
 I have distributed to the bi fraps the 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:22.380
 something hard from the currant tool 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:26.130
 fit perfectly in light trot and 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.599
 music already sees this when painting 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.340
 hammer off moderately 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:31.530
 and that's exactly how it tasted 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.940
 I can assure you if you can 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.360
 No swine ripples so fast 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.310
 have on it much clean quitten 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.789
 glaze that the second is there in total 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:44.909
 to buy four klausuren later 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:45.870
 Anyway, if that comes to you 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:47.759
 to get hold of 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.889
 and here you can see how they follow 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:51.539
 an hour come down so ever 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:56.789
 seen a dazzling appearance as us 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:06:01.259
 have totally flashed super delicious despite 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:03.389
 all not overly sticky and whole 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:08.009
 all clubs taste in need 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:10.830
 as I said after quitte the how fraps the 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:13.740
 Here in front also looks beautiful 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.620
 as from the picture book the goods with the 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.910
 currant also very well served on 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.550
 The dishes were served to us then 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.530
 quite simple with the piece of sweet potatoes 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:28.680
 in good baguette more it did not 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:30.500
 used or very nice as you get me 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.180
 me a little bit for yesterday's day 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.460
 it was a great meeting of the 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.860
 bee gees was eating at autofans 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.290
 fantastic so the same match it 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:44.790
 back if the meat is a great one 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:47.400
 quality and everything has come away so 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:50.390
 completely there was nothing left 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:53.880
 biggest compliment for you is boiling 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:56.880
 otherwise they are without small caps 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.920
 worth to be a trial always gets 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.580
 almost always very well out so straight 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:05.640
 this 321 method you can do every one 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.500
 of you were king and so remains 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.510
 nothing to say is, if you 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.040
 Please do not like to recommend 

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.900
 then write me something in the 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.570
 comments I look forward to with you 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.520
 install and hopefully we'll see 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.930
 see you again next tuesday 18 o'clock if 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.200
 It again welcomes you to the barbecue 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.200
 king
