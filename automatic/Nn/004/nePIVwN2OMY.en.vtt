00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.980
 Hi, my dear, the students here are the teacher. 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.840
 josÃ© elias 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.990
 let's answer the question of a student 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.040
 Ours she saw the following doubt the 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:34.520
 engineer of the sudam in tone of challenge 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:38.090
 the colleague said that one fifth of the triple 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.830
 half of the number of projects under its 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.870
 responsibility 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:48.020
 added to the successor of that number shall not 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:51.129
 exceeded six points 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:55.339
 the number of possibilities for this 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:58.610
 number is let's assume an issue of 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:01.040
 a contest is very simple look let's go 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:05.449
 assume that this number is speaking 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.740
 be x then the number is x combining the 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.570
 number xis 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:15.740
 we want to find the value of x or the value 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:19.130
 x is it that day x 6 may have 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.229
 values we will call this value from 6 to 1 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.840
 the money then challenge help 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:30.980
 stated that one fifth to one fifth 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:37.340
 or the fifth a fifth looks a fifth is 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:42.950
 one on five of the triple opa of the triple 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:46.670
 of three times the number of 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:52.430
 designs she's half a pa 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.680
 half of xx sub 21 in the projects of its 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:59.210
 responsibility added to your 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.470
 sensor added in addition to your 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.870
 successor 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:09.259
 well since the number is x is the next in 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:14.390
 positive time nor is the successor the 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.650
 xis plus one and if its successor added 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.420
 to the successor 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:24.690
 not that final 6th day is 76 will have to 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:28.290
 be less than or equal to six 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.950
 solving this inequation we will find 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.750
 the value of x we will solve them 9 to 11 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:41.790
 times three bunk beds 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:49.290
 here gives 3 x 1 over five times 2 of 10 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:57.660
 but this xis plus one is smaller then you 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:03:09.150
 must 3 x 10 x is more or less 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:12.020
 to the other side - 13 x 10 plus x is less or 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.020
 equal to 5 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.510
 I'll speak the least common multiple is 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:23.370
 which hockenheim to the minimum common multiple 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.800
 where the common denominator not 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:33.150
 appears here is the common denominator between 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:39.540
 10 and 11 is 10 10/10 here it gives an egg 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:44.600
 times 3 x 1 on top of 3x plus 10 / 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:48.170
 honda 10 ten times ten times 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.550
 this is all less than or equal to 5 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:54.450
 Let's continue here on the right, let's go. 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:04:00.570
 continue right here on the right in 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:08.760
 3x plus 10 x 3 x 2 x 1 you're 13 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:10.739
 x on 10 is less than or equal to 5 and if 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.780
 must be dividing if you go through 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:17.609
 other side it will multiply you 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:21.919
 staying with 13 x is better than 10 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.919
 times 569 hit 50 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:33.949
 lake x is less than 50 the thirteen is 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.710
 multiplying will put there dividing the xv 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:42.909
 less than or equal to 50 km 13 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:49.069
 lake x is less than or equal to 50/13 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:51.259
 50/13 of less than 41 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:56.029
 then this number here if you split 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:58.009
 by 50/13 will give to 3.1 some 

00:04:56.029 --> 00:05:00.740
 Look, it does not interest me what a 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:04.669
 thing I know is less than 4 of 3g 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:08.150
 something he said the number of 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:10.879
 possibilities for this number either 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.849
 say the name possibility for the 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:18.050
 amount of projects that this money 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:19.969
 is working well he can then ox 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.830
 must be less than or equal to 3 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:24.889
 what are their possibilities for 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:28.250
 number of projects 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:30.169
 what are the possibilities well have 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.500
 that being less than or equal to 3 has to be 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:35.719
 an integer and not negative then 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.469
 being less than or equal to 3 may be zero 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:41.509
 projects that no project can be the 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:44.389
 project is less than or equal to 3 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:48.529
 can be two projects is less than or equal 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:50.710
 the 3 can be three projects can be 4 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:54.469
 no 4 is not less than 3 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:57.800
 these your chances then asked the 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:06:02.300
 number of possibilities we answer 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:05.960
 put the answer here answer how much 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:09.729
 the possibilities exist 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:12.949
 the amount of responsibility will be 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:17.810
 zero or one or two or three then one 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:21.759
 two three or four one two three or 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:25.870
 four there are four possibilities 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:25.870
 four possibilities 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:32.449
 there are four possibilities the alternative 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:35.020
 correct we find in the alternative 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:39.440
 of the letter b of ball 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:42.380
 another baseball squad on the issue that 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.780
 colleague our shipment well this was a 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.860
 knows that the student has sent to the 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.780
 people 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:51.620
 the question is even interesting right? 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:53.660
 involving first grade inadequacy 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.389
 and in the equation of the first degree 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.310
 I want to stop thanking her for 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:01.130
 have sent the two 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:03.320
 I want to remind you that they are 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:07.250
 many doubts then sometimes it takes 15 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.780
 days so that you can respond to all 

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:12.199
 the doubts sometimes I answer 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:14.210
 right through the times I do in pdf and 

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:17.960
 sometimes I record or record 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:20.780
 Quick and boot there on one side of mine 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.099
 facebook page or blog 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.990
 Elias teacher 

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:24.949
 or you can also visit the 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.310
 youtube 

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:29.930
 there on the channel that I put there well if you 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.570
 liked the video right? 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:35.180
 I like god, I liked it. 

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:38.330
 put in your favorite share with 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.530
 Colleagues, you give me life this with the 

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.229
 your friends 

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:44.000
 if you did not like life with your 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:47.479
 enemies, right? 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.530
 but in the result and this was done with 

00:07:47.479 --> 00:07:51.050
 much affection 

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:53.719
 I hope you liked it. 

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.770
 Good luck happiness and see you next time. 

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:57.880
 opportunity 

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.880
 Thank you and see you there.
