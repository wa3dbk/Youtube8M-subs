00:00:04.091 --> 00:00:07.539
 The skating fans have waited two years for this day. 

00:00:07.539 --> 00:00:11.406

00:00:11.406 --> 00:00:17.904
 The last time Kim played in the major tournament was the 2011 Moscow World Championships. 

00:00:17.904 --> 00:00:25.021
 There were so many speculations surrounding her as she was ready to go to London (Canada) 

00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:32.685
 In today's practice she looked exactly like the world champion and Olympic champion we saw in the past. 

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:36.386
 David Wilson begins his skating Kiss of the Vampire. 

00:03:29.872 --> 00:03:37.170
 Wow, please be careful. The current Olympic champion from Korea, she is back. 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.112
 What she just showed is not easy at all. 

00:03:40.112 --> 00:03:45.158
 I mean, it's been two seasons since she did not play in a high-level competition. 

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:51.245
 Kim Yu-na, who needed the mentality like steel, 

00:03:51.245 --> 00:03:55.359
 It was Kim Yu-na who showed a very good technical skill. 

00:03:59.135 --> 00:04:03.955
 Although she has not competed in the tournament for two years, she seems to have missed anything. 

00:04:03.955 --> 00:04:06.486
 I see a Korean coach and her sitting down. 

00:04:06.486 --> 00:04:09.791
 Here she shows her trademark triple lutz - triple toe combination. 

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.330
 Look at that trajectory. 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.448
 It is a much more difficult and high-level combination than the combination shown by Kaitlin. 

00:04:16.448 --> 00:04:20.322
 This element seems to get at least 11 points or more. 

00:04:20.322 --> 00:04:22.508
 Triple flip and everything we saw, 

00:04:22.508 --> 00:04:27.156
 Throughout the game, we showed all the components in a very calm and calm manner. 

00:04:27.156 --> 00:04:31.808
 We almost worship her. She's an Olympic champion. 

00:04:31.808 --> 00:04:35.179
 But she's just a human being and I've been doing a lot of shows in the past few years 

00:04:35.179 --> 00:04:38.922
 I have never seen a triple-triple in practice or in a show. 

00:04:38.922 --> 00:04:43.583
 Certainly, technology has prevailed, but when I look artistic, I think her performance is ... 

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:44.755
 passive? 

00:04:44.755 --> 00:04:46.602
 Yes, it seemed a little suppressed to me. 

00:04:46.602 --> 00:04:53.368
 Great speed, great ice, great quality, expressive ... 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.066
 - She's smart. She's here. - Wait a second. 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:10.204
 This score is here in London (Canada), which leads Kim to top # 1 over Kathleen Osmund. 

00:05:10.204 --> 00:05:12.549
 69.97 points. 

00:05:12.549 --> 00:05:16.415
 I think she wanted a higher score. Does not it look like that?
