00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:09.180
 Assist 4 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:11.610
 Self- speaker warned me, but I'm still the first driver in the car 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.450
 That car did for me 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.760
 Will be 30 km and City Emergency Brake 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.570
 So Yes Let's go one more time 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.770
 I'm sorry to rear-end it has achieved time than immediately while ago 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.770
 Well then I want to go 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.070
 Chinese artists can do it themselves 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:35.809
 Yes than How about would be that 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.370
 It may be only another you know when I this that up because is intended to assist 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.050
 By 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.890
 d imitate and if the low-speed range I might be or are also Tomah brake 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.790
 Because it is something to assist 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.210
 It is 100 k again, and it is totally better if you hit an assist rather than hitting it all the time. 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.310
 I think that I'm strongly that it is safe 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.840
 Yes 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:56.430
 Two of in over there this replenishment likely Tteyuu 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.490
 Then I think that want to go cruise control 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.040
 I think cc something even your Zonchi or 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.949
 Set to I try to turn on the sound's 50 come 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.080
 I will accelerate to 50 km, but 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.080
 There may be a place now 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.580
 If it is late before it 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.990
 We will continue to pursue up to 0 km 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.670
 It is a skin shoe cruise control 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.670
 A scene like a traffic jam 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.370
 I have not asked 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:33.600
 I don't like it for 3 seconds, and everything will restart on snow 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.960
 Yes Yes the start in such a way as stepping on the accelerator a little 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.440
 There was also a form 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.440
 The next short stop within 3 seconds will come out without permission 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.060
 Because for us then if Well it around the curve 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.060
 Tsu bread Markit do you do wonder if you suburban road 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:56.880
 For those who do n't usually use it 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.180
 It is convenient to use on the highway if you can only prepare to step on the brake because you just set it in 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.000
 you know 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:05.110
 I say it's easy to say 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.440
 Well, I knew I had a good device , but I did not want to buy it as an option 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.640
 I think also quite some people that say I'm with you do in such a form so far 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.370
 Say Therefore, 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.530
 It is attached to two grades with this standard equipment 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.220
 redline is optional 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.220
 I can say that 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:29.310
 If you set 89 and go to 130, then that 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.599
 If you step on the accelerator you will go to there uniquely but it will fall to 80 km again Yes 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.860
 x will not 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.569
 That's right I will be bitten 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.170
 Next long stop 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:44.230
 Directly below see that is to really start-stop it is was more than 3 seconds 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:48.060
 If I save fuel with this, I think it is like an intersection or a level crossing, but 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.090
 That doing this was so kind of long stop manufacturers listen 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.769
 so 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:56.630
 It is a restart, but I think this is a situation like an intersection this time 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.770
 Make safety check in and put in the accelerator and 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.640
 I want to live 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:06.050
 Cruise control is still alive, so it is a set tribe 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:09.640
 When the previous car starts , I think it 's my turn now 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.640
 Restore the start stop system 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.270
 It may be possible to check the safety 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.630
 Yes over over 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.630
 Or always pass 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.030
 It's convenient. Play Kyoto, of course. 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.710
 There is such a thing 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.330
 Just after 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:40.420
 Of course you 'll get this stem and say it 's good as a car 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:45.000
 There are still few in the world, but it is the brake assist that is only noticed in Japan 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:48.560
 The thing of collision mitigation is because it is attached with the standard equipment 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.400
 Because such a place is very chance now 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.400
 Yes
