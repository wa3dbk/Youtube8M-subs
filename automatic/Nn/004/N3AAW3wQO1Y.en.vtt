because this is the only way you're

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.980 
because this is the only way you're
going<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.759> be<00:01:59.850> able<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.119> modify<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.689> behavior

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
going to be able to modify the behavior

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.920 
going to be able to modify the behavior
of<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.710> weapon<00:02:01.890> for<00:02:02.759> example<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.299> laser<00:02:03.540> sight

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
of a weapon for example the laser sight

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.950 
of a weapon for example the laser sight
actually<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:04.979> visualized<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.030> gun<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.869> you

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
actually is visualized on the gun so you

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.350 
actually is visualized on the gun so you
can<00:02:07.140> see<00:02:07.500> when<00:02:07.770> someone<00:02:08.129> is<00:02:08.250> doing<00:02:08.429> work<00:02:09.119> to

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
can see when someone is doing work to

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.869 
can see when someone is doing work to
you<00:02:09.539> at<00:02:09.810> close<00:02:10.319> range<00:02:10.709> firing<00:02:11.430> from<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.790> hip

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
you at close range firing from the hip

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.490 
you at close range firing from the hip
the<00:02:12.690> mms

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the mms

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.380 
the mms
a good<00:02:13.710> example<00:02:13.800> of<00:02:14.190> an<00:02:14.340> attachment<00:02:14.610> where

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
a good example of an attachment where

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.180 
a good example of an attachment where
you<00:02:15.690> actually<00:02:15.840> send<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.140> pulse<00:02:16.380> wave<00:02:16.710> through

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
you actually send a pulse wave through

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.130 
you actually send a pulse wave through
the<00:02:17.370> world<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.790> can<00:02:17.910> detect<00:02:18.240> people<00:02:18.630> it's<00:02:19.020> a

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
the world and can detect people it's a

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.900 
the world and can detect people it's a
rushers<00:02:19.560> tool<00:02:19.800> you<00:02:20.010> will<00:02:20.040> see<00:02:20.370> them<00:02:20.550> when

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
rushers tool you will see them when

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.880 
rushers tool you will see them when
they're<00:02:21.030> stationary<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.810> through<00:02:22.170> smoke<00:02:22.530> you

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
they're stationary and through smoke you

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.710 
they're stationary and through smoke you
can<00:02:23.040> use<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.460> in<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.670> standoff<00:02:24.060> battle<00:02:24.540> and

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
can use that in a standoff battle and

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.900 
can use that in a standoff battle and
take<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.380> guy<00:02:25.530> down<00:02:25.580> so<00:02:26.580> that's<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.880> very
