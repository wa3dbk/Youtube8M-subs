00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.469 
go through algae or whatever or a lot of
weeds<00:01:51.890> it's<00:01:52.159> going<00:01:52.369> to<00:01:52.430> get<00:01:52.670> ketchup<00:01:53.299> and

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
weeds it's going to get ketchup and

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.390 
weeds it's going to get ketchup and
stuff<00:01:53.570> yeah<00:01:53.869> but<00:01:54.560> for<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:54.830> most<00:01:54.979> part<00:01:55.100> it

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
stuff yeah but for the most part it

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.569 
stuff yeah but for the most part it
sweetness<00:01:56.710> this<00:01:57.710> will<00:01:57.890> have<00:01:58.009> a<00:01:58.040> slow<00:01:58.310> fall

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
sweetness this will have a slow fall

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.100 
sweetness this will have a slow fall
rate<00:01:58.790> because<00:01:59.090> it's<00:01:59.210> not<00:01:59.360> weighted<00:01:59.720> hook<00:01:59.840> and

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
rate because it's not weighted hook and

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.980 
rate because it's not weighted hook and
it<00:02:00.979> will<00:02:01.100> actually<00:02:01.369> this<00:02:02.240> tail<00:02:02.509> will<00:02:02.689> actually

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
it will actually this tail will actually

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.050 
it will actually this tail will actually
flutter<00:02:03.920> as<00:02:04.130> it<00:02:04.310> falls<00:02:04.490> down<00:02:07.000> second<00:02:08.000> way

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
flutter as it falls down second way

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.600 
flutter as it falls down second way
right<00:02:08.299> like<00:02:08.569> a<00:02:08.599> rigid<00:02:08.840> way<00:02:09.439> to<00:02:09.500> get<00:02:09.739> poked<00:02:09.950> same

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
right like a rigid way to get poked same

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.059 
right like a rigid way to get poked same
thing<00:02:11.030> I<00:02:11.300> just<00:02:11.569> showed<00:02:11.840> you<00:02:12.020> have<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.860> groove

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
to where the hook turns pierce it to the

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:18.809 
to where the hook turns pierce it to the
backside<00:02:17.830> of<00:02:17.860> where<00:02:18.129> the<00:02:18.190> groove<00:02:18.370> facing<00:02:18.549> you

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
backside of where the groove facing you

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.149 
backside of where the groove facing you
push<00:02:19.720> that<00:02:19.930> weight<00:02:20.140> through<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.590> worm<00:02:21.360> as<00:02:22.360> so

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
push that weight through the worm as so

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.280 
push that weight through the worm as so
put<00:02:24.159> that<00:02:24.190> worm<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:25.299> top<00:02:25.510> arm<00:02:25.780> on<00:02:25.930> that<00:02:26.049> keep

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
put that worm the top arm on that keep

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.710 
put that worm the top arm on that keep
like<00:02:26.500> that<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.940> see<00:02:28.090> how<00:02:28.120> that<00:02:28.390> hooks<00:02:28.569> like

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
like that you see how that hooks like

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.420 
like that you see how that hooks like
this<00:02:28.930> Pierce<00:02:29.409> it<00:02:29.560> through<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.860> whole<00:02:30.069> entire

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
this Pierce it through the whole entire

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.530 
this Pierce it through the whole entire
worm<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.150> belly<00:02:31.470> boom

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
worm to the belly boom

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.660 
worm to the belly boom
we<00:02:34.540> this<00:02:34.750> weighted<00:02:35.049> gap<00:02:35.230> hook<00:02:35.440> Oh

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
we this weighted gap hook Oh

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.910 
we this weighted gap hook Oh
it'll<00:02:37.510> have<00:02:37.599> a<00:02:37.629> faster<00:02:38.290> fall<00:02:38.500> rate<00:02:38.680> because

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
it'll have a faster fall rate because

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.589 
it'll have a faster fall rate because
it's<00:02:39.069> weighted<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:39.519> it'll<00:02:39.970> fall<00:02:40.120> down<00:02:40.180> like<00:02:40.540> a

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
it's weighted and it'll fall down like a

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.530 
it's weighted and it'll fall down like a
natural<00:02:40.989> bait<00:02:41.200> like<00:02:41.590> this

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
natural bait like this

I<00:02:58.569> have<00:02:59.440> it<00:02:59.560> in<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.680> middle<00:02:59.799> of<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.069> worm<00:03:00.190> like

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
I have it in the middle of the worm like

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.160 
I have it in the middle of the worm like
that<00:03:01.590> that<00:03:02.590> way<00:03:02.739> when<00:03:02.950> this<00:03:03.069> falls<00:03:03.400> down<00:03:04.170> these

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
that that way when this falls down these

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.380 
that that way when this falls down these
arms<00:03:05.530> will<00:03:05.620> undulate<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.190> they'll<00:03:06.390> they'll

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
arms will undulate and they'll they'll

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.229 
arms will undulate and they'll they'll
move<00:03:07.650> as<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:08.829> falls<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:09.430> then<00:03:09.849> you<00:03:09.909> can<00:03:10.060> bounce

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
move as it falls and then you can bounce

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.289 
move as it falls and then you can bounce
it<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:10.840> then<00:03:11.769> or<00:03:12.459> you<00:03:12.579> can<00:03:12.730> just<00:03:12.849> jerk<00:03:13.090> jerk

jerk jerk and these arms will pivot and

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.890 
jerk jerk and these arms will pivot and
they'll<00:03:15.670> move<00:03:16.829> three<00:03:17.829> ways<00:03:17.980> like<00:03:18.129> to<00:03:18.310> fish<00:03:18.459> it

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
they'll move three ways like to fish it

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.420 
they'll move three ways like to fish it
weightless<00:03:19.900> weighted<00:03:20.680> like<00:03:21.340> a<00:03:21.370> big<00:03:23.430> hook
