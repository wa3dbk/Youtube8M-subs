be weed whipping maybe once or twice a

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.300 
be weed whipping maybe once or twice a
year<00:02:30.900> at<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.140> most<00:02:31.290> if<00:02:31.560> you're<00:02:31.739> interested<00:02:32.190> in

year at the most if you're interested in

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.540 
year at the most if you're interested in
doing<00:02:32.489> that<00:02:32.850> does<00:02:33.720> well<00:02:34.050> in<00:02:34.350> shady<00:02:34.709> situations

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
doing that does well in shady situations

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.120

I think this is my favorite this is the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.720 
I think this is my favorite this is the
sensitive<00:02:48.570> plant<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:49.620> we<00:02:49.920> all<00:02:50.070> knew<00:02:50.489> and

sensitive plant that we all knew and

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.240 
sensitive plant that we all knew and
learned<00:02:50.910> about<00:02:51.209> in<00:02:51.600> biology<00:02:51.810> class<00:02:52.290> when<00:02:53.100> you

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
learned about in biology class when you

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.490 
learned about in biology class when you
touch<00:02:53.519> it<00:02:53.550> it<00:02:53.910> responds<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.600> stimuli<00:02:55.050> we<00:02:55.380> know

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500

they<00:03:03.540> live<00:03:03.810> flat<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.440> we<00:03:04.620> have<00:03:04.739> pink<00:03:05.040> flowers

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
they live flat and we have pink flowers

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.340 
they live flat and we have pink flowers
from<00:03:06.000> oh<00:03:06.440> I'd<00:03:07.440> say<00:03:07.950> late<00:03:08.700> February<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.200> end
