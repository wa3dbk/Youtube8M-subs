International Academy of oral medicine
toxicology<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:34.129> they<00:00:35.129> are<00:00:35.809> basically

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
toxicology and they are basically

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.250 
toxicology and they are basically
looking<00:00:37.050> at<00:00:37.350> how<00:00:37.470> poisons<00:00:38.010> work<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:39.260> mercury

looking at how poisons work and mercury

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.810 
looking at how poisons work and mercury
was<00:00:40.470> one<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.040> things<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.400> was<00:00:41.580> concerned

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
was one of the things I was concerned

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.450 
was one of the things I was concerned
about<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.540> what<00:00:43.379> immediately<00:00:43.769> pops<00:00:44.070> up<00:00:44.309> is

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
about and what immediately pops up is

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.399 
about and what immediately pops up is
fluoride<00:00:44.820> because<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.720> real<00:00:46.140> nasty

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:46.409 
fluoride because it's a real nasty

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:48.170 
fluoride because it's a real nasty
poison<00:00:46.769> and<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.519> know<00:00:47.730> we<00:00:47.850> started

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
poison and so you know we started

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.540 
poison and so you know we started
looking<00:00:48.269> at<00:00:48.510> how<00:00:48.659> it<00:00:48.809> damage<00:00:49.710> tyroid<00:00:50.250> and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
looking at how it damage tyroid and

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.479 
looking at how it damage tyroid and
bones<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.150> brains<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.720> all<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.960> stuff<00:00:52.199> and

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
bones and brains and all that stuff and

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.340 
bones and brains and all that stuff and
this<00:00:53.489> isn't<00:00:53.790> a<00:00:53.970> good<00:00:54.089> way<00:00:54.269> to<00:00:54.329> prevent<00:00:54.930> dental

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
this isn't a good way to prevent dental

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.970 
this isn't a good way to prevent dental
disease<00:00:55.649> not<00:00:55.890> at<00:00:56.039> all<00:00:56.190> it's<00:00:56.609> a<00:00:56.820> dangerous<00:00:57.390> way

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.280 

you'd<00:01:03.670> have<00:01:03.820> to<00:01:04.000> ask<00:01:04.089> them<00:01:04.300> that<00:01:04.510> because<00:01:04.750> I<00:01:05.019> I

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
you'd have to ask them that because I I

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.140 
you'd have to ask them that because I I
hate<00:01:05.560> to<00:01:05.800> ascribe<00:01:06.460> somebody<00:01:06.850> else's

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
hate to ascribe somebody else's

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.910 
hate to ascribe somebody else's
motivation<00:01:07.810> but<00:01:07.930> I<00:01:07.990> think<00:01:08.290> money<00:01:08.560> might<00:01:08.800> have

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
motivation but I think money might have

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.980 
motivation but I think money might have
something<00:01:09.340> to<00:01:09.370> do<00:01:09.550> with<00:01:09.640> it<00:01:09.820> I<00:01:10.000> don't<00:01:10.810> think

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
something to do with it I don't think

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.510 
something to do with it I don't think
there's<00:01:11.290> any<00:01:11.440> reason<00:01:11.710> on<00:01:11.950> God's<00:01:12.190> green<00:01:12.490> earth

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
there's any reason on God's green earth

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.880 
there's any reason on God's green earth
why<00:01:12.940> they<00:01:13.119> should<00:01:13.390> you<00:01:14.200> know<00:01:14.290> if<00:01:14.440> they<00:01:14.590> really

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
why they should you know if they really

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.430 
why they should you know if they really
cared<00:01:15.159> about<00:01:15.220> people<00:01:15.580> and<00:01:15.850> kids<00:01:16.180> and<00:01:16.510> and<00:01:16.900> it's

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
cared about people and kids and and it's

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.980 
cared about people and kids and and it's
just<00:01:17.560> a<00:01:17.950> way<00:01:18.100> to<00:01:18.130> for<00:01:18.729> industry<00:01:19.180> to<00:01:19.330> get<00:01:19.750> money

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
just a way to for industry to get money

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.200 
just a way to for industry to get money

toothpaste and you know it wasn't until
we<00:01:34.640> actually<00:01:35.030> started<00:01:35.450> studying<00:01:35.990> what<00:01:36.680> cause

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
we actually started studying what cause

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.130 
we actually started studying what cause
tooth<00:01:37.220> decay<00:01:37.310> that<00:01:38.210> we<00:01:38.330> realized<00:01:38.720> that<00:01:38.930> you

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
tooth decay that we realized that you

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.480 
tooth decay that we realized that you
know<00:01:39.230> there<00:01:39.560> are<00:01:39.620> a<00:01:39.680> lot<00:01:39.950> of<00:01:39.980> things<00:01:40.310> that

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
know there are a lot of things that

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.240 
know there are a lot of things that
stopped<00:01:40.730> tooth<00:01:40.940> decay<00:01:41.150> in<00:01:41.540> its<00:01:41.990> tract<00:01:42.350> boom<00:01:42.740> no

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
stopped tooth decay in its tract boom no

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.400 
stopped tooth decay in its tract boom no
further<00:01:43.550> due<00:01:43.820> to<00:01:43.850> a<00:01:44.060> problem<00:01:44.540> and<00:01:45.050> it's<00:01:45.230> not

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
further due to a problem and it's not

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.780 
further due to a problem and it's not
fluoride<00:01:45.980> and<00:01:46.520> so<00:01:47.230> one<00:01:48.230> it's<00:01:48.380> ineffective<00:01:48.790> -

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
fluoride and so one it's ineffective -

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.540 
fluoride and so one it's ineffective -
it's<00:01:49.940> dangerous<00:01:50.470> and<00:01:51.470> so<00:01:51.890> you<00:01:51.950> know<00:01:52.160> why<00:01:52.370> would

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
it's dangerous and so you know why would

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.240 
it's dangerous and so you know why would
you<00:01:52.640> recommend<00:01:52.940> it<00:01:53.210> so<00:01:53.960> as<00:01:54.440> a<00:01:54.470> dentist<00:01:54.920> I<00:01:55.070> say

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
it's got the same warning on it you'd

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.200 
it's got the same warning on it you'd
find<00:02:02.900> on<00:02:03.050> a<00:02:03.080> 38<00:02:03.560> caliber<00:02:04.040> pistol<00:02:04.070> keep<00:02:04.850> out<00:02:05.090> of

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.510 

actually<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:13.140> accelerates<00:02:13.709> gum<00:02:13.950> disease<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:14.489> I

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
actually it accelerates gum disease so I

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.250 
actually it accelerates gum disease so I
would<00:02:14.790> say<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.030> know<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.540> causes<00:02:15.780> different

would say you know it causes different

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.130 
would say you know it causes different
problems<00:02:16.830> but<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.970> doesn't<00:02:18.480> work<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.780> way

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
problems but it doesn't work that way

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.860 
problems but it doesn't work that way
it's<00:02:19.680> not<00:02:19.860> effective<00:02:20.849> it's<00:02:21.060> not<00:02:21.269> there's<00:02:21.810> a
