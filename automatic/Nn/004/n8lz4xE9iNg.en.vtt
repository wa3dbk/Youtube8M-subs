00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
and cleaned it was time to move on to

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.080 
and cleaned it was time to move on to
the<00:02:02.100> other<00:02:02.250> component<00:02:02.940> in<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.179> bearing<00:02:03.479> set

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.210 

because<00:02:08.090> I<00:02:08.119> had<00:02:08.450> cut<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.959> bicycle<00:02:09.590> headset

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
because I had cut the bicycle headset

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.030 
because I had cut the bicycle headset
shaft<00:02:10.640> in<00:02:10.970> half<00:02:11.300> when<00:02:12.110> I<00:02:12.140> was<00:02:12.349> salvaging<00:02:12.920> the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
shaft in half when I was salvaging the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.059 
shaft in half when I was salvaging the
components<00:02:13.580> from<00:02:13.700> recycled<00:02:14.300> bicycle<00:02:14.810> I

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
components from recycled bicycle I

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.580 
components from recycled bicycle I
needed<00:02:16.069> to<00:02:16.250> clean<00:02:16.940> up<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.269> end<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.349> pipe

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
needed to clean up the end of the pipe

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.650 
needed to clean up the end of the pipe
and<00:02:18.860> I<00:02:19.550> also<00:02:19.790> needed<00:02:20.269> to<00:02:20.390> sandblast<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.500> pipes

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
and I also needed to sandblast the pipes

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.229 
and I also needed to sandblast the pipes
after<00:02:23.660> doing<00:02:24.260> that<00:02:24.440> it<00:02:25.400> made<00:02:25.610> it<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.849> lot<00:02:25.970> easier

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
after doing that it made it a lot easier

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.680 
after doing that it made it a lot easier
for<00:02:26.480> me<00:02:26.810> to<00:02:27.099> refit<00:02:28.099> the<00:02:28.280> bearing<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.849> back

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
for me to refit the bearing and back

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.320 
for me to refit the bearing and back
onto<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.319> cleaned<00:02:30.620> up<00:02:30.800> headset<00:02:31.340> tube<00:02:31.610> as<00:02:32.090> you

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
onto the cleaned up headset tube as you
