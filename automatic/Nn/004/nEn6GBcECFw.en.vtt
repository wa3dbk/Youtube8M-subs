me personally to have to deal with a
knee<00:00:40.230> injury<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.680> think<00:00:41.070> all<00:00:41.489> those<00:00:41.640> years<00:00:41.850> of

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
knee injury I think all those years of

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.729 
knee injury I think all those years of
playing<00:00:42.329> national<00:00:42.840> team<00:00:42.960> basketball<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
playing national team basketball in the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.069 
playing national team basketball in the
summer<00:00:44.120> definitely<00:00:45.120> caught<00:00:45.329> up<00:00:45.450> with<00:00:45.629> me<00:00:45.840> but

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
summer definitely caught up with me but

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.500 
summer definitely caught up with me but
uh<00:00:46.110> I'm<00:00:47.010> here<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.640> now<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:47.850> hopefully<00:00:48.210> I

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
uh I'm here for you now and hopefully I

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.990 
uh I'm here for you now and hopefully I
can<00:00:48.660> be<00:00:48.809> ready<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.140> go<00:00:49.230> for<00:00:49.440> tomorrow<00:00:50.000> and

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
can be ready to go for tomorrow and

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.590 
can be ready to go for tomorrow and
defense<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.809> huge<00:00:51.899> part<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.350> your<00:00:52.469> game<00:00:52.680> so

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
defense is a huge part of your game so

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.330 
defense is a huge part of your game so
why<00:00:54.600> do<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.809> think<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.680> team<00:00:56.100> has

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
why do you think that the team has

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.729 
why do you think that the team has
struggled<00:00:56.730> defensively<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.629> year<00:00:57.870> well<00:00:58.530> you

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
struggled defensively this year well you

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.500 
struggled defensively this year well you
have<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.070> put<00:00:59.190> everything<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.730> perspective<00:00:59.820> we

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
have to put everything in perspective we

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.110 
have to put everything in perspective we
are<00:01:00.539> high<00:01:00.960> fast<00:01:01.590> break<00:01:01.859> fast<00:01:02.219> paced<00:01:02.550> team<00:01:02.850> so

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
are high fast break fast paced team so

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.729 
are high fast break fast paced team so
therefore<00:01:03.329> other<00:01:03.960> team<00:01:04.290> are<00:01:04.409> gonna<00:01:04.530> have

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
therefore other team are gonna have

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.950 
therefore other team are gonna have
definitely<00:01:05.309> more<00:01:06.000> opportunities<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.720> score

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
definitely more opportunities to score

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.719 
definitely more opportunities to score
and<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.320> play<00:01:07.560> at<00:01:07.680> such<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> fast<00:01:08.130> pace<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.670> I

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
and we play at such a fast pace that I

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.210 
and we play at such a fast pace that I
it's<00:01:09.299> gonna<00:01:09.420> be<00:01:09.570> tougher<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.960> stop<00:01:10.680> people<00:01:10.830> but

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
it's gonna be tougher to stop people but

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.859 
it's gonna be tougher to stop people but
i<00:01:11.250> think<00:01:11.580> i<00:01:11.670> would<00:01:11.820> definitely<00:01:12.090> put<00:01:12.390> emphasis

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
i think i would definitely put emphasis

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.109 
i think i would definitely put emphasis
into<00:01:13.260> trying<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.010> stop<00:01:14.250> those<00:01:14.400> guys<00:01:14.640> but<00:01:14.970> we

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
into trying to stop those guys but we

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.910 
into trying to stop those guys but we
have<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> group<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.930> guys<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.140> have<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.740> play

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
have a group of guys that have to play

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.670 
have a group of guys that have to play
fast<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:18.150> order<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.479> succeed<00:01:18.810> i<00:01:19.020> think<00:01:19.320> there

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
fast in order to succeed i think there

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.890 
fast in order to succeed i think there
is<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> stat<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.159> we<00:01:20.580> are<00:01:20.729> one<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.180> 16<00:01:21.630> when<00:01:21.810> we

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
is a stat that we are one in 16 when we

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.230 
is a stat that we are one in 16 when we
score<00:01:22.170> under<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:23.130> hundred<00:01:23.430> points<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:23.939> we<00:01:23.970> have

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
score under a hundred points so we have

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.420 
score under a hundred points so we have
to<00:01:24.390> speed<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> game<00:01:24.810> up<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.350> i<00:01:25.799> think<00:01:26.100> if<00:01:26.369> we

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
to speed the game up and i think if we

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.280 
to speed the game up and i think if we
have<00:01:26.700> everybody<00:01:27.060> healthy<00:01:27.330> whatever

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
have everybody healthy whatever

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.039 
have everybody healthy whatever
definitely<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> better<00:01:28.920> record<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:30.390> what<00:01:30.900> will

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
definitely a better record and what will

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.249 
definitely a better record and what will

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.439 
rkelly yes I think somebody one day one
of<00:05:34.960> my<00:05:35.080> friends<00:05:35.470> told<00:05:35.500> me<00:05:35.740> that<00:05:36.010> uh<00:05:36.360> arcade<00:05:37.360> is

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:37.449 
of my friends told me that uh arcade is

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:39.390 
of my friends told me that uh arcade is
a<00:05:37.539> pretty<00:05:37.690> good<00:05:37.870> basketball<00:05:38.020> player<00:05:38.440> and<00:05:38.919> it

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
a pretty good basketball player and it

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.710 
a pretty good basketball player and it
kind<00:05:39.550> of<00:05:39.610> looks<00:05:39.820> at<00:05:39.940> me<00:05:40.150> with<00:05:40.270> a<00:05:40.330> little

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
kind of looks at me with a little

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.779 
kind of looks at me with a little
straighter<00:05:41.080> braids<00:05:41.470> so<00:05:41.889> i<00:05:42.130> would<00:05:42.550> have<00:05:42.669> to

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
straighter braids so i would have to

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.279 
straighter braids so i would have to
pick<00:05:43.060> our<00:05:43.300> key<00:05:43.449> because<00:05:43.690> it's<00:05:43.840> kind<00:05:43.930> of<00:05:44.050> tall

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
pick our key because it's kind of tall

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:46.740 
pick our key because it's kind of tall
so<00:05:44.620> i<00:05:44.650> guess<00:05:44.979> that's<00:05:45.250> the<00:05:45.310> closest<00:05:45.880> person

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
so i guess that's the closest person

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.140 
so i guess that's the closest person
that<00:05:47.199> I<00:05:47.229> would<00:05:47.409> say<00:05:47.620> could<00:05:48.490> be<00:05:48.520> like<00:05:48.849> a<00:05:48.880> row

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150
