 Nine people today want you from 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:11.880
 our fitness of 2015 or 2015 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:16.880
 show we were in the real all in mdm 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.880
 and let go in the organic store matura 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:32.559
 so we will be full again gigantic 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:35.440
 once as built in the 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:39.360
 bought bioladen kernseife there we can 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.620
 soon to make an extra video 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.050
 usually with him on the internet 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.230
 ordered because it always has nature there 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:51.070
 We brought so few so so 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:56.379
 we learn in aldi 2 markus and bought 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:59.739
 Wish price at natura was here 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.120
 the loks in the offer for 199 so the 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.360
 species we had not now 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.700
 Let's try a few more 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.360
 so there is little word in it 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.360
 actually quite cool 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:17.470
 apps still three times a smear machine 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.720
 So it's definitely vegan, though 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.360
 when the guitar is taut together 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.290
 a nature alone in lidl will have then 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.020
 Spinach is often bought in ours 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.210
 green smoothies or help again 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.609
 like so then datteln 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.500
 which are held by Lidl also better than 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:36.789
 from aldi 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.869
 I find it a bit crisper 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:43.570
 somebody they are firm in all these things 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.840
 good german mud and the people yes 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:50.590
 then we would just have wiegand 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.630
 bought in real there make us now 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.219
 New Year's Eve my pizza de that's how it is 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:02.880
 an exception with good free 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:05.799
 pizza delivery and the apples bought here 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:12.460
 then it goes on 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:26.790
 it was good it fresh banquet him happy 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:32.769
 for a salad lidl a wheel of fortune gm 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:36.390
 as well as four times rice milk never 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.830
 again a promille from the hedgehog 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.540
 that was then we still have the 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.040
 Love on the left and that 's it then 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.950
 the first time a lidl the malki riad to the 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.480
 polio in broccoli at the truth 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.849
 been a bit cheaper with the 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.129
 occurs taken away then we have here 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:57.250
 still be minimal campers in all this 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.840
 comes all stuff from the all the whole 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.689
 once we film here we had two more 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.580
 couple pauli party was hole from the 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:06.400
 leader 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.739
 yes still a lips the product is right 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.870
 from a natura that is raw materials 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.250
 usually that would not be the fans of 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.549
 German printer but my players 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.500
 he had made something delicious and there 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:21.159
 yes has a lot of protein so therefore 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.670
 have to take it again where that 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:26.140
 It was now from a tour on the lidl 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:31.299
 then we had aldi from yet 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:35.349
 lime green onions zucchini 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:37.450
 paprika 2 marcus coolly to it to me 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.920
 We did not like to do both 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:43.310
 Now eating is very much like potatoes 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:48.180
 then it goes on 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.490
 heidelberger parked tangerines lady 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.600
 is different world and therefore it was only one 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.860
 victory 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:59.400
 a pomegranate then tomatoes 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.050
 hacked is for still tomatoes 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.020
 For example , I wanted one 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.940
 make modeling or so 2000 kidney 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.720
 beans we have some now 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.670
 that is why it only became 2000 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.760
 yes, then totally cool took over 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.799
 found in the al deen 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.200
 they are already totally matured so should 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.299
 They always give it to you now 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.490
 it can indeed times down we find there have 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:27.140
 now our crate bananas including 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.760
 table in the restaurant to the last crates 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.820
 Tomorrow, Iran will pick up a new order 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.870
 abandoned again 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.310
 we thought maybe it was not enough 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.480
 in the hold still the mature in the 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:42.870
 viewed and then packed with 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.580
 Bio potatoes always buy the ears 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.320
 is the true because simply 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:51.570
 taste better are a bit 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:54.300
 more expensive but that's worth it to us 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.890
 how many potatoes do you eat now? 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.210
 but then we have two more fires 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.530
 which is due to preliminary work of therefore only two 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.940
 we also had some leeks 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:08.090
 forever not always watching what we do 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:11.300
 conjure it up and grapes twice and 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:15.720
 clementinen one home has not said 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:19.200
 I'm afraid to sleep and otherwise we have 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:22.350
 stop short here comes back 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:26.760
 pineapple and other things put lemon 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.970
 also grapefruit and mini halal so one 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.970
 little 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:46.020
 you buy these hearts here these 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:46.020
 falls out 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:06:01.030
 and then we have times normal 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:06:03.520
 bought and for the price I know I found 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.840
 what exactly tasted but what up 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.850
 every case is right and where we are 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.050
 should pay attention to the new years i think 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.060
 most of you really have mine 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.880
 many heaps healthy food fat 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.470
 burn off lose muscle build up what 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.550
 even if you have supermarkets 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.500
 come in directly at the 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.210
 sweets or sweets department 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.190
 because it's just the devil 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.330
 department that is almost the best 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.340
 is not hungry shopping either 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.990
 Do not go hungry shopping 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.640
 already strikes past the department 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.740
 because this is not usually direct anyway 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.780
 at the beginning because people beat it 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.850
 at the very end of the box is indeed synonymous 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.200
 again something is just over 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:38.140
 and do not make life for yourself 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.270
 then it remains hard to set priorities and 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.800
 moved left and right in the supermarket 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.700
 but just go to the things handy 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.400
 really needs 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.530
 our tip in any case in this 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.630
 in any case already think a happy one 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:53.820
 new year or good slip 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.820
 first under load crash
