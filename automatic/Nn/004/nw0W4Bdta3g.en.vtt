usually use about 60 or 70 pounds
pressure<00:01:51.190> I<00:01:51.340> don't<00:01:51.490> want<00:01:51.610> to<00:01:51.670> put<00:01:51.820> too<00:01:51.970> much

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120

into<00:01:52.330> these<00:01:52.450> old<00:01:52.660> pipes<00:01:52.840> I<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:55.840> about<00:01:56.020> 70

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
into these old pipes I have about 70

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.840 
into these old pipes I have about 70

I've<00:01:57.940> just<00:01:58.060> opened<00:01:58.210> up<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.479> hot<00:01:58.660> side<00:01:58.900> first

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.969 

that<00:02:04.510> gunky<00:02:04.840> seen<00:02:04.990> is<00:02:05.140> actually<00:02:05.440> the<00:02:05.500> sediment

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
that gunky seen is actually the sediment

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.740 
that gunky seen is actually the sediment
to<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:06.070> bottom<00:02:06.400> of<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.550> water<00:02:06.760> here<00:02:06.970> comes

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
to the bottom of the water here comes

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:08.520 
to the bottom of the water here comes
right<00:02:07.869> up<00:02:07.990> to<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.170> Fox

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
right up to the Fox

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.300 
right up to the Fox
I<00:02:08.770> put<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.459> dishwasher<00:02:09.880> on<00:02:10.000> top<00:02:11.040> the<00:02:12.040> reason<00:02:12.250> I

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
I put the dishwasher on top the reason I

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.920 
I put the dishwasher on top the reason I
have<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:12.520> do<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:12.700> is<00:02:13.030> if<00:02:13.180> there's<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.780> hot

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
have you do that is if there's a hot

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.030 
have you do that is if there's a hot
water<00:02:14.080> line<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:14.350> runs<00:02:14.440> between<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.800> kitchen

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
water line that runs between the kitchen

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.650 
water line that runs between the kitchen
sink<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.790> dishwasher<00:02:15.820> and<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:16.540> can

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
sink and the dishwasher and that can

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.570 
sink and the dishwasher and that can
often<00:02:16.810> free<00:02:17.230> so<00:02:17.470> with<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.680> air<00:02:17.830> line<00:02:18.100> still

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
often free so with the air line still

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.310 
often free so with the air line still
charged<00:02:18.940> with<00:02:19.150> air<00:02:19.330> we're<00:02:19.870> going<00:02:19.990> to<00:02:20.080> run<00:02:20.230> the

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
charged with air we're going to run the

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.130 
charged with air we're going to run the
dishwasher<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:20.950> blow<00:02:21.130> that<00:02:21.280> line<00:02:21.490> up<00:02:22.140> the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
dishwasher to blow that line up the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.380 
dishwasher to blow that line up the
washing<00:02:23.410> machines<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:23.770> other<00:02:23.890> appliances

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
washing machines and other appliances

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.490 
washing machines and other appliances
you<00:02:25.390> could<00:02:25.510> just<00:02:25.660> run<00:02:25.840> that<00:02:26.020> both<00:02:26.200> hot<00:02:26.470> and

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
you could just run that both hot and

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.320 
you could just run that both hot and
cold<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:27.370> air<00:02:27.550> pressure<00:02:27.820> would<00:02:28.090> push<00:02:28.300> that

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
cold the air pressure would push that

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.150 
cold the air pressure would push that
water<00:02:28.900> right<00:02:29.170> out<00:02:29.230> we<00:02:29.830> don't<00:02:29.980> want<00:02:30.100> that

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
water right out we don't want that

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.040 
water right out we don't want that
defense

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.390 

now<00:02:37.050> we<00:02:37.110> just<00:02:37.260> open<00:02:37.710> that<00:02:37.740> shutoff<00:02:38.160> valve

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
now we just open that shutoff valve

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.040 
now we just open that shutoff valve
briefly<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.970> get<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.210> last<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.630> water<00:02:39.840> out<00:02:40.020> of

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
briefly to get the last the water out of

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.780 
briefly to get the last the water out of
that<00:02:40.230> line<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.770> toilet<00:02:43.550> all<00:02:44.550> right<00:02:44.700> we

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
that line to the toilet all right we

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.430 
that line to the toilet all right we
blown<00:02:45.030> out<00:02:45.180> all<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.600> water<00:02:45.780> from<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.170> hot<00:02:46.290> and

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
blown out all the water from the hot and

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.840 
blown out all the water from the hot and
cold<00:02:46.500> piping<00:02:47.010> but<00:02:47.100> there's<00:02:47.310> still<00:02:47.430> water<00:02:47.700> that

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
cold piping but there's still water that

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.490 
cold piping but there's still water that
sits<00:02:47.970> at<00:02:48.150> every<00:02:48.420> single<00:02:48.600> trap<00:02:48.960> inside<00:02:49.320> this

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
sits at every single trap inside this

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.260 
sits at every single trap inside this
building<00:02:49.710> and<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.040> could<00:02:50.220> freeze<00:02:50.550> but<00:02:51.210> we

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
building and that could freeze but we

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.640 
building and that could freeze but we
still<00:02:51.480> want<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.750> have<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:51.900> seal<00:02:52.230> so<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.470> sewer

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
still want to have a seal so the sewer

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.230 
still want to have a seal so the sewer
gas<00:02:52.890> doesn't<00:02:53.130> come<00:02:53.310> up<00:02:53.430> so<00:02:53.970> what<00:02:54.060> we're<00:02:54.150> going

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
gas doesn't come up so what we're going

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.060 
gas doesn't come up so what we're going
to<00:02:54.300> do<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.600> to<00:02:54.720> add<00:02:54.840> some<00:02:54.870> propylene<00:02:55.590> glycol

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
to do is to add some propylene glycol

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.280 
to do is to add some propylene glycol
that's<00:02:56.520> a<00:02:56.670> non-toxic<00:02:57.210> antifreeze<00:02:57.900> not<00:02:58.140> the

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
that's a non-toxic antifreeze not the

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.600 
that's a non-toxic antifreeze not the
ethylene<00:02:58.680> glycol<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.160> might<00:02:59.280> use<00:02:59.430> in<00:02:59.550> your

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
ethylene glycol you might use in your

the<00:03:29.340> compressor<00:03:29.640> was<00:03:29.880> on<00:03:30.030> we<00:03:30.150> sent<00:03:30.360> air<00:03:30.570> right

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
the compressor was on we sent air right

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.150 
the compressor was on we sent air right
through<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.230> coil<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.680> that's<00:03:31.800> when<00:03:31.980> we<00:03:32.070> got

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
through the coil and that's when we got

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.740 
through the coil and that's when we got
all<00:03:32.400> that<00:03:32.580> sludge<00:03:32.940> upstairs<00:03:33.360> at<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.570> kitchen

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
all that sludge upstairs at the kitchen

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.990 
all that sludge upstairs at the kitchen
so<00:03:34.350> we<00:03:34.440> know<00:03:34.560> there's<00:03:34.770> no<00:03:34.920> more<00:03:35.160> water<00:03:35.550> in<00:03:35.880> that

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
so we know there's no more water in that

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.760 
so we know there's no more water in that
coil<00:03:36.270> but<00:03:36.810> there's<00:03:37.020> plenty<00:03:37.260> of<00:03:37.320> water<00:03:37.530> in<00:03:37.680> the

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
coil but there's plenty of water in the

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.040 
coil but there's plenty of water in the
boiler<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.400> in<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:38.940> hot<00:03:39.090> water<00:03:39.210> piping<00:03:39.720> do<00:03:39.930> we

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
boiler and in the hot water piping do we

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.990 
boiler and in the hot water piping do we
blow<00:03:40.320> all<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.710> water<00:03:41.340> out<00:03:41.550> of<00:03:41.580> that<00:03:41.790> system

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
blow all the water out of that system

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.420 
blow all the water out of that system
well<00:03:42.570> no<00:03:42.810> what<00:03:42.990> I<00:03:43.020> did<00:03:43.350> was<00:03:43.740> I<00:03:43.830> took<00:03:43.860> some<00:03:44.100> of

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
well no what I did was I took some of

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.560 
well no what I did was I took some of
the<00:03:44.490> water<00:03:44.670> out<00:03:44.820> of<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.030> heating<00:03:45.270> system

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
the water out of the heating system

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.450 
the water out of the heating system
through<00:03:45.750> this<00:03:45.900> hose<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:46.500> put<00:03:47.100> it<00:03:47.190> into<00:03:47.430> a

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
through this hose and put it into a

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.850 
through this hose and put it into a
bucket<00:03:47.700> from<00:03:48.600> another<00:03:49.020> bucket

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
bucket from another bucket

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.560 
bucket from another bucket
I<00:03:49.890> put<00:03:50.220> antifreeze<00:03:50.550> that<00:03:50.910> same<00:03:51.120> propylene

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
I put antifreeze that same propylene

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.390 
I put antifreeze that same propylene
glycol<00:03:51.930> we<00:03:52.080> use<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.380> non<00:03:52.530> toxic<00:03:52.980> stuff<00:03:53.190> and

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
glycol we use the non toxic stuff and

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.310 
glycol we use the non toxic stuff and
pumped<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:54.060> back<00:03:54.330> into<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.750> heating<00:03:55.020> system

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
pumped it back into the heating system

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.710 
pumped it back into the heating system
so<00:03:55.440> these<00:03:55.590> pipes<00:03:55.890> won't<00:03:56.160> freeze<00:03:56.490> you<00:03:57.300> can<00:03:57.600> go

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
so these pipes won't freeze you can go

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.850 
so these pipes won't freeze you can go
to<00:03:57.780> Florida<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.350> don't<00:03:58.530> work

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
to Florida and don't work

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.920 
to Florida and don't work
you
