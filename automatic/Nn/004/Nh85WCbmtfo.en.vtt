00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello together because the film factory heard 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.460
 I have you again a blockbuster 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.679
 brought the great gatsby and that 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.900
 the new movie of bass lerman main role 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.420
 So the money is playing Leonardo dicaprio 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.550
 but the narrative perspective is nick 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.460
 carraway played by tobey maguire and 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.869
 he met in gatsby as neighbors 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.449
 gatsby just has so much 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.519
 apply estate giant throws as the 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.710
 a party nara other the complete 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.240
 city ​​is always then all the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.349
 have something to say or even 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.920
 not and have money 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.380
 who is just like the efd in progress 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.690
 of the film also clear why he with daisy 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.129
 Together was played by Carey 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.719
 mulligan and again with her 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.390
 together that comes as a question 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.920
 the film explains it's about power 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.899
 it is all about a lot of money 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.550
 and one or the other 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.170
 Shine must be kept like that 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.149
 you can see that here 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.320
 I say that everything will be exactly like that 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.960
 as it was before just for you and me 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.760
 no big fire would have that 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.619
 fairy tale that he wore in his heart 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.619
 can affect something 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.900
 and that really springs from everything 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.900
 your imagination 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.380
 but I had the bad feeling that he 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.380
 something hid 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:37.340
 I wish I did not want to go 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.340
 to carry home 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.090
 then stay 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.580
 I also start at the big gatsby 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.020
 of course with things that are so obvious 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.570
 are better you have done great 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.360
 And that's how it looks on all corners 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.409
 is just gorgeous splendid it 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.119
 is already on some places 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.750
 a little too much that looks fantastic 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.759
 out 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.860
 this is simply an outfit 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.170
 you rarely see the movie like that 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.550
 it was like just to have said 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.259
 some places exaggerated I see 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.970
 these are also part of these party themes 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.670
 just too long i just got it now 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.739
 After 20 minutes, it is completely enough for me 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.000
 Now know what the thing is there you are 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.830
 yes I'm always more of a friend of it 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.019
 to say okay, that reduces you 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.970
 bit essential and leave that 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.650
 do not degenerate but that's better 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.390
 we do not even know that 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.950
 not so bad actually much 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.300
 it is sadder that the film one 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.190
 leaves relatively cold 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.959
 now is already a fate is yes 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.640
 Even a book template has been synonymous 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.130
 a film to a better man has just 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.360
 the 2013er version made and the 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.549
 destinies of the individual characters 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.470
 somehow do not hit me and me 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.510
 I am already someone who is emotional 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.190
 like to go in for a movie but the 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.690
 could be really quite cold though 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.970
 there are other good things this 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.980
 films the music the soundtrack is 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.720
 Really great things are really sensational 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.760
 by jaycee 2 wx xml is andrea doria 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.390
 and and and it's worth it to everyone 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.370
 case 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.140
 But that's the soundtrack now 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.930
 at some places in the film radio destination that 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.030
 not for me I already understand that 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.799
 barcelonas consciously use 20s 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.739
 years everything very old and now modern 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.720
 beats this works when it does 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.239
 So it would be laid in the 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.070
 spectator understands okay that's about to happen 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.630
 played from behind that should the film 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.820
 supported because that works because it 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.640
 a new dynamic arises when I do 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.500
 at the party at gatsby itself 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.000
 I have moments where you can feel it 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.950
 Especially because his scene is not directly in the 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.690
 Partyraum plays and I have the 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.700
 impression take delicious david guetta 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.769
 here has the autoscooter offer 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.090
 unpacked those are the points then 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.980
 does that work because we are at all 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.750
 not with this contrast that works 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.440
 somehow not at all 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.480
 Actually it is actually so far 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.209
 All right, dicaprio plays it for me 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.180
 Huge on the spot so he's already like that 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.370
 this rather nasty greasy 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.060
 drove where noted and there is 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.280
 something behind it 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.920
 I generally like carey mulligan very much 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.319
 like to stay here a bit pale and 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.720
 under-challenged tobey maguire also tries 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.069
 I personally see his best though 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.080
 just do not like it for me 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.010
 just the eternal sissy there he can 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.080
 do whatever he wants 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.250
 but george patton is really pretty 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.900
 good as a husband of daisy and that is 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.040
 So there are many heights there are many 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.590
 deep in this movie 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.239
 that's why it's all about me 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.549
 average for it bombastic 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.250
 looking cinema keepers who are 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.139
 now in the cinema are on everyone 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.000
 Fall fans of better than so often 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.160
 brings the now synonymous no movie out 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.540
 that's why in any case in the cinema with it 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.490
 even if the actor likes it 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.290
 or simply be showered in the cinema 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.870
 would like to have good pictures that tells me 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.010
 the story is actually relatively unimportant 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.290
 Who should not watch this movie? 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.280
 I also look at those who say that 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.320
 definitely need a little more 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.880
 substance when it comes to emotional matters 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.680
 I want to be packed, I think 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.930
 I am not to you and the others 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.210
 say boycott 3d movies that 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.070
 just not in 3d are these too 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.900
 people from this movie just outside 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.120
 stay my personal rating for 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.250
 gaps are six out of ten points it has 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.270
 just hinted at 3d is 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.100
 I do not drive at all 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.110
 sometimes the glasses can be omitted 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.430
 that it was not a criterion for one 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.229
 good or bad movie because of that 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.010
 look at him if in 2d if that 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.990
 is possible 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.570
 he has many heights and many deep ones 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.280
 looks great great music touches me 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.250
 But not all in all is just for the 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.940
 designed canvas and therefore 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.160
 above average six out of ten 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.300
 I'm a bit disappointed 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.110
 but expects a bit more 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.310
 Overall, just an ok result 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.229
 give you the review on the great gatsby 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.150
 fell and said hey i think it's alright 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:29.490
 that with the big production 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.110
 do not always think everything is good then go 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.099
 is a thumbs up otherwise the 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.510
 thumb down 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.740
 here you have the possibility to you 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.690
 to watch another video 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.490
 Optionally comes to facebook and twitter 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.500
 stay there always up to date 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.599
 what the film factory but also mine 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.890
 do not pay or subscribe to the 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:44.580
 channel so that we here soon 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.560
 meet again in 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.960
 new movie review or trailer 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.590
 here in the film factory with me the 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.590
