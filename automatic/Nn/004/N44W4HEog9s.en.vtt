this thing right up and bury it deep
under<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.340> ground<00:03:23.580> all<00:03:24.180> I'm<00:03:24.420> trying<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.810> do<00:03:24.960> is

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
under the ground all I'm trying to do is

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.380 
under the ground all I'm trying to do is
get<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.620> root<00:03:25.830> underneath<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.580> I<00:03:27.000> want<00:03:27.210> I

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
get the root underneath and I want I

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.880 
get the root underneath and I want I
don't<00:03:27.570> care<00:03:27.750> if<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.930> seeds<00:03:28.170> exposed<00:03:28.590> or<00:03:28.740> not<00:03:28.770> I

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
don't care if the seeds exposed or not I

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.290 
don't care if the seeds exposed or not I
kind<00:03:29.250> of<00:03:29.310> liked<00:03:29.460> it<00:03:29.610> better<00:03:29.760> when<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.090> seeds

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
kind of liked it better when the seeds

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.600 
kind of liked it better when the seeds
exposed<00:03:30.750> because<00:03:31.440> that<00:03:31.770> way<00:03:31.950> there<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.490> know

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
exposed because that way there I know

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.890 
exposed because that way there I know
it's<00:03:32.880> going<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.060> dry<00:03:33.300> out<00:03:33.330> with<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:33.690> light

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
it's going to dry out with the light

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.770 
it's going to dry out with the light
that's<00:03:34.080> on<00:03:34.230> it<00:03:34.440> but<00:03:34.860> also<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:35.220> can<00:03:35.520> see<00:03:35.790> that

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
that's on it but also I can see that

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.050 
that's on it but also I can see that
it's<00:03:36.930> it's<00:03:37.230> moving<00:03:37.500> you<00:03:37.830> know<00:03:37.980> here's<00:03:38.760> another

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
it's it's moving you know here's another

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.560 
it's it's moving you know here's another
one

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
one

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.930 
one
it's<00:03:40.410> got<00:03:40.560> a<00:03:40.590> halfway-decent<00:03:41.010> root<00:03:41.580> sticking

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
it's got a halfway-decent root sticking

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.590 
it's got a halfway-decent root sticking
out<00:03:42.060> over<00:03:42.240> there<00:03:42.620> they'll<00:03:43.620> take<00:03:43.800> down<00:03:43.830> them

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
out over there they'll take down them

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.750 
out over there they'll take down them
put<00:03:45.600> her<00:03:45.660> in<00:03:45.780> this<00:03:46.100> another<00:03:47.100> thing<00:03:47.370> too<00:03:47.580> is

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
put her in this another thing too is

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.570 
put her in this another thing too is
whatever<00:03:48.060> it's<00:03:48.420> possible<00:03:48.990> I<00:03:49.170> like<00:03:49.980> to<00:03:50.130> use<00:03:50.340> the

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
whatever it's possible I like to use the

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.060 
whatever it's possible I like to use the
see-through<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:52.110> see-through<00:03:52.530> containers

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
see-through the see-through containers

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.400 
see-through the see-through containers
because<00:03:54.060> then<00:03:54.390> when<00:03:54.570> it<00:03:54.660> does<00:03:54.810> really<00:03:55.110> start

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
because then when it does really start

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.110 
because then when it does really start
to<00:03:55.590> root<00:03:55.800> you'll<00:03:56.100> be<00:03:56.220> able<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.520> actually<00:03:56.640> see

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
to root you'll be able to actually see

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.760 
to root you'll be able to actually see
the<00:03:57.300> roots<00:03:57.540> growing<00:03:57.840> down<00:03:57.990> in<00:03:58.380> through<00:03:58.590> here

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
the roots growing down in through here

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.920 
the roots growing down in through here
you<00:03:58.980> know<00:03:59.160> it's<00:03:59.880> time<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.330> transplant<00:04:00.660> that

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
you know it's time to transplant that

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.510 
you know it's time to transplant that
because<00:04:01.380> with<00:04:01.530> some<00:04:01.709> of<00:04:01.830> these<00:04:01.950> plants<00:04:02.310> that

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
because with some of these plants that

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.480 
because with some of these plants that
I've<00:04:02.700> been<00:04:02.850> doing<00:04:03.260> you<00:04:04.260> know<00:04:04.380> they<00:04:05.070> look<00:04:05.310> like

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
I've been doing you know they look like

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.550 
I've been doing you know they look like
they're<00:04:05.730> ready<00:04:05.940> to<00:04:06.030> go<00:04:06.300> nice<00:04:06.660> big<00:04:06.930> plants<00:04:07.410> and

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
they're ready to go nice big plants and

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.170 
they're ready to go nice big plants and
then<00:04:07.650> you<00:04:07.920> actually<00:04:08.280> go<00:04:08.430> to<00:04:08.459> transplant<00:04:09.090> them

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
then you actually go to transplant them

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.800 
then you actually go to transplant them
and<00:04:09.410> not<00:04:10.410> so<00:04:10.590> much<00:04:11.060> so<00:04:12.060> anyways<00:04:12.360> that's<00:04:12.600> the

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
and not so much so anyways that's the

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.330 
and not so much so anyways that's the
basis<00:04:13.200> of<00:04:13.320> it<00:04:13.470> right<00:04:13.650> there<00:04:13.860> I'm<00:04:14.070> just<00:04:14.160> going

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
basis of it right there I'm just going

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.430 
basis of it right there I'm just going
to<00:04:14.370> give<00:04:14.550> you<00:04:14.640> a<00:04:14.700> quick<00:04:14.970> move<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.990> next<00:04:16.170> step

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
to give you a quick move the next step

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.310 
to give you a quick move the next step
type<00:04:16.680> of<00:04:16.830> deal<00:04:16.950> here<00:04:17.900> so<00:04:18.900> we've<00:04:19.049> got<00:04:19.200> our

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
type of deal here so we've got our

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.349 
type of deal here so we've got our
plants<00:04:19.680> planted<00:04:20.070> or<00:04:20.370> our<00:04:20.549> seeds<00:04:20.850> planted<00:04:21.239> in

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
plants planted or our seeds planted in

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.180 
plants planted or our seeds planted in
our<00:04:21.479> cups<00:04:21.690> and<00:04:21.960> what's<00:04:22.530> going<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:22.740> happen<00:04:23.100> is

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
our cups and what's going to happen is

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.430 
our cups and what's going to happen is
you

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
you

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.320 
you
put<00:04:23.620> that<00:04:23.710> under<00:04:24.010> a<00:04:24.040> light<00:04:24.280> I<00:04:24.550> like<00:04:25.060> to<00:04:25.180> use

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
put that under a light I like to use

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.000 
put that under a light I like to use
heat<00:04:25.570> pads<00:04:25.840> for<00:04:26.050> everything<00:04:26.560> because<00:04:26.770> again

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
heat pads for everything because again

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.200 
heat pads for everything because again
it's<00:04:27.190> eastern<00:04:27.490> Canada

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
it's eastern Canada

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.540 
it's eastern Canada
I<00:04:28.240> think<00:04:28.810> it's<00:04:28.900> minus<00:04:29.380> 17<00:04:29.980> degrees<00:04:30.340> or

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
I think it's minus 17 degrees or

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.100 
I think it's minus 17 degrees or
something<00:04:30.670> stupid<00:04:31.180> like<00:04:31.210> that<00:04:31.480> outside<00:04:31.660> right

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
something stupid like that outside right

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.500 
something stupid like that outside right
now<00:04:32.290> but<00:04:33.220> you<00:04:33.340> put<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:33.610> heat<00:04:33.760> pad<00:04:33.940> under<00:04:34.270> and

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
now but you put the heat pad under and

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.600 
now but you put the heat pad under and
keep<00:04:34.660> it<00:04:34.810> watered<00:04:35.170> this<00:04:35.950> is<00:04:36.100> going<00:04:36.280> to<00:04:36.340> be<00:04:36.460> your

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
keep it watered this is going to be your

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.580 
keep it watered this is going to be your
next<00:04:36.820> step<00:04:37.050> so<00:04:38.050> you're<00:04:38.170> going<00:04:38.290> to<00:04:38.320> get<00:04:38.470> this

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
next step so you're going to get this

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.020 
next step so you're going to get this
nice<00:04:38.860> little<00:04:38.890> baby<00:04:39.340> plant<00:04:39.670> it's<00:04:39.820> going<00:04:39.970> to

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
nice little baby plant it's going to

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.120 
nice little baby plant it's going to
shoot<00:04:40.210> up<00:04:40.420> you<00:04:41.080> know<00:04:41.200> nice<00:04:41.500> green<00:04:41.860> little

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
shoot up you know nice green little

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.850 
shoot up you know nice green little
leaves<00:04:42.400> on<00:04:42.670> there<00:04:42.940> looks<00:04:43.480> really<00:04:43.780> good<00:04:43.960> and

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
leaves on there looks really good and

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.340 
leaves on there looks really good and
then<00:04:45.100> when<00:04:45.220> we<00:04:45.310> go<00:04:45.430> from<00:04:45.610> this<00:04:45.790> step<00:04:46.350> we're

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
then when we go from this step we're

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.010
