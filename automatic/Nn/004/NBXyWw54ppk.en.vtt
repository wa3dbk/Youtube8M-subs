00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.173
 Welcome to the "World of Warcraft" professional crash course: disciplinary riding 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.813
 In the film, we will be in a simple and clear way 

00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:11.470
 Tell you how to get started with the disciplinary ride that has just risen to level 90. 

00:00:11.992 --> 00:00:14.899
 The main resource of disciplinary riding is the holy energy. 

00:00:14.934 --> 00:00:19.658
 Your time will almost always be spent using a variety of attacks to accumulate holy energy. 

00:00:19.693 --> 00:00:22.678
 Then used on a few powerful skills 

00:00:22.713 --> 00:00:26.154
 Like other paladins, disciplinary riding also has mana 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.061
 But in most cases, you donâ€™t need to pay attention to it. 

00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:31.070
 Just focus on the holy energy. 

00:00:31.705 --> 00:00:34.661
 Before entering the battle, you must first cast a blessing of power. 

00:00:34.696 --> 00:00:36.838
 It will greatly enhance your proficiency 

00:00:36.873 --> 00:00:39.574
 And improve the damage you can do. 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:42.244
 You should also start the Seal of Truth 

00:00:42.377 --> 00:00:45.051
 Make more damage to your melee attacks 

00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:48.881
 After entering the battle, you should use the Crusader Holy Strike as much as possible. 

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:51.211
 Then experiment and exorcism 

00:00:51.246 --> 00:00:54.177
 These skills produce a holy energy when they hit the target. 

00:00:54.212 --> 00:00:56.383
 As soon as the cooling time is over, use it right away. 

00:00:56.418 --> 00:00:59.677
 Sometimes your automatic attack will trigger the art of war 

00:00:59.712 --> 00:01:02.280
 This will reset the cooldown of the Exorcism 

00:01:02.315 --> 00:01:07.298
 When the target health is below 20%, you can use the Hammer of Wrath 

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.914
 Can cause a lot of damage and produce a holy energy 

00:01:10.949 --> 00:01:14.431
 When you accumulate three holy abilities, you can use them to apply skills. 

00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:16.709
 Your preferred skill is heresy 

00:01:16.744 --> 00:01:19.306
 It can greatly increase the damage and last for a while 

00:01:19.341 --> 00:01:21.787
 So try to keep this gain effect as much as possible. 

00:01:21.822 --> 00:01:25.134
 If the heresy interrogation has been initiated, the next words 

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:27.221
 Use the sacred power on the temptation of the Templars 

00:01:27.256 --> 00:01:29.971
 This is a powerful melee attack that can cause high damage. 

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:33.696
 If you want to master the paladin's gameplay, there are still many places to explore. 

00:01:33.731 --> 00:01:38.160
 I hope this introduction can give you basic ideas and the right direction. 

00:01:38.195 --> 00:01:41.981
 As long as you master the basic concepts, take a moment to study 

00:01:42.016 --> 00:01:45.171
 Spellbook, talent and glyph 

00:01:45.206 --> 00:01:48.279
 Exploring spells not mentioned here will help a lot. 

00:01:48.314 --> 00:01:51.257
 Thank you for watching, we see you in Azeroth!
