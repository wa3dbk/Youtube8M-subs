00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
didn't really want him because of one

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.990 
didn't really want him because of one
thing<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.770> member<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.159> show<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.759> some

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
thing I member in the show this some

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.899 
thing I member in the show this some
cannon<00:01:45.990> would<00:01:46.170> tilt<00:01:46.380> down<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.729> thought

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
cannon would tilt down and I thought

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.969 
cannon would tilt down and I thought
that<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.390> would<00:01:48.479> just<00:01:48.990> be<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> big<00:01:49.409> salt<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
that it would just be a big salt to the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.670 
that it would just be a big salt to the
plastic<00:01:50.430> right<00:01:50.520> here<00:01:50.790> well<00:01:51.570> what<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.869> noticed

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
plastic right here well what I noticed

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.620 
plastic right here well what I noticed
after<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.250> few<00:01:53.790> minutes<00:01:53.909> after<00:01:54.240> playing<00:01:54.540> with

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
after a few minutes after playing with

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.719 
after a few minutes after playing with
it<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.380> there's<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.710> hinge<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.280> allows<00:01:56.340> you

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
it that there's a hinge that allows you

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.459 
it that there's a hinge that allows you
to<00:01:56.759> bring<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.390> down<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.930> was<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.259> show

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
to bring it down like it was in the show

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.109 
to bring it down like it was in the show
and<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.369> thought<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.640> was<00:02:00.119> pretty<00:02:00.360> awesome<00:02:00.540> um

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.289 
and I thought that was pretty awesome um
for<00:02:03.119> some<00:02:03.270> reason<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.630> crashers<00:02:04.140> they<00:02:04.770> can<00:02:04.950> on

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
for some reason the crashers they can on

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.300 
for some reason the crashers they can on
they're<00:02:06.299> able<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.570> move<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.680> goat<00:02:07.979> become

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
they're able to move so that goat become

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.570 
they're able to move so that goat become
