so that I can chrono this warp gate as

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.380 
so that I can chrono this warp gate as
soon<00:03:49.280> as<00:03:49.370> it's<00:03:49.519> done<00:03:52.030> okay<00:03:53.030> so<00:03:53.090> we're<00:03:53.299> gonna

and he's the boy keep this going um

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.960 
and he's the boy keep this going um
we're<00:04:06.380> gonna<00:04:06.470> get<00:04:06.650> this<00:04:06.830> warp<00:04:07.520> prism<00:04:07.850> we're

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
we're gonna get this warp prism we're

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.120 
we're gonna get this warp prism we're
gonna<00:04:08.090> chrono<00:04:08.390> boost<00:04:08.630> that<00:04:08.810> out<00:04:09.020> once<00:04:09.830> we<00:04:10.040> get

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
gonna chrono boost that out once we get

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.440 
gonna chrono boost that out once we get
200<00:04:10.640> gas<00:04:10.820> in<00:04:11.090> total<00:04:11.510> we're<00:04:11.720> gonna<00:04:11.810> pull<00:04:12.170> all<00:04:12.380> of

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
200 gas in total we're gonna pull all of

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.860 
200 gas in total we're gonna pull all of
workers<00:04:14.450> from<00:04:14.630> gas<00:04:16.060> I'm<00:04:17.060> just<00:04:17.239> gonna<00:04:17.330> cue<00:04:17.690> you

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
workers from gas I'm just gonna cue you

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.449 
workers from gas I'm just gonna cue you
up<00:04:18.080> just<00:04:18.320> so<00:04:18.380> we<00:04:18.410> know<00:04:18.500> how<00:04:18.680> much<00:04:18.799> gas<00:04:19.070> we<00:04:19.310> have

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
up just so we know how much gas we have

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:31.090 
up just so we know how much gas we have
here<00:04:22.960> alright<00:04:23.960> it's<00:04:24.140> really<00:04:24.380> take<00:04:24.560> you<00:04:24.740> off<00:04:30.100> go

working<00:05:19.749> on<00:05:19.869> this<00:05:20.079> build<00:05:23.369> okay<00:05:24.369> take<00:05:24.939> it

00:05:24.989 --> 00:05:24.999 
working on this build okay take it

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:46.330 
working on this build okay take it
really<00:05:28.769> this<00:05:29.769> is<00:05:29.979> just<00:05:30.009> a<00:05:30.369> force<00:05:30.869> links

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.580 

wall<00:05:46.610> this<00:05:46.880> off

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:06:06.909 

we

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:09.080 

we're<00:06:07.919> just<00:06:07.979> gonna<00:06:08.100> go<00:06:08.220> right<00:06:08.490> to<00:06:08.610> the<00:06:08.699> natural

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
we're just gonna go right to the natural

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.900 
we're just gonna go right to the natural
right<00:06:09.270> now<00:06:09.380> timings<00:06:10.380> not<00:06:10.530> bad<00:06:10.770> only<00:06:11.400> off<00:06:11.669> by

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
right now timings not bad only off by

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:17.360 
right now timings not bad only off by
about<00:06:12.120> 15<00:06:12.750> seconds<00:06:16.070> that<00:06:17.070> would<00:06:17.220> be

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
about 15 seconds that would be

00:06:17.370 --> 00:07:10.610 
about 15 seconds that would be
horrendous

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:10.620 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:16.909 

yes<00:07:12.479> whoo<00:07:14.340> successful<00:07:15.340> build<00:07:15.999> attempt<00:07:16.629> is

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:16.919 
yes whoo successful build attempt is

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:20.489 
yes whoo successful build attempt is
successful<00:07:18.059> so<00:07:19.059> it<00:07:19.419> wasn't<00:07:19.659> perfect<00:07:20.229> I

00:07:20.489 --> 00:07:20.499 
successful so it wasn't perfect I

00:07:20.499 --> 00:07:23.159 
successful so it wasn't perfect I
actually<00:07:20.889> got<00:07:21.219> my<00:07:21.339> mothership<00:07:21.849> core<00:07:22.120> about<00:07:22.990> to

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:23.169 
actually got my mothership core about to

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:26.670 
actually got my mothership core about to
supply<00:07:23.589> late<00:07:23.889> I<00:07:24.419> also<00:07:25.419> needed<00:07:25.839> a<00:07:25.990> third<00:07:26.020> zealot

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:26.680 
supply late I also needed a third zealot

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.339 
supply late I also needed a third zealot
in<00:07:26.830> that<00:07:27.069> warp<00:07:27.490> prism<00:07:27.900> the<00:07:28.900> reason<00:07:29.199> why<00:07:29.319> I

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:29.349 
in that warp prism the reason why I

00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:30.600 
in that warp prism the reason why I
didn't<00:07:29.589> get<00:07:29.710> it<00:07:29.800> is<00:07:29.919> so<00:07:30.069> that<00:07:30.219> it<00:07:30.339> didn't

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:30.610 
didn't get it is so that it didn't

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.079 
didn't get it is so that it didn't
prolong<00:07:30.969> my<00:07:30.999> second<00:07:31.719> immortal<00:07:32.400> I<00:07:33.400> pulled<00:07:33.879> I

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:34.089 
prolong my second immortal I pulled I

00:07:34.089 --> 00:07:35.700 
prolong my second immortal I pulled I
pulled<00:07:34.180> everything<00:07:34.749> off<00:07:35.020> gasps<00:07:35.319> it's<00:07:35.620> a

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:35.710 
pulled everything off gasps it's a

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:37.920 
pulled everything off gasps it's a
gasless<00:07:36.159> build<00:07:36.400> after<00:07:37.389> you<00:07:37.509> get<00:07:37.659> the<00:07:37.779> first

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:37.930 
gasless build after you get the first

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.839 
gasless build after you get the first
two<00:07:38.139> immortals<00:07:38.559> that<00:07:38.680> is<00:07:38.830> so<00:07:39.219> you<00:07:39.279> really<00:07:39.819> only

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:39.849 
two immortals that is so you really only

00:07:39.849 --> 00:07:43.140 
two immortals that is so you really only
need<00:07:40.199> 350<00:07:41.199> gasps<00:07:41.529> 50<00:07:42.189> for<00:07:42.460> the<00:07:42.759> warp<00:07:42.939> gate

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:43.150 
need 350 gasps 50 for the warp gate

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.570 
need 350 gasps 50 for the warp gate
research<00:07:43.479> will<00:07:43.810> actually<00:07:44.080> need<00:07:44.189> 450<00:07:45.189> for<00:07:45.490> the

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:45.580 
research will actually need 450 for the

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.159 
research will actually need 450 for the
warp<00:07:45.729> gate<00:07:45.939> research<00:07:46.300> 50<00:07:46.719> for<00:07:46.870> the<00:07:46.960> first

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:47.169 
warp gate research 50 for the first

00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:50.309 
warp gate research 50 for the first
stalker<00:07:47.409> mothership<00:07:48.279> core<00:07:48.990> and<00:07:49.990> then<00:07:50.139> two

00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:50.319 
stalker mothership core and then two

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:53.850 
stalker mothership core and then two
immortals<00:07:50.740> so<00:07:51.370> 400<00:07:51.999> gas<00:07:52.180> in<00:07:52.419> total<00:07:52.860> pretty

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:53.860 
immortals so 400 gas in total pretty

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.290 
immortals so 400 gas in total pretty
good<00:07:54.069> i'm<00:07:54.279> still<00:07:54.490> gonna<00:07:54.580> keep<00:07:54.849> working<00:07:54.879> on

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:55.300 
good i'm still gonna keep working on

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.469 
good i'm still gonna keep working on
this<00:07:55.449> build<00:07:55.719> and<00:07:56.020> as<00:07:56.499> it<00:07:56.620> gets<00:07:56.770> better<00:07:57.479> i'll

00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:58.479 
this build and as it gets better i'll

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:04.259 
this build and as it gets better i'll
show<00:07:58.659> it<00:07:58.689> off<00:07:58.930> a<00:07:59.199> little<00:07:59.289> bit<00:07:59.529> more<00:08:01.259> peace
