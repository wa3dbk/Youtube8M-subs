Hi, everybody!
My name is Sergey Polyansky,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I play in the band «5diez»,
today I’ll tell you

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
about Yamaha RGX-220DZ guitar.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The body of this guitar
is made of alder,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
the neck is made of maple
and the fretboard is of rosewood.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.500
There are 24 frets.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This guitar has two humbuckers,
volume and tone knobs installed.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
There is a Floyd Rose type
tremolo here.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Let’s try each pickup
with a clean sound.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Now, let’s play it
