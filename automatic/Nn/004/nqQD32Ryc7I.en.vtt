all right I my friends to talk about
Salvage<00:02:07.460> which<00:02:07.700> of<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.150> three<00:02:08.420> brand<00:02:08.720> new

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
Salvage which of the three brand new

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.050 
Salvage which of the three brand new
maps<00:02:09.050> is<00:02:09.229> definitely<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.070> smallest<00:02:10.280> it<00:02:10.790> takes

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
maps is definitely the smallest it takes

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.780 
maps is definitely the smallest it takes
place<00:02:11.240> in<00:02:11.360> a<00:02:11.660> snow-covered<00:02:12.230> junkyard<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.640> one

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
place in a snow-covered junkyard the one

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.340 
place in a snow-covered junkyard the one
thing<00:02:13.970> when<00:02:14.180> I<00:02:14.210> first<00:02:14.450> jumped<00:02:14.810> into<00:02:14.930> this<00:02:15.110> map

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
thing when I first jumped into this map

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.620 
thing when I first jumped into this map
what<00:02:15.800> I<00:02:15.830> was<00:02:16.100> really<00:02:16.130> blown<00:02:16.460> away<00:02:16.550> by<00:02:16.790> was<00:02:17.300> was

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
what I was really blown away by was was

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.390 
what I was really blown away by was was
the<00:02:17.780> atmosphere<00:02:17.900> just<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.740> grit<00:02:19.070> and<00:02:19.250> the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
the atmosphere just the grit and the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.720 
the atmosphere just the grit and the
grime<00:02:19.960> really<00:02:20.960> kind<00:02:21.170> of<00:02:21.260> you<00:02:21.500> know<00:02:21.730> solidified

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
grime really kind of you know solidified

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.890 
grime really kind of you know solidified
everything<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.270> second<00:02:23.660> that<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:23.780> actually

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
everything the second that I actually

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.350 
everything the second that I actually
saw<00:02:24.380> you<00:02:24.740> know<00:02:24.830> myself<00:02:24.980> on<00:02:25.460> this<00:02:25.640> map<00:02:25.850> actually

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
saw you know myself on this map actually

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.970 
saw you know myself on this map actually
started<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.930> get<00:02:27.050> chilly<00:02:27.350> looking<00:02:27.710> at<00:02:27.860> him

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
started to get chilly looking at him

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.100 
started to get chilly looking at him
well<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:28.970> other<00:02:29.060> thing<00:02:29.210> that<00:02:29.330> I<00:02:29.450> mean<00:02:29.780> aside

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
well the other thing that I mean aside

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.750 
well the other thing that I mean aside
from<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.380> atmosphere<00:02:30.800> that<00:02:30.860> kind<00:02:31.040> of<00:02:31.070> pops<00:02:31.550> up

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
from the atmosphere that kind of pops up

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.510 
from the atmosphere that kind of pops up
for<00:02:31.940> me<00:02:32.060> is<00:02:32.420> look<00:02:32.990> up<00:02:33.140> there's<00:02:33.830> no<00:02:34.010> place<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.490> go

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
for me is look up there's no place to go

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.570 
for me is look up there's no place to go
this<00:02:34.910> is<00:02:35.090> all<00:02:35.330> on<00:02:35.720> one<00:02:36.050> level<00:02:36.350> this<00:02:36.980> is<00:02:37.190> this<00:02:37.370> is

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
this is all on one level this is this is

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.760 
this is all on one level this is this is
to<00:02:37.790> me<00:02:37.880> its<00:02:38.120> simplicity<00:02:38.360> it<00:02:38.900> above<00:02:39.140> itself<00:02:39.530> and

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
to me its simplicity it above itself and

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.280 
to me its simplicity it above itself and
not<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:40.610> bad<00:02:40.880> way<00:02:41.090> I<00:02:41.270> mean<00:02:41.450> either<00:02:41.930> thing<00:02:42.200> the

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
not a bad way I mean either thing the

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.250 
not a bad way I mean either thing the
high<00:02:42.440> notice<00:02:42.830> is<00:02:43.040> that<00:02:43.640> all<00:02:44.360> these<00:02:44.630> little

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
high notice is that all these little

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.140 
high notice is that all these little
alleyways<00:02:45.740> all<00:02:45.980> these<00:02:46.160> roads<00:02:46.430> have<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.730> very

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
alleyways all these roads have a very

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.080 
alleyways all these roads have a very
very<00:02:47.720> narrow<00:02:48.050> focus<00:02:48.620> right<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:49.400> i<00:02:49.460> think<00:02:49.610> this

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
very narrow focus right and i think this

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.970 
very narrow focus right and i think this
for<00:02:50.510> modern<00:02:50.930> warfare<00:02:51.080> 2<00:02:51.440> it's<00:02:51.590> really<00:02:51.860> gonna

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
for modern warfare 2 it's really gonna

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.550 
for modern warfare 2 it's really gonna
boil<00:02:52.280> it<00:02:52.520> down<00:02:52.550> to<00:02:52.880> skill<00:02:53.390> versus<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:54.530> know

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
boil it down to skill versus you know

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.580 
boil it down to skill versus you know
map<00:02:54.890> complexity<00:02:55.670> um<00:02:56.150> oh<00:02:56.660> I<00:02:56.930> think<00:02:57.200> I<00:02:57.290> mean<00:02:57.470> to

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
map complexity um oh I think I mean to

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.020 
map complexity um oh I think I mean to
me<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.800> way<00:02:57.890> I<00:02:57.920> would<00:02:58.070> describe<00:02:58.190> this<00:02:58.580> map<00:02:58.790> in

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
me the way I would describe this map in

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.500 
me the way I would describe this map in
in<00:02:59.540> one<00:03:00.020> phrase<00:03:00.320> every<00:03:01.190> corner<00:03:01.970> is<00:03:02.180> going<00:03:02.420> to

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
in one phrase every corner is going to

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:10.240 
in one phrase every corner is going to
be<00:03:02.600> an<00:03:02.690> adventure

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.620 

as<00:03:11.250> soon<00:03:11.430> as<00:03:11.460> we<00:03:11.610> jump<00:03:11.820> on<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.120> storm<00:03:12.420> the

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
as soon as we jump on the storm the

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.180 
as soon as we jump on the storm the
first<00:03:12.840> thing<00:03:12.990> that<00:03:13.110> pops<00:03:13.320> out<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.560> me<00:03:13.770> again<00:03:14.040> is

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
first thing that pops out to me again is

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.010 
first thing that pops out to me again is
that<00:03:14.220> is<00:03:14.490> that<00:03:14.730> atmosphere<00:03:15.390> they<00:03:15.540> created<00:03:15.960> I

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
that is that atmosphere they created I

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.230 
that is that atmosphere they created I
think<00:03:16.200> they<00:03:16.260> captured<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:16.770> again<00:03:17.010> in<00:03:17.820> storm

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
think they captured it again in storm

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.880 
think they captured it again in storm
you<00:03:18.810> know<00:03:18.870> it's<00:03:18.990> interesting<00:03:19.080> too<00:03:19.530> is<00:03:19.560> I<00:03:19.710> think

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
you know it's interesting too is I think

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.050 
you know it's interesting too is I think
you<00:03:20.010> look<00:03:20.130> at<00:03:20.250> this<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.490> it<00:03:20.580> does<00:03:20.730> have<00:03:20.760> these

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
you look at this and it does have these

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.990 
you look at this and it does have these
really<00:03:21.210> long<00:03:21.450> sidelines<00:03:21.960> right<00:03:22.230> but<00:03:23.130> I<00:03:23.430> feel

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
really long sidelines right but I feel

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.030 
really long sidelines right but I feel
like<00:03:24.030> they've<00:03:24.480> done<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.750> good<00:03:25.080> job<00:03:25.140> of<00:03:25.530> allowing

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
like they've done a good job of allowing

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.210 
like they've done a good job of allowing
you<00:03:26.390> to<00:03:27.390> tactically<00:03:28.140> move<00:03:28.380> through<00:03:28.650> so<00:03:29.100> the

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
you to tactically move through so the

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.410 
you to tactically move through so the
snipers<00:03:29.580> are<00:03:29.700> really<00:03:29.850> gonna<00:03:29.940> be<00:03:30.060> picking<00:03:30.210> off

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420

going<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:39.480> get<00:03:39.570> tagged<00:03:39.870> at<00:03:40.080> a<00:03:40.110> really<00:03:40.290> long

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
going to get tagged at a really long

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.110 
going to get tagged at a really long
distance<00:03:40.920> I<00:03:41.130> think<00:03:41.550> it's<00:03:41.670> going<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:41.820> be<00:03:41.910> really

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
distance I think it's going to be really

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.730 
distance I think it's going to be really
easy<00:03:42.270> to<00:03:42.540> pick<00:03:42.720> up<00:03:42.840> on<00:03:42.990> some<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.350> landmarks

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
easy to pick up on some of the landmarks

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.100 
easy to pick up on some of the landmarks
some<00:03:44.370> of<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.490> key<00:03:44.670> elements<00:03:44.910> of<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.750> map<00:03:45.930> that

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
some of the key elements of the map that

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.810 
some of the key elements of the map that
they<00:03:46.230> wanted<00:03:46.530> you<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.800> kind<00:03:47.010> of<00:03:47.070> hone<00:03:47.280> in<00:03:47.460> on<00:03:47.610> or

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
they wanted you to kind of hone in on or

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.000 
they wanted you to kind of hone in on or
see<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.360> instantly<00:03:49.050> show<00:03:49.320> you<00:03:49.380> where<00:03:49.680> you<00:03:49.830> are

because<00:03:50.430> again<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:50.820> mean<00:03:51.030> as<00:03:51.360> far<00:03:51.600> as<00:03:51.810> the

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 
because again I mean as far as the

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.350 
because again I mean as far as the
layout<00:03:52.260> goes<00:03:52.500> it<00:03:52.710> is<00:03:52.740> a<00:03:52.830> fairly<00:03:53.160> big<00:03:53.400> map<00:03:53.700> there

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
layout goes it is a fairly big map there

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.570 
layout goes it is a fairly big map there
is<00:03:54.480> some<00:03:54.660> interior<00:03:54.990> but<00:03:55.770> mostly<00:03:56.070> out<00:03:56.280> teared

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
is some interior but mostly out teared

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.750 
is some interior but mostly out teared
up<00:03:56.850> out<00:03:57.060> here<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.450> don't<00:03:58.460> stick<00:03:59.460> with<00:03:59.610> that

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
up out here you don't stick with that

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.700 
up out here you don't stick with that
stick<00:03:59.970> with<00:04:00.120> them<00:04:00.240> out<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.630> mostly<00:04:00.960> out<00:04:01.200> terior

as<00:04:02.060> educated<00:04:03.060> people<00:04:03.330> like<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.630> say<00:04:03.810> there<00:04:04.350> is

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
as educated people like to say there is

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.350 
as educated people like to say there is
the<00:04:04.680> big<00:04:04.890> warehouse<00:04:05.490> though<00:04:05.790> I<00:04:05.970> think<00:04:06.210> that's

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
the big warehouse though I think that's

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.660 
the big warehouse though I think that's
there<00:04:07.350> are<00:04:07.590> a<00:04:07.620> couple<00:04:07.800> of<00:04:07.950> outbuildings<00:04:08.340> that

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
there are a couple of outbuildings that

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.040 
there are a couple of outbuildings that
you<00:04:08.790> can<00:04:08.940> kind<00:04:09.120> of<00:04:09.150> get<00:04:09.300> into<00:04:09.450> their<00:04:09.750> small

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
you can kind of get into their small

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.710 
you can kind of get into their small
kind<00:04:10.290> of<00:04:10.350> discrete<00:04:10.740> areas<00:04:11.210> but<00:04:12.210> germain

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720

might<00:04:17.310> very<00:04:17.400> well<00:04:17.610> be<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:17.850> focal<00:04:18.239> point

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
might very well be the focal point

people might gravitate towards it it's

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.730 
people might gravitate towards it it's
definitely<00:04:21.360> an<00:04:21.720> interesting<00:04:21.900> place<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.350> have
