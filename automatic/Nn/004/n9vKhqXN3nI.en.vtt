the ground so dig a square like that and

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.120 
the ground so dig a square like that and
then<00:01:27.390> dig<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.900> next<00:01:28.229> layer<00:01:28.439> down<00:01:30.979> now<00:01:31.979> on

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
then dig the next layer down now on

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.100 
then dig the next layer down now on
these<00:01:32.280> front<00:01:32.610> two<00:01:32.670> blocks<00:01:33.119> here<00:01:33.390> dig<00:01:33.750> another

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
these front two blocks here dig another

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.469 
these front two blocks here dig another
layer<00:01:34.409> down<00:01:34.740> but<00:01:35.040> leave<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.700> ones<00:01:35.909> on<00:01:36.210> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
layer down but leave the ones on the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.810 
layer down but leave the ones on the
back<00:01:36.720> there<00:01:37.049> at<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.860> bottom<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.220> these<00:01:38.430> we'll

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
back there at the bottom of these we'll

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.850 
back there at the bottom of these we'll
place<00:01:39.060> our<00:01:39.360> pistons<00:01:42.170> then<00:01:43.170> on<00:01:43.380> these<00:01:43.560> other

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
place our pistons then on these other

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.760 
place our pistons then on these other
two<00:01:44.189> blocks<00:01:44.520> place<00:01:44.759> redstone<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.630> top<00:01:45.869> now

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
two blocks place redstone on the top now

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.510 
two blocks place redstone on the top now
at<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.070> top<00:01:47.310> right<00:01:47.579> block<00:01:47.850> here<00:01:48.119> dig<00:01:48.390> 2<00:01:48.600> down

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
at this top right block here dig 2 down

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.200 
at this top right block here dig 2 down
do<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.640> one<00:01:50.850> more<00:01:50.990> and<00:01:52.399> place<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.579> redstone<00:01:54.000> on

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
do it one more and place the redstone on

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.660 
do it one more and place the redstone on
those<00:01:54.390> two<00:01:54.659> blocks<00:01:54.930> down<00:01:55.049> there<00:01:55.549> stick<00:01:56.549> a

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
those two blocks down there stick a

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.730 
those two blocks down there stick a
redstone<00:01:57.000> torch<00:01:57.149> on<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:58.110> side<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.530> block

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
redstone torch on this side of the block

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.539 
redstone torch on this side of the block
there<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.340> should<00:01:59.549> power<00:01:59.939> these<00:02:00.570> Pistons

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
there and it should power these Pistons

this repeater here and then one
connecting<00:03:50.489> them<00:03:51.150> up<00:03:51.330> so<00:03:51.720> there<00:03:51.900> we<00:03:51.989> go<00:03:52.019> guys

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
connecting them up so there we go guys

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.830 
connecting them up so there we go guys
that<00:03:52.769> is<00:03:52.890> practically<00:03:53.489> it<00:03:53.700> but<00:03:54.209> now<00:03:54.420> if<00:03:54.660> you
