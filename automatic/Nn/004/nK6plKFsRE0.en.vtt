00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.540 
make sure that the edges are safe and
clear<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.380> do<00:00:34.620> not<00:00:34.739> have<00:00:34.980> one<00:00:35.340> edge<00:00:35.520> that

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
clear so you do not have one edge that

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.080 
clear so you do not have one edge that
is<00:00:35.910> too<00:00:36.120> long<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.570> one<00:00:36.719> that's<00:00:36.930> too<00:00:37.200> short

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.520 

after<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.210> fabric<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.719> all<00:00:42.930> penned<00:00:43.170> up<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
after the fabric is all penned up on the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.950 
after the fabric is all penned up on the
walls<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.950> want<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.280> start<00:00:44.579> by<00:00:44.850> putting<00:00:45.629> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
walls you want to start by putting the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.930 
walls you want to start by putting the
starch<00:00:46.559> into<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.039> paint<00:00:47.250> bin<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.670> be

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
starch into the paint bin and be

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.910 
starch into the paint bin and be
generous<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.690> because<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.260> will<00:00:49.500> need<00:00:49.710> a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
generous on this because you will need a

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.970 
generous on this because you will need a
lot<00:00:50.180> wet<00:00:51.180> your<00:00:51.329> paintbrush<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.960> start<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
lot wet your paintbrush and start in the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.310 
lot wet your paintbrush and start in the
corner<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.760> wall<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.329> work<00:00:54.989> your<00:00:55.140> way

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
corner of the wall and work your way

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.619 
corner of the wall and work your way
down<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.920> out<00:00:58.640> we<00:00:59.640> found<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.030> using<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
down and out we found that using the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.869 
down and out we found that using the
paint<00:01:00.930> roller<00:01:01.109> works<00:01:01.440> best<00:01:01.980> because<00:01:02.609> it

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
paint roller works best because it

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.270 
paint roller works best because it
applies<00:01:03.270> more<00:01:03.510> starch<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> larger<00:01:04.619> area<00:01:04.830> and

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
applies more starch to a larger area and

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.160 
applies more starch to a larger area and
don't<00:01:05.640> be<00:01:05.729> afraid<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.150> put<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.510> lot<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.930> starch

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
don't be afraid to put a lot of starch

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.620 
don't be afraid to put a lot of starch
onto<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.619> walls<00:01:07.830> because<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.490> little<00:01:08.760> does<00:01:09.299> not

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
onto the walls because a little does not

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.780 
onto the walls because a little does not
go<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> long<00:01:10.080> way<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.500> case<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.549> will

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
go a long way in this case and you will

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.440 
go a long way in this case and you will
need<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.270> lot<00:01:12.930> for<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.470> process

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.500 

Oh
