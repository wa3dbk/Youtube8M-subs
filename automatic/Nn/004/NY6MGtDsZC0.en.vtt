00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
hair dry I'm not using a brush because

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.440 
hair dry I'm not using a brush because
I'm<00:01:10.560> not<00:01:10.710> really<00:01:10.950> looking<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.729> smooth<00:01:12.240> out<00:01:12.420> my

all right so none of my hair is
completely<00:01:48.210> dry<00:01:48.570> I'm<00:01:48.930> just<00:01:49.140> gonna<00:01:49.260> run<00:01:49.560> my

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950

paddle<00:01:50.400> brush<00:01:50.550> once<00:01:50.970> again<00:01:51.270> through<00:01:51.450> my<00:01:51.480> hair

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
paddle brush once again through my hair

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.060 
paddle brush once again through my hair
to<00:01:52.020> make<00:01:52.170> sure<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.350> don't<00:01:52.470> have<00:01:52.619> any<00:01:52.680> tangles

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
to make sure I don't have any tangles

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.070 
to make sure I don't have any tangles
and<00:01:53.430> then<00:01:54.060> I'm<00:01:54.330> going<00:01:54.510> to<00:01:54.570> start<00:01:54.810> off<00:01:54.900> by

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
and then I'm going to start off by

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.160 
and then I'm going to start off by
sectioning<00:01:55.440> off<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.070> top<00:01:56.869> section<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.990> hair

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
sectioning off the top section of hair

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.810 
sectioning off the top section of hair
so<00:01:58.320> I'm<00:01:58.380> going<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.530> do<00:01:58.650> like<00:01:58.890> my<00:01:59.340> split<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.729> in

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
so I'm going to do like my split it in

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.640 
so I'm going to do like my split it in
half<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.390> I'm<00:02:01.140> going<00:02:01.260> to<00:02:01.320> start<00:02:01.530> by<00:02:01.619> working

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
half and I'm going to start by working

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.060 
half and I'm going to start by working
with<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.369> lower<00:02:02.550> end<00:02:02.850> first

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
with the lower end first

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.400 
with the lower end first
so<00:02:05.070> next<00:02:05.250> I'm<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.490> going<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.790> put<00:02:06.030> on<00:02:06.119> my

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
so next I'm just going to put on my

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.719 
so next I'm just going to put on my
heat-resistant<00:02:07.410> gloves<00:02:07.770> since<00:02:08.100> I<00:02:08.190> am<00:02:08.369> using<00:02:08.550> a

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
heat-resistant gloves since I am using a

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.210 
heat-resistant gloves since I am using a
wand<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.390> once<00:02:09.869> don't<00:02:10.140> have<00:02:10.320> any<00:02:10.530> clips<00:02:10.890> and

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
wand and once don't have any clips and

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.190 
wand and once don't have any clips and
you<00:02:12.209> want<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.390> make<00:02:12.510> sure<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.900> put<00:02:13.080> on<00:02:13.170> a

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
you want to make sure that you put on a

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.630 
you want to make sure that you put on a
glove<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.740> don't<00:02:13.920> bring<00:02:14.010> your<00:02:14.070> fingertips

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
glove so you don't bring your fingertips

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.190 
glove so you don't bring your fingertips
plus<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.180> helps<00:02:15.330> me<00:02:15.630> work<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.930> little<00:02:16.020> bit

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
plus it helps me work a little bit

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.780 
plus it helps me work a little bit
faster<00:02:16.650> if<00:02:16.740> I<00:02:16.800> have<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:16.950> glove<00:02:17.190> on<00:02:17.340> because<00:02:17.670> I'm

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
faster if I have a glove on because I'm

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.960 
faster if I have a glove on because I'm
not<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.240> careful<00:02:19.050> with<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:20.580> I'm<00:02:20.820> actually

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
not so careful with it and I'm actually

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.630 
not so careful with it and I'm actually
using<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.450> 25<00:02:21.990> millimeter<00:02:22.350> one<00:02:22.950> first

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
using the 25 millimeter one first

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.520 
using the 25 millimeter one first
because<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.300> want<00:02:24.450> bigger<00:02:24.780> waves<00:02:25.110> at<00:02:25.350> the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
because I want bigger waves at the
