00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:12.759
 this device around the world 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.619
 a depression from the largest mobile you can imagine at the level of 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.460
 those of this year besides this we will not see 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.300
 in fact this is a little what I told you before the idea is a great device 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.519
 who has nokia 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:25.789
 that is not a mobile 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.419
 that are a bit strange 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.419
 a nokia that is not a world the idea that has 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.290
 smallest more manageable with us 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.770
 and for certain occasions - a device makes me feel this 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.480
 complement as they call me exactly 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.860
 the good all have already three models is a christ that dissipated since 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:48.640
 i + d 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.390
 They took a first a product that was not good to remove it now marked by the 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.520
 moment has development team 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.520
 and they have pulled out their latest version since it's a 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.049
 an apparatus with keyboard with gps with camera 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.410
 the pole to know this newspaper 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.910
 h 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.320
 a lot of improvements 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.880
 but it will continue to be 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.730
 that is our these flu therapies while doing it before 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:16.500
 these 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.160
 this also 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.910
 good lcd explained that it is a bit the software the whole part of the show 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.820
 this device is being developed with a free-of-charge project 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.290
 the community creates a community of developers for a hundred that we will add 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.960
 maemo point 8s and well I'm participating in the community both 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.390
 User Level 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.480
 has developed new ideas from the test 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.770
 the end has arrived 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.240
 communities or good book for mobile devices 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.399
 the idea that has does not have that sense is to enhance the development part as 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.410
 sugar free 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.210
 and they are becoming references as a device manufacturer that in the end 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.850
 good 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.790
 is a bit the Nokia what surprises for its mobile devices 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.580
 for all the part of development that can improve the community of 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.130
 developers that exist 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.009
 they will be good in that sense min
