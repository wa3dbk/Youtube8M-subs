00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.720
 Garrosh Hellscream 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.250
 the leader of the horde is very sad fate 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.769
 own thirst for power and madness 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.840
 led him to a series of failures and hardships 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.599
 Now we will continue to consider 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.580
 the story of this ambiguous character and 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.109
 find out why he became who 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.109
 is now 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.890
 Garrosh committed several times 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.550
 thoughtless actions in relation to 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.860
 alliance 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.130
 and tried to unleash hostility between the two 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.130
 by the nations 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.570
 when a new world looms over the world of Azeroth 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.670
 threat in the form of the ancient god yoxa ron 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.160
 who has rested for centuries in the palaces 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.470
 ulduar trawl and garrosh were urgent 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.440
 summoned and in Dalaran for negotiations with 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.840
 the leader of the kirin torus ronin but 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.270
 coincidental arch 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.440
 arrived just at that moment when there 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:26.259
 attended variannogo alliance I do not 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:28.690
 it seemed to be between the king and the good again 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.390
 conflict broke out and they started a fight each 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.759
 with another straight purple citadel but 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.399
 ronin was able to stop the fight with 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.320
 magic account 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.570
 ronin believed that the horde and alliance 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.840
 will be able to unite in front of a new threat 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.880
 but the hatred between boiled and good is not 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.869
 allowed the parties to negotiate and 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.850
 option teleported away garrosh 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.369
 expressed the opinion that the true leader 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.520
 will never cooperate miserable 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.520
 cowards 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.660
 after the events in dalaran and trall and 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.599
 Garrosh returned to their fortress songs 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.000
 wars in northscale a little later cairne 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.920
 bloody hoof visited the fortress to 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.540
 meet up with a surfing spy and 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.879
 peas he was impressed with the fortification 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.010
 fortress and compared it with architecture 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:29.629
 which the arches used during 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:32.500
 last war on the way home garrosh 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:35.630
 discovered the wreck of the alliance 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.630
 the young orc obeyed the branches right and not 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.450
 began to kill the survivors instead he 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.549
 gave them food by showing them 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.549
 at the same time the power and mercy of the horde 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.710
 when the war ended garrosh returned 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.440
 in orgrimmar to hero winner trout 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.960
 warmly received war veterans in nordskol 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.260
 and during the holidays their honor he handed 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.530
 the peas ax of his father is bloody thunder 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.180
 howl 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.340
 soon because of problems with elementals 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.830
 which blocked the path of supply 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.990
 the leaders of the horde offered to begin the peaceful 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.590
 negotiations with the night elves as much 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.960
 January forest Garrosh was again 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.500
 outraged by this and offered to take away 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:25.230
 right this land itself by force but 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.680
 he was besieged by the core and the garrosh was forced 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.680
 to apologize 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.310
 a little later considering the skull of the mannorote 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.730
 Garrosh Meets Rich Matriarch 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.130
 sinister totem he immediately expressed to her 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.410
 soft and contempt because her tribe 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.500
 was the only one who did not swear 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.720
 Ardi's allegiance is rich promised that 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.290
 join the horde when there is 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:56.690
 need and said I was stunned what exactly he 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.690
 must lead the orc people 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:03.260
 the elemental threat continued to grow and 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:06.510
 fiery spirits soon flooded orgrimmar 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.910
 attempts to find out the reason for their madness 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:14.190
 which did not lead and the trawl began training 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:16.470
 to travel in on a grant due to the fact that 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.780
 he could not fulfill the duties of the leader 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:23.400
 he had to consider temporary 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.830
 candidacy for this post first thought 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.500
 was cairne bloody hoof 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.810
 but he was taurine and did not fit this 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.120
 role as it would cause discontent 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.120
 and unrest in such turbulent times 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:41.759
 the ideal candidate was a hip knife 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:47.280
 surfing son of warak but he died by the hand 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:49.830
 Lich King's thoughts-bed knife and prompted 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.660
 trawl on the idea that garrosh is quite 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.770
 could handle this hard 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.039
 task 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.889
 the trawl summoned a garrosh to the grommash fortress and 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:02.759
 declared him acting 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:05.310
 the leader garrosh tried to refuse 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.889
 arguing that his place on the field 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.220
 combat and he is more tempted in the military they 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:14.190
 political art but the trawl reassured 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.789
 him saying that cairn intrigue and vol'jin 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:20.430
 help him cope with the board 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:22.610
 Garrosh agreed and took over this 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.610
 role 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.450
 Well, in more detail a garrosh as 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:39.540
 the leader of the horde we'll talk next video 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.540
 with you there was no 1 see you soon 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:45.960
 The video was made with the support of 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:48.590
 information portal in jpee. 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.590
