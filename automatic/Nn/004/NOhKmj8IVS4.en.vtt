these realistic cars and our little frog

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.400 
these realistic cars and our little frog
and<00:00:31.880> we<00:00:32.880> have<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.149> hop<00:00:33.300> across<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:34.050> road

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
and we have to hop across the road

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.670 
and we have to hop across the road
without<00:00:34.649> getting<00:00:35.070> killed<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:36.350> it<00:00:37.350> actually

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
without getting killed and it actually

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.170 
without getting killed and it actually
works<00:00:38.100> really<00:00:38.370> well<00:00:38.700> when<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.870> survive<00:00:40.320> oh

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
works really well when you survive oh

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.910 
works really well when you survive oh
the<00:00:42.180> cars<00:00:42.480> look<00:00:42.719> really<00:00:43.170> nice<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.590> think<00:00:43.649> what

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the cars look really nice I think what

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.350 
the cars look really nice I think what
they<00:00:44.010> did<00:00:44.190> was<00:00:44.309> they<00:00:44.370> probably<00:00:44.760> had<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.149> take<00:00:45.329> a

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
they did was they probably had to take a

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.190 
they did was they probably had to take a
picture<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.320> cars<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.890> then<00:00:48.079> you<00:00:49.079> know

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
picture of the cars and then you know

layer is actually being used here for

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.609 
layer is actually being used here for
most<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.610> content<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.420> level<00:01:15.720> um<00:01:16.229> I

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
most of the content in the level um I

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.730 
most of the content in the level um I
think<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.670> wood<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.780> concrete<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.590> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
think the wood and the concrete and the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.030 
think the wood and the concrete and the
sash<00:01:19.950> stuff<00:01:20.520> those<00:01:20.820> are<00:01:21.150> all<00:01:21.630> engaged

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
materials but other than that I think

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.060 
materials but other than that I think
everything<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:25.950> level<00:01:26.310> we<00:01:26.580> made

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
everything in this level we made

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.820 
everything in this level we made
sticker<00:01:27.550> layer<00:01:27.820> and<00:01:28.090> as<00:01:28.930> you<00:01:29.080> can<00:01:29.229> see<00:01:29.260> you<00:01:29.470> to
