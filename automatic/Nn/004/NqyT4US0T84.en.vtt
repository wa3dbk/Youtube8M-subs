00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.419
 Memmingen II 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.480
 Hello and welcome to the current issue of life &amp; style v 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.349
 in the first round of the krombacher-kreispokals it came on the 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.639
 Sports ground on Kammweg to the meeting of the two second 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:16.330
 men 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.669
 the FC Wehr the compartment 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:20.650
 and that post Südstadt Karlsruhe 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.690
 from beginning to 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.119
 a game developed at eye level 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.310
 showing both teams 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.210
 that they are in the middle of preparing for the new season but not only 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.010
 hard workouts had some with Aspar players to deal with 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.569
 Alsdorf sports the city more Ford realizes that new brooms 

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:42.959
 later it was stolen and I told Denk that our software was significantly increasing 

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:44.150
 the stone is still percent 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.150
 To feel what they are selling the venue 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.960
 Torse scenes on both sides remained more likely throughout the first half 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.590
 in short supply 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.130
 the biggest chance of the guests Hans Schmid narrowly missed a cross 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.220
 next to the gate of fcb-keeper Matthias Kopp the first 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.879
 but shortly before the break whistle, the home side were allowed to 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.950
 Cheer up premiere for Uster 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.100
 A capital blunder in the defense of the a-ligist Post SK had Kevin 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.100
 Kauffeld to the 1 0 half-time 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.640
 also in halftime two same picture much midfield skirmishing and few right 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.760
 goal scenes 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.420
 In the 65th minute following a corner, Shell was proud that we were here 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.060
 his shot just missed the goal 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.220
 on the opposite side it goes after a ball win quickly in the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.160
 top 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.130
 The shot of Klaus striker Klose Frosty can but just in the last 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.130
 Be blocked 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.439
 the biggest chance on the part of SC Wettersbach was in the 75th minute 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.000
 Patrick Zanner 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.750
 but his volley goes past the box of Posco Peter Reiff Schleicher 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.820
 The last action of the cup match brought the nearly 50 spectators 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.320
 Fantoche one more hit 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.320
 Substitute Florian Müller 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.320
 is alone on and off seconds before the end 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.929
 he fits into the center and Patrick Ommert jumps the ball at his 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.029
 Defense attempt on the hand 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:17.219
 logically, there is the yellow card for him 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.000
 and the penalty penalty 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.150
 Relatives of the SCW captain Yaniv stubbornly confident to the 2 0-endstand 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.709
 Coach Thomas Knorr has nothing to complain about 

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:35.279
 but many years 9 92 2 1 1 sentences and sometimes even back satisfied 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:37.309
 it was in three now training operation 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:41.189
 and I think that two of them are some teens or boy or player 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.539
 everything is to know the battery he is since March but on the whole am 

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:45.249
 I am satisfied 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:48.919
 a boy of the subject he himself is therefore the a-ligist of the post Südstadt 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:50.659
 Karlsruhe with 2 to 0 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.319
 and Thomas Knorr expects a lot from his this season 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.969
 young players 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:03:00.109
 So our philosophy Bordeaux can only get young players 7 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.909
 But AR on the potential to play that can alone on the experience 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.209
 Quake but I think 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.289
 On the way she should be right in front of the actually everything should take place again in May 

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:10.969
 Nordertor pawn sacrifice 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:12.689
 a than in the previous year 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:16.379
 and the numbers there were twelve more players coming out i think that's the one 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.529
 one or the other speaks three to four spatially the chance Mulgrew 

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:22.919
 Brainwashing Monza for games and that will be our long-term goal 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:23.549
 his 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.479
 our young team percent built 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:27.680
 on Wednesday 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.750
 it is the second team of the FCB that makes it in the second round of the 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.000
 krombacher-cup at 18:15 on the league-starter 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.710
 FV Alemannia Bruchhausen
