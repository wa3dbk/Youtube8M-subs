this and that grounding Jay I made it's
the<00:00:02.610> universal<00:00:03.240> jig<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:05.210> select<00:00:06.210> different

shapes profiles on the Mac from Gibson
to<00:00:10.139> PRS<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.309> my<00:00:11.429> own<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:12.179> whether<00:00:12.420> they<00:00:12.630> may

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
to PRS to my own to whether they may

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.560 
to PRS to my own to whether they may
become<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.590> how<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:14.490> works<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:14.969> these<00:00:15.480> feelers

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
become and how it works is these feelers

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.540 
become and how it works is these feelers
actually<00:00:19.910> kind<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:21.000> follow<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.689> contour<00:00:22.289> on

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
actually kind of follow this contour on

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.800 
actually kind of follow this contour on
both<00:00:23.550> sides<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.090> Mac<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.510> what<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.689> is

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
both sides of the Mac and what it is

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.050 
both sides of the Mac and what it is
it's<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.470> it's<00:00:26.150> a<00:00:27.470> mold<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:29.400> profile<00:00:29.820> here

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
it's a it's a mold of this profile here

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.389 
it's a it's a mold of this profile here
blown<00:00:30.269> out<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.599> set<00:00:31.289> out<00:00:31.439> here<00:00:31.650> same<00:00:32.219> thing

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
blown out and set out here same thing

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.670 
blown out and set out here same thing
here<00:00:32.579> it's<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.360> profile<00:00:33.809> blown<00:00:34.050> out<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.500> set

here it's this profile blown out and set

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.740 
here it's this profile blown out and set
out<00:00:34.770> here<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.700> what<00:00:36.090> I'm<00:00:36.149> going<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.300> do<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.540> I

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
out here so what I'm going to do is I

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.930 
out here so what I'm going to do is I
have<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> ability<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.559> stack<00:00:37.890> like<00:00:38.129> eight<00:00:38.370> or

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
have the ability to stack like eight or

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.540 
have the ability to stack like eight or
six<00:00:39.180> six<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.570> eight<00:00:39.719> different<00:00:40.100> neck<00:00:41.100> profile

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
six six to eight different neck profile

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.850 
six six to eight different neck profile
is<00:00:41.670> on<00:00:41.790> there<00:00:42.030> without<00:00:42.239> having<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.260> change<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
is on there without having to change the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.590 
is on there without having to change the
machine<00:00:44.190> or<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.460> know<00:00:44.550> like<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.480> then

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
machine or you know like that and then

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.630 
machine or you know like that and then
how<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.870> works<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.440> I've<00:00:46.950> only<00:00:47.129> got<00:00:47.340> two<00:00:47.489> on

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
how it works is I've only got two on

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.100 
how it works is I've only got two on
here<00:00:47.850> right<00:00:48.000> now<00:00:48.829> but<00:00:49.829> however<00:00:50.190> as<00:00:50.899> more<00:00:51.899> come

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
here right now but however as more come

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.000 
here right now but however as more come
up<00:00:52.260> come<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.649> here

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
up come in here

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
up come in here
I<00:00:53.960> made<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.170> indexer<00:00:55.949> with<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> with<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.930> nylon

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
I made this indexer with a with a nylon

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.069 
I made this indexer with a with a nylon
washer<00:01:00.030> that's<00:01:00.149> just<00:01:00.359> hard<00:01:00.539> mounted<00:01:00.870> there<00:01:00.989> so

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
washer that's just hard mounted there so

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.830 
washer that's just hard mounted there so
it's<00:01:01.199> just<00:01:01.260> friction<00:01:01.649> running<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:03.030> am

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
it's just friction running on this I am

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.440 
it's just friction running on this I am
able<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.170> just<00:01:04.949> loosen<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:05.850> slide<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.420> to

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
able to just loosen that and slide it to

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.539 
able to just loosen that and slide it to
the<00:01:06.600> next<00:01:06.780> profile<00:01:07.200> shape<00:01:07.439> without<00:01:08.070> having<00:01:08.460> to

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the next profile shape without having to

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.880 
the next profile shape without having to
do<00:01:08.700> any<00:01:08.970> other<00:01:09.270> thing<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:10.110> course<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.650> want<00:01:10.799> to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
do any other thing of course you want to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.990 
do any other thing of course you want to
select<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.250> same<00:01:11.430> down<00:01:11.670> here<00:01:11.970> which<00:01:12.780> would<00:01:13.140> be

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
select the same down here which would be

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.399 
select the same down here which would be
like<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.210> okay<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:15.720> now<00:01:15.930> these<00:01:16.170> are<00:01:16.229> two

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
like that okay so now these are two

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.020 
like that okay so now these are two
totally<00:01:16.890> different<00:01:16.950> profiles<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.790> just

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
totally different profiles that I just

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.710 
totally different profiles that I just
selected<00:01:18.799> so<00:01:19.799> as<00:01:20.189> they<00:01:20.759> get<00:01:20.880> stacked<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.450> here

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
selected so as they get stacked on here

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.160 
selected so as they get stacked on here
I<00:01:21.900> can<00:01:22.140> go<00:01:22.259> from<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.970> 1954<00:01:23.970> Fender<00:01:24.360> Strat<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.960> can

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
I can go from a 1954 Fender Strat I can

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.109 
I can go from a 1954 Fender Strat I can
go<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> PRS<00:01:25.890> white<00:01:26.130> fat<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.700> can<00:01:26.850> do<00:01:26.970> my<00:01:27.090> own

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
cars I can do the acoustic guitar cars

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.780 
cars I can do the acoustic guitar cars
that<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:30.350> that<00:01:31.350> have<00:01:31.470> come<00:01:31.650> up<00:01:31.829> with<00:01:31.860> but

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
that I that have come up with but

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.880 
that I that have come up with but
actually<00:01:33.360> for<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.570> route<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:34.049> will<00:01:34.350> be<00:01:34.500> going

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
actually for this route I will be going

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.810 
actually for this route I will be going
back<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.460> which<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.570> just<00:01:37.490> going<00:01:38.490> back<00:01:38.729> to

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
back to this which is just going back to

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.910 
back to this which is just going back to
that<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:40.040> also<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.960> other<00:01:43.079> cool<00:01:43.649> part<00:01:43.799> is

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
that and also the other cool part is

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.800 
that and also the other cool part is
just<00:01:44.159> these<00:01:44.549> here<00:01:44.820> these<00:01:45.210> can<00:01:45.450> move<00:01:45.600> up<00:01:45.720> and

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
just these here these can move up and

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.230 
just these here these can move up and
down<00:01:45.930> but<00:01:46.500> generally<00:01:46.979> it's<00:01:47.220> an<00:01:47.369> indexed<00:01:48.060> an

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
down but generally it's an indexed an

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.310 
down but generally it's an indexed an
indexed<00:01:49.170> set<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.369> then<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.360> parameters<00:01:52.020> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
indexed set and then the parameters the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.749 
indexed set and then the parameters the
boundaries<00:01:53.310> from<00:01:53.579> here<00:01:53.909> or<00:01:54.060> on<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:55.640> so<00:01:56.640> if

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
boundaries from here or on this so if

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.670 
boundaries from here or on this so if
you<00:01:56.850> went<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.149> wider<00:01:57.450> nut<00:01:57.719> or<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> wider<00:01:58.290> he'll

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
you went to a wider nut or a wider he'll

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.240 
you went to a wider nut or a wider he'll
just<00:01:59.610> leave<00:01:59.880> these<00:02:00.030> indexed<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.860> make<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
just leave these indexed and make the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.370 
just leave these indexed and make the
the<00:02:02.670> cam<00:02:02.909> shapers<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.420> call<00:02:03.600> these<00:02:03.750> cam<00:02:03.960> shapers

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
the cam shapers I call these cam shapers

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.709 
the cam shapers I call these cam shapers
would<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:04.710> would<00:02:05.130> be<00:02:05.310> relatively<00:02:06.119> just<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.570> hair

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
would be would be relatively just a hair

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.740 
would be would be relatively just a hair
bigger<00:02:06.930> because<00:02:07.829> you'd<00:02:07.950> be<00:02:08.039> wider<00:02:08.280> here<00:02:08.750> so

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
bigger because you'd be wider here so

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.180 
bigger because you'd be wider here so
that's<00:02:09.899> basically<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.440> functionality<00:02:11.160> of

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
that's basically the functionality of

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.809 
that's basically the functionality of
this<00:02:11.340> Jay

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
this Jay

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.170 
this Jay
okay<00:02:11.939> it<00:02:12.659> mostly<00:02:12.989> space<00:02:13.230> on<00:02:13.499> the<00:02:13.590> axis<00:02:14.180> it

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
okay it mostly space on the axis it

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.670 
okay it mostly space on the axis it
slides<00:02:15.450> back<00:02:15.659> and<00:02:15.689> forth<00:02:15.900> there's<00:02:16.409> a<00:02:16.499> pin

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
slides back and forth there's a pin

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.379 
slides back and forth there's a pin
underneath<00:02:16.950> here<00:02:17.249> directly<00:02:17.760> underneath<00:02:17.969> this

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:20.389 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:24.080 

this<00:02:21.389> this<00:02:21.959> holder<00:02:22.439> can<00:02:22.620> only<00:02:22.739> rotate<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.549> it

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
this this holder can only rotate and it

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.399 
this this holder can only rotate and it
can<00:02:24.209> only<00:02:24.299> go<00:02:24.480> up<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.749> down<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.230> can<00:02:25.349> only

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
can only go up and down so it can only

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.020 
can only go up and down so it can only
rotate<00:02:25.709> go<00:02:26.040> up<00:02:26.099> and<00:02:26.219> down<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:26.489> that<00:02:26.519> the<00:02:26.700> feeler

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
rotate go up and down so that the feeler

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.319 
rotate go up and down so that the feeler
will<00:02:27.719> just<00:02:28.409> follow<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.340> camp<00:02:29.730> shape<00:02:29.909> and

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
will just follow that camp shape and

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.839 
will just follow that camp shape and
then<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.450> put<00:02:30.689> a<00:02:31.040> steering<00:02:32.040> wheel<00:02:32.069> slash<00:02:32.519> guide

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
then I put a steering wheel slash guide

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:33.649 
then I put a steering wheel slash guide
wheel<00:02:33.090> over<00:02:33.299> here

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
wheel over here

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.899 
wheel over here
so<00:02:34.349> how<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.680> works<00:02:34.709> is<00:02:35.989> I<00:02:36.989> actually<00:02:37.319> bring<00:02:37.909> the

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
so how it works is I actually bring the

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.270 
so how it works is I actually bring the
router<00:02:39.060> bit<00:02:39.239> down<00:02:39.450> things<00:02:40.230> like<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.560> that's

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
router bit down things like that that's

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.539 
router bit down things like that that's
running<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:42.499> I<00:02:43.499> will<00:02:43.680> start<00:02:43.919> here<00:02:44.219> and<00:02:44.400> I'll

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
running and I will start here and I'll

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.959 
running and I will start here and I'll
come<00:02:44.730> across<00:02:45.030> here<00:02:45.299> like<00:02:45.359> this<00:02:45.719> and<00:02:46.730> I'll<00:02:47.730> come

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:47.969 
come across here like this and I'll come

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:52.220 
come across here like this and I'll come
down<00:02:48.120> here<00:02:48.709> I'll<00:02:49.709> come<00:02:49.859> over<00:02:49.980> like<00:02:50.250> this<00:02:51.230> now

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
down here I'll come over like this now

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.439 
down here I'll come over like this now
I'll<00:02:52.379> come<00:02:52.530> back<00:02:52.939> and<00:02:53.939> then<00:02:54.030> I'll<00:02:54.150> just<00:02:54.299> start

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:54.449 
I'll come back and then I'll just start

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
I'll come back and then I'll just start
doing<00:02:54.599> short<00:02:55.560> cuts<00:02:56.310> like<00:02:56.459> this<00:02:57.169> it<00:02:58.169> will

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:58.469 
doing short cuts like this it will

00:02:58.469 --> 00:02:59.959 
doing short cuts like this it will
follow<00:02:58.680> these<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.549> will<00:02:59.639> put<00:02:59.849> that

00:02:59.959 --> 00:02:59.969 
follow these and it will put that

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:03.140 
follow these and it will put that
profile<00:03:00.389> on<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.599> neck<00:03:00.799> so<00:03:01.799> if<00:03:02.609> I<00:03:02.760> can<00:03:02.969> get<00:03:03.120> a

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
profile on the neck so if I can get a

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.409 
profile on the neck so if I can get a
copy<00:03:03.659> of<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.959> neck<00:03:04.109> I<00:03:04.319> can<00:03:04.879> replicate<00:03:05.879> other

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:06.419 
copy of the neck I can replicate other

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.319 
copy of the neck I can replicate other
necks<00:03:07.459> that<00:03:08.459> is<00:03:08.579> basically<00:03:08.909> how<00:03:09.000> it's<00:03:09.209> gonna

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
necks that is basically how it's gonna

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.319 
necks that is basically how it's gonna
go<00:03:09.569> well<00:03:10.349> show<00:03:10.709> show<00:03:11.099> me<00:03:11.280> like<00:03:11.639> I<00:03:11.790> just<00:03:12.090> figured

go well show show me like I just figured
out<00:03:12.419> how<00:03:12.569> that<00:03:12.750> worked<00:03:12.959> because<00:03:13.319> of<00:03:13.409> that

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
out how that worked because of that

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.819 
out how that worked because of that
that's<00:03:14.189> springload<00:03:14.879> yep<00:03:15.209> that's<00:03:15.989> really<00:03:16.650> cool

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
that's springload yep that's really cool

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.719 
that's springload yep that's really cool
yep<00:03:17.549> show<00:03:17.819> me<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:18.419> okay<00:03:18.750> so<00:03:19.430> if<00:03:20.430> I<00:03:20.519> push

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
down you'll notice that this this thing

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.679 
down you'll notice that this this thing
here<00:03:22.500> moves<00:03:22.680> well<00:03:22.949> these<00:03:23.370> Springs<00:03:23.970> have<00:03:24.299> art

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:24.689 
here moves well these Springs have art

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:26.240 
here moves well these Springs have art
you<00:03:24.959> know<00:03:25.019> I<00:03:25.079> can<00:03:25.259> put<00:03:25.470> tighter<00:03:25.739> Springs<00:03:26.099> on

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
you know I can put tighter Springs on

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.610 
you know I can put tighter Springs on
there<00:03:26.370> but<00:03:26.489> I<00:03:26.519> I<00:03:27.239> just<00:03:27.810> want<00:03:28.229> to<00:03:28.290> pull<00:03:28.439> enough

there but I I just want to pull enough

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.649 
there but I I just want to pull enough
tension<00:03:29.069> up<00:03:29.250> into<00:03:29.519> this<00:03:29.639> so<00:03:30.150> that<00:03:30.329> it's

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
tension up into this so that it's

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.439 
tension up into this so that it's
holding<00:03:31.019> it<00:03:31.139> it's<00:03:31.530> holding<00:03:31.859> this<00:03:32.099> up<00:03:32.449> into

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.449 
holding it it's holding this up into

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:37.399 
holding it it's holding this up into
this<00:03:34.069> so<00:03:35.069> that<00:03:35.220> this<00:03:35.340> indexer<00:03:35.939> can<00:03:36.169> feel<00:03:37.169> this

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
this so that this indexer can feel this

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:41.360 
this so that this indexer can feel this
this<00:03:37.739> profile<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:39.620> it's<00:03:40.620> holding<00:03:40.859> it<00:03:41.040> up<00:03:41.159> and

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
this profile and it's holding it up and

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.729 
this profile and it's holding it up and
it's<00:03:42.150> holding<00:03:42.329> also<00:03:42.750> holding<00:03:43.079> it<00:03:43.199> up<00:03:43.319> into<00:03:43.590> the

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
it's holding also holding it up into the

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.580 
it's holding also holding it up into the
cutter<00:03:43.949> as<00:03:44.189> it's<00:03:44.970> going<00:03:45.239> so<00:03:45.659> as<00:03:45.930> you'll<00:03:46.379> notice

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
cutter as it's going so as you'll notice

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.219 
cutter as it's going so as you'll notice
if<00:03:46.769> you<00:03:46.829> just<00:03:47.040> look<00:03:47.220> at<00:03:47.310> this<00:03:47.400> bar<00:03:47.639> it<00:03:48.229> just

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:49.229 
if you just look at this bar it just

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.789 
if you just look at this bar it just
goes<00:03:49.409> up<00:03:49.620> or<00:03:49.859> down<00:03:50.479> and<00:03:51.479> rotates<00:03:52.169> it<00:03:52.290> does<00:03:52.620> it

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
goes up or down and rotates it does it

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.580 
goes up or down and rotates it does it
can't<00:03:53.040> yaw<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:54.030> can't<00:03:54.359> you<00:03:54.959> can't<00:03:55.229> even<00:03:55.500> go

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
can't yaw it can't you can't even go

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.189 
can't yaw it can't you can't even go

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 
to blend the ceiling but the important

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:32.689 
to blend the ceiling but the important
thing<00:06:29.789> here<00:06:29.879> is<00:06:30.360> the<00:06:31.110> profile<00:06:31.650> puts<00:06:32.129> on<00:06:32.250> here<00:06:32.520> I

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:32.699 
thing here is the profile puts on here I

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:34.670 
thing here is the profile puts on here I
can<00:06:32.940> pick<00:06:33.090> this<00:06:33.210> out<00:06:33.389> I<00:06:33.629> can<00:06:33.840> do<00:06:33.930> ten<00:06:34.169> decks<00:06:34.440> and

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
can pick this out I can do ten decks and

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.869 
can pick this out I can do ten decks and
they<00:06:34.740> would<00:06:34.889> be<00:06:34.979> identical<00:06:35.669> in<00:06:35.970> feel<00:06:36.270> so

00:06:37.869 --> 00:06:37.879 
they would be identical in feel so

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:40.350 
they would be identical in feel so
that's<00:06:38.879> important

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
that's important

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:50.179 
that's important

and a bit if anybody's interested is it
it's<00:06:54.099> called<00:06:54.490> a<00:06:54.669> compression<00:06:55.150> bit<00:06:55.569> or

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:55.930 
it's called a compression bit or

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.159 
it's called a compression bit or
compound<00:06:56.559> bit<00:06:56.789> the<00:06:57.789> bottom<00:06:58.120> half<00:06:58.300> inch<00:06:58.599> cuts

00:06:59.159 --> 00:06:59.169 
compound bit the bottom half inch cuts

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:03.540 
compound bit the bottom half inch cuts
up<00:06:59.379> and<00:07:00.689> the<00:07:01.689> the<00:07:02.110> top<00:07:02.409> part<00:07:02.979> portion<00:07:03.249> of<00:07:03.490> the

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:03.550 
up and the the top part portion of the

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.689 
up and the the top part portion of the
cutter<00:07:03.729> cuts<00:07:03.999> down<00:07:04.589> so<00:07:05.589> it<00:07:05.830> has<00:07:06.370> since<00:07:06.580> I'm

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:06.699 
cutter cuts down so it has since I'm

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:08.909 
cutter cuts down so it has since I'm
using<00:07:06.849> an<00:07:07.029> up<00:07:07.150> cut<00:07:07.360> bit<00:07:07.900> to<00:07:08.020> do<00:07:08.139> this<00:07:08.259> an<00:07:08.499> up<00:07:08.680> cut

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:08.919 
using an up cut bit to do this an up cut

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:10.469 
using an up cut bit to do this an up cut
you<00:07:09.189> can<00:07:09.309> just<00:07:09.460> use<00:07:09.580> a<00:07:09.610> straight<00:07:09.909> up<00:07:10.029> cut<00:07:10.240> this

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 
you can just use a straight up cut this

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:14.669 
you can just use a straight up cut this
bit<00:07:10.719> is<00:07:10.839> just<00:07:11.460> cuts<00:07:12.460> both<00:07:12.610> ways
