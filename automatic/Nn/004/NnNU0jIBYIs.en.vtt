00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:09.210
 hello everyone how's it going 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:13.650
 let's get right to the subject know what it is 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.890
 this and jet is the brain of the measure 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.900
 said pinto at rush hour is Maria 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.850
 of pains pco internet ip give a 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.100
 interview about your new book 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.619
 there is always a first time 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.449
 only that will go along way to have 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.119
 afternoon trained but things got worse 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.600
 when the writer decided to start 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.370
 talk about the country and I'll 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.680
 sad foundation when it comes to 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.390
 Portuguese and in operation 30 and 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.860
 deserves this type of manifestation 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.270
 Clear design, yes, a race. 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.010
 virtually all their point of view 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.440
 rest is sad and we were all in 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.910
 background people are desperate not 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.129
 able to live with these measures of 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.949
 Extreme austerity does not see a light 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.870
 end of the tunnel is the super normal and 70 is 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.949
 to manifest is not that the strike is what 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.609
 This makes it sad, it shows a lack of 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.549
 citizenship of people who are going to 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.350
 in trying to upset the work 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.549
 of those who now govern it 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.290
 country is ok, forget that I was talking 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.210
 with a sack gravel 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.220
 the daisy I'll explain slowly 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.680
 As you said, Wen. 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.750
 There is always a first time and this goes 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.170
 being your first time is realizing a 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.450
 logical reasoning is that those who tried 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.659
 govern this country and I 'm going 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.250
 try to upset the future that 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.180
 those who are trying now 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.680
 survive 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.020
 It's good that people do not have it. 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.150
 memory and realize that we do not 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.200
 We're here for home and it's not home. 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.720
 this government is responsible for the ultra 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.570
 due to economic shortage 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.580
 it's maybe in this same right, not most 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.440
 of people do not have short memory is this 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.090
 You have a good memory and this is going to be the 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.200
 your problem but to me this interview 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:00.440
 was forgotten has already expressed is 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.970
 while as a citizen my 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.460
 click and some pity that this happens 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.950
 daisy we also have leonisio 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.750
 Press while Portuguese you have 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.150
 born cars now much remains us 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.460
 little I do not know how to deal with this the best 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.590
 Way to one thing I think 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.540
 when there is a serious situation than 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.880
 which is important and the fifth people 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.220
 write the functions of lesser evil 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.400
 today this is very easy to say of the mouth 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.190
 out but now you already think ke 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.290
 his lesser evil concept case has already left 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.660
 always exist as you will also see 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.120
 also cut everyone stay say 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.430
 jensen on top of these notes and the more 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.580
 was sharp intelligence but we 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.709
 be strong and believe in the future do not know 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.480
 that the most serious cuts are in people 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.060
 who can not even afford the 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.970
 medicines make the little body 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.010
 it works and then do not take the 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.489
 medicines do that thing a lot 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.130
 boring that it's easy to be and look 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.140
 always a first time to do us 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.209
 it is difficult to get a second 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.150
 We all gain minds and we all have to 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.160
 learn to gain exact moment but who 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.510
 I said so can not learn to 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.400
 living with less because it's yours is not 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.440
 with this bench coaching attitude 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.690
 at the time it is a thing typically 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.670
 Portuguese and prohibits the route things 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.320
 Do not come and think now we have 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.870
 several rulers we will even trust 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:28.480
 I know the odds and I know not 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:35.000
 we can is because we already saw the shit 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:38.010
 gets a yell goal knows what the fuck is 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.349
 What are you trusting there? 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:46.690
 You know how it is in whom you trust 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:49.319
 it's in the shit know what eats who 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.360
 trust who is there 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.580
 Shit, I think I already noticed the 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.560
 reasoning and I think it's a lack of 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.790
 liability lack some 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.630
 sand in this case a lack of 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.900
 intelligence 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.420
 is this type of manifestation not 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.150
 we agree that before 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.590
 make a demonstration at your door 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.330
 when, although we do not live on 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.819
 Assembly of the Republic is ready 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.440
 better still everything is on the way and we 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.299
 we have to put pressure on the prisoners' case 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.669
 But I'll tell you more about Daisy. It was one more. 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.360
 that comes from everything that comes out of your mouth are 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:24.070
 of the agents as being shocked by the 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.750
 rates in most hospitals 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.340
 much more so that the rates 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.860
 in hospitals are machines 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.200
 very large health care needs 30 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.600
 since publication is this nobody thing 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.669
 use all crimes and some more 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.250
 in and not even participated is paying 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.810
 It is not public pay webb and even for 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.120
 content of laws beside flames 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.610
 taxes do not hear talk for example 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.130
 But there's no way it's worth a shout. 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.010
 It's really tiring and I still have to do it. 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:54.720
 A free course once again. 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.720
 The improvements are brief.
