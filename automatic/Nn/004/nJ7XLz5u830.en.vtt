00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520 

this<00:00:00.210> lesson<00:00:00.599> I<00:00:00.750> want<00:00:00.900> to<00:00:01.050> talk<00:00:01.230> to<00:00:01.350> you<00:00:01.439> about

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
this lesson I want to talk to you about

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.789 
this lesson I want to talk to you about
making<00:00:01.890> basic<00:00:02.550> skin<00:00:02.909> tones<00:00:03.240> I<00:00:04.080> have<00:00:04.500> an<00:00:04.620> image

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
making basic skin tones I have an image

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.680 
making basic skin tones I have an image
here<00:00:05.339> where<00:00:05.580> there<00:00:05.730> are<00:00:05.819> two<00:00:06.000> figures<00:00:06.420> in<00:00:06.540> it

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
here where there are two figures in it

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.440 
here where there are two figures in it
and<00:00:06.899> you<00:00:07.259> can<00:00:07.410> see<00:00:07.649> that<00:00:07.830> one<00:00:08.309> is<00:00:08.610> considerably

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
and you can see that one is considerably

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.440 
and you can see that one is considerably
darker<00:00:09.750> than<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.260> other<00:00:10.969> the<00:00:11.969> important

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
darker than the other the important

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.480 
darker than the other the important
thing<00:00:12.630> about<00:00:12.780> this<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.380> obviously<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:14.460> a

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
thing about this is obviously to a

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.039 
thing about this is obviously to a
certain<00:00:14.880> extent<00:00:15.330> he<00:00:15.540> would<00:00:15.719> have<00:00:15.839> probably

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
certain extent he would have probably

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.310 
certain extent he would have probably
had<00:00:16.440> darker<00:00:16.920> skin<00:00:17.190> tone<00:00:17.460> anyway<00:00:18.000> but<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.869> second

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
had darker skin tone anyway but a second

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.779 
had darker skin tone anyway but a second
element<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.770> she's<00:00:20.010> getting<00:00:20.160> an<00:00:20.369> awful<00:00:20.670> lot<00:00:20.760> of

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
element is she's getting an awful lot of

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.790 
element is she's getting an awful lot of
reflected<00:00:21.539> light<00:00:21.779> she's<00:00:22.080> nearer<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.590> light

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
reflected light she's nearer the light

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.429 
reflected light she's nearer the light
source<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.670> is<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.850> spot<00:00:24.210> light<00:00:24.449> on<00:00:24.480> stage<00:00:25.109> of

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
source this is a spot light on stage of

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.929 
source this is a spot light on stage of
two<00:00:25.650> ballet<00:00:26.130> dancers

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
two ballet dancers

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.269 
two ballet dancers
so<00:00:27.300> she's<00:00:27.570> nearer<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.560> center<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:29.160> the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
so she's nearer the center of the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.310 
so she's nearer the center of the
spotlight<00:00:29.789> getting<00:00:30.150> more<00:00:30.359> light<00:00:30.630> but<00:00:31.109> she's

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
spotlight getting more light but she's

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.560 
spotlight getting more light but she's
also<00:00:31.500> wearing<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.189> light-colored<00:00:32.430> top<00:00:33.120> so

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
also wearing a light-colored top so

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.709 
also wearing a light-colored top so
she's<00:00:33.780> getting<00:00:33.899> more<00:00:34.200> light<00:00:34.739> reflected<00:00:35.399> up

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
she's getting more light reflected up

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.270 
she's getting more light reflected up
but<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> approach<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.559> skintone<00:00:38.070> would

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
but the approach to the skintone would

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.639 
but the approach to the skintone would
be<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.610> same<00:00:38.879> even<00:00:39.149> though<00:00:39.629> one<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.469> lot

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
be the same even though one is a lot

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.350 
be the same even though one is a lot
darker<00:00:40.860> than<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.309> other<00:00:41.460> but<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:41.940> can<00:00:42.149> see

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
darker than the other but you can see

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.510 
darker than the other but you can see
what<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.690> does<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:43.110> put<00:00:43.290> all<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.559> focus<00:00:43.920> on<00:00:44.280> her

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
what it does is put all the focus on her

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.510 
what it does is put all the focus on her
and<00:00:44.789> he's<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> second<00:00:45.750> element<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.219> it

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
and he's a second element to it so it

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.729 
and he's a second element to it so it
was<00:00:48.059> enabling<00:00:48.570> me<00:00:48.719> by<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.960> just<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.410> change

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
was enabling me by the just the change

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.160 
was enabling me by the just the change
in<00:00:49.980> skin<00:00:50.280> tones<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.360> create<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.719> design

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
in skin tones and to create a design

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.990 
in skin tones and to create a design
within<00:00:52.440> my<00:00:52.710> picture<00:00:53.160> rather<00:00:53.520> than<00:00:53.789> giving

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
within my picture rather than giving

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.569 
within my picture rather than giving
them<00:00:54.149> equal<00:00:54.680> balance<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.100> you've<00:00:56.219> just<00:00:56.250> got

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
them equal balance so you've just got

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.680 
them equal balance so you've just got
two<00:00:56.789> heads<00:00:57.920> in<00:00:59.180> this<00:01:00.180> one<00:01:00.480> here<00:01:01.039> you<00:01:02.039> can<00:01:02.250> see

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
two heads in this one here you can see

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.690 
two heads in this one here you can see
with<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.840> skin<00:01:04.199> tone<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.920> all<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.430> skin

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
with this skin tone that all of the skin

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.050 
with this skin tone that all of the skin
tone<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.150> quite<00:01:06.450> light<00:01:07.040> it's<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.159> level<00:01:08.460> level

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
tone is quite light it's a level level

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.810 
tone is quite light it's a level level
to<00:01:09.299> -<00:01:09.630> maybe<00:01:09.869> level<00:01:10.380> three<00:01:10.740> very<00:01:11.340> very<00:01:11.430> light

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
to - maybe level three very very light

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.719 
to - maybe level three very very light
but<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.299> needs<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.600> be<00:01:12.689> very<00:01:13.020> warm<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.460> skin

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
but it needs to be very warm so the skin

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.789 
but it needs to be very warm so the skin
tone<00:01:15.030> here<00:01:15.450> has<00:01:15.689> just<00:01:15.720> changed<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.500> slightly

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
tone here has just changed to a slightly

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.719 
tone here has just changed to a slightly
warmer<00:01:18.080> Pinker<00:01:19.080> tone<00:01:19.920> because<00:01:20.220> we<00:01:20.340> don't<00:01:20.549> want

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
warmer Pinker tone because we don't want

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.280 
warmer Pinker tone because we don't want
to<00:01:20.880> feel<00:01:21.119> when<00:01:21.330> we're<00:01:21.479> looking<00:01:21.600> at<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.900> figure

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
to feel when we're looking at a figure

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.340 
to feel when we're looking at a figure
that's<00:01:22.439> nude<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.460> she's<00:01:23.700> cold<00:01:24.000> or<00:01:24.360> he's<00:01:24.750> cold

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
that's nude that she's cold or he's cold

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.340 
that's nude that she's cold or he's cold
so<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.040> warming<00:01:26.549> up<00:01:26.729> creates<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.509> brightness

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
so that warming up creates a brightness

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.399 
so that warming up creates a brightness
in<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.920> light<00:01:29.220> source<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:30.780> shadows<00:01:31.200> are

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
in the light source the shadows are

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.810 
in the light source the shadows are
lighter<00:01:31.619> because<00:01:32.159> that's<00:01:32.369> therefore

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
lighter because that's therefore

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.810 
lighter because that's therefore
creating<00:01:33.420> more<00:01:33.659> more<00:01:34.259> direct<00:01:35.070> light<00:01:35.340> or<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
creating more more direct light or the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.190 
creating more more direct light or the
impression<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.420> more<00:01:36.600> light<00:01:36.810> coming<00:01:37.079> through

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
impression of more light coming through

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.289 
impression of more light coming through
the<00:01:37.500> window<00:01:37.950> I'm<00:01:38.220> getting<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.790> bounce<00:01:39.030> back

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
the window I'm getting a bounce back

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.440 
the window I'm getting a bounce back
from<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.229> light<00:01:40.500> shiny<00:01:41.070> top<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.909> table<00:01:42.329> as

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
from the light shiny top of the table as

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.270 
from the light shiny top of the table as
well<00:01:42.630> which<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.810> reflecting<00:01:43.439> back<00:01:43.799> into<00:01:44.159> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
well which is reflecting back into the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.190 
well which is reflecting back into the
skin<00:01:44.549> tone<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.270> had<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.659> keep<00:01:45.780> all<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.049> that

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
skin tone so I had to keep all of that

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.130 
skin tone so I had to keep all of that
very<00:01:46.680> light<00:01:47.009> if<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.700> was<00:01:47.939> dark<00:01:48.240> down<00:01:48.630> here

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
very light if this was dark down here

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.649 
very light if this was dark down here
it<00:01:49.320> wouldn't<00:01:49.680> work<00:01:49.920> because<00:01:50.850> everything

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
it wouldn't work because everything

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.969 
it wouldn't work because everything
would<00:01:51.780> look<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.990> little<00:01:52.110> bit<00:01:52.380> dull<00:01:52.680> and

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
would look a little bit dull and

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.190 
would look a little bit dull and
miserable<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.420> all<00:01:54.630> about<00:01:54.990> the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
miserable and this is all about the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.289 
miserable and this is all about the
quality<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.920> light<00:01:56.130> but<00:01:56.850> more

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
quality of the light but more

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.660 
quality of the light but more
importantly<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.439> she<00:01:58.649> looks<00:01:58.890> warm<00:01:59.280> and

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
importantly that she looks warm and

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.310 
importantly that she looks warm and
healthy<00:02:01.490> in<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.670> figure<00:02:02.939> here<00:02:03.320> we're

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
healthy in this figure here we're

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.999 
healthy in this figure here we're
looking<00:02:04.710> more<00:02:05.960> at<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.049> darker<00:02:07.500> element<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:07.979> can

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
looking more at a darker element you can

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.770 
looking more at a darker element you can
see<00:02:08.250> it's<00:02:08.369> almost<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.879> same<00:02:09.090> setup<00:02:09.390> it's<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
see it's almost the same setup it's the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.660 
see it's almost the same setup it's the
same<00:02:10.020> table<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.160> same

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
same table and the same

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.480 
same table and the same
over<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.510> different<00:02:12.930> model<00:02:13.319> here<00:02:13.860> but<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.310> is

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
over a different model here but this is

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.820 
over a different model here but this is
more<00:02:14.730> about<00:02:14.880> creating<00:02:15.599> a<00:02:15.720> contrast<00:02:16.380> I've<00:02:16.650> gone

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
more about creating a contrast I've gone

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.570 
more about creating a contrast I've gone
down<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.459> a<00:02:17.489> much<00:02:17.819> lower<00:02:18.150> level<00:02:18.349> five<00:02:19.349> in<00:02:19.830> in

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
down to a much lower level five in in

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.270 
down to a much lower level five in in
tonal<00:02:21.150> element<00:02:21.599> and<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:22.349> skin<00:02:22.620> tone<00:02:22.650> is<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.069> lot

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
tonal element and the skin tone is a lot

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.750 
tonal element and the skin tone is a lot
darker<00:02:23.640> what<00:02:24.569> I<00:02:24.599> why<00:02:25.230> I've<00:02:25.440> done<00:02:25.709> that<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.370> to

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
darker what I why I've done that is to

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.580 
darker what I why I've done that is to
create<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.150> difference<00:02:27.720> between<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.319> skin

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
create a difference between the skin

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.110 
create a difference between the skin
tone<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.069> face<00:02:29.280> which<00:02:29.520> is<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.670> lot<00:02:29.880> warmer

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
tone of the face which is a lot warmer

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.120 
tone of the face which is a lot warmer
because<00:02:30.480> she's<00:02:30.810> getting<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.110> lot<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.290> reflected

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
because she's getting a lot of reflected

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.490 
because she's getting a lot of reflected
light<00:02:32.160> coming<00:02:32.850> up<00:02:33.000> from<00:02:33.510> her<00:02:33.690> leg<00:02:33.959> that<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.350> in

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
light coming up from her leg that is in

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.070 
light coming up from her leg that is in
full<00:02:34.770> full<00:02:35.280> sunlight<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.150> it's<00:02:36.569> enabled<00:02:37.050> me

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
full full sunlight and it's enabled me

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.050 
full full sunlight and it's enabled me
to<00:02:37.230> put<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.410> lot<00:02:37.590> of<00:02:37.680> light<00:02:37.920> in<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.610> foot<00:02:38.880> as

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
to put a lot of light in the foot as

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.360 
to put a lot of light in the foot as
well<00:02:39.300> so<00:02:40.019> that<00:02:40.230> has<00:02:40.380> created<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.980> design

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
well so that has created a design

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.240 
well so that has created a design
element<00:02:41.610> so<00:02:42.510> if<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.140> back<00:02:43.380> had<00:02:43.680> had<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.010> same

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
element so if the back had had the same

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.880 
element so if the back had had the same
amount<00:02:44.640> of<00:02:44.880> detail<00:02:45.690> in<00:02:46.050> terms<00:02:46.080> of<00:02:46.530> warm

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
amount of detail in terms of warm

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.059 
amount of detail in terms of warm
lighter<00:02:47.430> tone<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.269> there<00:02:49.050> would<00:02:49.200> be<00:02:49.230> an

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
lighter tone and there would be an

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.130 
lighter tone and there would be an
evenness<00:02:50.819> to<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.150> figure<00:02:51.510> but<00:02:51.840> what<00:02:51.989> I'm

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
evenness to the figure but what I'm

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.050 
evenness to the figure but what I'm
doing<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.530> within<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:53.100> figure<00:02:53.489> saying<00:02:53.850> no

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
doing is within the figure saying no

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.059 
doing is within the figure saying no
look<00:02:54.510> at<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.780> face<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:55.319> look<00:02:55.530> at<00:02:55.650> this<00:02:55.739> lovely

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
look at the face and look at this lovely

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.309 
look at the face and look at this lovely
little<00:02:56.430> foot<00:02:56.760> that's<00:02:57.330> nice<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:57.870> warm<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.230> got

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
little foot that's nice and warm and got

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.140 
little foot that's nice and warm and got
a<00:02:58.350> little<00:02:58.500> bit<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.680> orange<00:02:58.830> on<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.430> so<00:02:59.790> within

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
a little bit of orange on it so within

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.590 
a little bit of orange on it so within
the<00:03:00.450> figure<00:03:00.780> I've<00:03:00.930> created<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.830> sort<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.280> a

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
the figure I've created a sort of a

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.140 
the figure I've created a sort of a
contrapposto<00:03:03.600> if<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.470> like<00:03:04.739> an<00:03:05.430> alternation

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
contrapposto if you like an alternation

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.870 
contrapposto if you like an alternation
of<00:03:06.720> tone<00:03:07.049> so<00:03:07.680> it's<00:03:07.830> highly<00:03:08.040> important<00:03:08.700> that

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
of tone so it's highly important that

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.210 
of tone so it's highly important that
that<00:03:09.000> is<00:03:09.180> as<00:03:09.330> dark<00:03:09.690> as<00:03:10.140> some<00:03:10.440> elements<00:03:10.950> of<00:03:11.069> the

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
that is as dark as some elements of the

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.420 
that is as dark as some elements of the
darker<00:03:11.610> area<00:03:12.000> of<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.569> picture<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:14.220> within

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
darker area of the picture and within

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.789 
darker area of the picture and within
the<00:03:14.700> skin<00:03:14.970> tones<00:03:15.239> I'm<00:03:15.420> saying<00:03:15.690> this<00:03:16.170> isn't<00:03:16.560> so

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
the skin tones I'm saying this isn't so

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.920 
the skin tones I'm saying this isn't so
important<00:03:17.370> don't<00:03:17.670> look<00:03:17.850> at<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.030> but<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:18.900> course

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
important don't look at it but of course

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.560 
important don't look at it but of course
it<00:03:19.200> still<00:03:19.440> is<00:03:19.590> all<00:03:19.769> skin<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:21.950> in<00:03:22.950> this<00:03:23.130> figure

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
it still is all skin and in this figure

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.240 
it still is all skin and in this figure
where<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.720> figure<00:03:24.989> is<00:03:25.079> isolated<00:03:25.829> in<00:03:26.070> the

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
where the figure is isolated in the

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.580 
where the figure is isolated in the
studio<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.900> same<00:03:28.170> thing<00:03:28.440> has<00:03:28.560> happened

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
studio the same thing has happened

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.120 
studio the same thing has happened
really<00:03:29.310> we've<00:03:29.430> gone<00:03:29.579> even<00:03:30.120> darker<00:03:30.660> again<00:03:31.130> and

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
really we've gone even darker again and

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.479 
really we've gone even darker again and
down<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.609> a<00:03:32.640> level<00:03:32.880> five<00:03:33.570> maybe<00:03:34.079> in<00:03:34.859> skin<00:03:35.250> tone

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
down to a level five maybe in skin tone

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.650 
down to a level five maybe in skin tone
or<00:03:35.700> or<00:03:35.940> six<00:03:36.359> in<00:03:36.600> places<00:03:37.489> tonally<00:03:38.519> but<00:03:39.420> again

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
or or six in places tonally but again

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.330 
or or six in places tonally but again
I've<00:03:39.840> had<00:03:39.959> to<00:03:40.109> keep<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.410> figure<00:03:40.739> warm<00:03:41.010> because

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
I've had to keep the figure warm because

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.009 
I've had to keep the figure warm because
otherwise<00:03:41.790> she<00:03:42.120> would<00:03:42.269> look<00:03:42.420> as<00:03:42.540> if<00:03:42.690> she<00:03:42.720> was

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
otherwise she would look as if she was

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.270 
otherwise she would look as if she was
quite<00:03:43.370> cold<00:03:44.370> in<00:03:44.640> what<00:03:45.209> is<00:03:45.359> a<00:03:45.750> cool<00:03:46.280> environment

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
quite cold in what is a cool environment

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.530 
quite cold in what is a cool environment
for<00:03:47.579> the<00:03:48.680> studio<00:03:49.680> itself<00:03:50.190> but<00:03:50.790> she's<00:03:51.030> cocooned

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
for the studio itself but she's cocooned

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.349 
for the studio itself but she's cocooned
in<00:03:51.959> all<00:03:52.140> these<00:03:52.380> dark<00:03:52.739> areas<00:03:53.130> they've<00:03:53.970> all<00:03:54.180> been

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
in all these dark areas they've all been

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.170 
in all these dark areas they've all been
totally<00:03:54.870> considered<00:03:55.440> to<00:03:55.859> isolate<00:03:56.459> her<00:03:56.700> in<00:03:57.000> the

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
totally considered to isolate her in the

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.860 
totally considered to isolate her in the
sensor<00:03:57.630> as<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:57.750> standing<00:03:58.350> figure<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:59.760> then<00:04:00.000> the

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
sensor as a standing figure and then the

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.630 
sensor as a standing figure and then the
skin<00:04:01.140> tone<00:04:01.440> has<00:04:01.709> been<00:04:01.739> kept<00:04:02.130> quite<00:04:02.370> warm

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
skin tone has been kept quite warm

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.970 
skin tone has been kept quite warm
although<00:04:03.000> it's<00:04:03.209> dark<00:04:03.540> but<00:04:04.079> again<00:04:04.380> you<00:04:04.530> can<00:04:04.739> see

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
although it's dark but again you can see

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.000 
although it's dark but again you can see
that<00:04:05.220> it's<00:04:05.370> still<00:04:05.549> a<00:04:05.609> white<00:04:05.880> female<00:04:07.010> because

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
that it's still a white female because

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.680 
that it's still a white female because
obviously<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.760> areas<00:04:09.150> where<00:04:09.329> the<00:04:09.480> light<00:04:09.660> is

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
obviously the areas where the light is

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.140 
obviously the areas where the light is
breaking<00:04:10.170> through<00:04:10.889> that's<00:04:11.459> my<00:04:11.700> design

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
breaking through that's my design

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.180 
breaking through that's my design
element<00:04:12.600> within<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:13.079> figure<00:04:13.470> these<00:04:13.829> little

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
element within the figure these little

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.460 
element within the figure these little
highlights<00:04:14.700> are<00:04:14.970> really<00:04:15.359> making<00:04:15.569> a<00:04:15.840> detail<00:04:16.289> of

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
highlights are really making a detail of

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.120 
highlights are really making a detail of
two<00:04:17.039> licks<00:04:17.370> of<00:04:17.609> little<00:04:17.880> dark<00:04:18.450> tone<00:04:19.289> there<00:04:19.620> that

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
two licks of little dark tone there that

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.580 
two licks of little dark tone there that
is<00:04:20.250> completely<00:04:20.669> creating<00:04:21.330> the<00:04:21.479> hand<00:04:21.780> so<00:04:22.380> that

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
is completely creating the hand so that

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.670 
is completely creating the hand so that
contrasts<00:04:23.250> there

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
contrasts there

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.490 
contrasts there
a warm<00:04:24.430> light<00:04:24.880> is<00:04:25.360> telling<00:04:25.840> you<00:04:25.960> that<00:04:26.139> she<00:04:26.320> has

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
a warm light is telling you that she has

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.460 
a warm light is telling you that she has
she's<00:04:27.130> not<00:04:27.340> cold<00:04:27.870> but<00:04:28.870> giving<00:04:29.139> me<00:04:29.229> a<00:04:29.259> little

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
she's not cold but giving me a little

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.350 
she's not cold but giving me a little
bit<00:04:29.590> of<00:04:29.680> interest<00:04:30.039> as<00:04:30.280> well<00:04:30.490> I'm<00:04:31.030> just<00:04:31.180> going

where I'm going to mix a skin tone which

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.840 
where I'm going to mix a skin tone which
I'm<00:04:35.470> going<00:04:35.710> to<00:04:35.800> try<00:04:36.009> and<00:04:36.160> match<00:04:36.340> to<00:04:36.610> the<00:04:36.699> back

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
I'm going to try and match to the back

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.870 
I'm going to try and match to the back
of<00:04:37.030> my<00:04:37.180> hand<00:04:37.560> all<00:04:38.560> skin<00:04:38.949> tones<00:04:39.160> start<00:04:39.580> in<00:04:39.759> the

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.450 
control this wash as to how yellow it is
by<00:05:02.259> pulling<00:05:02.650> it<00:05:02.770> out<00:05:04.770> so<00:05:05.770> the<00:05:05.889> first<00:05:06.130> thing<00:05:06.310> I'm

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
by pulling it out so the first thing I'm

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.249 
by pulling it out so the first thing I'm
going<00:05:06.639> to<00:05:06.759> do<00:05:06.970> is<00:05:07.180> just<00:05:07.449> put<00:05:07.690> this<00:05:07.810> on<00:05:08.080> the

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:08.259 
going to do is just put this on the

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:12.029 
going to do is just put this on the
paper<00:05:08.740> and<00:05:10.050> you<00:05:11.050> can<00:05:11.169> see<00:05:11.380> that<00:05:11.560> that's<00:05:11.710> quite

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
paper and you can see that that's quite

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:14.670 
paper and you can see that that's quite
orange<00:05:12.520> but<00:05:13.180> my<00:05:13.300> skin<00:05:13.930> tone<00:05:14.169> wants<00:05:14.470> a<00:05:14.560> little

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
orange but my skin tone wants a little

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.100 
orange but my skin tone wants a little
bit<00:05:14.889> of<00:05:14.949> something<00:05:15.550> extra<00:05:15.639> but<00:05:16.630> you<00:05:16.720> can<00:05:16.900> see

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
bit of something extra but you can see

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.830 
bit of something extra but you can see
that<00:05:17.320> the<00:05:17.440> by<00:05:18.340> using<00:05:18.820> yellow<00:05:19.210> ochre<00:05:19.599> and<00:05:19.630> a<00:05:19.750> lot

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
that the by using yellow ochre and a lot

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.480 
that the by using yellow ochre and a lot
of<00:05:19.870> people<00:05:20.139> say<00:05:20.259> why<00:05:20.470> use<00:05:20.740> yellow<00:05:21.070> ochre

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
of people say why use yellow ochre

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.390 
of people say why use yellow ochre
rather<00:05:22.090> than<00:05:22.389> something<00:05:22.630> like<00:05:23.050> a<00:05:23.440> raw<00:05:23.860> sienna

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
rather than something like a raw sienna

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.520 
rather than something like a raw sienna
which<00:05:24.669> is<00:05:24.820> a<00:05:24.849> more<00:05:25.090> glowing<00:05:25.389> yellow<00:05:25.780> well<00:05:26.410> it's

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
which is a more glowing yellow well it's

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.950 
which is a more glowing yellow well it's
because<00:05:26.860> it's<00:05:27.009> a<00:05:27.160> granulating<00:05:28.060> heavy<00:05:28.360> pigment

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
because it's a granulating heavy pigment

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.450 
because it's a granulating heavy pigment
and<00:05:29.199> you<00:05:29.470> can<00:05:29.620> see<00:05:29.800> what<00:05:29.949> happens<00:05:30.310> I

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
and you can see what happens I

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.760 
and you can see what happens I
immediately<00:05:30.760> get<00:05:31.270> that<00:05:31.330> granulating<00:05:32.289> by

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
immediately get that granulating by

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.790 
immediately get that granulating by
mixing<00:05:33.010> it<00:05:33.310> with<00:05:33.400> a<00:05:33.460> fine<00:05:33.940> smooth<00:05:34.599> tint<00:05:35.229> which

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
mixing it with a fine smooth tint which

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.770 
mixing it with a fine smooth tint which
is<00:05:35.979> the<00:05:36.130> alizarin<00:05:36.400> crimson<00:05:36.849> and<00:05:37.300> the<00:05:37.599> two

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
is the alizarin crimson and the two

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.980 
is the alizarin crimson and the two
together<00:05:37.990> work<00:05:38.380> quite<00:05:38.650> well<00:05:39.150> so<00:05:40.150> now<00:05:40.360> it<00:05:40.780> needs

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
together work quite well so now it needs

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.510 
together work quite well so now it needs
a<00:05:41.169> little<00:05:41.320> bit<00:05:41.470> of<00:05:41.530> something<00:05:41.979> else<00:05:42.159> and<00:05:42.430> I'm
