understand there's two basic ways to rig
a<00:00:32.250> spear<00:00:32.730> gun<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.270> that's<00:00:34.140> where<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.680> shaft

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
a spear gun and that's where the shaft

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.819 
a spear gun and that's where the shaft
will<00:00:35.489> stay<00:00:35.760> attached<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> gun<00:00:37.020> when<00:00:37.649> you

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
will stay attached to the gun when you

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.850 
will stay attached to the gun when you
shoot<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.270> other<00:00:39.420> option<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.469> had

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
shoot the the other option that I had

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.150 
shoot the the other option that I had
available<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.610> me<00:00:41.840> was<00:00:42.840> for<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> shaft<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:44.010> be

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
available to me was for the shaft to be

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.400 
available to me was for the shaft to be
separated<00:00:44.910> from<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.239> gun<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:46.289> would

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
separated from the gun that it would

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.160 
separated from the gun that it would
come<00:00:46.620> completely<00:00:47.309> free<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.020> would

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
come completely free and that it would

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.250 
come completely free and that it would

where<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.190> shaft<00:00:56.460> flies<00:00:56.940> free<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.930> called<00:00:58.320> a

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
where the shaft flies free is called a

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.599 
where the shaft flies free is called a
riding<00:00:58.949> rig

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
riding rig

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.110 
riding rig
anyway<00:01:00.390> we<00:01:00.660> chose<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.230> riding<00:01:01.680> rig<00:01:02.120> for

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
anyway we chose the riding rig for

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.420 
anyway we chose the riding rig for
various<00:01:03.539> reasons<00:01:04.110> if<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.890> run<00:01:05.100> into<00:01:05.280> some

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
various reasons if you run into some

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.640 
various reasons if you run into some
safety<00:01:05.850> trouble<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.540> can<00:01:06.750> let<00:01:07.020> go<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.470> your

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
safety trouble you can let go of your

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.850 
safety trouble you can let go of your
shaft<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:09.299> fish<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.930> shaft<00:01:10.200> go<00:01:10.500> away

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
shaft and the fish and the shaft go away

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.359 
shaft and the fish and the shaft go away
but<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.790> gun<00:01:12.060> stays<00:01:12.570> with<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.350> okay<00:01:14.189> because

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
but the gun stays with you okay because

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.390 
but the gun stays with you okay because
the<00:01:14.760> gun<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.240> actually<00:01:15.509> attached<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:17.040> vest

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
the gun is actually attached to the vest

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.670 
the gun is actually attached to the vest
by<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.790> little<00:01:18.270> clip<00:01:18.570> mmm

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
by this little clip mmm

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.600 
by this little clip mmm
so<00:01:20.430> when<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.790> shaft<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.450> freed<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:22.400> can<00:01:23.400> let<00:01:23.580> go

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
so when the shaft is freed I can let go

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.440 
so when the shaft is freed I can let go
of<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.180> gun<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.530> can<00:01:25.740> work<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.369> fish<00:01:26.640> with

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
of the gun and I can work the fish with

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.350 
of the gun and I can work the fish with
this<00:01:27.659> handheld<00:01:28.140> rope<00:01:28.680> along<00:01:29.460> with<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.850> cable

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
this handheld rope along with the cable

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.230 
this handheld rope along with the cable
that<00:01:30.540> runs<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.110> shaft<00:01:31.579> okay<00:01:32.579> now<00:01:33.030> we're

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
that runs to the shaft okay now we're

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.960 
that runs to the shaft okay now we're
going<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.450> go<00:01:33.600> ahead<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.020> involve<00:01:34.350> Joey<00:01:34.970> Joey

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
to ask all right how far can this go

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.399 
to ask all right how far can this go
well

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
well

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.490 
well
that's<00:01:46.770> measured<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.399> wraps<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.960> cable

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
that's measured in wraps and the cable

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.380 
that's measured in wraps and the cable
that's<00:01:49.740> going<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.979> be<00:01:50.189> going<00:01:50.700> from<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.000> shaft

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
that's going to be going from the shaft

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.420 
that's going to be going from the shaft
to<00:01:52.200> my<00:01:52.380> hand<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:53.369> uh<00:01:53.540> mm<00:01:54.540> has<00:01:55.170> two<00:01:55.560> wraps<00:01:55.890> on<00:01:56.219> it

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
to my hand is uh mm has two wraps on it

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.600 
to my hand is uh mm has two wraps on it
okay<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.450> means<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.960> goes<00:01:58.170> from<00:01:59.040> one<00:01:59.219> end<00:01:59.250> of

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
okay that means it goes from one end of

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.850 
okay that means it goes from one end of
the<00:01:59.700> barrel<00:02:00.180> down<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.320> trigger<00:02:01.590> mechanism

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
the barrel down to the trigger mechanism

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.429 
the barrel down to the trigger mechanism
and<00:02:02.430> we<00:02:02.909> make<00:02:03.149> two<00:02:03.420> wraps<00:02:03.719> with<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.229> right

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
and we make two wraps with it right

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.219 
and we make two wraps with it right
round<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.979> round<00:02:05.070> twice<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:06.229> that's

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
round and round twice and that's

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.589 
round and round twice and that's
actually<00:02:07.560> on<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:08.429> particular<00:02:08.819> operation

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
actually on this particular operation

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.419 
actually on this particular operation
going<00:02:10.110> to

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
going to

we have this new satellite imagery
system<00:02:31.280> that's<00:02:31.459> available<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:32.209> us<00:02:32.239> and<00:02:32.629> it's

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
system that's available to us and it's

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.690 
system that's available to us and it's
going<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.379> show<00:02:33.439> us<00:02:33.769> where<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.099> blue<00:02:34.370> water

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
going to show us where the blue water

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.690 
going to show us where the blue water
develops<00:02:35.420> so<00:02:36.139> before<00:02:36.859> we<00:02:37.040> get<00:02:37.189> out<00:02:37.370> there<00:02:37.579> and

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
develops so before we get out there and

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.949 
develops so before we get out there and
have<00:02:37.819> to<00:02:37.969> look<00:02:38.150> around<00:02:38.480> we<00:02:38.629> should<00:02:38.659> have<00:02:38.930> a

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
have to look around we should have a

have to look around we should have a
pretty<00:02:39.200> good<00:02:39.349> idea<00:02:39.620> of<00:02:40.040> where<00:02:40.549> the<00:02:40.760> blue<00:02:40.969> water

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
pretty good idea of where the blue water

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:51.369 
pretty good idea of where the blue water
is<00:02:44.620> how<00:02:45.620> you<00:02:45.680> sit<00:02:46.040> those<00:02:46.250> things<00:02:49.299> i<00:02:50.299> Joe<00:02:51.169> is

use<00:04:08.959> in<00:04:09.349> the<00:04:10.099> gun<00:04:10.280> again<00:04:10.579> so<00:04:11.239> when<00:04:11.689> this<00:04:11.840> fish

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:12.199 
use in the gun again so when this fish

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:16.479 
use in the gun again so when this fish
is<00:04:12.500> speared<00:04:13.370> a<00:04:14.829> little<00:04:15.829> ring<00:04:16.009> is<00:04:16.250> going<00:04:16.430> to

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
is speared a little ring is going to

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.879 
is speared a little ring is going to
release<00:04:16.789> these<00:04:17.000> barbs<00:04:17.539> and<00:04:17.720> those<00:04:18.380> Barb's

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
release these barbs and those Barb's

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.349 
release these barbs and those Barb's
obviously<00:04:19.430> are<00:04:19.519> going<00:04:19.669> to<00:04:19.729> stop<00:04:19.940> the<00:04:20.150> fish

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
obviously are going to stop the fish

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:21.190 
obviously are going to stop the fish
from<00:04:20.539> coming<00:04:20.870> off

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
from coming off

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.490 
from coming off
but<00:04:21.770> as<00:04:21.980> the<00:04:22.280> fish<00:04:22.520> Wiggles<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.330> tip<00:04:24.170> is<00:04:24.350> going

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
but as the fish Wiggles the tip is going

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.490 
but as the fish Wiggles the tip is going
to<00:04:24.560> break<00:04:24.830> away<00:04:25.100> from<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.700> shaft<00:04:25.970> okay<00:04:26.960> and

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
to break away from the shaft okay and

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.860 
to break away from the shaft okay and
it's<00:04:27.770> going<00:04:27.920> to<00:04:27.980> come<00:04:28.190> to<00:04:28.340> a<00:04:28.370> stop<00:04:28.700> point<00:04:29.000> so

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
it's going to come to a stop point so

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.300 
it's going to come to a stop point so
now<00:04:30.050> your<00:04:30.290> fish<00:04:30.530> is<00:04:30.800> on<00:04:30.830> the<00:04:31.040> cable<00:04:32.320> and<00:04:33.320> it<00:04:34.100> can

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
now your fish is on the cable and it can

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.910 
now your fish is on the cable and it can
do<00:04:34.460> its<00:04:34.850> thrashing<00:04:35.480> about<00:04:35.680> until<00:04:36.680> he's

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
do its thrashing about until he's

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.340 
do its thrashing about until he's
finished<00:04:37.160> and<00:04:37.670> the<00:04:38.540> cable<00:04:38.900> is<00:04:38.960> going<00:04:39.020> to<00:04:39.140> take

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
finished and the cable is going to take

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.740 
finished and the cable is going to take
less<00:04:39.710> damage<00:04:39.740> while<00:04:40.490> the<00:04:40.670> fish<00:04:40.880> exhausts<00:04:41.570> his

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
less damage while the fish exhausts his

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:48.040 
less damage while the fish exhausts his
energy<00:04:44.260> any<00:04:45.260> other<00:04:45.530> question<00:04:45.980> is<00:04:46.100> Joey<00:04:47.050> what

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
energy any other question is Joey what

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.070 
energy any other question is Joey what
kind<00:04:48.230> of<00:04:48.290> fish<00:04:48.500> you<00:04:48.530> out<00:04:49.660> well<00:04:50.660> there's<00:04:50.900> some

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
kind of fish you out well there's some

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.410 
kind of fish you out well there's some
seasons<00:04:51.740> out<00:04:52.040> there<00:04:52.400> shooting<00:04:52.730> at<00:04:52.940> these<00:04:53.090> rigs

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
seasons out there shooting at these rigs

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.540 
seasons out there shooting at these rigs
in<00:04:53.600> the<00:04:53.630> Gulf<00:04:53.840> of<00:04:54.020> Mexico<00:04:54.100> there's<00:04:55.100> different

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
in the Gulf of Mexico there's different

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.450 
in the Gulf of Mexico there's different
seasons<00:04:56.030> for<00:04:56.270> these<00:04:56.390> fish<00:04:56.690> I<00:04:57.590> think<00:04:58.160> basically

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
seasons for these fish I think basically

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.250 
seasons for these fish I think basically
we're<00:04:59.000> going<00:04:59.120> to<00:04:59.210> be<00:04:59.360> looking<00:04:59.750> for<00:04:59.960> a<00:04:59.990> red

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
we're going to be looking for a red

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.940 
we're going to be looking for a red
snapper<00:05:00.500> a<00:05:01.810> Kobe<00:05:02.810> which<00:05:03.020> is<00:05:03.200> also<00:05:03.530> known<00:05:03.740> as<00:05:03.770> a

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
snapper a Kobe which is also known as a

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.330 
snapper a Kobe which is also known as a
lemon<00:05:04.670> fish<00:05:04.910> and<00:05:05.270> I<00:05:05.890> think<00:05:06.890> we're<00:05:07.040> going<00:05:07.130> to<00:05:07.190> be

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
lemon fish and I think we're going to be

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.000 
lemon fish and I think we're going to be
shooting<00:05:07.670> some<00:05:07.850> amberjack<00:05:08.540> that's<00:05:09.530> probably

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
shooting some amberjack that's probably

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.400 
shooting some amberjack that's probably
the<00:05:10.250> three<00:05:10.520> targets<00:05:10.820> that<00:05:11.300> are<00:05:11.720> most<00:05:11.900> common

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
the three targets that are most common

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.160 
the three targets that are most common
with<00:05:12.950> with<00:05:13.820> the<00:05:13.940> guys<00:05:14.120> on<00:05:14.420> the<00:05:14.510> boat<00:05:14.660> I<00:05:14.870> think

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
with with the guys on the boat I think

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.300 
with with the guys on the boat I think
every<00:05:15.470> now<00:05:15.590> and<00:05:15.800> then<00:05:15.860> they'll<00:05:16.070> take<00:05:16.280> a

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
every now and then they'll take a

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.790 
every now and then they'll take a
Barracuda<00:05:17.090> as<00:05:17.240> well<00:05:20.140> there's<00:05:21.140> a<00:05:21.260> chance<00:05:21.560> to

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
Barracuda as well there's a chance to

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.440 
Barracuda as well there's a chance to
shoot<00:05:21.950> some<00:05:22.220> trigger<00:05:22.490> fish<00:05:22.820> if<00:05:23.090> they're<00:05:23.240> big

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
shoot some trigger fish if they're big

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.120 
shoot some trigger fish if they're big
enough<00:05:23.480> again<00:05:24.350> a<00:05:24.380> lot<00:05:24.620> of<00:05:24.770> that's<00:05:24.920> going<00:05:25.070> to

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
enough again a lot of that's going to

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.650 
enough again a lot of that's going to
depend<00:05:25.310> on<00:05:25.700> the<00:05:25.880> time<00:05:26.090> of<00:05:26.120> the<00:05:26.330> year<00:05:26.360> that

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
depend on the time of the year that

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.210 
depend on the time of the year that
we're<00:05:26.810> actually<00:05:27.020> out<00:05:27.440> there<00:05:27.710> and<00:05:27.920> there's

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
we're actually out there and there's

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.820 
we're actually out there and there's
also<00:05:28.430> some<00:05:29.180> restraints<00:05:29.840> on<00:05:29.990> how<00:05:30.170> big<00:05:30.410> the<00:05:30.440> fish

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
also some restraints on how big the fish

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.270 
also some restraints on how big the fish
need<00:05:31.070> to<00:05:31.220> be<00:05:31.340> before<00:05:31.520> you<00:05:31.700> take<00:05:32.030> them<00:05:33.280> any

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
need to be before you take them any

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.550 
need to be before you take them any
other<00:05:34.400> questions<00:05:35.030> what<00:05:35.990> other<00:05:36.140> kind<00:05:36.440> of
