from<00:00:17.850> what<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.060> know<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.480> auto<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.810> be<00:00:18.990> in<00:00:19.109> 1.6

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
from what I know the auto to be in 1.6

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.830 
from what I know the auto to be in 1.6
to<00:00:20.369> start<00:00:20.640> your<00:00:20.880> running<00:00:21.210> speed<00:00:21.330> with<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.720> gun

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
to start your running speed with the gun

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.250 
to start your running speed with the gun
is<00:00:22.250> 215<00:00:23.250> units<00:00:23.670> per<00:00:23.820> second<00:00:24.210> opposed<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.750> 1.6

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
is 215 units per second opposed to 1.6

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.259 
is 215 units per second opposed to 1.6
to<00:00:25.439> speed<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.830> 210<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.760> it's<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.939> little<00:00:27.180> bit

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
to speed of 210 so it's a little bit

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.640 
to speed of 210 so it's a little bit
lighter<00:00:27.480> something<00:00:28.170> that's<00:00:28.349> remained

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
lighter something that's remained

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.620 
lighter something that's remained
consistent<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.490> it's<00:00:29.820> extremely

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
consistent is that it's extremely

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.749 
consistent is that it's extremely
accurate<00:00:30.660> both<00:00:31.349> zoomed<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.099> out<00:00:32.309> so

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
accurate both zoomed in and out so

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.459 
accurate both zoomed in and out so
standing<00:00:33.210> still<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.690> no<00:00:33.840> scoping<00:00:34.320> is

standing still and no scoping is

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:53.069 
standing still and no scoping is
definitely<00:00:35.190> still<00:00:35.550> an<00:00:35.700> option<00:00:35.850> for<00:00:36.210> attacking

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
one of the big characteristics to the
