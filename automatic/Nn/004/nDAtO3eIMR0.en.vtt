um so yeah it's just we I look on
youtube<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:48.120> i<00:00:48.480> wanted<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.989> do<00:00:49.170> full<00:00:49.890> locks

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
youtube and i wanted to do full locks

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.520 
youtube and i wanted to do full locks
and<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.879> was<00:00:51.090> an<00:00:51.210> option<00:00:51.390> for<00:00:51.690> me<00:00:52.050> but<00:00:52.289> then

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
and that was an option for me but then

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.340 
and that was an option for me but then
the<00:00:53.280> person<00:00:53.789> who<00:00:53.940> i<00:00:54.000> wanted<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.600> do<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:55.020> said

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
the person who i wanted to do it said

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.389 
the person who i wanted to do it said
that<00:00:55.620> it's<00:00:55.920> very<00:00:56.520> costly<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.660> that's<00:00:57.899> another

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
that it's very costly and that's another

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.549 
that it's very costly and that's another
reason<00:00:59.399> why<00:00:59.640> I<00:01:00.180> didn't<00:01:00.629> go<00:01:00.690> with<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.230> one

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
reason why I didn't go with that and one

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.219 
reason why I didn't go with that and one
with<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:01.920> method<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.520> because<00:01:03.049> the<00:01:04.049> other

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
with this method is because the other

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.830 
with this method is because the other
phone<00:01:04.920> locks<00:01:05.159> are<00:01:05.430> time<00:01:05.670> consuming<00:01:06.210> using

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
phone locks are time consuming using

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.260 
phone locks are time consuming using
trustee<00:01:07.530> meeting<00:01:08.010> for<00:01:08.310> everything<00:01:08.880> like

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
trustee meeting for everything like

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.090 
trustee meeting for everything like
Wikipedia<00:01:10.229> or<00:01:10.380> something<00:01:10.860> i<00:01:11.119> discovered<00:01:12.119> the

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100
