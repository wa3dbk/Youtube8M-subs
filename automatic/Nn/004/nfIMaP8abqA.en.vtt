Maria<00:00:27.500> who<00:00:27.800> brought<00:00:28.100> us<00:00:28.250> a<00:00:28.400> previous<00:00:28.910> lunar

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
Maria who brought us a previous lunar

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.570 
Maria who brought us a previous lunar
wave<00:00:29.510> has<00:00:30.110> again<00:00:30.500> reported<00:00:31.100> shooting<00:00:31.310> the

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
wave has again reported shooting the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.819 
wave has again reported shooting the
13th<00:00:32.090> lunar<00:00:32.509> wave<00:00:32.689> that<00:00:32.960> we<00:00:33.079> know<00:00:33.230> about<00:00:33.410> and

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
13th lunar wave that we know about and

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.069 
13th lunar wave that we know about and
again<00:00:34.280> it<00:00:34.640> was<00:00:34.789> right<00:00:35.149> before<00:00:35.480> the<00:00:35.839> full<00:00:36.050> moon

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
again it was right before the full moon

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.220 
again it was right before the full moon
and<00:00:36.649> here's<00:00:37.219> the<00:00:37.399> footage<00:00:37.640> I<00:00:37.999> had<00:00:38.989> to<00:00:39.109> do<00:00:39.199> a

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
and here's the footage I had to do a

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.919 
and here's the footage I had to do a
screen<00:00:39.589> capture<00:00:39.620> on<00:00:40.160> this<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:41.210> file<00:00:41.449> that<00:00:41.809> he

00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:41.929 
screen capture on this the file that he

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:43.569 
screen capture on this the file that he
sent<00:00:42.199> me<00:00:42.350> just<00:00:42.559> did<00:00:42.829> not<00:00:42.980> want<00:00:43.280> to<00:00:43.399> drive

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
sent me just did not want to drive

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.310 
sent me just did not want to drive
there's<00:00:43.999> the<00:00:44.149> second<00:00:44.510> wave<00:00:44.629> coming<00:00:45.019> up<00:00:45.140> and

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
there's the second wave coming up and

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.979 
there's the second wave coming up and
I'll<00:00:45.379> do<00:00:45.559> a<00:00:45.589> zoom<00:00:45.890> on<00:00:46.100> this<00:00:46.659> you<00:00:47.659> should<00:00:47.839> head

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
I'll do a zoom on this you should head

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.979 
I'll do a zoom on this you should head
over<00:00:48.199> to<00:00:48.319> Richard<00:00:48.620> 205<00:00:49.159> Maria<00:00:49.550> to<00:00:49.730> see<00:00:49.909> a

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
over to Richard 205 Maria to see a

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.599 
over to Richard 205 Maria to see a
little<00:00:50.989> bit<00:00:51.109> better<00:00:51.260> quality<00:00:51.499> on<00:00:52.039> this<00:00:52.370> wave

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
little bit better quality on this wave

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.469 
little bit better quality on this wave
and<00:00:53.229> here<00:00:54.229> it'll<00:00:54.350> come<00:00:54.530> at<00:00:54.679> the<00:00:54.800> bottom

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:55.479 
and here it'll come at the bottom

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:58.840 
and here it'll come at the bottom
there's<00:00:56.479> the<00:00:56.600> first<00:00:56.870> wave<00:00:57.229> and<00:00:57.609> there's<00:00:58.609> the

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
there's the first wave and there's the

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.369 
there's the first wave and there's the
second<00:00:59.269> and<00:00:59.420> for<00:00:59.659> those<00:00:59.780> that<00:01:00.019> have<00:01:00.140> followed

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
second and for those that have followed

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.139 
second and for those that have followed
you<00:01:00.920> know<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:01.129> prediction<00:01:01.519> has<00:01:01.579> always<00:01:01.789> been

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
you know the prediction has always been

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.719 
you know the prediction has always been
near<00:01:02.600> or<00:01:02.780> right<00:01:03.199> out<00:01:03.229> a<00:01:03.409> full<00:01:03.710> moon<00:01:03.949> certainly

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
near or right out a full moon certainly

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.940 
near or right out a full moon certainly
in<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:04.940> third<00:01:05.120> phase<00:01:05.420> all<00:01:06.229> right<00:01:06.440> coming<00:01:06.829> in

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
in the third phase all right coming in

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.440 
in the third phase all right coming in
at<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.159> right<00:01:07.340> here<00:01:07.640> is<00:01:07.850> a<00:01:07.880> full<00:01:08.180> spectrum

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
at the right here is a full spectrum

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.410 
at the right here is a full spectrum
object<00:01:09.200> we<00:01:09.350> filmed<00:01:09.829> and<00:01:10.100> what<00:01:10.820> we're<00:01:10.969> doing<00:01:11.000> is

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
object we filmed and what we're doing is

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.200 
object we filmed and what we're doing is
dialing<00:01:11.899> in<00:01:12.079> our<00:01:12.229> ability<00:01:12.680> to<00:01:12.710> use<00:01:12.979> auto<00:01:13.460> ISO

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
dialing in our ability to use auto ISO

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.690 
dialing in our ability to use auto ISO
to<00:01:14.869> light<00:01:15.079> up<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.380> sky<00:01:15.619> beyond<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:16.219> moon<00:01:16.430> and

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
to light up the sky beyond the moon and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.940 
to light up the sky beyond the moon and
track<00:01:16.909> an<00:01:17.060> object<00:01:17.450> as<00:01:17.570> we're<00:01:17.719> doing<00:01:17.960> here<00:01:18.320> the

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
track an object as we're doing here the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.889 
track an object as we're doing here the
main<00:01:19.130> problem<00:01:19.549> right<00:01:19.759> now<00:01:19.789> is<00:01:20.360> using<00:01:20.810> the

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
main problem right now is using the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.649 
main problem right now is using the
telescope<00:01:21.229> to<00:01:22.039> move<00:01:22.280> like<00:01:22.670> right<00:01:22.880> now<00:01:23.060> that<00:01:23.090> is

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
telescope to move like right now that is

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.080 
telescope to move like right now that is
telescope<00:01:24.380> movement<00:01:24.860> this<00:01:25.100> object<00:01:25.310> went<00:01:25.820> in<00:01:26.000> a

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
telescope movement this object went in a

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.179 
telescope movement this object went in a
perfectly<00:01:26.539> straight<00:01:26.840> line<00:01:26.869> so<00:01:27.829> we're<00:01:28.009> trying

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
perfectly straight line so we're trying

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.520 
perfectly straight line so we're trying
to<00:01:28.369> figure<00:01:28.640> out<00:01:28.670> how<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.149> do<00:01:29.509> the<00:01:29.659> Edit<00:01:30.079> you

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
to figure out how to do the Edit you

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.590 
to figure out how to do the Edit you
know<00:01:30.649> in<00:01:30.860> it<00:01:31.009> in<00:01:31.189> a<00:01:31.310> better<00:01:31.670> way<00:01:31.880> than<00:01:31.909> this<00:01:32.240> is

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
know in it in a better way than this is

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.459 
know in it in a better way than this is
to<00:01:33.560> deal<00:01:33.799> with<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.399> double<00:01:35.210> access<00:01:35.750> pan<00:01:36.140> of

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469 
to deal with the double access pan of

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:39.219 
to deal with the double access pan of
the<00:01:37.219> telescope<00:01:37.820> when<00:01:38.180> an<00:01:38.329> object's<00:01:38.780> traveling

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
the telescope when an object's traveling

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.740 
the telescope when an object's traveling
diagonally<00:01:39.829> like<00:01:40.009> this<00:01:40.070> I<00:01:40.549> think<00:01:41.299> what<00:01:41.450> we<00:01:41.570> may

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
diagonally like this I think what we may

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.899 
diagonally like this I think what we may
do<00:01:41.810> is<00:01:42.229> do<00:01:42.409> very<00:01:42.649> quick<00:01:42.920> pans<00:01:43.250> and<00:01:43.579> then<00:01:43.700> I'll

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
do is do very quick pans and then I'll

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.569 
do is do very quick pans and then I'll
edit<00:01:44.119> out<00:01:44.509> the<00:01:44.960> telescope<00:01:45.770> movement<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:46.399> just

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
edit out the telescope movement and just

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.880 
edit out the telescope movement and just
leave<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:47.119> object<00:01:47.570> in<00:01:47.750> or<00:01:48.469> something<00:01:48.740> like

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
leave the object in or something like

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.380 
leave the object in or something like
that<00:01:49.039> anyhow<00:01:49.549> we're<00:01:49.700> working<00:01:50.000> it<00:01:50.060> out<00:01:50.119> all

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
that anyhow we're working it out all

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.349 
that anyhow we're working it out all
that<00:01:50.719> black<00:01:50.990> junk<00:01:51.439> is<00:01:51.619> stuff<00:01:52.549> on<00:01:52.729> my<00:01:52.909> sensor

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
that black junk is stuff on my sensor

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:55.359 
that black junk is stuff on my sensor
and<00:01:53.659> I<00:01:53.750> finally<00:01:54.020> have<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.409> tools<00:01:54.859> to<00:01:55.159> deal

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
and I finally have the tools to deal

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.789 
and I finally have the tools to deal
with<00:01:55.399> this<00:01:55.759> with<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.179> full<00:01:56.359> full<00:01:57.350> spectrum

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
with this with the full full spectrum

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.760 
with this with the full full spectrum
camera<00:01:58.009> so<00:01:58.909> next<00:01:59.210> time<00:01:59.450> I<00:01:59.780> shoot<00:02:00.079> I<00:02:00.320> will<00:02:00.590> not

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
camera so next time I shoot I will not

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.069 
camera so next time I shoot I will not
have<00:02:00.950> junk<00:02:01.280> all<00:02:01.460> my<00:02:01.609> sensor<00:02:01.999> it's<00:02:02.780> a<00:02:02.869> little

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
have junk all my sensor it's a little

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.599 
have junk all my sensor it's a little
bit<00:02:03.200> different<00:02:03.439> dealing<00:02:03.890> with<00:02:04.159> this<00:02:04.310> camera

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.609 
bit different dealing with this camera

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:06.580 
bit different dealing with this camera
coming<00:02:05.240> in<00:02:05.420> at<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:05.630> right<00:02:05.810> without<00:02:05.960> a<00:02:06.140> circle
