anticipating questions with things like
Google<00:00:26.130> now<00:00:26.400> but<00:00:27.390> it's<00:00:27.539> also<00:00:27.720> safe<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.080> assume

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
Google now but it's also safe to assume

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.410 
Google now but it's also safe to assume
that<00:00:28.560> we<00:00:28.650> continue<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.130> work<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:29.429> core<00:00:29.910> search

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420

quality<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.439> my<00:00:32.189> tip<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.910> check<00:00:33.090> out

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
quality so my tip is just to check out

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.299 
quality so my tip is just to check out
google's<00:00:34.079> webmaster<00:00:34.260> videos<00:00:34.559> if<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.130> search

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
google's webmaster videos if you search

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.370 
google's webmaster videos if you search
for<00:00:35.340> webmaster<00:00:35.969> videos<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.809> have<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> channel

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
for webmaster videos we have a channel

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.990 
for webmaster videos we have a channel
that's<00:00:37.410> gotten<00:00:37.920> something<00:00:38.100> like<00:00:38.309> 12<00:00:38.610> million

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
that's gotten something like 12 million

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.869 
that's gotten something like 12 million
views<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:40.020> recently<00:00:40.860> for<00:00:41.070> example<00:00:41.460> we<00:00:41.579> put<00:00:41.790> out

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
views so recently for example we put out

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.299 
views so recently for example we put out
a<00:00:41.910> video<00:00:42.090> about<00:00:42.420> what<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.020> expect<00:00:43.050> for<00:00:43.860> SEOs

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
a video about what to expect for SEOs

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.490 
a video about what to expect for SEOs
and<00:00:44.730> web<00:00:45.300> developers<00:00:45.870> over<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.320> coming

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
and web developers over the coming

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.080 
and web developers over the coming
summer<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.430> actually<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.969> be<00:00:48.059> a

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
summer and it's actually going to be a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.639 
summer and it's actually going to be a
pretty<00:00:48.390> busy<00:00:48.870> summer<00:00:49.110> it'll<00:00:49.320> be<00:00:49.440> pretty

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
pretty busy summer it'll be pretty

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.490 
pretty busy summer it'll be pretty
eventful<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.399> for<00:00:50.670> example<00:00:51.110> the<00:00:52.110> rest<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
eventful so for example the rest of the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.110 
eventful so for example the rest of the
world<00:00:52.649> doesn't<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.460> know<00:00:53.489> pay<00:00:53.940> much

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
world doesn't you know pay much

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.510 
world doesn't you know pay much
attention<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.719> stuff<00:00:54.780> but<00:00:55.260> if<00:00:55.500> you're<00:00:55.920> an

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
attention to this stuff but if you're an

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.049 
attention to this stuff but if you're an
SEO<00:00:56.969> search<00:00:57.930> engine<00:00:58.050> optimizer<00:00:58.730> we've<00:00:59.730> got<00:00:59.910> an

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
SEO search engine optimizer we've got an

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.610 
SEO search engine optimizer we've got an
algorithm<00:01:00.510> called<00:01:00.539> penguin<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.379> we're

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
algorithm called penguin and we're

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.319 
algorithm called penguin and we're
releasing<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.250> next<00:01:02.520> generation<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.090> pink

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
releasing the next generation of pink

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.320 
releasing the next generation of pink
one<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.719> next<00:01:04.110> few<00:01:04.320> hours<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:05.280> after<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:06.060> get

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
one in the next few hours so after I get

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.760 
one in the next few hours so after I get
off<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.630> program<00:01:07.080> we're<00:01:07.260> going<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.439> go<00:01:07.560> back

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
off this program we're going to go back

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.590 
off this program we're going to go back
and<00:01:07.799> we'll<00:01:08.490> start<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.820> press<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.150> red<00:01:09.270> button

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
and we'll start to press the red button

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.690 
and we'll start to press the red button
and<00:01:09.689> it's<00:01:10.590> going<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.799> have<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> pretty<00:01:11.400> big

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
and it's going to have a pretty big

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.600 
and it's going to have a pretty big
impact<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.390> web<00:01:12.630> spam<00:01:12.930> for<00:01:13.290> example<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.159> if<00:01:14.490> you

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
impact on web spam for example so if you

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.310 
impact on web spam for example so if you
want<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.850> keep<00:01:15.000> up<00:01:15.210> on<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.390> latest<00:01:15.540> updates

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
want to keep up on the latest updates

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.320 
want to keep up on the latest updates
you<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.680> search<00:01:16.979> for<00:01:17.250> webmaster<00:01:17.820> blog<00:01:18.030> or

iteration<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:31.170> penguin<00:01:31.530> would<00:01:31.939> essentially

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
iteration of penguin would essentially

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.999 
iteration of penguin would essentially
only<00:01:33.180> look<00:01:33.479> at<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.689> homepage<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.500> site<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
only look at the homepage of a site the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.800 
only look at the homepage of a site the
the<00:01:35.400> newer<00:01:35.610> generation<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.329> pink<00:01:36.509> one<00:01:36.630> goes

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
the newer generation of pink one goes

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.170 
the newer generation of pink one goes
much<00:01:37.049> deeper<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.650> has<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> really<00:01:38.490> big<00:01:38.610> impact

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
much deeper it has a really big impact

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.530 
much deeper it has a really big impact
in<00:01:39.780> certain<00:01:40.740> small<00:01:41.100> areas<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.210> think

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
in certain small areas so I think

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.999 
in certain small areas so I think
something<00:01:42.960> like<00:01:43.049> two-point-three<00:01:43.979> percent

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
something like two-point-three percent

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.399 
something like two-point-three percent
of<00:01:44.579> English<00:01:45.090> queries<00:01:45.540> will<00:01:45.720> be<00:01:45.810> affected<00:01:46.259> to

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
of English queries will be affected to

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.870 
of English queries will be affected to
the<00:01:46.530> degree<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:47.009> regular<00:01:47.399> user<00:01:47.579> might

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
the degree that a regular user might

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.760
