00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
hello Co Dismas here this is just a

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.809 
hello Co Dismas here this is just a
quick<00:00:03.270> video<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.659> show<00:00:03.870> how<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.560> change<00:00:04.859> the

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
quick video to show how to change the

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.129 
quick video to show how to change the
command<00:00:06.750> that<00:00:07.379> my<00:00:08.099> plugins<00:00:08.790> use<00:00:09.240> in<00:00:09.599> game<00:00:09.960> so

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
command that my plugins use in game so

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.029 
command that my plugins use in game so
plugins<00:00:13.139> like<00:00:13.380> chunk<00:00:13.740> ohm<00:00:14.929> it<00:00:15.929> chunk<00:00:16.500> own<00:00:16.650> uses

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
plugins like chunk ohm it chunk own uses

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.290 
plugins like chunk ohm it chunk own uses
the<00:00:17.600> command<00:00:18.600> slash<00:00:19.170> chunk<00:00:19.890> but<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.880> know<00:00:20.970> there

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
the command slash chunk but I know there

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.970 
the command slash chunk but I know there
is<00:00:21.390> at<00:00:21.510> least<00:00:21.689> one<00:00:22.080> other<00:00:22.230> plugin<00:00:22.680> out<00:00:22.769> there

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
is at least one other plugin out there

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.040 
is at least one other plugin out there
that<00:00:23.189> does<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.490> same<00:00:23.519> thing<00:00:23.699> so<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:24.779> causes

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
that does the same thing so this causes

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.330 
that does the same thing so this causes
problems<00:00:25.410> because<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:27.470> can't<00:00:28.470> obviously<00:00:28.769> use

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
problems because you can't obviously use

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.209 
problems because you can't obviously use
the<00:00:29.609> same<00:00:29.820> command<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:30.740> two<00:00:31.740> plug-ins<00:00:32.009> that

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
the same command for two plug-ins that

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.610 
the same command for two plug-ins that
are<00:00:32.340> installed<00:00:32.430> at<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:32.969> same<00:00:33.120> time<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:34.050> this

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
are installed at the same time so this

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.340 
are installed at the same time so this
is<00:00:34.940> what<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.030> have<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.300> do<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.630> change<00:00:36.989> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
is what you have to do to change the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.850 
is what you have to do to change the
command<00:00:38.180> for<00:00:39.180> any<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.680> my<00:00:40.710> plugins<00:00:41.600> basically

conflicts<00:01:07.380> with<00:01:07.409> something<00:01:07.799> else<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.130> you

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
conflicts with something else but you

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.960 
conflicts with something else but you
just<00:01:08.549> find<00:01:09.619> whatever<00:01:10.619> whatever<00:01:11.520> works<00:01:11.850> best

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
just find whatever whatever works best

and<00:01:23.810> that's<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.080> now<00:01:25.320> instead<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.250> type<00:01:26.490> bean

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
and that's it now instead of type bean

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.819 
and that's it now instead of type bean
slash<00:01:27.540> chunk<00:01:27.990> you'll<00:01:28.229> type<00:01:28.670> slash<00:01:29.670> Co<00:01:30.829> now

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
slash chunk you'll type slash Co now

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.749 
slash chunk you'll type slash Co now
this<00:01:32.040> works<00:01:32.310> with<00:01:32.579> all<00:01:33.090> my<00:01:33.659> plugins<00:01:34.759> it

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
this works with all my plugins it

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.030 
this works with all my plugins it
however<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.540> something<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.380> added<00:01:37.710> into<00:01:37.920> my

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
however is something I added into my

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.429 
however is something I added into my
plugins<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:38.640> don't<00:01:38.880> try<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.270> with<00:01:39.659> someone

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
plugins so don't try it with someone

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.289 
plugins so don't try it with someone
else's<00:01:40.799> plug-in<00:01:41.220> because<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.970> most<00:01:42.210> likely

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
else's plug-in because it most likely

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.990 
else's plug-in because it most likely
won't<00:01:42.750> work<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.259> if<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.340> download<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.790> new

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
won't work and if you download a new

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.580 
won't work and if you download a new
version<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.509> my<00:01:45.600> plug-in<00:01:45.869> you'll<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.409> to

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
version on my plug-in you'll have to

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.380 
version on my plug-in you'll have to
redo<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.130> but<00:01:48.060> it's<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.960> simple<00:01:49.259> that

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
redo it but it's just that simple that

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.760 
redo it but it's just that simple that
you<00:01:51.390> can<00:01:51.570> change<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.110> whatever<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.470> want

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
you can change it to whatever you want

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.690 
you can change it to whatever you want
also<00:01:53.430> if<00:01:53.640> for<00:01:54.119> some<00:01:54.149> reason<00:01:54.829> you<00:01:55.829> can't<00:01:56.130> find

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
also if for some reason you can't find

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.090 
also if for some reason you can't find
your<00:01:59.719> you<00:02:00.719> can't<00:02:00.930> find<00:02:01.110> your<00:02:01.259> program<00:02:01.439> here<00:02:01.950> in

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
your you can't find your program here in

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.340 
your you can't find your program here in
the<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:03.180> program<00:02:03.390> list<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.200> can<00:02:04.320> also

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
the in the program list you can also

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.440 
the in the program list you can also
just<00:02:04.890> change<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:06.860> from<00:02:07.860> dot<00:02:08.160> jar<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.879> dot<00:02:09.060> zip

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
just change this from dot jar to dot zip

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.650 
just change this from dot jar to dot zip
it<00:02:10.080> will<00:02:10.200> ask<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.530> are<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.739> sure<00:02:11.330> yes<00:02:12.330> and

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
then from that you just

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.010 
then from that you just
double-click<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.400> open<00:02:14.520> it<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.060> open<00:02:15.360> the

same thing so that's it I'm going to

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.520 
same thing so that's it I'm going to
change<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.180> back<00:02:21.270> for<00:02:21.510> now<00:02:21.600> but<00:02:21.840> that's<00:02:22.080> all
