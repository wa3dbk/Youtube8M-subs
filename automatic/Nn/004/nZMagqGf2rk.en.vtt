articulation quickly so we have the arms

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.490 
articulation quickly so we have the arms
with<00:00:30.179> sally<00:00:30.750> has<00:00:30.990> no<00:00:31.199> swivel<00:00:31.769> in<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:34.050> biceps

with sally has no swivel in the biceps

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.350 
with sally has no swivel in the biceps
but<00:00:34.829> his<00:00:35.190> head<00:00:35.460> moves<00:00:37.100> yes<00:00:38.100> almost<00:00:38.489> kind<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.239> a

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
but his head moves yes almost kind of a

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.209 
but his head moves yes almost kind of a
torso<00:00:39.899> twist<00:00:40.730> his<00:00:41.730> arm<00:00:41.910> or<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.719> ratchet<00:00:44.719> swing

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
torso twist his arm or in ratchet swing

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.970 
torso twist his arm or in ratchet swing
the<00:00:47.219> arms<00:00:47.700> okay<00:00:48.300> now<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.530> head<00:00:49.770> his

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
the arms okay now this is a head his

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.400 
the arms okay now this is a head his
head<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.489> actually<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.360> ball<00:00:51.719> joint<00:00:52.050> which

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
head is actually on the ball joint which

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.410 
head is actually on the ball joint which
I<00:00:52.559> was<00:00:52.680> surprised<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.219> find<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.670> was<00:00:53.940> packing<00:00:54.149> a

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
I was surprised to find I was packing a

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.689 
I was surprised to find I was packing a
swivel<00:00:54.780> but<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.440> actually<00:00:55.649> on<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.190> ball<00:00:56.670> joint

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
swivel but is actually on a ball joint

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.000 
swivel but is actually on a ball joint
so<00:00:57.270> he<00:00:57.360> does<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:58.050> bit<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.010> movement<00:00:59.219> ahead

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
so he does have a bit of movement ahead

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.710 
so he does have a bit of movement ahead
for<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> legs<00:01:02.309> are<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:03.329> imagine<00:01:03.870> they<00:01:04.830> split

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
for the legs are in imagine they split

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:13.000 
for the legs are in imagine they split

i'll just show you the easy

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.760 
i'll just show you the easy
transformations<00:01:51.450> formation<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.259> put<00:01:52.649> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
transformations formation so you put the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.819 
transformations formation so you put the
arms<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.909> hands<00:01:54.180> go<00:01:54.869> inside<00:01:57.079> yeah<00:01:58.079> forget

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
arms and hands go inside yeah forget

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.880 
arms and hands go inside yeah forget
hand<00:01:59.070> down<00:01:59.600> twist<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.899> body<00:02:03.409> click<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.680> legs

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
hand down twist the body click the legs

hand down twist the body click the legs
together

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.260 

put<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.640> arms<00:02:09.970> indeed<00:02:10.330> tab<00:02:10.599> inside<00:02:11.080> that's<00:02:11.800> it

so as you can see there's a very trapeze

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.720 
so as you can see there's a very trapeze
transformer<00:02:15.670> Shrek<00:02:16.360> mold<00:02:16.569> is<00:02:16.720> pretty<00:02:16.989> nice<00:02:17.730> of

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
transformer Shrek mold is pretty nice of

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.620 
transformer Shrek mold is pretty nice of
course<00:02:19.060> I'm<00:02:19.209> empty<00:02:19.480> spot<00:02:19.750> but<00:02:19.989> for<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:22.239> sixth

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
course I'm empty spot but for the sixth

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.630 
course I'm empty spot but for the sixth
step<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:23.110> transformation<00:02:23.739> I<00:02:23.890> find<00:02:24.220> this<00:02:24.370> very

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
step of transformation I find this very

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.840 
step of transformation I find this very
nice<00:02:25.630> prime<00:02:26.080> yes<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:27.100> pipes<00:02:27.630> there's<00:02:28.630> levels

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
nice prime yes the pipes there's levels

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.630 
nice prime yes the pipes there's levels
so<00:02:30.850> again<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.330> transform<00:02:31.840> them<00:02:33.420> tab<00:02:35.489> click<00:02:36.489> the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
so again to transform them tab click the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.479 
so again to transform them tab click the
body<00:02:36.900> turn<00:02:37.900> this<00:02:39.120> for<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.239> arms<00:02:41.250> fist<00:02:42.250> comes

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
body turn this for the arms fist comes

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.080 
body turn this for the arms fist comes
out<00:02:42.730> Thunder<00:02:43.410> spread<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.800> ahead<00:02:45.280> something<00:02:46.000> I

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
out Thunder spread and ahead something I

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.910 
out Thunder spread and ahead something I
was<00:02:46.239> surprised<00:02:46.600> they<00:02:46.630> actually<00:02:46.959> put<00:02:47.590> a<00:02:47.620> bit<00:02:47.890> of

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
was surprised they actually put a bit of

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.140 
was surprised they actually put a bit of
swivels<00:02:48.580> on<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:50.230> ankle<00:02:50.440> so<00:02:51.310> to<00:02:51.370> pull<00:02:51.910> them

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
swivels on the ankle so to pull them

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.150 
swivels on the ankle so to pull them
around<00:02:52.299> and<00:02:52.690> pull<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.440> bill<00:02:53.620> t<00:02:53.799> is<00:02:53.860> really

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160
