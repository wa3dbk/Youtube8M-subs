fans you can have the PCI Stars and the

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.860 
fans you can have the PCI Stars and the
power<00:00:53.280> supply<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.969> he<00:00:54.239> says<00:00:54.450> here<00:00:54.660> down<00:00:54.840> here

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
power supply and he says here down here

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.920 
power supply and he says here down here
is<00:00:55.200> his<00:00:55.320> version<00:00:55.500> two<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.190> don't<00:00:56.520> know

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
is his version two so I don't know

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.479 
is his version two so I don't know
whether<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.200> vision<00:00:58.469> one<00:00:58.980> or<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.460> one

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
whether this a vision one or the one

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.889 
whether this a vision one or the one
that<00:00:59.760> one<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.239> she<00:01:00.300> could<00:01:00.600> version<00:01:00.989> one

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
that one is that she could version one

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.479 
that one is that she could version one
so<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.170> actually<00:01:04.469> the<00:01:04.619> first<00:01:04.769> BitFenix

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
so this is actually the first BitFenix

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.859 
so this is actually the first BitFenix
one<00:01:05.880> I've<00:01:06.180> actually<00:01:06.329> purchased<00:01:08.420> and<00:01:09.420> then<00:01:09.720> I

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
one I've actually purchased and then I

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.450 
one I've actually purchased and then I
think<00:01:10.080> mister<00:01:10.290> probably<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.979> front<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
think mister probably the front of the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.940 
think mister probably the front of the
box<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.479> can<00:01:12.510> see<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.869> says<00:01:12.960> white<00:01:13.229> and

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
box and you can see it says white and

box and you can see it says white and
near<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.369> BitFenix

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
near the BitFenix

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.969 
near the BitFenix
phoenix<00:01:15.780> logo<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.409> they're<00:01:16.500> quite<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.710> lot

these logos all over the place so
there's<00:01:18.689> no<00:01:19.250> wondering<00:01:20.250> what<00:01:20.549> make<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.479> case

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
there's no wondering what make of case

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.570 
there's no wondering what make of case
this<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.250> last<00:01:23.460> side<00:01:25.340> not<00:01:26.340> really

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
this is and the last side not really

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.000 
this is and the last side not really
much<00:01:26.760> to<00:01:26.790> see<00:01:27.210> here<00:01:27.350> just<00:01:28.350> some<00:01:28.439> barcode

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
much to see here just some barcode

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.670 
much to see here just some barcode
information<00:01:29.670> again<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:31.049> fact<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.530> can

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
information again the fact that you can

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.190 
information again the fact that you can
get<00:01:31.799> one<00:01:32.040> with<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.369> window<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.790> without<00:01:33.200> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
get one with the window and without and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.710 
get one with the window and without and
just<00:01:34.530> some<00:01:34.770> information<00:01:35.580> at<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.210> bottom<00:01:36.360> so

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
just some information at the bottom so

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.289 
just some information at the bottom so
let's<00:01:36.750> just<00:01:37.049> get<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.350> open<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:38.299> won't

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
let's just get this open I won't

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.330 
let's just get this open I won't
actually<00:01:39.450> show<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.840> show<00:01:40.439> myself<00:01:40.650> opening<00:01:41.189> it

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
actually show you show myself opening it

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.719 
actually show you show myself opening it
I<00:01:41.490> think<00:01:41.729> I'll<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:42.750> open<00:01:42.930> it

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
I think I'll just open it

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.460 
I think I'll just open it
okay<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:44.790> I've<00:01:45.030> opened<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.320> what

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
okay so I've opened it and this is what

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.260 
okay so I've opened it and this is what
the<00:01:46.560> case<00:01:46.740> looks<00:01:47.009> like<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.520> went<00:01:47.759> with<00:01:48.030> the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
the case looks like I went with the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.340 
the case looks like I went with the
white<00:01:48.540> one<00:01:48.900> with<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.680> blue<00:01:50.270> mesh<00:01:51.350> grille

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
white one with the blue mesh grille

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.859 
white one with the blue mesh grille
striping<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.400> just<00:01:53.670> zoom<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:54.060> there<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.750> can

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
striping you just zoom in there you can

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.649 
striping you just zoom in there you can
see<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:55.409> like<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:56.009> steel<00:01:56.490> or<00:01:56.790> or<00:01:57.150> plastic

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
see it's just like a steel or or plastic

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.620 
see it's just like a steel or or plastic
mesh<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.740> just<00:01:58.920> runs<00:01:59.189> along<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.850> top<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.360> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
mesh it just runs along the top and the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.090 
mesh it just runs along the top and the
bottom<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:01.140> got<00:02:01.920> this<00:02:02.009> case<00:02:02.310> for<00:02:02.700> 50<00:02:03.149> pounds<00:02:03.630> so

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
bottom I got this case for 50 pounds so

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.929 
bottom I got this case for 50 pounds so
that's<00:02:05.100> probably<00:02:05.579> about<00:02:06.439> a<00:02:07.439> basic<00:02:08.280> level<00:02:08.549> case

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:08.939 
that's probably about a basic level case

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:11.059 
that's probably about a basic level case
so<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.599> wasn't<00:02:09.869> really<00:02:10.049> expecting<00:02:10.409> much<00:02:10.739> I've

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
so I wasn't really expecting much I've

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.549 
so I wasn't really expecting much I've
read<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.579> the<00:02:11.909> side<00:02:12.150> panels<00:02:12.569> we've<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.290> little

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:13.559 
read that the side panels we've a little

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:14.360 
read that the side panels we've a little
bit

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
bit

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.550 
bit
and<00:02:14.730> when<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.180> was<00:02:15.330> lifting<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.870> out<00:02:16.019> it<00:02:16.290> did

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
and when I was lifting it out it did

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.410 
and when I was lifting it out it did
feel<00:02:16.769> very<00:02:16.830> lightweight<00:02:17.310> compared<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.120> say<00:02:18.300> in

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
feel very lightweight compared to say in

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.380 
feel very lightweight compared to say in
my<00:02:18.599> other<00:02:18.900> case<00:02:19.140> which<00:02:19.349> is<00:02:19.530> an<00:02:19.680> antic<00:02:20.129> 300<00:02:20.849> and

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
my other case which is an antic 300 and

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.009 
my other case which is an antic 300 and
even<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.870> old<00:02:22.739> Sonata<00:02:23.250> her<00:02:23.489> case<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.910> have<00:02:24.180> so

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
even a old Sonata her case I have so

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.740 
even a old Sonata her case I have so
just<00:02:25.230> stop<00:02:25.410> tacking<00:02:25.890> on<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.129> side<00:02:26.629> the<00:02:27.629> whole

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
just stop tacking on the side the whole

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.420 
just stop tacking on the side the whole
thing<00:02:28.019> does<00:02:28.230> move<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:28.590> I'm<00:02:28.709> not<00:02:28.860> even<00:02:29.099> applying

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
thing does move it I'm not even applying

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.610 
thing does move it I'm not even applying
any<00:02:29.640> real<00:02:29.849> pressure<00:02:30.120> so<00:02:30.870> it's<00:02:31.379> not<00:02:31.530> the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
any real pressure so it's not the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.289 
any real pressure so it's not the
heaviest<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.220> cases<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:32.879> doesn't<00:02:33.180> feel

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
heaviest of cases and it doesn't feel

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.050 
heaviest of cases and it doesn't feel
like<00:02:33.390> it's<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.870> most<00:02:34.049> expensive<00:02:34.890> of<00:02:35.069> cases

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
like it's the most expensive of cases

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.869 
like it's the most expensive of cases
but<00:02:36.599> 450<00:02:37.260> pounds<00:02:37.709> I<00:02:37.950> think<00:02:38.310> it's<00:02:38.459> not<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.670> bad

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
but 450 pounds I think it's not a bad

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:39.350 
but 450 pounds I think it's not a bad
deal

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
deal

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.240 
deal
it<00:02:39.599> does<00:02:39.780> look<00:02:39.900> quite<00:02:40.170> nice<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.739> does<00:02:40.980> look

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
it does look quite nice it does look

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.400 
it does look quite nice it does look
like<00:02:41.489> it's<00:02:42.209> worth<00:02:42.390> probably<00:02:42.629> about<00:02:42.900> 80<00:02:43.260> 90

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
like it's worth probably about 80 90

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.390 
like it's worth probably about 80 90
pounds<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:44.519> guess<00:02:45.450> about<00:02:45.599> the<00:02:45.690> top<00:02:46.140> we've<00:02:46.890> got<00:02:47.190> a

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
pounds I guess about the top we've got a

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.940 
pounds I guess about the top we've got a
power<00:02:48.329> reset<00:02:48.599> button<00:02:49.110> we've<00:02:49.500> got<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.650> power

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
power reset button we've got a power

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.089 
power reset button we've got a power
button<00:02:50.010> I've<00:02:50.940> got<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.120> microphone<00:02:52.099> jack

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
button I've got a microphone jack

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.490 
button I've got a microphone jack
headphone<00:02:54.030> jack<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.989> think<00:02:55.200> these<00:02:55.290> two

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
headphone jack and I think these two

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.949 
headphone jack and I think these two
would<00:02:55.680> be<00:02:55.829> USB<00:02:56.280> 3<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:57.120> these<00:02:57.299> two<00:02:57.540> would<00:02:57.780> be

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
would be USB 3 and these two would be

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.800 
would be USB 3 and these two would be
USB<00:02:58.500> 2<00:02:58.769> and<00:02:59.129> there's<00:02:59.670> what<00:02:59.819> of<00:03:00.000> this<00:03:00.180> measure

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
USB 2 and there's what of this measure

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.930 
USB 2 and there's what of this measure
like<00:03:01.049> griddle<00:03:01.410> at<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.590> top<00:03:01.799> as<00:03:01.950> well<00:03:02.160> which<00:03:02.819> I

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
like griddle at the top as well which I

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.140 
like griddle at the top as well which I
think<00:03:02.970> has<00:03:03.299> a<00:03:03.329> rubberized<00:03:04.549> coating<00:03:05.549> apply<00:03:06.090> to

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
think has a rubberized coating apply to

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.660 
think has a rubberized coating apply to
rip<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.569> whole<00:03:06.720> front<00:03:07.140> sort<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.040> top<00:03:08.340> and

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
rip the whole front sort of top and

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.819 
rip the whole front sort of top and
front<00:03:09.060> has<00:03:09.299> a<00:03:09.329> rubberized<00:03:09.870> coating<00:03:10.230> apply<00:03:10.769> to

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
front has a rubberized coating apply to

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.800 
front has a rubberized coating apply to
it<00:03:11.099> so<00:03:11.610> that<00:03:11.640> does<00:03:11.940> help<00:03:12.060> me<00:03:12.180> keep<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.660> a<00:03:12.780> little

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
it so that does help me keep it a little

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.170 
it so that does help me keep it a little
bit<00:03:13.140> more<00:03:13.379> expensive<00:03:13.739> I<00:03:14.250> think<00:03:14.879> this<00:03:15.030> is

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
bit more expensive I think this is

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.089 
bit more expensive I think this is
probably<00:03:15.360> just<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.110> don't<00:03:16.200> really<00:03:16.620> know<00:03:16.950> miss

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
probably just I don't really know miss

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.830 
probably just I don't really know miss
Augusta<00:03:17.340> Karthik<00:03:17.790> it<00:03:17.879> will<00:03:18.030> come<00:03:18.239> off<00:03:18.450> or

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
Augusta Karthik it will come off or

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.640 
Augusta Karthik it will come off or
whether<00:03:19.410> it's<00:03:19.620> just<00:03:19.889> some<00:03:20.790> mesh<00:03:21.350> so<00:03:22.350> you<00:03:22.410> can't

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
whether it's just some mesh so you can't

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.140 
whether it's just some mesh so you can't
put<00:03:22.859> two<00:03:22.980> fans<00:03:23.220> in<00:03:23.400> there<00:03:23.579> I<00:03:23.609> probably<00:03:23.940> won't

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
put two fans in there I probably won't

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.390 
put two fans in there I probably won't
do<00:03:24.450> that<00:03:24.750> because<00:03:25.350> I<00:03:25.470> don't<00:03:25.530> expect<00:03:25.920> there<00:03:26.370> to

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
do that because I don't expect there to

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.000 
do that because I don't expect there to
be<00:03:26.549> too<00:03:26.880> much<00:03:27.090> heat<00:03:27.359> in<00:03:27.569> here<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:28.620> does<00:03:28.769> come

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
be too much heat in here it does come

okay<00:03:39.599> so<00:03:39.660> let's<00:03:40.079> just<00:03:40.200> go<00:03:40.500> around<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.769> back

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
okay so let's just go around the back

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.640 
okay so let's just go around the back
and<00:03:43.639> you<00:03:44.639> can<00:03:44.790> see<00:03:45.000> it's<00:03:45.290> pretty<00:03:46.290> standard

water cooling and it is supposed to be
you've<00:04:02.069> done<00:04:02.340> a<00:04:02.549> screw<00:04:03.030> loose<00:04:03.060> access<00:04:03.630> to

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
you've done a screw loose access to

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.479 
you've done a screw loose access to
you've<00:04:03.930> got<00:04:04.079> these<00:04:04.169> screws<00:04:04.470> here<00:04:04.500> let's<00:04:05.340> see

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
you've got these screws here let's see

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.860 
you've got these screws here let's see
if<00:04:05.519> I<00:04:05.609> can<00:04:05.790> just<00:04:05.940> do<00:04:06.450> one<00:04:07.880> without<00:04:08.880> making<00:04:09.690> too

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
if I can just do one without making too

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.850 
if I can just do one without making too
much<00:04:09.989> noise

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.320 

you<00:04:13.980> know<00:04:14.040> we<00:04:14.190> believe<00:04:14.430> this<00:04:14.550> polish<00:04:14.910> it<00:04:15.060> just

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
you know we believe this polish it just

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.539 
you know we believe this polish it just
come<00:04:15.600> off<00:04:18.650> then<00:04:19.650> we<00:04:19.799> might<00:04:19.980> have<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.280> put<00:04:20.459> the

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
come off then we might have to put the

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:32.360 
come off then we might have to put the
camera<00:04:20.700> down<00:04:21.860> I<00:04:30.770> guess<00:04:31.770> I<00:04:31.920> just<00:04:32.100> sort<00:04:32.250> of

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
camera down I guess I just sort of

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.220 
camera down I guess I just sort of
slightly<00:04:33.060> left<00:04:33.210> to<00:04:33.360> look<00:04:33.510> after<00:04:33.660> then<00:04:33.960> it<00:04:34.050> came

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
slightly left to look after then it came

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.750 
slightly left to look after then it came
now

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.360 

okay<00:04:38.760> stuff<00:04:38.970> inside<00:04:39.390> it<00:04:40.320> looks<00:04:41.010> pretty<00:04:41.220> much

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
okay stuff inside it looks pretty much

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.090 
okay stuff inside it looks pretty much
the<00:04:41.520> same<00:04:41.670> as<00:04:41.910> any<00:04:42.210> other<00:04:42.500> case<00:04:43.500> it<00:04:43.860> doesn't

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
the same as any other case it doesn't

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.520 
the same as any other case it doesn't
maybe<00:04:44.310> seem<00:04:44.520> to<00:04:44.640> be<00:04:44.730> anything<00:04:45.350> hopefully<00:04:46.350> to

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
maybe seem to be anything hopefully to

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.840 
maybe seem to be anything hopefully to
stand<00:04:46.770> out<00:04:46.950> you<00:04:47.100> can<00:04:47.310> see<00:04:47.490> that<00:04:47.670> there<00:04:47.820> are

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
stand out you can see that there are

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:57.230 
stand out you can see that there are
some<00:04:48.660> have<00:04:49.020> girls<00:04:49.260> at<00:04:49.410> the<00:04:49.500> bottom<00:04:56.180> you<00:04:57.180> can

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
some have girls at the bottom you can

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.350 
some have girls at the bottom you can
see<00:04:57.360> there's<00:04:57.690> like<00:04:57.870> a<00:04:57.930> little<00:04:58.670> grill<00:04:59.670> and<00:05:00.060> a

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
see there's like a little grill and a

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.810 
see there's like a little grill and a
Misha<00:05:00.720> air<00:05:01.020> filter<00:05:01.530> which<00:05:02.100> I<00:05:02.250> assume<00:05:02.490> is<00:05:02.610> just

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
Misha air filter which I assume is just

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.640 
Misha air filter which I assume is just
for<00:05:03.060> preventing<00:05:03.690> dust<00:05:03.960> getting<00:05:04.290> in<00:05:04.410> there<00:05:04.560> and

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
for preventing dust getting in there and

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.620 
for preventing dust getting in there and
it<00:05:05.100> looks<00:05:05.310> like<00:05:05.370> it's<00:05:05.610> quite<00:05:05.730> easy<00:05:06.030> and<00:05:06.240> bluesy

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
it looks like it's quite easy and bluesy

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.690 
it looks like it's quite easy and bluesy
you<00:05:06.750> can<00:05:06.960> just<00:05:07.110> take<00:05:07.290> it<00:05:07.320> out<00:05:07.530> and<00:05:07.860> just<00:05:08.490> give

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
you can just take it out and just give

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.070 
you can just take it out and just give
it<00:05:08.730> a<00:05:08.850> wipe<00:05:09.030> which<00:05:09.270> is<00:05:09.390> pretty<00:05:09.600> in<00:05:09.720> the<00:05:09.780> washing

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
it a wipe which is pretty in the washing

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.650 
it a wipe which is pretty in the washing
machine<00:05:11.420> other<00:05:12.420> than<00:05:12.540> that<00:05:12.870> you've<00:05:13.110> got<00:05:13.380> your

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
machine other than that you've got your

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.330 
machine other than that you've got your
trays<00:05:15.660> for<00:05:16.410> your<00:05:16.560> hard<00:05:16.830> drives<00:05:17.070> and<00:05:17.220> your

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
trays for your hard drives and your

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.550 
trays for your hard drives and your
optical<00:05:17.820> drive<00:05:17.880> I<00:05:18.360> know<00:05:18.840> that<00:05:19.140> we<00:05:19.260> using

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
optical drive I know that we using

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.170 
optical drive I know that we using
either<00:05:19.710> of<00:05:19.919> those<00:05:20.070> and<00:05:20.130> you've<00:05:20.580> got<00:05:20.790> more

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
either of those and you've got more

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.010 
either of those and you've got more
trays<00:05:21.810> for<00:05:22.140> more<00:05:22.440> hard<00:05:22.710> drives<00:05:23.060> and<00:05:24.060> beyond

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
trays for more hard drives and beyond

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.370 
trays for more hard drives and beyond
that<00:05:25.880> you've<00:05:26.880> just<00:05:27.180> got<00:05:27.390> a<00:05:27.540> pan<00:05:27.810> at<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.110> top

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
that you've just got a pan at the top

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.230 
that you've just got a pan at the top
and<00:05:30.350> not<00:05:31.350> really<00:05:31.650> much<00:05:31.860> helps<00:05:32.310> you<00:05:33.090> could

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
and not really much helps you could

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.260 
and not really much helps you could
probably<00:05:33.360> attach<00:05:33.780> a<00:05:33.930> family<00:05:34.560> or<00:05:35.550> two<00:05:36.030> fans

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
probably attach a family or two fans

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.630 
probably attach a family or two fans
will<00:05:36.480> go<00:05:36.600> there<00:05:36.870> and<00:05:37.770> then<00:05:38.220> you<00:05:38.280> can<00:05:38.400> stack

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
will go there and then you can stack

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.190 
will go there and then you can stack
your<00:05:38.790> motherboard<00:05:39.120> and<00:05:39.360> I<00:05:39.480> suppose<00:05:39.870> these<00:05:40.020> are

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
your motherboard and I suppose these are

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.390 
your motherboard and I suppose these are
just<00:05:41.090> these<00:05:42.090> cables<00:05:42.510> are<00:05:42.690> just<00:05:43.050> for<00:05:43.530> the<00:05:43.950> fun

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
just these cables are just for the fun

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.300 
just these cables are just for the fun
headers<00:05:44.820> at<00:05:45.120> USB<00:05:45.419> ports<00:05:45.960> and<00:05:46.650> the<00:05:46.740> microphone

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
headers at USB ports and the microphone

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.550 
headers at USB ports and the microphone
okay

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
okay

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.930 
okay
now<00:05:49.560> the<00:05:49.620> back<00:05:49.890> panel<00:05:50.190> does<00:05:50.340> come<00:05:50.610> off<00:05:50.640> and

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
now the back panel does come off and

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.030 
now the back panel does come off and
that<00:05:51.120> would<00:05:51.270> just<00:05:51.300> a<00:05:51.720> review<00:05:52.200> the<00:05:52.530> underside

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 
that would just a review the underside

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.510 
that would just a review the underside
of<00:05:53.070> this<00:05:53.310> motherboard<00:05:54.240> played<00:05:55.070> in<00:05:56.070> terms<00:05:56.340> of

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
of this motherboard played in terms of

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.409 
of this motherboard played in terms of
size<00:05:56.700> it's<00:05:57.000> a<00:05:57.410> 20<00:05:58.410> centimeters<00:05:59.100> roughly<00:05:59.850> 20

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
size it's a 20 centimeters roughly 20

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.870 
size it's a 20 centimeters roughly 20
centimeters<00:06:01.050> from<00:06:01.200> here<00:06:01.550> to<00:06:02.550> here<00:06:02.850> and<00:06:03.150> about

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
centimeters from here to here and about

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.400 
centimeters from here to here and about
46<00:06:05.880> centimeters<00:06:06.479> from<00:06:06.570> the<00:06:06.660> bottom<00:06:07.020> to<00:06:07.290> the

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 
46 centimeters from the bottom to the

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:12.230 
46 centimeters from the bottom to the
top<00:06:07.440> and<00:06:08.130> about<00:06:08.850> 50<00:06:09.240> centimeters<00:06:09.680> in<00:06:10.680> depth<00:06:11.240> so

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
top and about 50 centimeters in depth so

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.730 
top and about 50 centimeters in depth so
overall<00:06:12.570> it<00:06:12.810> looks<00:06:12.870> like<00:06:13.110> a<00:06:13.140> nice<00:06:13.380> case

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
overall it looks like a nice case

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.190 
overall it looks like a nice case
hopefully<00:06:14.640> will<00:06:14.760> be<00:06:14.880> easy<00:06:15.120> to<00:06:15.450> install<00:06:15.840> the

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
hopefully will be easy to install the

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.810 
hopefully will be easy to install the
motherboard<00:06:16.320> and<00:06:16.890> everything<00:06:17.280> else<00:06:17.490> and

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
motherboard and everything else and

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.740 
motherboard and everything else and
let's<00:06:18.690> just<00:06:18.870> move<00:06:18.990> on<00:06:19.110> to<00:06:19.260> the<00:06:19.350> next<00:06:19.470> piece
