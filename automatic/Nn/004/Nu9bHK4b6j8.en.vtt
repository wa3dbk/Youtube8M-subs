00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.067
 How are you? 

00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:02.967
 -Hello. Everything great. -OK. 

00:00:03.033 --> 00:00:05.233
 Thank you for helping me on my way to work. 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.500
 No problem. 

00:00:06.567 --> 00:00:07.733
 You are Iggy ... 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.367
 -Yes. -But that's not your name. 

00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:10.800
 No, my name is Amethyst. 

00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.067
 Really? 

00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.500
 Yes exactly. 

00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:15.333
 -How the gem? Right? -Yes, the stone. 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.633
 And then how did you come to name Iggy Azalea? 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.667
 Dog, street and such. 

00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.267
 -After the "porn star" formula? -Yes. 

00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.900
 After the pornstar formula, like that 

00:00:25.967 --> 00:00:27.500
 How pornstars get their names? 

00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:28.600
 Yes it is. 

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:32.600
 Then my Denzer Hellbottom would be. 

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:34.333
 -Yeah ... -What would mean 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.867
 -that I'm a very special ... -Denzer, yes ... 

00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.467
 ... pornstar guy would be. 

00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.233
 Can we listen to some music? 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.333
 Of course. 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.300
 Well. Let's see what we have. 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.767
 What? 

00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:50.333
 Here it is. 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.933
 You have to play me clearly. 

00:01:00.467 --> 00:01:01.733
 -Come on! -Come on! 

00:01:05.067 --> 00:01:06.233
 You have to clap three times. 

00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.367
 Such a great song. 

00:01:28.467 --> 00:01:29.733
 -Do you think that attractive? -NOE. 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.900
 -With washboard stomach? -I like big slim guys. 

00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:33.867
 Obviously, I marry one like that. -Right. 

00:01:34.967 --> 00:01:38.767
 From this I conclude that I am not your type. Do you mean this? 

00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:41.733
 In fact, I also went out with guys of your stature. 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.533
 I went out with guys of your stature. 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.033
 Phenomenal lovers, right? That's what they say. 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.967
 -Yes that's true. Yes. -Yes. 

00:01:49.033 --> 00:01:50.067
 -Say one. -Toll in bed. 

00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:51.533
 -We really have ... -Yes. 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.800
 -Really. -We get the hang of it. 

00:01:55.567 --> 00:01:57.133
 You absolutely have to do that. 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.200
 Yes. 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.233
 Okay, but we'll do the next one together. 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.633
 -Ready? OK. -Agreed. 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.267
 -Yes I am ready. -OK. 

00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:34.033
 Do not miss the mission, he'll be right there. 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.067
 Are you planning your wedding? 

00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:17.033
 Oh yeah. I already have the wedding planner 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.200
 -met. -Oh yes? 

00:03:18.267 --> 00:03:20.200
 Are you going to become the wedding monster? 

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:21.500
 -No. Really not? 

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:22.600
 No, really not. 

00:03:22.667 --> 00:03:24.567
 No one thinks of becoming a wedding monster. 

00:03:24.633 --> 00:03:27.400
 Nobody thinks, "I'm going to become a wedding monster." 

00:03:27.467 --> 00:03:29.000
 And who will make the wedding? 

00:03:29.067 --> 00:03:30.100
 No idea. 

00:03:30.167 --> 00:03:31.833
 If I am ordained, may I then? 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.067
 -Definitely. -Seriously? 

00:03:33.133 --> 00:03:34.400
 -Seriously. -Don't mind me. 

00:03:34.467 --> 00:03:36.267
 Wait. I stop. 

00:03:36.367 --> 00:03:38.833
 If I am ordained, may I perform the marriage ceremony? 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.667
 -Promised. -Not true! 

00:03:40.733 --> 00:03:42.467
 Oh my God! 

00:03:42.533 --> 00:03:43.767
 -If. -My tears come. 

00:03:43.867 --> 00:03:45.467
 I'm really crying ... 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.667
 That does not sound like her. 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.467
 You sound like her. 

00:04:42.633 --> 00:04:44.267
 OK then. You sounded like Jennifer Hudson. 

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:45.367
 Do you find? 

00:04:45.433 --> 00:04:48.533
 That's the nicest thing I've ever been told. 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.467
 She will understand that as an insult. 

00:04:50.533 --> 00:04:52.833
 -No! -Certainly. 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.700
 What will be your first dance? 

00:04:54.767 --> 00:04:57.267
 I do not know. But I know Nick really wants to ... 

00:04:57.333 --> 00:04:59.200
 -My God. -Nick necessarily wants 

00:04:59.267 --> 00:05:02.400
 R. Kelly at the wedding to sing "Marry the ..." with him. 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.867
 -Wow. I think ... - typical. 

00:05:04.933 --> 00:05:07.767
 ... that's what they all imagine when they ... 

00:05:07.833 --> 00:05:10.200
 -If you really find him ... -I do not know. 

00:05:10.267 --> 00:05:11.567
 If you find the man ... 

00:05:11.633 --> 00:05:13.133
 I do not know if it comes to this ... 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.300
 I think you should do everything on "All My Life" 

00:05:15.367 --> 00:05:17.600
 -by K-CI &amp; JoJo. -To realize it. 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.933
 How many bridesmaids will you have? 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.033
 Four. 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.333
 Virtually all my friends. 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.467
 Three thin girlfriends, one is built stronger? 

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:26.900
 -No, all skinny. -Stop it. 

00:05:26.967 --> 00:05:28.333
 -Only thin. -No one has only thin. 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.033
 Everyone has a tighter fit girl who does not like the dress. 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.600
 Demi Lovato is a bridesmaid. 

00:05:32.667 --> 00:05:33.733
 -No! -But. 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.900
 Shut your mouth! 

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:36.567
 -And she absolutely has to sing. -Yes! 

00:05:36.633 --> 00:05:38.867
 Demi Lovato and I could sing "Endless Love". 

00:05:38.933 --> 00:05:40.700
 Oh, my God, that's what's going on. 

00:05:40.767 --> 00:05:43.500
 -There's a big long train ... -Yes. 

00:05:43.567 --> 00:05:46.233
 With push-up bra or are you allowed to rest? 

00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:48.167
 Let's rest her, yes. -Really? 

00:05:48.267 --> 00:05:49.900
 -This is controversial. -You should rest. 

00:05:49.967 --> 00:05:51.267
 You like push-ups? 

00:05:51.533 --> 00:05:52.800
 -Professional. -Professional. 

00:05:52.867 --> 00:05:55.467
 Professionally, you are a push-up professional ... 

00:05:55.533 --> 00:05:57.800
 -Yes. You are very relaxed ... 

00:05:57.867 --> 00:05:59.500
 -Private. -... in your private life. 

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:01.400
 Do we want to watch some wedding dresses? 

00:06:01.467 --> 00:06:02.533
 -Yes. -A wedding dress ... 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.400
 Here happens to be a bridal gown. 

00:06:04.467 --> 00:06:05.600
 Look. 

00:06:05.667 --> 00:06:07.800
 -Hello. -Good day. 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.900
 How are you? We have some cameras with us, is that alright? 

00:06:11.033 --> 00:06:12.867
 Iggy marries next year. 

00:06:13.033 --> 00:06:15.333
 She has never tried on a bridal gown. 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.333
 Can we try on a few and see if we can find one? 

00:06:19.433 --> 00:06:21.133
 How about, Iggy? 

00:06:21.233 --> 00:06:24.133
 It's always hard with a big butt like ... 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.167
 You said it. Whom do you say that? 

00:06:26.233 --> 00:06:30.367
 We need something classy but sexy too. 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.233
 I do not know what Iggy wants, but that's ... 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.800
 Look at this. 

00:06:37.667 --> 00:06:40.967
 Oh, my God, so grown up. She has grown up. 

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:43.100
 Do you want a veil? -Yes, pep yourself up. 

00:06:43.167 --> 00:06:45.400
 A veil! A veil please! 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.800
 Let's see what that is ... 

00:06:46.867 --> 00:06:49.367
 Oh my God! 

00:06:50.233 --> 00:06:53.967
 In lockstep. 

00:06:54.067 --> 00:06:55.833
 -In the step-by-step. -Father... 

00:06:55.933 --> 00:06:57.633
 My God, that touches me that way. 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.867
 -Really? -Yeah, I'm getting very emotional. 

00:07:00.933 --> 00:07:03.167
 I thought ... I do not know what I'm going to wedding ... 

00:07:03.233 --> 00:07:04.700
 -Something for James. -...take on. 

00:07:04.767 --> 00:07:07.500
 Do you have something that I could wear to the wedding? 

00:07:14.733 --> 00:07:18.067
 Oh God. I feel fantastic. 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.400
 We take it. We both take. 

00:07:20.667 --> 00:07:23.967
 That was great, but I have to get to work now. 

00:07:24.033 --> 00:07:25.067
 OK. 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.233
 Thank you so much for joining me to work. 

00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:40.667
 I appreciate very much. 

00:07:40.733 --> 00:07:42.767
 Bye for now. Can you make it home alone? 

00:07:42.833 --> 00:07:44.000
 -Yeah, sure. -For sure? 

00:07:44.067 --> 00:07:46.033
 -In order. See you later. -The veil ... Bye!
