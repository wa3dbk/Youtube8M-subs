00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:45.959 

my<00:00:40.489> plan<00:00:41.179> was<00:00:41.359> earlier<00:00:41.719> but<00:00:41.809> then<00:00:43.300> but<00:00:44.300> uh

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
my plan was earlier but then but uh

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.590 
my plan was earlier but then but uh
heading<00:00:47.530> right<00:00:48.530> now<00:00:48.589> so<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:49.390> order<00:00:50.390> of<00:00:50.479> the

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
heading right now so the order of the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.630 
heading right now so the order of the
parts<00:00:50.930> for<00:00:51.109> the<00:00:51.260> Phantom<00:00:52.070> I<00:00:52.159> think<00:00:52.370> I<00:00:52.399> got<00:00:52.519> it

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
parts for the Phantom I think I got it

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.860 
parts for the Phantom I think I got it
all<00:00:52.729> figured<00:00:52.940> out<00:00:53.120> I<00:00:53.179> think<00:00:53.420> the<00:00:53.510> frame<00:00:53.839> just

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
all figured out I think the frame just

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.039 
all figured out I think the frame just
bent<00:00:54.320> a<00:00:54.379> little<00:00:54.409> bit<00:00:54.620> and<00:00:54.949> the<00:00:55.879> gibble<00:00:56.600> bracket

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:57.049 
bent a little bit and the gibble bracket

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:59.619 
bent a little bit and the gibble bracket
broke<00:00:57.350> so<00:00:58.039> I<00:00:58.070> got<00:00:58.339> those<00:00:58.640> replacements<00:00:59.510> and

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
broke so I got those replacements and

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.319 
broke so I got those replacements and
when<00:00:59.809> I<00:00:59.899> plugged<00:01:00.769> the<00:01:00.859> gimbal<00:01:01.159> back<00:01:01.339> in<00:01:01.609> it

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
when I plugged the gimbal back in it

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:03.880 
when I plugged the gimbal back in it
turned<00:01:02.719> on<00:01:02.869> and<00:01:03.170> centered<00:01:03.439> itself<00:01:03.769> and

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
turned on and centered itself and

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.840 
turned on and centered itself and
everything<00:01:04.189> so<00:01:04.399> that's<00:01:04.519> good<00:01:05.170> and<00:01:06.610> yeah<00:01:07.610> that

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
everything so that's good and yeah that

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.670 
everything so that's good and yeah that
the<00:01:07.970> actual<00:01:08.299> frame<00:01:08.539> is<00:01:08.720> a<00:01:08.750> phantom<00:01:09.439> is<00:01:09.649> a

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
the actual frame is a phantom is a

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.139 
the actual frame is a phantom is a
little<00:01:09.950> bit<00:01:10.100> but<00:01:10.310> all<00:01:10.399> the<00:01:10.520> internals<00:01:11.000> were

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
little bit but all the internals were

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.450 
little bit but all the internals were
good<00:01:11.330> so<00:01:11.539> I'm<00:01:11.600> hoping<00:01:11.840> I<00:01:11.960> can<00:01:11.990> just<00:01:12.380> take<00:01:13.369> it

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
good so I'm hoping I can just take it

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.100 
good so I'm hoping I can just take it
all<00:01:13.580> apart<00:01:13.880> just<00:01:14.149> transfer<00:01:14.569> it<00:01:14.630> over<00:01:14.720> to<00:01:14.990> the

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
all apart just transfer it over to the

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.359 
all apart just transfer it over to the
new<00:01:15.259> frame<00:01:15.560> it<00:01:15.679> looks<00:01:15.740> like<00:01:15.920> it's<00:01:16.069> pretty<00:01:16.250> much

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
new frame it looks like it's pretty much

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.639 
new frame it looks like it's pretty much
plug<00:01:16.789> and<00:01:16.970> play<00:01:17.179> the<00:01:17.720> way<00:01:17.810> they<00:01:17.840> have<00:01:18.110> it<00:01:18.259> set

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
plug and play the way they have it set

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:24.890
