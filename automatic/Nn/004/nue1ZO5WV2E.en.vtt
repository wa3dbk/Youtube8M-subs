00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:18.980
 what I am going to present to you 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.990
 today it's the new all in one 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.450
 new lots horizons so it's a 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.350
 it's a traditional all in one of a 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.570
 First on board 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.119
 the novelty of this product is that we 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.760
 can tilt it and there we see that 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:34.460
 the interface launches that offers 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.300
 different themes of music by 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.530
 example so we can have a 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.960
 user who is on that side 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.220
 of the table that selects an album 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.830
 that's who can start playing this 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.120
 album another user who himself 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.080
 find at our side of the table he wants 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.059
 tell me I want to play with pictures 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.620
 so they select photos see 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.330
 he can be there he is in the process of 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.790
 play and consult his pictures 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.199
 sent hop here's a third can 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.140
 to be for example me I decide I have 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.780
 rather want to make a game and so we 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.870
 can take the example of the game 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.659
 rydings company which is so a game 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.930
 rather arcade type like these 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.950
 see then we select here is the game 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.119
 we want to do we can play 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.600
 up to 4 good young players in 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.220
 select two here that's up and we 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.200
 can start the game so is there you 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.390
 have two users that is found 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.160
 face to face what do you see control the 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.750
 character with the little joystick is there 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.000
 and with the other hand you want to activate 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.560
 a whole series of functions and so that 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.580
 really brings interactivity to the game 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.260
 both on the same screen 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.070
 it's something a lot more 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.060
 friendly than what we know 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.830
 traditionally in the world 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.140
 computer where everyone is behind his 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.360
 screen there is really a return to the game at 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.440
 family game from elsewhere since we are 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.570
 in the family game we will come back 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.600
 obviously on what is I think the 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.640
 more famous example of the games 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.450
 of society this is the monopoly here we have 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.450
 an electronic version 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.600
 of monopoly so you see the principle 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.700
 is the same one selects a certain 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.009
 number of character players there I 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.880
 maybe I'll take three here 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.719
 here is a third character here and 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.520
 even a fourth 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.819
 here and so we can start the game 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.899
 So here we are with a die 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.610
 who has physics is not one of 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.319
 virtual so we really feel 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.950
 dvd in hand here we explain each 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.739
 each of the characteristics of 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.430
 characters and so there you are at 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.049
 above the board 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.190
 you throw either the nose over you 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.120
 can if the game was next there is 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.120
 also I do the number 1 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.579
 the pc recognizes it is fifrelin he has 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.709
 advance the case the character who 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.959
 give him indications on the box there 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.180
 we come back to a complexion game that we can 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.879
 call it rather finds it in theaters 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.989
 lunapark type games so that's air 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:43.879
 hockey that's an example so we 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.720
 also selects the type of board 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:49.190
 we want to use 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.290
 here and there we put the palace here 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.120
 sailboats and so you have two players 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.769
 who are face to face 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.239
 so that was it for the 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.440
 last little demonstration so soon 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.690
 we get out of the game we always come back 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.980
 on this interface will have and so at all 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.920
 moment I can decide to sell them and 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.410
 it's the screen and so he's going to offer me 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.010
 automatically come back to the desktop 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.099
 windows 8 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.569
 here we see here is so I 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.790
 come back to my traditional interface 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.200
 he can use my computer with 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.459
 mouse keyboard with everything we 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.459
 knows as French ends 2.8
