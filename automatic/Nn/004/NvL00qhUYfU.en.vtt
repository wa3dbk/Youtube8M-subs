here<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:24.140> flip<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.260> switch<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:27.199> then<00:00:28.199> there

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
here and flip the switch and then there

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.910 
here and flip the switch and then there
we<00:00:28.500> go

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
we go

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.720 
we go
start<00:00:29.730> using<00:00:29.880> water<00:00:30.269> power<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:31.460> as<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.579> can

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
start using water power and as you can

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.920 
start using water power and as you can
see<00:00:33.920> it<00:00:34.920> just<00:00:34.950> starts<00:00:35.340> doing<00:00:35.610> its<00:00:35.730> thing<00:00:35.940> so

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
see it just starts doing its thing so

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.490 
see it just starts doing its thing so
you<00:00:36.989> can<00:00:37.260> see<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.850> hose<00:00:38.850> being<00:00:39.149> pulled<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.629> not

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
you can see the hose being pulled in not

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.080 
you can see the hose being pulled in not
tremendously<00:00:41.010> fast<00:00:41.370> but<00:00:41.670> then<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.879> guess<00:00:42.059> that

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
tremendously fast but then I guess that

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.549 
tremendously fast but then I guess that
would<00:00:42.300> be<00:00:42.480> bad<00:00:42.660> if<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.989> light<00:00:43.200> caught<00:00:43.410> you

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
would be bad if that light caught you

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.979 
would be bad if that light caught you
around<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.829> foot<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.040> knocked<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.460> over<00:00:44.989> but

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
around the foot and knocked you over but

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.450 
around the foot and knocked you over but
you<00:00:46.260> know<00:00:46.350> let's<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:46.649> let<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.950> go<00:00:47.070> here<00:00:47.280> had<00:00:47.430> a

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
couple of people who thought that was a

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.930

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.840 

you<00:01:15.170> see<00:01:15.320> I<00:01:15.350> had<00:01:15.470> it<00:01:15.560> all<00:01:15.650> crossed<00:01:15.979> up<00:01:16.280> still

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
you see I had it all crossed up still

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:32.310 
you see I had it all crossed up still
doing<00:01:17.030> a<00:01:17.090> good<00:01:17.210> job<00:01:17.270> no<00:01:17.780> you<00:01:18.259> know<00:01:18.380> no<00:01:18.530> tangles

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.490 

it<00:01:32.830> goes<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.840> like<00:01:35.050> a<00:01:35.110> little<00:01:35.290> bit<00:01:35.380> of<00:01:35.440> a

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
it goes it's like a little bit of a

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.490 
it goes it's like a little bit of a
crossover<00:01:35.860> one<00:01:36.100> let's<00:01:36.280> see<00:01:36.400> what<00:01:36.520> it<00:01:36.610> does

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
crossover one let's see what it does

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.750 
crossover one let's see what it does
it<00:01:38.500> handles<00:01:38.800> that<00:01:38.920> okay<00:01:39.220> just<00:01:39.430> flipped<00:01:39.640> it

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
it handles that okay just flipped it

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:47.240 
it handles that okay just flipped it
right<00:01:39.790> over<00:01:42.510> comment<00:01:43.510> up<00:01:43.570> on<00:01:43.720> that<00:01:43.840> last<00:01:44.050> part

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.100 

okay

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.980 

and<00:01:54.110> there<00:01:54.380> you<00:01:54.500> go<00:01:54.530> coming<00:01:55.250> in<00:01:55.720> don't<00:01:56.720> get<00:01:56.840> to

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
and there you go coming in don't get to

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.340 
and there you go coming in don't get to
the<00:01:57.079> end<00:01:57.229> there<00:01:57.409> and<00:01:57.619> it<00:01:58.310> stops

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
the end there and it stops

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.590 
the end there and it stops
flip<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.500> switch<00:02:01.119> hoses<00:02:02.119> rolled<00:02:02.360> in<00:02:04.600> fun

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600
