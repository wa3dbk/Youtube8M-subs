00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
right here to antenna web but if I press

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.890 
right here to antenna web but if I press
it<00:06:01.900> it<00:06:02.110> doesn't<00:06:02.260> work<00:06:02.970> how<00:06:03.970> do<00:06:04.270> I<00:06:04.330> actually<00:06:04.600> get

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
it it doesn't work how do I actually get

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.500 
it it doesn't work how do I actually get
it<00:06:05.050> well<00:06:05.800> like<00:06:05.950> I<00:06:06.070> said<00:06:06.300> they've<00:06:07.300> actually

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
it well like I said they've actually

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.210 
it well like I said they've actually
implemented<00:06:08.140> sort<00:06:08.320> of<00:06:08.380> a<00:06:08.440> mouse<00:06:08.680> like<00:06:08.860> thing

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
implemented sort of a mouse like thing

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.850 
implemented sort of a mouse like thing
so<00:06:09.400> you<00:06:09.490> can<00:06:09.580> rotate<00:06:10.120> this<00:06:10.330> mouse<00:06:10.740> but<00:06:11.740> to

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
so you can rotate this mouse but to

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.710 
so you can rotate this mouse but to
actually<00:06:11.980> click<00:06:12.730> the<00:06:12.880> link<00:06:13.060> you<00:06:13.180> have<00:06:13.270> to<00:06:13.390> drag

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
actually click the link you have to drag

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.440 
actually click the link you have to drag
it<00:06:13.750> there<00:06:14.110> and<00:06:15.010> then<00:06:15.070> press<00:06:16.000> the<00:06:16.030> button

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.450 
it there and then press the button

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.050 
it there and then press the button
inside<00:06:16.810> and<00:06:17.140> in<00:06:18.010> this<00:06:18.220> case<00:06:18.400> it<00:06:18.610> doesn't<00:06:18.880> load

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
inside and in this case it doesn't load

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.210 
inside and in this case it doesn't load
but<00:06:19.360> that's<00:06:20.230> how<00:06:20.470> you<00:06:20.530> would<00:06:20.770> do<00:06:20.920> it<00:06:20.950> that's

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 
but that's how you would do it that's

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.290 
but that's how you would do it that's
how<00:06:21.310> they<00:06:21.550> did<00:06:22.830> the<00:06:23.830> web<00:06:24.130> browser<00:06:24.400> it's<00:06:25.120> kind

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
how they did the web browser it's kind

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.030 
how they did the web browser it's kind
of<00:06:25.330> weird<00:06:25.690> I<00:06:25.960> would<00:06:26.380> have<00:06:26.440> preferred<00:06:26.620> if<00:06:26.950> you

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
of weird I would have preferred if you

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.800 
of weird I would have preferred if you
could<00:06:27.190> just<00:06:27.220> tap<00:06:27.550> on<00:06:27.610> but<00:06:28.060> I<00:06:28.240> guess<00:06:28.480> without

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
could just tap on but I guess without

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.260 
could just tap on but I guess without
multi-touch<00:06:29.440> it<00:06:29.980> couldn't<00:06:30.520> it<00:06:30.700> doesn't<00:06:31.120> work

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
multi-touch it couldn't it doesn't work

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.900 
multi-touch it couldn't it doesn't work
as<00:06:31.480> well<00:06:31.750> would<00:06:32.170> I<00:06:32.380> just<00:06:33.340> think<00:06:33.520> it's<00:06:33.760> an

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:33.910 
as well would I just think it's an

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.220 
as well would I just think it's an
interesting<00:06:34.120> way<00:06:34.360> they<00:06:34.480> implemented<00:06:34.810> it<00:06:35.080> but

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.230 
interesting way they implemented it but

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.710 
interesting way they implemented it but
I<00:06:35.410> don't<00:06:35.590> like<00:06:36.130> it<00:06:36.310> that<00:06:36.340> way<00:06:36.700> I<00:06:36.940> guess<00:06:37.480> you

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
I don't like it that way I guess you

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.700 
I don't like it that way I guess you
could<00:06:37.870> say<00:06:38.220> so<00:06:39.220> let's<00:06:39.430> go<00:06:39.520> back<00:06:39.700> to<00:06:39.730> the<00:06:39.910> menu

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
could say so let's go back to the menu

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.800 
could say so let's go back to the menu
so<00:06:41.710> you<00:06:41.740> have<00:06:41.920> your<00:06:41.950> settings<00:06:42.520> your<00:06:43.360> browser<00:06:43.570> a
