00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.189
 quality collections does not have 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.960
 left of smart thoughtful because 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.109
 precisely that's a lot of attention the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.570
 detail all the interior details in 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.269
 outside it's also a lot at the level 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.060
 the best materials 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:35.100
 the mcr which is tactile ie 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:40.250
 authentic for the best comfort if 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.500
 you want the idea it's really keeping 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.899
 look natural but at the same time we have a 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.660
 treatment the most difficult test 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.550
 really that it's solid and it stays 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.949
 long time with a quality port even though 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.840
 is bought in this red letter 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.179
 she stays like that we take a 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.179
 touching and hop it's gone 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:07.160
 working with us is there we have 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.930
 years lean cuisine know is fine 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.560
 and we also have good china for them 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.020
 ceramics 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.210
 that is, it's known for the 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.420
 plate fantastic colors that she 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.760
 wants 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.680
 big brother I doubled and then also 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.000
 for sustainability and it's also 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.060
 possible to work with the links 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.060
 very strong to make sense really 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.520
 one hinders and to my qualities that 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.860
 name father what cardboard for linen 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.500
 bed just because it took 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.700
 shown soft quality we also 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.760
 worked with the nc the wool that is 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.440
 policy for carpets that for 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.270
 structure this error that also makes 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.550
 the opportunity to work with 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.479
 great emotions that presents well with 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.070
 the dinner table for example because 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.940
 it really cuts everything on 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.940
 the carpet 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.930
 it's the depression that is very 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.110
 decorative for the pauliste voters 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.929
 who of things pascal lamy trine in 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.000
 four years we tried everything to 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.420
 work with very strong colors 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.170
 as natural as it is a bit like 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:24.500
 also with humor like this mother 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.500
 which is very fresh green spring 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.430
 we did not really look at the years 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.730
 fifty years that we are indeed a 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.040
 mixture of a lot thing we have a lot 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.959
 looked at and from east to the future we are going 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.940
 try to make a collection with the 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.640
 very lonely that is to say that the 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.980
 products carry its own place but 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.750
 I believe that true beauty with the 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.090
 collection is that it mixes well 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.610
 with what we already have six and others and 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.690
 who produced or if it's something 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.030
 of classic or a little kit time already 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.239
 and that it serves as a strength with the 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.239
 corruption 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:08.580
 maceo trying to work with a 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.170
 product with multi function function if 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.069
 you want for what it really is 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.750
 a walk in different places 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.049
 when it changes at home and in 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.390
 chance of the context will remain 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:23.489
 the idea is that all this furniture 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.180
 should always take place the favorite 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:33.620
 it's jean d'enfants entrance hall 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.620
 room where any fifteen days
