itself<00:00:22.800> rather<00:00:24.050> this<00:00:25.050> video<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.710> actually

itself rather this video is actually
about<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.730> spawn<00:00:27.090> trap<00:00:27.449> on<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.109> map<00:00:28.710> recovery

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
about a spawn trap on the map recovery

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.710 
about a spawn trap on the map recovery
that<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.490> wanted<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.060> talk<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.390> guys<00:00:30.510> about

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
that I wanted to talk to you guys about

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.450 
that I wanted to talk to you guys about
so<00:00:31.590> me<00:00:31.920> my<00:00:32.040> friend<00:00:32.250> Aaron<00:00:32.489> were<00:00:32.579> playing<00:00:32.850> and

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
so me my friend Aaron were playing and

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.740 
so me my friend Aaron were playing and
we<00:00:35.460> started<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.790> play<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.969> lot<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.329> uplink

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
we started to play a lot of uplink

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.690 
we started to play a lot of uplink
because<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.710> can<00:00:37.860> spawn<00:00:38.070> trap<00:00:38.340> better<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.640> we

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
because you can spawn trap better and we

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.220 
because you can spawn trap better and we
were<00:00:38.820> going<00:00:39.059> for<00:00:39.210> triples<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:41.540> we<00:00:42.540> were

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
were going for triples so we were

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.170 
were going for triples so we were
testing<00:00:43.680> around<00:00:43.860> spawns<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.640> different<00:00:45.000> maps

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
testing around spawns on different maps

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.709 
testing around spawns on different maps
and<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:45.750> found<00:00:46.020> on<00:00:46.140> recovery<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:47.719> recovery

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
and we found on recovery that recovery

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.720 
and we found on recovery that recovery
has<00:00:48.960> actually<00:00:49.500> has<00:00:49.680> probably<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.100> best<00:00:50.190> spawn

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
has actually has probably the best spawn

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.119 
has actually has probably the best spawn
tractor<00:00:51.120> if<00:00:51.320> we're<00:00:52.320> still<00:00:52.620> debating<00:00:52.739> between

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
tractor if we're still debating between

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.930 
tractor if we're still debating between
recovery<00:00:54.120> by<00:00:54.300> lab<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.960> horizon<00:00:55.649> or<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.640> know

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
recovery by lab and horizon or I know

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.720 
recovery by lab and horizon or I know
you<00:00:57.000> probably<00:00:57.329> say<00:00:57.629> horizon<00:00:58.350> like<00:00:58.730> question

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
you probably say horizon like question

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.070 
you probably say horizon like question
mark<00:00:59.760> like<00:01:01.070> that's<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.160> terrible<00:01:02.520> map<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:03.180> guys

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
mark like that's a terrible map but guys

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.260 
mark like that's a terrible map but guys
for<00:01:04.439> uplink<00:01:04.799> horizon<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.640> great<00:01:05.970> spawn

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
for uplink horizon is a great spawn

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.219 
for uplink horizon is a great spawn
trapping<00:01:06.570> map<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:08.299> will<00:01:09.299> actually<00:01:09.450> be<00:01:09.659> bringing

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
trapping map I will actually be bringing

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.530 
trapping map I will actually be bringing
you<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> video<00:01:11.369> tutorial<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:12.090> how<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.330> spawn

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
you a video tutorial on how to spawn

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.410 
you a video tutorial on how to spawn
crap<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:12.930> every<00:01:13.290> one<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.439> these<00:01:13.590> maps<00:01:14.420> starting

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
crap on every one of these maps starting

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.260 
crap on every one of these maps starting
with<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.659> one<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.200> one<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.409> them<00:01:17.270> and

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
with this one this is one of them and

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.320 
with this one this is one of them and
we'll<00:01:19.259> go<00:01:19.380> from<00:01:19.500> there

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
we'll go from there

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.880 
we'll go from there
but<00:01:21.330> anyway<00:01:21.900> Aaron<00:01:22.290> actually<00:01:22.439> ended<00:01:22.799> up

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
but anyway Aaron actually ended up

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.730 
but anyway Aaron actually ended up
getting<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.600> world's<00:01:24.600> fastest<00:01:25.140> or<00:01:25.409> not<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
getting the world's fastest or not the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.679 
getting the world's fastest or not the
world's<00:01:25.950> fastest<00:01:26.280> like<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.939> world's<00:01:27.270> second

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
world's fastest like the world's second

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.910 
world's fastest like the world's second

fastest DNA bomb on this game and or in
this<00:01:32.040> game<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.570> it<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.780> because<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.380> this

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
this game and it is because of this

spawn<00:01:34.799> trap<00:01:35.070> now<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.909> actually<00:01:36.119> started<00:01:36.570> my

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
spawn trap now I actually started my

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.480 
spawn trap now I actually started my
spawn<00:01:37.020> trap<00:01:37.290> before<00:01:37.500> we<00:01:37.799> got<00:01:37.979> over<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.340> their

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
spawn trap before we got over to their

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.920 
spawn trap before we got over to their
right<00:01:39.150> side<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.829> need<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.159> be<00:01:41.280> on

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
right side so you you need to be on

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.590 
right side so you you need to be on
first<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.079> all<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:44.040> side<00:01:44.399> where<00:01:45.240> we<00:01:45.360> you're

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
first of all this side where we you're

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.120 
first of all this side where we you're
spawning<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.229> then<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.649> need<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.860> be<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
spawning and then you need to be on the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.399 
spawning and then you need to be on the
second<00:01:47.549> half<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.939> map<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.509> you'll<00:01:49.170> see

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
second half of the map and you'll see

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.280 
second half of the map and you'll see
right<00:01:49.560> here<00:01:49.799> in<00:01:49.979> my<00:01:50.189> spot<00:01:50.630> all<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:52.049> got<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.229> do
