wanted<00:00:07.770> me<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.859> demonstrate<00:00:08.130> sharpening

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
wanted me to demonstrate sharpening

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.490 
wanted me to demonstrate sharpening
methods<00:00:09.330> now<00:00:09.570> I've<00:00:09.719> gotten<00:00:09.990> this<00:00:10.080> question

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
methods now I've gotten this question

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.890 
methods now I've gotten this question
several<00:00:11.250> times<00:00:11.400> in<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.790> past<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.450> you<00:00:12.780> know<00:00:12.870> I

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
several times in the past and you know I

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.230 
several times in the past and you know I
never<00:00:13.049> really<00:00:13.349> got<00:00:13.559> around<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.370> in<00:00:15.150> the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
never really got around to it and in the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.519 
never really got around to it and in the
past<00:00:15.420> I've<00:00:15.540> always<00:00:15.630> use<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.900> little<00:00:15.960> whetstone

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
past I've always use a little whetstone

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.410 
past I've always use a little whetstone
basically<00:00:17.070> it's<00:00:17.190> just<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.520> stone<00:00:18.029> about<00:00:18.270> the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
basically it's just the stone about the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.349 
basically it's just the stone about the
same<00:00:18.660> size<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.410> just<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:20.010> know<00:00:20.330> run<00:00:21.330> your

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
same size and you just you know run your

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.650 
same size and you just you know run your
blade<00:00:21.810> down<00:00:22.050> keeping<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.529> angle<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:23.340> know

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
blade down keeping the angle you know

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.080 
blade down keeping the angle you know
consistent<00:00:24.660> but<00:00:25.609> recently<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.670> picked<00:00:26.880> up<00:00:26.939> a

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
consistent but recently I picked up a

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.150 
consistent but recently I picked up a
particle<00:00:27.359> sharp<00:00:27.750> maker<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.650> want<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.980> demo

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
particle sharp maker and I want to demo

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.070 
particle sharp maker and I want to demo
this<00:00:29.369> on<00:00:29.609> on<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.179> video<00:00:30.420> here<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.869> comes<00:00:31.019> a

this on on the video here so it comes a

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.520 
this on on the video here so it comes a
little<00:00:31.199> package<00:00:31.560> like<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:33.170> what<00:00:34.170> we<00:00:34.320> do

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
little package like this and what we do

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.100 
little package like this and what we do
is<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:34.950> would<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.219> open<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.790> up<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.239> inside

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
is we would just open it up and inside

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.660 
is we would just open it up and inside
they'll<00:00:37.469> be<00:00:37.620> your<00:00:37.829> sharpening<00:00:38.160> rod<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.579> you've

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
they'll be your sharpening rod so you've

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.330 
they'll be your sharpening rod so you've
got<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.940> course<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.750> define<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.800> outside

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
got the course and define on the outside

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.119 
got the course and define on the outside
and<00:00:41.670> then<00:00:41.790> underneath<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:43.129> course

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
and then underneath the the course

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.389 
and then underneath the the course
stones<00:00:44.430> you'll<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.180> have<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:46.100> rods<00:00:47.100> for

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
stones you'll just have the rods for

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.920 
stones you'll just have the rods for

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
just slip off the the rods here so what

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.240 
just slip off the the rods here so what
I'm<00:00:52.379> trying<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.620> do<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.890> I'm<00:00:53.010> trying<00:00:53.100> to

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
this thing has gotten a little bit dull

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.149 
this thing has gotten a little bit dull
show<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.750> what<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.930> mean<00:01:04.110> here's<00:01:04.680> an<00:01:04.799> ordinary

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
show you what I mean here's an ordinary

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.240 
show you what I mean here's an ordinary
piece<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.430> paper<00:01:05.610> here<00:01:06.350> it<00:01:07.350> still<00:01:07.680> cuts<00:01:07.979> but

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
piece of paper here it still cuts but

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.170 
piece of paper here it still cuts but
it's<00:01:08.340> like<00:01:08.460> tearing<00:01:08.970> into<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.360> paper<00:01:09.600> now<00:01:09.840> and

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
it's like tearing into the paper now and

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.969 
it's like tearing into the paper now and
see<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.210> mean<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:12.780> just<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.530> actually<00:01:13.830> not<00:01:13.920> a

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
see I mean it's just it's actually not a

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.020 
see I mean it's just it's actually not a
very<00:01:14.070> straight<00:01:14.490> cut<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:15.720> know<00:01:15.810> like<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:17.030> can

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
very straight cut you know like I can

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.090 
very straight cut you know like I can
cut<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:18.479> see<00:01:19.259> like<00:01:19.380> it's<00:01:19.710> actually<00:01:19.830> just

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
cut this see like it's actually just

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.100 
cut this see like it's actually just
tearing<00:01:20.990> so<00:01:21.990> hopefully<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.680> can<00:01:22.890> get<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:24.110> to

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
tearing so hopefully I can get it to to

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.260 
tearing so hopefully I can get it to to
about<00:01:25.290> Spyderco<00:01:25.710> sharp<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.790> what<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:26.970> want

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
about Spyderco sharp this is what I want

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.310 
about Spyderco sharp this is what I want
to<00:01:27.360> be<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:28.850> perfectly<00:01:29.850> straight<00:01:30.659> cut<00:01:30.900> that's

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
to be a perfectly straight cut that's

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.440 
to be a perfectly straight cut that's
exactly<00:01:31.829> what<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.009> want<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.369> know<00:01:32.400> just<00:01:32.520> nice

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
exactly what I want you know just nice

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.920 
exactly what I want you know just nice
and<00:01:33.930> sharp<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:35.100> 14<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.880> 10<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.479> not<00:01:36.659> really

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
and sharp this 14 to 10 is not really

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.109 
and sharp this 14 to 10 is not really
doing<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.200> slipping<00:01:37.860> off<00:01:38.009> its<00:01:38.460> if<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.939> cuts

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
doing it slipping off its if it cuts

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.080 
doing it slipping off its if it cuts
getting<00:01:39.390> like<00:01:39.509> all<00:01:39.689> rounded<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:41.009> see<00:01:41.850> like<00:01:42.000> a

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
getting like all rounded and see like a

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.609 
getting like all rounded and see like a
tears<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.479> paper<00:01:42.630> idea<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.110> let's<00:01:43.320> see<00:01:43.439> if<00:01:43.530> we

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
tears of paper idea so let's see if we

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.350 
tears of paper idea so let's see if we
can<00:01:43.829> use<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> spiral<00:01:44.490> sharp<00:01:44.700> maker<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.090> get<00:01:45.210> this

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
can use a spiral sharp maker to get this

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.789 
can use a spiral sharp maker to get this
to<00:01:45.540> as<00:01:45.780> sharp<00:01:46.140> as<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:47.159> spiral<00:01:47.670> Chokwe<00:01:48.799> all

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
to as sharp as this spiral Chokwe all

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.010 
to as sharp as this spiral Chokwe all
right<00:01:49.950> some<00:01:50.250> we'll<00:01:50.369> put<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.640> right<00:01:50.850> here

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
right some we'll put that right here

off<00:02:08.429> I'm<00:02:08.580> going<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.729> set<00:02:08.940> my<00:02:09.119> protecting<00:02:09.660> my

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
off I'm going to set my protecting my

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.990 
off I'm going to set my protecting my
protecting<00:02:10.649> rods<00:02:10.860> here<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.340> know<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.819> lot<00:02:11.970> of

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
protecting rods here I know a lot of

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.400 
protecting rods here I know a lot of
people<00:02:12.209> don't<00:02:12.330> like<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.629> use<00:02:12.780> these<00:02:12.989> I<00:02:13.200> just

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
people don't like to use these I just

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.980 
people don't like to use these I just
use<00:02:13.560> them<00:02:13.680> just

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
use them just

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.480 
use them just
because<00:02:14.170> you<00:02:14.470> know<00:02:15.330> safety<00:02:16.330> first<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:18.310> I'm

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
because you know safety first so I'm

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.460 
because you know safety first so I'm
only<00:02:18.880> going<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.150> be<00:02:19.270> probably<00:02:19.630> using<00:02:20.050> just<00:02:20.260> the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
only going to be probably using just the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.280 
only going to be probably using just the
just<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.550> corners<00:02:22.090> here<00:02:22.390> because<00:02:22.960> it's<00:02:23.110> a

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
just the corners here because it's a

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.850 
just the corners here because it's a
sharp<00:02:24.130> maker<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:25.690> rods<00:02:26.170> are<00:02:26.350> in<00:02:26.470> a<00:02:26.530> triangle

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
sharp maker the rods are in a triangle

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.470 
sharp maker the rods are in a triangle
shape<00:02:26.980> so<00:02:27.460> you<00:02:27.490> can<00:02:27.670> either<00:02:27.790> have<00:02:28.150> it<00:02:28.330> a

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
shape so you can either have it a

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.150 
shape so you can either have it a
position<00:02:29.140> like<00:02:29.170> this<00:02:29.350> where<00:02:29.710> you<00:02:29.800> use<00:02:29.920> have<00:02:30.130> a

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
position like this where you use have a

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.940 
position like this where you use have a
flat<00:02:30.460> size<00:02:30.760> flat<00:02:31.480> side<00:02:31.780> or<00:02:32.350> you<00:02:32.590> can<00:02:32.620> position

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
flat size flat side or you can position

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.590 
flat size flat side or you can position
it<00:02:33.070> like<00:02:33.160> this<00:02:33.340> we<00:02:33.520> just<00:02:33.580> have<00:02:33.820> have<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.240> sharp

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
it like this we just have have the sharp

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.540 
it like this we just have have the sharp
corner<00:02:34.990> so<00:02:35.410> let<00:02:35.530> start<00:02:35.590> sharp<00:02:35.980> corners<00:02:36.310> maybe

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
corner so let start sharp corners maybe

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.440 
corner so let start sharp corners maybe
a<00:02:36.640> few<00:02:36.850> swipes<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:38.040> get<00:02:39.040> in<00:02:39.160> nice<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.270> you<00:02:40.420> know

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
a few swipes to get in nice and you know

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.640 
a few swipes to get in nice and you know
get<00:02:40.660> some<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.900> metal<00:02:41.200> off<00:02:41.350> of<00:02:41.380> there<00:02:41.620> so

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
get some of the metal off of there so

what<00:03:20.170> i'm<00:03:20.260> doing<00:03:20.410> here<00:03:20.590> is<00:03:20.800> i'm<00:03:21.040> just

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
what i'm doing here is i'm just

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.490 
what i'm doing here is i'm just
basically<00:03:21.310> moving<00:03:21.820> a<00:03:21.880> lot<00:03:22.000> of<00:03:22.120> metal<00:03:22.390> and<00:03:23.080> you

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
basically moving a lot of metal and you

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.680 
basically moving a lot of metal and you
can<00:03:23.620> tell<00:03:23.860> because<00:03:24.090> my<00:03:25.090> fingers<00:03:25.150> are<00:03:25.510> clean

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
can tell because my fingers are clean

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.390 
can tell because my fingers are clean
right<00:03:25.900> now<00:03:25.990> but<00:03:26.260> if<00:03:26.380> i<00:03:26.500> run<00:03:26.740> my<00:03:26.860> finger<00:03:27.130> up<00:03:27.250> this

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
right now but if i run my finger up this

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.260 
right now but if i run my finger up this
way<00:03:27.610> that's<00:03:28.270> actually<00:03:28.570> dark<00:03:28.810> so<00:03:30.120> so<00:03:31.120> there's<00:03:31.240> a

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
way that's actually dark so so there's a

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.670 
way that's actually dark so so there's a
little<00:03:31.450> bit<00:03:31.540> dark<00:03:31.810> basically<00:03:32.320> I<00:03:32.410> see<00:03:32.470> metal

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
little bit dark basically I see metal

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.830 
little bit dark basically I see metal
coming<00:03:32.950> off<00:03:33.130> of<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:33.610> blade<00:03:33.790> itself<00:03:36.840> maybe

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
coming off of the blade itself maybe

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:51.110 
coming off of the blade itself maybe
another<00:03:38.080> another<00:03:38.410> five<00:03:38.740> on<00:03:38.920> your<00:03:39.040> side<00:03:39.280> here

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.540 

so<00:03:52.170> so<00:03:53.170> being<00:03:53.470> careful<00:03:53.650> because<00:03:54.040> I<00:03:54.130> want<00:03:54.490> to

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
so so being careful because I want to

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.950 
so so being careful because I want to
keep<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.790> same<00:03:54.970> angle<00:03:55.000> here<00:03:55.510> and<00:03:55.660> you<00:03:55.750> want<00:03:55.900> to

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
keep the same angle here and you want to

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.570 
keep the same angle here and you want to
run<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.260> entire<00:03:56.530> length<00:03:56.770> of<00:03:56.890> blade<00:03:57.040> so<00:03:57.340> I<00:03:57.400> did

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
run the entire length of blade so I did

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.520 
run the entire length of blade so I did
drawing<00:03:57.880> down<00:03:58.000> I'm<00:03:58.210> kind<00:03:58.390> of<00:03:58.420> angling<00:03:58.870> my<00:03:58.900> hand

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
drawing down I'm kind of angling my hand

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.150 
drawing down I'm kind of angling my hand
down<00:03:59.710> on<00:04:00.550> each<00:04:00.730> side<00:04:01.000> to<00:04:01.600> get<00:04:01.810> you<00:04:02.590> know<00:04:02.710> to<00:04:03.010> get

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
down on each side to get you know to get

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.440 
down on each side to get you know to get
the<00:04:03.280> entire<00:04:03.550> blade<00:04:04.120> covered<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:04.840> know<00:04:04.960> so<00:04:06.450> so

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
the entire blade covered you know so so

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.880 
the entire blade covered you know so so
let's<00:04:07.600> go<00:04:07.720> ahead<00:04:07.780> and<00:04:07.990> just<00:04:08.260> just<00:04:08.500> put<00:04:08.650> this<00:04:08.770> on

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
let's go ahead and just just put this on

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.710 
let's go ahead and just just put this on
the<00:04:09.010> flat<00:04:09.220> side<00:04:09.430> really<00:04:09.790> quick<00:04:10.000> and<00:04:10.180> we'll<00:04:10.570> run

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
the flat side really quick and we'll run

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.360 
the flat side really quick and we'll run
a<00:04:10.750> couple<00:04:10.930> swipes<00:04:11.230> down<00:04:11.470> this<00:04:11.620> way<00:04:11.800> as<00:04:11.920> well<00:04:12.100> so

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
a couple swipes down this way as well so

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.930 
a couple swipes down this way as well so
again<00:04:13.360> keeping<00:04:13.870> the<00:04:13.990> angle<00:04:14.320> a<00:04:14.530> constant<00:04:15.070> like

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
again keeping the angle a constant like

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:24.420 
again keeping the angle a constant like
this

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.700 

alright<00:04:25.780> that's<00:04:26.780> feeling<00:04:27.020> that's<00:04:27.470> being<00:04:27.650> a

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
alright that's feeling that's being a

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:28.629 
alright that's feeling that's being a
little<00:04:27.980> bit<00:04:28.100> sharper

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639

you guys have it so it's that simple
using<00:05:37.520> the<00:05:37.729> Spyderco<00:05:38.690> sharp<00:05:38.960> maker<00:05:39.169> to<00:05:39.560> just

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
using the Spyderco sharp maker to just

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.750 
using the Spyderco sharp maker to just
bring<00:05:40.580> up<00:05:40.729> your<00:05:41.090> your<00:05:41.539> your<00:05:42.320> dull<00:05:43.190> blades<00:05:43.490> here

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
so as I demonstrated this is the HK 14

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:48.940 
so as I demonstrated this is the HK 14
to<00:05:46.820> 10<00:05:47.090> and<00:05:47.300> when<00:05:48.169> I<00:05:48.200> first<00:05:48.350> brought<00:05:48.650> this<00:05:48.770> out

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
to 10 and when I first brought this out

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.260 
to 10 and when I first brought this out
on<00:05:49.070> video<00:05:49.250> you<00:05:49.550> notice<00:05:49.729> it<00:05:49.850> wasn't<00:05:50.090> really

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
on video you notice it wasn't really

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.610 
on video you notice it wasn't really
cutting<00:05:50.539> very<00:05:50.690> easily<00:05:50.930> it<00:05:51.169> was<00:05:51.260> tearing<00:05:51.590> the

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
cutting very easily it was tearing the

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.920 
cutting very easily it was tearing the
paper<00:05:51.830> and<00:05:52.490> I<00:05:52.610> did<00:05:52.760> like<00:05:52.880> a<00:05:52.940> nice<00:05:53.210> slash<00:05:53.600> to<00:05:53.840> the

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
paper and I did like a nice slash to the

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.560 
paper and I did like a nice slash to the
page<00:05:54.140> it<00:05:54.410> would<00:05:54.890> just<00:05:55.070> tear<00:05:55.250> the<00:05:55.400> paper<00:05:55.550> it<00:05:56.390> was

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
page it would just tear the paper it was

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.540 
page it would just tear the paper it was
nothing<00:05:57.140> it<00:05:57.470> was<00:05:57.650> basically<00:05:58.039> nothing<00:05:58.220> close

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
nothing it was basically nothing close

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.460 
nothing it was basically nothing close

to that sparkle chalk way so now after
you<00:06:01.070> know<00:06:01.310> basically<00:06:02.000> 40<00:06:02.390> swipes<00:06:02.690> 45<00:06:03.590> swipes<00:06:03.919> I

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
you know basically 40 swipes 45 swipes I

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:06.370 
you know basically 40 swipes 45 swipes I
believe<00:06:04.280> so<00:06:05.030> they've<00:06:05.210> got<00:06:05.570> like<00:06:05.780> I<00:06:06.020> believe

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
believe so they've got like I believe

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.969 
believe so they've got like I believe
that<00:06:06.710> 25<00:06:07.669> on<00:06:07.970> the<00:06:08.270> on<00:06:09.020> the<00:06:09.140> course<00:06:09.380> stones<00:06:09.650> and

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:09.979 
that 25 on the on the course stones and

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:13.420 
that 25 on the on the course stones and
then<00:06:10.100> just<00:06:10.430> 20<00:06:10.789> on<00:06:11.090> the<00:06:11.300> fine<00:06:12.289> stones<00:06:12.620> fine

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
then just 20 on the fine stones fine

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.159 
then just 20 on the fine stones fine
rods<00:06:13.669> and<00:06:14.479> look<00:06:14.660> at<00:06:14.780> it<00:06:14.870> it's<00:06:15.080> basically

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:15.169 
rods and look at it it's basically

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:17.409 
rods and look at it it's basically
slicing<00:06:15.740> there<00:06:15.830> champ<00:06:16.100> I<00:06:16.250> bet<00:06:16.430> you<00:06:16.550> if<00:06:16.610> I<00:06:16.700> if<00:06:17.300> I

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:17.419 
slicing there champ I bet you if I if I

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:20.469 
slicing there champ I bet you if I if I
do<00:06:17.479> a<00:06:17.630> couple<00:06:17.960> more<00:06:18.110> on<00:06:18.260> the<00:06:18.940> fine<00:06:19.940> stones<00:06:20.240> here

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 
do a couple more on the fine stones here

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:22.120 
do a couple more on the fine stones here
is<00:06:20.630> probably<00:06:20.780> cut<00:06:21.140> just<00:06:21.380> like<00:06:21.470> that<00:06:21.710> chalk<00:06:21.919> way
