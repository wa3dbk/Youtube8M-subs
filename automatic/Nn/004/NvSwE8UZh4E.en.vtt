00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.090
 the blender 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.940
 we put a little water 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.170
 and we are going to strain it 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.170
 since it is well liquefied 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.760
 and we do the same again but this 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.680

 that's to taste 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.860
 and so we have to stay 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.440
 for the mass 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:48.520
 we are going to put a little butter and 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.520
 now let's knead 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:04:00.570
 we are going to knead it 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.570
 Now we throw the baking powder 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.739

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:17.030
 we knead it again 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.030
 and we take half a cup of 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.690

 we put salt to your liking 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:32.750
 and again we put it back 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.750
 what is butter 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.930
 the rest of butter 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.040
 we are pouring water little by little 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.270
 and that's how we have to stay 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.270
 little watery dough 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.960
 but do not have a guard 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:56.220
 now we are going to need 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.680
 the banana leaves 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.060
 we're going to put them in a I'll be with 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.770
 hot water 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.969
 for 10 minutes 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:10.110
 and now we are going to prepare the 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:10.110
 take tamales 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.590
 and this is how we prepare 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.430
 is going to wrap 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.330
 I do not know how to wrap that way 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:49.930
 now in the pot where we are going to cook the 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:52.210
 tamales we are going to cover them with aluminum 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.479
 and inside the alumina we are going to put 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.660
 the tamales and with the same aluminum what 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:00.290
 let's cover 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.290
 all right 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:11.620
 we put water 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.620
 in the middle of the pot 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.740
 and we're going to cover it with a bag 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:23.460
 so that it is well deposit 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.610

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:29.060
 in knowing each other and that's how we are left
