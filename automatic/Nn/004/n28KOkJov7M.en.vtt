00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:11.240
 That marker Takesan has a great deal of attention and is really a position 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:13.780
 Not pay to shoot ten thousand and one 2.1 million Toka that Well up there but I was made to use the equipment 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.860
 But it is a little more 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.170
 that 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:27.250
 First of all, from the grip to make it a Yankee or something of the era car Yankee specification 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:30.430
 It seems that the flight light tuning of the soft grid to change 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:34.850
 I What 's more their likes music 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:40.339
 Toka because comfortably listen to creating an environment was still of the Inspector 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.239
 I would like to understand and introduce the cable such that there do Dechotto high sound quality of the cormorant 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:43.510
 Was 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.600
 Now I Regards 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:51.370
 I have 3 amazing eyes and I'm an expectant dentist 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.910
 But there is somewhere in Do Why the final guess this is horse racing that ELEC 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.360
 oyaide d + series 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.660
 Yeah, it's a cable, but when I say something like this 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.690
 That dj 6 type brain that lecturer 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.930
 In the Akiba called ELEC electricity 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:11.970
 We are selling bend without electric shop 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:16.020
 I'm say the body has been developed there Well dj for I'm certain is the capital 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:23.710
 Might have people look pretty even but it is famous for this so-site 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:26.590
 Oh yeah 8 rc no ordinary red and white cables accompanies the benefits 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:32.560
 Yeah Toka What 's please adults set 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:36.340
 usb cable jsb is also for ton pcdj it sounds like this awesome usb 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.390
 I say it really changes the sound in type blue 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.550
 The next time is that 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.550
 It is theoretically digital signal Why 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:50.200
 Really that I will hear good to Tteyuu'll do so much change the 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:55.430
 Changes Are you sure you want've entered is okay 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.400
 I also contract and say first I was skeptical I Uchi et al charged 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.880
 I thought so but 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:08.020
 In fact, try it a little 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:09.160
 It was different with your friend, but clearly the sound of the troubled feeling up to now is very sharp 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.590
 Become visible 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.590
 I actually used this, though 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.440
 d + This it is at the bottom of the play of the series 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.040
 Color b 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.790
 b in the sense of so folks orange 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:33.040
 It's grade about two increases on the Do composer 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:35.830
 Imperial virtue constantly everyone's in this perhaps that purple alone with this cable 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.840
 I do not think solar after that 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:44.010
 I think it's twice a round , but I'm not sure if it 's true or not 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.010
 It is not from the next issue May 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.650
 The sound is completely different even with this alone 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.700
 Boo Boo 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:17.510
 But it seems like I didn't test it because I realized it was amazing 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.490
 Well from such a defeat 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.930
 Try changing it 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:25.890
 I also an array of say Kikuitteyuu create an environment with the feeling their favorite back feels good sound 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.600
 Is it not? 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:33.740
 I made a mistake at yeah 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:40.460
 After all that, for example, anyone can do something like this 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:47.180
 Well, artists, those artists you like are recording 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:53.420
 Uma Achotto cone it to No to say it Dae-eun Recording on the Yappa good environment 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.730
 Gyogu's last Is the I is strong Kana Toka bass is weak Kana whether various doing Well Mitch ring 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.340
 I will 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:02.569
 I'm finally ready to release the ring work 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:06.080
 The information in, for example, the Tteyuu Toka mp3 is 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:08.960
 A not Well have a so-called compression 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.500
 As an artist, that's a great nine . 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:15.250
 If I say anything or it against what you made 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.720
 How spoiled to some extent 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:23.370
 It's not really your own sound because you 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.270
 Well that kind of that kind of good mp3 is great 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.379
 file size light 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:32.350
 Neither is it intended to be denied itself in good convenient 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:35.410
 I think that I got that citizenship 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:41.650
 The real feeling is a sound that should go 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:42.940
 So I think the Fu say so and Do not want to hear my song When you have from the artist 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.729
 And total 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.020
 If you've heard after all therefore I wish I was I want to honor the things that really good 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:54.060
 truly 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:57.840
 That 's right, but everyone is told that even with coding years it will change with a single cable 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.230
 Also Well musician who over great Yappa money 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.060
 It looks like in management 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:06.530
 It is in Zara 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.630
 If you look at it from ordinary people, there may be many who think like that 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:14.690
 But that's too expensive 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:21.169
 If you wanted to listen to the log is to Yeah Well kind of things like that of 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:21.940
 2 I just want to choose a cable a little bit of what I have heard so far 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:26.110
 Follow 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:30.910
 That much more information that well 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:34.060
 I think that the source part that asks for the artist is coming to light 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:39.070
 I thought I mp3 Nomou 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.970
 Though I think that there are various bit rates and various things that color is intense, it seems like really low bit rates 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:45.110
 In such feeling 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:48.160
 It is really I'm some sad that fine it and would be heard 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.160
 I mean
