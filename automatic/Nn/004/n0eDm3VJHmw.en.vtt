00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
sounds like they're gonna pick a public

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.620 
sounds like they're gonna pick a public

venue for their ambush I'm not gonna let
that<00:00:15.660> happen

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.710 

this<00:00:21.860> convoy<00:00:22.370> mission<00:00:22.760> is<00:00:22.940> one<00:00:23.240> of<00:00:23.390> the<00:00:23.510> most

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
this convoy mission is one of the most

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.040 
this convoy mission is one of the most
difficult<00:00:24.400> it's<00:00:25.400> like<00:00:25.790> a<00:00:26.060> difficulty<00:00:26.780> for

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
difficult it's like a difficulty for

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.570 
difficult it's like a difficulty for
stars<00:00:27.380> from<00:00:27.620> five<00:00:29.710> more<00:00:30.710> difficult<00:00:31.160> is<00:00:31.310> only

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
stars from five more difficult is only

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.380 
stars from five more difficult is only
the<00:00:31.970> last<00:00:32.540> mission<00:00:33.370> so<00:00:34.370> for<00:00:34.610> this<00:00:34.700> convoy<00:00:35.240> I

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
the last mission so for this convoy I

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.650 
the last mission so for this convoy I
need<00:00:35.660> more<00:00:36.280> armored<00:00:37.280> vehicle<00:00:37.640> armored<00:00:38.510> or

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
need more armored vehicle armored or

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.900 
need more armored vehicle armored or
ambulance<00:00:39.440> is<00:00:39.620> perfect<00:00:40.040> so<00:00:40.370> that<00:00:40.580> is<00:00:40.700> why<00:00:40.880> I

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
ambulance is perfect so that is why I

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.820 
ambulance is perfect so that is why I
took<00:00:41.059> ambulance<00:00:43.570> why<00:00:44.570> this<00:00:44.629> corner<00:00:45.140> convoy<00:00:45.710> is

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
took ambulance why this corner convoy is

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.710 
took ambulance why this corner convoy is
difficult<00:00:46.370> because<00:00:47.800> there<00:00:48.800> are<00:00:48.950> two<00:00:49.160> targets

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
difficult because there are two targets

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.260 
difficult because there are two targets
that<00:00:50.720> you<00:00:51.110> cannot<00:00:51.500> kill<00:00:51.910> there<00:00:52.910> are<00:00:53.030> six

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
that you cannot kill there are six

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.260 
that you cannot kill there are six
vehicles<00:00:53.540> and<00:00:54.050> there<00:00:54.800> are<00:00:54.950> two<00:00:55.160> in<00:00:55.550> forces

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
vehicles and there are two in forces

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.370 
vehicles and there are two in forces
pretty<00:00:56.630> strong<00:00:57.079> and<00:00:58.690> actually<00:00:59.690> it's<00:00:59.870> easy<00:01:00.170> to

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
pretty strong and actually it's easy to

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.180 
pretty strong and actually it's easy to
stop<00:01:00.680> them

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
stop them

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.930 
stop them
and<00:01:01.900> but<00:01:02.900> later<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:03.590> problem<00:01:04.130> is<00:01:04.309> what<00:01:04.759> will

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
and but later the problem is what will

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.060 
and but later the problem is what will
happen<00:01:05.150> after<00:01:05.660> you<00:01:05.780> stop<00:01:06.050> them<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:06.560> they<00:01:06.830> will

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
happen after you stop them so they will

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.670 
happen after you stop them so they will
all<00:01:07.280> attack<00:01:07.700> you<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.030> to<00:01:08.270> enforces<00:01:08.990> will<00:01:09.229> rush

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
all attack you and to enforces will rush

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.490 
all attack you and to enforces will rush
to<00:01:09.710> you<00:01:10.390> so<00:01:11.390> that<00:01:11.570> is<00:01:11.690> why<00:01:11.899> you<00:01:11.930> need<00:01:12.200> heavy

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
to you so that is why you need heavy

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.999 
to you so that is why you need heavy
armored<00:01:12.920> vehicle<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:14.050> you<00:01:15.050> cannot<00:01:15.320> enforce

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
armored vehicle and you cannot enforce

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.130 
armored vehicle and you cannot enforce
us<00:01:16.190> usually<00:01:16.670> run<00:01:16.880> with<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:17.270> target<00:01:17.630> directly

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
us usually run with the target directly

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.310 
us usually run with the target directly
so<00:01:18.320> it's<00:01:18.530> difficult<00:01:19.070> to<00:01:19.190> use<00:01:19.220> explosives<00:01:20.320> so

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
so it's difficult to use explosives so

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.139 
so it's difficult to use explosives so
that<00:01:21.590> what<00:01:21.950> I<00:01:21.979> will<00:01:22.190> do<00:01:22.369> I<00:01:22.550> will<00:01:22.580> disrupt

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
that what I will do I will disrupt

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.510 
that what I will do I will disrupt
traffic<00:01:23.479> a<00:01:23.750> little<00:01:23.869> bit<00:01:24.080> to<00:01:24.440> have<00:01:25.040> some<00:01:25.280> time

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
traffic a little bit to have some time

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.399 
traffic a little bit to have some time
for<00:01:25.549> preparation<00:01:26.000> this<00:01:26.840> is<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.140> perfect

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
for preparation this is the perfect

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.649 
for preparation this is the perfect
ambush<00:01:27.920> point<00:01:28.280> this<00:01:28.610> is<00:01:28.790> a<00:01:28.880> steam<00:01:29.150> pipe<00:01:29.360> and

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
ambush point this is a steam pipe and

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.469 
ambush point this is a steam pipe and
there<00:01:30.229> is<00:01:30.350> a<00:01:30.380> bridge<00:01:30.680> in<00:01:30.860> front<00:01:31.159> so<00:01:31.909> actually

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
there is a bridge in front so actually

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.520 
there is a bridge in front so actually
there<00:01:32.630> are<00:01:32.750> two<00:01:32.930> typical<00:01:33.640> points<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:36.200> steam

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
there are two typical points the steam

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.520 
there are two typical points the steam
pipe<00:01:36.799> and<00:01:37.100> also<00:01:37.700> you<00:01:37.909> can<00:01:38.240> open<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.320> bridge

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
pipe and also you can open the bridge

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.590 
pipe and also you can open the bridge
between<00:01:39.860> two<00:01:40.190> targets<00:01:40.610> but<00:01:40.790> that's<00:01:41.360> difficult

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
between two targets but that's difficult

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.870 
between two targets but that's difficult
to<00:01:41.900> do<00:01:42.080> so<00:01:42.290> now<00:01:42.500> what<00:01:42.860> I<00:01:42.890> will<00:01:43.040> do<00:01:43.340> I<00:01:43.549> will

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
to do so now what I will do I will

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.660 
to do so now what I will do I will
explode<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:44.900> steam<00:01:45.170> pipe<00:01:45.440> and<00:01:45.799> try<00:01:46.190> to<00:01:46.250> take

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
explode the steam pipe and try to take

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.480 
explode the steam pipe and try to take
over<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:47.420> first<00:01:47.900> vehicle<00:01:48.470> within<00:01:48.770> forces

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
over the first vehicle within forces

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.200 
over the first vehicle within forces
also<00:01:50.270> I<00:01:50.450> will<00:01:50.840> place<00:01:51.470> a<00:01:51.740> lot<00:01:51.890> of<00:01:52.010> bombs<00:01:52.310> but

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
also I will place a lot of bombs but

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.399 
also I will place a lot of bombs but
mostly<00:01:53.689> what<00:01:54.350> is<00:01:54.500> my<00:01:54.710> purpose<00:01:54.950> I<00:01:55.930> will<00:01:56.930> bombs

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
mostly what is my purpose I will bombs

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.000 
mostly what is my purpose I will bombs
put<00:01:57.950> bombs<00:01:58.189> a<00:01:58.400> little<00:01:58.880> bit<00:01:59.060> more<00:01:59.360> far<00:02:00.010> what

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
put bombs a little bit more far what

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.990 
put bombs a little bit more far what
will<00:02:01.189> happen<00:02:01.670> that<00:02:03.100> vehicle<00:02:04.100> with<00:02:04.310> enforcer

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
will happen that vehicle with enforcer

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.320 
will happen that vehicle with enforcer
later<00:02:05.299> will<00:02:05.720> rush<00:02:06.380> to<00:02:06.680> chase<00:02:06.979> me<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:07.490> I<00:02:08.090> will

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
later will rush to chase me and I will

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
later will rush to chase me and I will
try<00:02:08.540> to<00:02:08.660> lure<00:02:09.080> them<00:02:09.500> into<00:02:09.739> that<00:02:10.100> bombs<00:02:10.429> and

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
try to lure them into that bombs and

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.590 
try to lure them into that bombs and
later<00:02:12.350> I<00:02:12.470> will<00:02:12.769> try<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.010> explode<00:02:13.519> explode<00:02:14.360> them

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
later I will try to explode explode them

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.449 
later I will try to explode explode them
so<00:02:15.140> anyway<00:02:15.560> my<00:02:16.250> purpose<00:02:16.910> is<00:02:17.120> by

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
so anyway my purpose is by

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.780 
so anyway my purpose is by
firstly<00:02:20.390> take<00:02:20.720> over<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:21.890> first<00:02:22.159> vehicle<00:02:22.579> with

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
firstly take over the first vehicle with

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.130 
firstly take over the first vehicle with
the<00:02:22.939> enforcer<00:02:23.629> and<00:02:24.400> later<00:02:25.400> targets<00:02:26.000> will<00:02:26.269> go

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
the enforcer and later targets will go

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.360 
the enforcer and later targets will go
down<00:02:27.790> go<00:02:28.790> get<00:02:29.060> out<00:02:29.209> of<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:29.599> vehicle<00:02:30.099> but<00:02:31.099> later

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
down go get out of the vehicle but later
