and I think it's kind of perfect for

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.850 
and I think it's kind of perfect for
like<00:04:24.400> springtime<00:04:25.030> and<00:04:25.930> summer<00:04:26.260> anything<00:04:26.710> kind

like springtime and summer anything kind

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.320 
like springtime and summer anything kind
of<00:04:26.980> all<00:04:27.220> your<00:04:27.400> ground<00:04:27.639> metallics<00:04:28.030> just<00:04:28.180> kind

of all your ground metallics just kind
of<00:04:28.360> go<00:04:28.480> all<00:04:28.690> year<00:04:28.840> round<00:04:29.020> and<00:04:29.320> then<00:04:29.620> this<00:04:29.710> is

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
of go all year round and then this is

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.380 
of go all year round and then this is
like<00:04:29.889> a<00:04:30.040> metallic<00:04:30.460> gold<00:04:30.610> it's<00:04:30.880> a<00:04:30.940> very<00:04:31.150> like

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
like a metallic gold it's a very like

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.580 
like a metallic gold it's a very like
subtle<00:04:31.630> cool<00:04:31.900> that's<00:04:32.110> not<00:04:32.230> like<00:04:32.380> in-your-face

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
subtle cool that's not like in-your-face

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.190 
subtle cool that's not like in-your-face
like<00:04:33.220> BAM<00:04:33.460> gold<00:04:33.970> with<00:04:34.390> gaudy<00:04:34.690> gold<00:04:34.900> but<00:04:35.169> I

like BAM gold with gaudy gold but I

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.080 
like BAM gold with gaudy gold but I
think<00:04:35.470> it's<00:04:35.590> really<00:04:35.770> pretty<00:04:36.010> really<00:04:36.730> subtle

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
think it's really pretty really subtle

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.550 
think it's really pretty really subtle
it's<00:04:37.270> almost<00:04:37.390> like<00:04:37.540> a<00:04:37.630> brown<00:04:37.900> like<00:04:38.110> in<00:04:38.230> that<00:04:38.380> in

it's almost like a brown like in that in
the<00:04:38.710> neutral<00:04:39.070> family<00:04:39.430> but<00:04:39.580> it's<00:04:39.730> definitely<00:04:39.910> a

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
the neutral family but it's definitely a

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.520 
the neutral family but it's definitely a
shimmer<00:04:40.480> gold<00:04:40.690> and<00:04:40.870> they<00:04:40.930> think<00:04:41.080> it's<00:04:41.200> really

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
shimmer gold and they think it's really

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.870 
shimmer gold and they think it's really
really<00:04:41.800> pretty<00:04:41.980> so<00:04:42.220> those<00:04:42.370> are<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:42.580> two<00:04:42.730> that
