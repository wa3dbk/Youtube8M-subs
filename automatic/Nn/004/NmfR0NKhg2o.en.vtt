to<00:03:52.829> be<00:03:52.859> really<00:03:53.160> good<00:03:53.190> 91<00:03:53.940> and<00:03:54.319> his<00:03:55.319> pace<00:03:55.560> was

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
to be really good 91 and his pace was

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.740 
to be really good 91 and his pace was
decent<00:03:56.340> i<00:03:56.430> wouldn't<00:03:56.669> say<00:03:56.790> felt<00:03:57.060> any<00:03:57.180> faster<00:03:57.660> or

decent i wouldn't say felt any faster or
slower<00:03:57.930> than<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.290> 81<00:03:58.680> pace<00:03:58.829> he<00:03:58.980> did<00:03:59.130> feel<00:03:59.280> like

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
slower than the 81 pace he did feel like

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.530 
slower than the 81 pace he did feel like
the<00:04:00.660> sets<00:04:00.989> a<00:04:01.200> and<00:04:01.669> i<00:04:02.669> was<00:04:03.000> heading<00:04:03.239> i<00:04:03.329> didn't
