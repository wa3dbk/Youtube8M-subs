00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
for and rear textured disc brakes I'll

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.020 
for and rear textured disc brakes I'll
write<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.010> lot<00:02:44.639> of<00:02:44.849> really<00:02:45.120> steep<00:02:45.389> stuff<00:02:46.639> so<00:02:47.639> I

so<00:03:08.730> much<00:03:08.819> the<00:03:08.969> seat<00:03:09.209> I<00:03:09.359> mean<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.599> seat<00:03:09.810> isn't

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
so much the seat I mean the seat isn't

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.259 
so much the seat I mean the seat isn't
really<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.439> comfortable<00:03:11.030> but<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.120> mean

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
really that comfortable but I mean

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.759 
really that comfortable but I mean
that's<00:03:12.419> just<00:03:12.569> kind<00:03:12.689> of<00:03:12.780> be<00:03:12.959> expected<00:03:13.500> as<00:03:13.650> you

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
that's just kind of be expected as you

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.500 
that's just kind of be expected as you
can<00:03:13.859> see<00:03:13.980> right<00:03:14.129> now<00:03:14.189> mine<00:03:14.609> is<00:03:14.760> way<00:03:15.000> too<00:03:15.060> far

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
can see right now mine is way too far

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.039 
can see right now mine is way too far
back<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:16.579> that's<00:03:17.579> just<00:03:17.760> because<00:03:17.909> it<00:03:18.750> comes

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
back and that's just because it comes

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.240 
back and that's just because it comes
loose<00:03:19.319> and<00:03:19.620> slides<00:03:19.919> back<00:03:20.280> on<00:03:20.549> its<00:03:20.729> own<00:03:20.909> I<00:03:21.180> mean

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
loose and slides back on its own I mean

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.770 
loose and slides back on its own I mean
it's<00:03:23.250> not<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:23.430> big<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:23.819> a<00:03:23.970> promise<00:03:24.359> just<00:03:24.599> do

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
it's not that big of a promise just do

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.599 
it's not that big of a promise just do
something<00:03:24.989> you<00:03:25.109> have<00:03:25.199> to<00:03:25.290> adjust<00:03:25.620> but<00:03:26.340> as<00:03:26.459> you

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
something you have to adjust but as you

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.039 
something you have to adjust but as you
see<00:03:26.819> you<00:03:26.970> definitely<00:03:27.389> don't<00:03:27.510> want<00:03:27.780> yours<00:03:27.959> to

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
see you definitely don't want yours to

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.649 
see you definitely don't want yours to
be<00:03:28.169> like<00:03:28.500> this<00:03:28.680> because<00:03:28.979> it<00:03:29.129> can<00:03:29.280> snap<00:03:29.790> and

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
be like this because it can snap and

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:31.809 
be like this because it can snap and
that<00:03:30.810> wouldn't<00:03:31.109> be<00:03:31.199> good

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
that wouldn't be good

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.179 
that wouldn't be good
another<00:03:32.819> than<00:03:33.000> that<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.510> lot<00:03:34.049> of<00:03:34.109> people<00:03:34.409> say

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:35.189 
another than that a lot of people say

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:38.960 
another than that a lot of people say
the<00:03:35.519> frame<00:03:36.409> paint<00:03:37.409> job<00:03:37.620> isn't<00:03:38.010> great<00:03:38.189> I<00:03:38.489> hear

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.080 
job the scene looks nice else can get
into<00:04:11.099> the<00:04:11.280> tires<00:04:11.579> or<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.030> kindda<00:04:13.669> kindda<00:04:14.669> claw

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
into the tires or the kindda kindda claw

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.879 
into the tires or the kindda kindda claw
I<00:04:15.120> think<00:04:15.689> is<00:04:15.870> what<00:04:16.049> I<00:04:16.079> called<00:04:16.380> something<00:04:16.799> like

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
I think is what I called something like

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.539 
I think is what I called something like
that<00:04:17.659> pretty<00:04:18.659> decent<00:04:18.900> tires<00:04:19.349> I<00:04:19.829> like<00:04:20.430> the

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
that pretty decent tires I like the

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.170 
that pretty decent tires I like the
front<00:04:20.849> I<00:04:21.380> feel<00:04:22.380> like<00:04:22.529> the<00:04:22.680> back<00:04:22.950> lacks<00:04:23.940> a

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
front I feel like the back lacks a

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.720 
front I feel like the back lacks a
little<00:04:24.330> bit<00:04:24.570> in<00:04:24.779> traction

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
little bit in traction

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.000 
little bit in traction
you<00:04:26.940> know<00:04:27.030> fairly<00:04:27.480> warned<00:04:27.780> but<00:04:28.139> even<00:04:28.889> when<00:04:28.980> I

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
first got it I mean you can see the

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.820 
first got it I mean you can see the
difference<00:04:31.260> in<00:04:31.410> the<00:04:31.500> tread<00:04:31.830> just<00:04:32.639> the<00:04:32.790> rear<00:04:33.830> to

tires not sure what the brand of the

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.250 
tires not sure what the brand of the
wheel<00:04:47.730> is<00:04:48.030> but<00:04:48.300> they're<00:04:48.450> pretty<00:04:48.600> nice<00:04:48.870> I<00:04:49.110> mean

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
wheel is but they're pretty nice I mean

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.740 
wheel is but they're pretty nice I mean
they<00:04:50.010> seem<00:04:50.280> to<00:04:50.520> be<00:04:51.150> holding<00:04:51.360> up<00:04:51.540> nice<00:04:51.720> and

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
they seem to be holding up nice and

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.560 
they seem to be holding up nice and
strong<00:04:52.200> too<00:04:52.470> I<00:04:52.500> did<00:04:52.800> replace<00:04:53.160> the<00:04:53.340> pedals<00:04:53.700> but

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
strong too I did replace the pedals but

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.510 
strong too I did replace the pedals but
I<00:04:54.600> just<00:04:54.870> bought<00:04:55.020> some<00:04:55.230> cheap<00:04:55.440> pedals<00:04:55.830> don't

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.960 
buy these cheap pedals you're actually
probably<00:04:58.860> better<00:04:59.190> off<00:04:59.280> with<00:04:59.580> the<00:04:59.700> platform

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
probably better off with the platform

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.420 
probably better off with the platform
pedals<00:05:00.510> it<00:05:00.810> comes<00:05:01.020> with<00:05:01.229> I<00:05:01.470> prefer<00:05:01.919> platform

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430

area<00:05:07.110> I<00:05:07.680> think<00:05:08.460> a<00:05:08.790> little<00:05:08.940> bit<00:05:09.060> more<00:05:09.120> grippy

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
area I think a little bit more grippy

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.469 
area I think a little bit more grippy
though<00:05:10.830> that's<00:05:11.700> about<00:05:11.910> it<00:05:12.120> really

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479
