I<00:00:10.430> think<00:00:11.389> it<00:00:11.450> was<00:00:11.540> norm<00:00:11.840> that<00:00:12.080> said<00:00:12.320> you<00:00:12.500> can't

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
I think it was norm that said you can't

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.549 
I think it was norm that said you can't
have<00:00:13.010> too<00:00:13.280> many<00:00:13.430> class<00:00:13.990> and<00:00:14.990> I<00:00:15.110> agree<00:00:15.410> with

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:15.559 
have too many class and I agree with

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.010 
have too many class and I agree with
that<00:00:15.710> but<00:00:15.950> what<00:00:16.160> you<00:00:16.189> can<00:00:16.640> have<00:00:17.000> is<00:00:17.300> a<00:00:17.360> place<00:00:17.810> to

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
that but what you can have is a place to

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.320 
that but what you can have is a place to
store<00:00:18.290> those<00:00:18.560> clamps<00:00:18.950> and<00:00:19.730> what<00:00:19.939> I've<00:00:20.090> done

here is I've mounted all my C clamps on
this<00:00:22.849> wall<00:00:23.119> and<00:00:23.619> I<00:00:24.619> put<00:00:24.860> it<00:00:24.980> on<00:00:25.099> a<00:00:25.130> piece<00:00:25.399> of<00:00:25.610> oh

little branch exit with a screw hole
through<00:01:00.530> it<00:01:00.650> and<00:01:01.150> that<00:01:02.150> gives<00:01:03.020> each<00:01:03.260> clamp<00:01:03.620> a

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
through it and that gives each clamp a

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:10.570 
through it and that gives each clamp a
place<00:01:04.100> to<00:01:04.869> set<00:01:08.079> and<00:01:09.079> then<00:01:09.650> over<00:01:10.010> on<00:01:10.130> this<00:01:10.310> wall

they do and they fit down in the BC a
PVC<00:02:17.630> pipe<00:02:18.520> and<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:19.730> pipe<00:02:19.940> will<00:02:20.239> soothe<00:02:21.160> this

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
PVC pipe and the pipe will soothe this

PVC pipe and the pipe will soothe this
top<00:02:22.610> board<00:02:22.940> goes<00:02:23.870> through<00:02:24.080> this<00:02:24.290> board<00:02:24.650> but<00:02:24.890> it

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
top board goes through this board but it

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.590 
top board goes through this board but it
can't<00:02:25.220> go<00:02:25.430> through<00:02:25.700> this<00:02:25.970> one<00:02:26.180> because<00:02:26.480> the

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
can't go through this one because the

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.420 
can't go through this one because the
holes<00:02:26.780> too<00:02:27.050> small<00:02:27.080> it<00:02:27.530> does<00:02:27.739> allow<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.010> plant

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
holes too small it does allow the plant

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.699 
holes too small it does allow the plant
to<00:02:28.519> go<00:02:28.700> through<00:02:28.910> Oh<00:02:29.290> bring<00:02:30.290> that<00:02:30.440> in<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.620> little

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
to go through Oh bring that in a little

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:38.100 
to go through Oh bring that in a little
bit<00:02:30.830> closer<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:31.370> you<00:02:31.519> can<00:02:31.610> see<00:02:31.730> what<00:02:32.030> I've<00:02:32.150> done

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.090 

but<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.260> holds<00:02:39.410> about<00:02:39.970> 20<00:02:40.970> clamps<00:02:41.390> or<00:02:41.540> so<00:02:41.750> I<00:02:42.100> had

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
but it holds about 20 clamps or so I had

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.699 
but it holds about 20 clamps or so I had
to<00:02:43.220> put<00:02:43.430> a<00:02:43.459> few<00:02:43.760> here<00:02:44.150> on<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:45.260> end<00:02:45.410> of<00:02:45.590> this

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
to put a few here on the end of this

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.580 
to put a few here on the end of this
board<00:02:46.660> because<00:02:47.660> I<00:02:47.810> was<00:02:47.930> running<00:02:48.260> out<00:02:48.410> of<00:02:48.440> room

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
board because I was running out of room

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.570 
board because I was running out of room
in<00:02:49.040> there<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:50.000> then<00:02:50.239> my<00:02:50.500> short<00:02:51.500> pipe<00:02:52.069> clamps

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
in there and then my short pipe clamps

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.270 
in there and then my short pipe clamps
are<00:02:52.730> on<00:02:52.819> this<00:02:53.060> two<00:02:53.269> before<00:02:53.630> behind<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:54.440> have<00:02:55.250> a

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
are on this two before behind and have a

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.220 
are on this two before behind and have a
few<00:02:55.610> more<00:02:55.819> that<00:02:56.000> didn't<00:02:56.330> fit<00:02:56.510> on<00:02:56.540> my<00:02:56.840> system

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
few more that didn't fit on my system

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.550 
few more that didn't fit on my system
just<00:02:57.260> laying<00:02:57.769> loose<00:02:57.980> there<00:02:59.170> but<00:03:00.170> this<00:03:00.290> system

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
just laying loose there but this system

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.620 
just laying loose there but this system
works<00:03:00.950> fairly<00:03:01.160> well<00:03:01.370> it's<00:03:01.880> easy<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.269> keep

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
works fairly well it's easy to keep

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.140 
works fairly well it's easy to keep
clean<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:03.019> it's<00:03:03.470> easy<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:03.829> pull<00:03:04.370> out<00:03:04.519> any<00:03:04.760> one

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
clean and it's easy to pull out any one

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.350 
clean and it's easy to pull out any one
of<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.510> bar<00:03:06.320> clamps<00:03:06.829> the<00:03:07.670> ones<00:03:07.880> in<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.150> back

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
of the bar clamps the ones in the back

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.180 
of the bar clamps the ones in the back
are<00:03:08.390> a<00:03:08.690> little<00:03:08.959> bit<00:03:09.110> longer<00:03:09.380> than<00:03:09.769> the<00:03:09.860> ones<00:03:10.040> in

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
are a little bit longer than the ones in

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.210 
are a little bit longer than the ones in
the<00:03:10.250> front<00:03:11.140> and<00:03:12.140> then<00:03:12.350> from<00:03:12.560> my<00:03:12.680> real<00:03:12.890> long

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
the front and then from my real long

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.380 
the front and then from my real long
pipe<00:03:13.790> clamps<00:03:14.329> I<00:03:14.769> store<00:03:15.769> them<00:03:16.070> up<00:03:16.640> here<00:03:16.970> next<00:03:17.209> to

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
pipe clamps I store them up here next to

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.650 
pipe clamps I store them up here next to
the<00:03:17.510> ceiling<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.049> a<00:03:18.170> little<00:03:18.410> bracket<00:03:18.829> I<00:03:18.920> made

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
the ceiling and a little bracket I made

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.780 
the ceiling and a little bracket I made
probably<00:03:20.660> can't<00:03:20.870> see<00:03:21.079> that<00:03:21.110> too<00:03:21.470> well<00:03:21.790> but

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
probably can't see that too well but

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.210 
probably can't see that too well but
they<00:03:22.970> have<00:03:23.180> got<00:03:23.600> like<00:03:23.810> eight<00:03:24.019> feet<00:03:24.290> long<00:03:24.590> when

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
they have got like eight feet long when

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.449 
they have got like eight feet long when
I<00:03:25.250> do<00:03:25.519> a<00:03:25.549> big<00:03:25.850> project<00:03:26.829> and<00:03:27.829> that's<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:28.220> way<00:03:28.430> I

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
I do a big project and that's the way I

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.160 
I do a big project and that's the way I
store<00:03:29.030> my<00:03:29.209> clamps<00:03:30.910> my<00:03:31.910> son<00:03:32.209> works<00:03:32.690> out<00:03:32.900> here<00:03:33.140> a

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
store my clamps my son works out here a

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.000 
store my clamps my son works out here a
lot<00:03:33.410> and<00:03:33.620> he<00:03:33.799> uses<00:03:34.070> them<00:03:34.400> and<00:03:35.290> like<00:03:36.290> norm<00:03:36.709> said

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
lot and he uses them and like norm said

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.540 
lot and he uses them and like norm said
you<00:03:37.220> can't<00:03:37.459> have<00:03:37.700> too<00:03:37.910> many<00:03:38.090> clamps
