00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
different in here that you're doing an

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.270 
different in here that you're doing an
conventional<00:00:39.750> framed<00:00:39.989> house<00:00:40.230> well<00:00:41.100> basically

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
conventional framed house well basically

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.490 
conventional framed house well basically
you<00:00:41.550> got<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.850> make<00:00:42.629> yourself<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.110> channel

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
you got to make yourself a channel

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.740 
you got to make yourself a channel
through<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.800> foam<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:45.030> do<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.329> by<00:00:45.510> burning

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
through the foam we do that by burning

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.380 
through the foam we do that by burning
it<00:00:45.989> out<00:00:46.170> with<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.530> heat<00:00:46.950> gun<00:00:47.239> there<00:00:48.239> are

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
it out with the heat gun there are

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.760 
it out with the heat gun there are
several<00:00:48.629> different<00:00:48.960> ways<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.230> can<00:00:49.350> do<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.500> but

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
several different ways you can do it but

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.010 
several different ways you can do it but
that's<00:00:50.610> probably<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> neatest<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.780> let<00:00:51.960> me

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
that's probably the neatest and let me

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.270 
that's probably the neatest and let me
see<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> tool<00:00:52.469> because<00:00:52.710> that's<00:00:52.860> easiest

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
see the tool because that's easiest

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.760 
see the tool because that's easiest
that's<00:00:53.640> an<00:00:53.789> interesting<00:00:54.320> interesting<00:00:55.320> tool

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
that's an interesting interesting tool

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.069 
that's an interesting interesting tool
here<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.039> heat<00:00:56.280> gun<00:00:56.520> just<00:00:57.149> heats<00:00:57.329> up<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.750> burns

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
here a heat gun just heats up and burns

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.979 
here a heat gun just heats up and burns
the<00:00:58.260> phone<00:00:58.680> through<00:00:59.359> you<00:01:00.359> can<00:01:00.510> pull<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.840> right

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
the phone through you can pull it right

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.209 
the phone through you can pull it right
out<00:01:01.050> as<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.590> can<00:01:01.710> see<00:01:01.859> out<00:01:01.980> there<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.129> little

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
out as you can see out there a little

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.460 
out as you can see out there a little
bit<00:01:02.399> here<00:01:02.640> right<00:01:03.329> now<00:01:03.539> like<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.750> soldering<00:01:04.260> iron

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
bit here right now like a soldering iron

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.090 
bit here right now like a soldering iron
it<00:01:04.799> make<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:06.180> whole<00:01:06.510> element<00:01:07.350> here<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.710> hot

it make this whole element here is hot

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.010 
it make this whole element here is hot
exactly<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.119> will<00:01:09.270> melt<00:01:09.689> through<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
exactly and that will melt through the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.340 
exactly and that will melt through the
start<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:11.159> we<00:01:11.250> see<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.820> sure<00:01:12.240> do<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.140> what<00:01:13.260> you

the war sure what you're left with then
is<00:01:54.819> the<00:01:55.390> cut<00:01:55.600> out<00:01:55.719> part<00:01:56.020> creating<00:01:56.709> a<00:01:56.770> little

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
is the cut out part creating a little

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.550 
is the cut out part creating a little
challenge<00:01:57.340> here<00:01:57.579> right<00:01:57.880> now<00:01:58.689> for<00:01:58.929> cutting<00:01:59.439> out

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
challenge here right now for cutting out

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.819 
challenge here right now for cutting out
our<00:01:59.679> box<00:01:59.890> we<00:02:00.159> have<00:02:00.310> a<00:02:00.899> different<00:02:01.899> hot<00:02:02.590> knife

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
our box we have a different hot knife

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.370 
our box we have a different hot knife
with<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.189> same<00:02:03.399> sort<00:02:03.640> of<00:02:03.700> deal<00:02:03.759> here<00:02:04.329> kind<00:02:05.289> of

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
with the same sort of deal here kind of

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.380 
with the same sort of deal here kind of
again<00:02:05.530> like<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.890> soldering<00:02:06.459> iron<00:02:06.759> model<00:02:07.090> the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
again like the soldering iron model the

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.080 
again like the soldering iron model the
element<00:02:07.750> this<00:02:07.840> time<00:02:08.140> is<00:02:08.849> wider<00:02:09.849> and

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
element this time is wider and

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.449 
element this time is wider and
rectangular<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:10.929> that<00:02:11.319> will<00:02:11.470> cut<00:02:11.680> out<00:02:11.860> a<00:02:12.099> hole

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
rectangular and that will cut out a hole

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.449 
rectangular and that will cut out a hole
just<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:12.940> right<00:02:13.090> size<00:02:13.920> there<00:02:14.920> Keith<00:02:15.130> we<00:02:15.310> can

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
just the right size there Keith we can

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.550 
just the right size there Keith we can
see<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:15.819> will<00:02:16.269> fit<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.660> box<00:02:16.930> so<00:02:17.230> i'll<00:02:17.410> let

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
see that will fit the box so i'll let

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.460 
see that will fit the box so i'll let
you<00:02:17.739> already<00:02:18.459> have<00:02:18.970> at<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:22.170> need<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.200> little<00:02:23.380> bit

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
you already have at it need a little bit

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.800 
you already have at it need a little bit
of<00:02:23.530> room<00:02:23.739> on<00:02:23.860> top<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.340> get<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.549> wire<00:02:24.730> in<00:02:25.000> so<00:02:25.239> you

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
of room on top to get the wire in so you

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.000 
of room on top to get the wire in so you
want<00:02:25.959> to<00:02:26.019> make<00:02:26.049> it<00:02:26.230> slightly<00:02:26.440> brighter<00:02:26.769> a

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
want to make it slightly brighter a

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:34.809 
want to make it slightly brighter a
little<00:02:27.130> higher<00:02:27.400> than<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.760> box<00:02:27.940> or<00:02:28.150> so

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.220 

so<00:02:35.810> then<00:02:35.930> you'll<00:02:36.079> come<00:02:36.890> back<00:02:37.069> out<00:02:37.310> of<00:02:37.340> that<00:02:37.489> yep

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
so then you'll come back out of that yep

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.390 
so then you'll come back out of that yep
look<00:02:39.230> at<00:02:39.319> that<00:02:39.439> little<00:02:39.620> plug<00:02:39.889> will<00:02:40.040> come<00:02:40.219> right

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
look at that little plug will come right

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:49.460 
look at that little plug will come right
out<00:02:40.459> of<00:02:40.639> there

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.920 

basically<00:02:50.470> we're<00:02:50.590> just<00:02:50.739> using<00:02:50.890> up<00:02:51.690> ramset<00:02:52.690> gun

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
basically we're just using up ramset gun

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.119 
basically we're just using up ramset gun
okay<00:02:53.769> this<00:02:54.459> is<00:02:54.610> a<00:02:54.640> powder<00:02:55.360> actuated<00:02:56.129> nailer

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
okay this is a powder actuated nailer

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.790 
okay this is a powder actuated nailer
uses<00:02:57.640> a<00:02:57.670> little<00:02:57.879> gun<00:02:58.540> powder<00:02:58.720> charge<00:02:59.110> exactly

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
uses a little gun powder charge exactly

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.710 
uses a little gun powder charge exactly
drive<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.190> fastener<00:03:00.610> into<00:03:00.760> contrast<00:03:01.510> all

drive the fastener into contrast all

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.530 
drive the fastener into contrast all
right<00:03:01.900> all<00:03:02.560> right<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:04.209> there's<00:03:04.360> a<00:03:04.420> little

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
right all right and there's a little

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:12.240 
right all right and there's a little
louder<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:07.690> works<00:03:07.930> rather<00:03:08.200> well<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.950> try<00:03:12.190> and

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
louder it works rather well to try and

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:19.280 
louder it works rather well to try and
make<00:03:12.400> sure<00:03:12.459> it's<00:03:12.730> straight<00:03:17.459> now<00:03:18.459> up<00:03:18.670> top<00:03:18.910> here

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
make sure it's straight now up top here
