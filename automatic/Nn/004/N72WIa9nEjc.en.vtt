00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 the one who's all welcome again 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.339
 and as you can see in the title in this 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.130
 Minecraft tutorial I will teach you 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.540
 be a trampoline that is something 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.030
 like this we put on this basis 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.610
 good white is quartz and we started to 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.020
 jump extremely high and good them 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.029
 I'm going to show you how to do it, we're going to 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.029
 get off and well let's start 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.700
 and well before I start I want 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.320
 tell them two things the first is that 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.390
 As you can see, the house is remodeled and 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.610
 put the roof and a few other improvements 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.680
 that now they will see when we enter 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.210
 detail in the tutorial and good the 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.670
 second thing you want to say is that 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.950
 this idea is not mine the reedite handle 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.989
 it's a was a tutorial but in a photo 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.790
 good they were like other photos but then I 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.020
 I wanted to go to video tutorial so that 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.910
 you saw it so that what 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.739
 they understood better if he says if they are not 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.280
 It makes it much easier to do things with photo 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.530
 and less in English 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.390
 but still to give credit to the author 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.820
 well the one who had this idea can leave 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.510
 the link to the description of the forum 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.980
 good redit of the after no and good now 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.140
 yes let's start good to start 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.200
 let's make the trampoline shape by 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.280
 example this is a design but they can 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.659
 do any and they can do 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.399
 anything else that is not 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.310
 just a rag or just something 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.049
 to jump but good to start I should 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.390
 say you need to have a center to see 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.590
 that this 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.590
 as it separated from rain 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.080
 but hey, I must say that this 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.430
 has a center that is this and around 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.340
 from this center we have to build 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.259
 right now you will see why 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.549
 so let's put a center first 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.299
 and around we are going to put blocks 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.299
 let's say about 2 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.479
 so this is going to be our springboard 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.470
 we already fill in the rest , this is with the 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.380
 Mouth they want, I'm doing it 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.430
 with wool because it's a bit easier 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.960
 but you can do it with whatever it is already 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.330
 we have here on our trampoline as 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.369
 who says this is not the trampoline and 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.380
 this one can be good, this is not 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.060
 simply decorative but here in this 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.860
 in the white forests will be where 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.229
 let's jump and well let's continue the 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.970
 step 2 and since we have our way of 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.009
 bounce filled you up we need these 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.170
 objects 2 command what everyone is 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.630
 compare koppers landmarks as you know the 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.760
 command pad is not available in the menu of the 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.590
 creative and to have we need 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.300
 look for it in the tumen and if we do not have it is 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.910
 your mind we just put this in the 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.940
 diagonal chat and the other pre-user and 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.799
 the 237 and it gives us 1 and it put that we have 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.780
 these three objects we are going to continue 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.519
 we need to make a structure like the 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.380
 next I have around here that is a 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.730
 small room that I made and good what 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.370
 that we have to be a structure like 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.040
 this review I will explain them well as to 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.560
 see I'm going to destroy we're not going to make another 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.140
 from the beginning let's go up we 're going to 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.450
 do another with this mechanism works 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.220
 this and how we do it by simply 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.140
 we put a rest in comparator 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.700
 like the good blog command block 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.560
 then subtract one comparator and the other 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.160
 block commands 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.410
 and well here we need to put a two 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.420
 koppers we put this and with chip 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.489
 left we select and we put this 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.530
 another so that hopper will be 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.090
 link this one we already destroyed this and that 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.280
 world same chip left and right 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.750
 here for that link to this and 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.720
 what's going to happen with this then when 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.700
 when I made an object here as the 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.500
 the red one this will happen this one and this one 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.290
 will happen this and what happens with this that 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.870
 when the energy goes through here and that's why 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.310
 it suddenly gives energy and sometimes not this 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.690
 that energy sometimes yes and sometimes this 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.760
 serves to make this block command 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.769
 it is always on or activate it is 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.440
 has activated again again and again 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.430
 so on and we are always 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.700
 when we are so that we can always 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.080
 jump high high and good we're going to 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.060
 put this command block we are going to 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.680
 put this and wait before you 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.190
 copy these are the coordinates of 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.690
 center of the center look at me explained by 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.650
 example this center we have to catch 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.420
 the coordinates here 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:51.360
 efe 3 and look like in the coordinates 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:57.850
 they are x 56 we are going to put here 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:04:00.400
 56 10 77 512 in the center this is 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.620
 important we are here in what 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.110
 commands and we put what they had 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:09.320
 said to see I'm going to remove all this 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:12.170
 I'm going to leave this this command in the 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.150
 description so it will not be complicated 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:19.730
 a lot and well as you see there says below x 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:21.260
 56 1070 iceta was that saying I think it's 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.840
 also 512 not because I did it in the 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.340
 same height as this one if 512 and that 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.340
 we put on the radio so let's put 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.870
 the following for example from here here 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.210
 there are three blocks here and here there are 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.500
 another three blocks this is the radio as 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.940
 they taught the school bergua here 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.770
 there is the f3 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.050
 the radius for example if there were another 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:43.060
 line blocks here the radius would be 4 and if 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.919
 it was so good to see 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.050
 I will explain it well and if I were without 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.520
 radio would be 2 because here here there is only 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.600
 two blocks and well let's leave it in 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.940
 two so here the radius is 2 I hope I 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.680
 has explained and good that we are going to put 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.940
 in this command block in this 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.639
 command block let's put what 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.770
 following effect alpe 8 3 10 and that 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.200
 means 83 10 then first 8 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.000
 means position number 8 which is the 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.340
 from her a post to jump high as 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.680
 the one that we were seeing good what we 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.540
 will be used for the trampoline or the 3 is the 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.250
 time you want me to give it to you but that 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.830
 do not worry with one it works but I 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.630
 I put three for it because sometimes it 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.030
 It takes me a while to give it to you so put it on 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.770
 three seconds and the day means the 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.720
 height 10 for example in the other 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.830
 7 trampoline I had good height 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.170
 the 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.730
 how to say the position number how 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:34.040
 it's called as the enchantment level 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:36.560
 that sometimes gives you I do not know 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.150
 efficiency 4 efficiency 5 efficiency 2 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.580
 Well, here is the same for 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.350
 positions we put 10 or we can 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.480
 put also 1 if we want to jump less 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.070
 with the other as I said I had six if it is 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.890
 high quite high but what are we going to 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:52.190
 put 10 to see how we fly like this 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.720
 that I repeat the effect is the one that is not a 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.700
 effect the fish for the player more 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.500
 close but this does not matter much and 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.210
 then 8 is the number 8 position that 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.070
 is to jump high the 3 are the 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.920
 seconds that you want me to give you and the 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.270
 10 is the height the higher you 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.520
 put more then before jumping as 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.530
 people can be from 1 to 10 and then 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.910
 good and to the structure made it 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.130
 assumes that we can get on the 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.689
 trampoline as he gave us the position and 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:18.539
 how do we see if we jump 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:20.610
 I am going to explain to you a bit also how 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:24.509
 is that this worked this was like a 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:26.759
 how to say it when this someone 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:27.959
 was here I was going to activate this by 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:31.799
 example here says that in these 

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:33.239
 coordinates in x 56 10 77 512 when 

00:06:31.799 --> 00:06:35.789
 someone was there within a radius of two 

00:06:33.239 --> 00:06:37.979
 cubes so activate and this time to be 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:39.629
 activate this and then good until the 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:41.909
 trampoline done we can already skip what 

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:43.439
 we want and look, let's change here 

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:45.870
 the height so that it is better understood in 

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:50.240
 place of 10 we are going to put you 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:50.240
 I that I know one to see the difference 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.690
 it's almost like the normal jump we're not going to 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.490
 put it now 5 to see how 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.650
 increasing 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.690
 and as you can see, I already jump to the height of 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.169
 house more or less and let's see let's put 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.990
 again 10 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:11.680
 10 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:13.870
 and again let's see the height again 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.580
 maximum according to me is 10 but it is not that no 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:20.200
 I know if it can be seen let's put the 100 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:22.210
 to see what happens or if you can this does not 

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.910
 I knew it can serve well as that of 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.680
 an extension platform or a 

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.390
 fast elevator or something like that not seriously 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.700
 that this I did not know I thought that what
