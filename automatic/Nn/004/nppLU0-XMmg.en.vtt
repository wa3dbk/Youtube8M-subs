00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:14.400
 hello everyone with you lech and today I 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.750
 I will review the German average tanks 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.410
 eighth level panther 2 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.689
 panther 2 is just a mega tank on 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.789
 which I don't play very well but what 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.150
 different duck is his bad tool 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.029
 armor and good speed because 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:34.050
 the gun at us punches at its level 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:38.340
 all because we punch 150 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:42.840
 millimeters of armor up to 210 and our damage 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:46.469
 projectile is 225,250 depending on which one scolded 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.950
 will fall further our rate of fire 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.360
 guns 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.190
 it's 8 shots per minute just what 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.309
 three seconds then just a lot 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.320
 this is very bad but communication is nonsense exact 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.609
 mixing time is three seconds and the spread is 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.049
 100 meters 035 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:08.290
