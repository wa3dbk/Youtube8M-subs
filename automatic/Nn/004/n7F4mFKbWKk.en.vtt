in mind I feel like I definitely need a
belt<00:01:36.000> with<00:01:36.180> these<00:01:36.329> because<00:01:37.110> they<00:01:37.259> have<00:01:37.290> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
belt with these because they have the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.380 
belt with these because they have the
heavy<00:01:37.860> knee<00:01:38.250> pads<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.729> them<00:01:38.850> they<00:01:39.090> kind<00:01:39.240> of

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
heavy knee pads in them they kind of

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.640 
heavy knee pads in them they kind of
want<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.600> fall<00:01:39.810> down<00:01:39.840> which<00:01:40.229> makes<00:01:40.409> me<00:01:40.500> want<00:01:40.560> to

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
want to fall down which makes me want to

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.140 
want to fall down which makes me want to
take<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.920> knee<00:01:41.040> pads<00:01:41.310> out<00:01:41.490> but<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.790> negates

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
take the knee pads out but that negates

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.880 
take the knee pads out but that negates
the<00:01:42.329> best<00:01:42.509> feature<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.930> pants<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.409> keep
