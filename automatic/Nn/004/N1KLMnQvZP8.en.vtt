00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
that is on the twelfth fret on the B

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.130 
that is on the twelfth fret on the B
string<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.370> I'm<00:02:13.490> bending<00:02:13.850> it<00:02:13.940> up<00:02:14.060> sort<00:02:14.990> of<00:02:15.050> a

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
string and I'm bending it up sort of a

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.160 
string and I'm bending it up sort of a
whole<00:02:15.320> step<00:02:15.910> that's<00:02:16.910> really<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.210> preference

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
whole step that's really a preference

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.000 
whole step that's really a preference
how<00:02:18.290> much<00:02:18.500> one<00:02:18.710> bended<00:02:20.740> then<00:02:21.740> I<00:02:21.770> come<00:02:21.980> back

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
how much one bended then I come back

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.710 
how much one bended then I come back
here<00:02:22.430> on<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.790> root<00:02:23.240> note<00:02:23.270> a<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:25.090> go<00:02:26.090> down<00:02:26.450> to

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
here on the root note a and go down to

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.940 
here on the root note a and go down to
the<00:02:26.840> major<00:02:26.990> six<00:02:27.320> and<00:02:28.600> then<00:02:29.600> coming<00:02:30.530> back<00:02:30.710> on

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
the major six and then coming back on

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:38.650 
the major six and then coming back on
that<00:02:31.100> note<00:02:31.310> then<00:02:31.550> bending<00:02:31.760> it<00:02:31.880> up<00:02:33.490> but<00:02:37.660> it's

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
that note then bending it up but it's

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.260 
that note then bending it up but it's
kind<00:02:38.840> of<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:38.990> funky<00:02:39.230> lick<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:42.970> then<00:02:43.970> for<00:02:44.180> the

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
kind of a funky lick and then for the

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.660 
kind of a funky lick and then for the
second<00:02:44.690> lick<00:02:44.870> we're<00:02:45.740> doing<00:02:46.070> sort<00:02:46.490> of<00:02:46.550> an

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
second lick we're doing sort of an

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.600 
second lick we're doing sort of an
answer<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.420> first<00:02:47.630> lick<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:52.190> me<00:02:52.310> that<00:02:52.490> is

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
answer to the first lick to me that is

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.610 
answer to the first lick to me that is
sort<00:02:52.910> of<00:02:52.970> a<00:02:53.090> call<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:53.600> answer<00:02:53.810> type<00:02:54.230> of<00:02:54.410> plane

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
sort of a call and answer type of plane

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.580 
sort of a call and answer type of plane
where<00:02:54.920> you<00:02:55.070> play<00:02:55.280> one<00:02:55.520> lick<00:02:55.750> that<00:02:56.750> goes<00:02:57.020> up<00:02:57.290> and

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
where you play one lick that goes up and

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.040 
where you play one lick that goes up and
then<00:02:58.310> you<00:02:58.520> play<00:02:58.730> a<00:02:58.760> second<00:02:59.060> lick<00:02:59.240> that<00:02:59.450> comes

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
then you play a second lick that comes

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:08.160 
then you play a second lick that comes
back<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.530> sort<00:03:00.709> of<00:03:00.800> fulfills<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.910> whole<00:03:02.060> idea

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.650 

so<00:03:09.170> now<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:09.380> second<00:03:09.800> leg<00:03:09.920> starts<00:03:10.310> with<00:03:10.660> the

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
so now the second leg starts with the

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.270 
so now the second leg starts with the
major<00:03:11.870> six<00:03:12.230> going<00:03:12.769> up<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.100> root<00:03:13.250> note

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
major six going up to the root note

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.180 
major six going up to the root note
bending<00:03:16.280> again<00:03:17.320> then<00:03:18.320> back<00:03:18.530> to<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:18.800> second

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
bending again then back to the second

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:33.520 
bending again then back to the second
here<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:20.769> root<00:03:21.769> note<00:03:22.930> six<00:03:23.930> again

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.160 

and<00:03:33.799> I<00:03:33.890> try<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.430> play<00:03:34.730> with<00:03:34.970> a<00:03:35.000> funky<00:03:35.689> timing

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
and I try to play with a funky timing

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.300 
and I try to play with a funky timing
although<00:03:39.170> you<00:03:39.230> can<00:03:39.470> play<00:03:39.680> around<00:03:39.799> with<00:03:40.040> that

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
although you can play around with that

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.280 
although you can play around with that
if<00:03:40.640> you<00:03:40.760> like<00:03:40.790> it<00:03:41.390> works<00:03:41.689> with<00:03:42.140> different

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
if you like it works with different

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.369 
if you like it works with different
types<00:03:42.739> of<00:03:42.860> rhythm<00:03:43.099> as<00:03:43.220> well<00:03:45.670> and<00:03:47.140> then<00:03:48.140> for<00:03:48.319> the

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
types of rhythm as well and then for the

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:57.540 
types of rhythm as well and then for the
third<00:03:48.590> time<00:03:48.890> I'm<00:03:49.159> blinded

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.610
