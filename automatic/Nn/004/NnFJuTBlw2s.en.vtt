00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.750
 hello how about you guys in this video I'm going to 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.720
 teach a good handful of indeed knees 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.980
 several curiosities here in the gta 5 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.840
 to see the first one we will need 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.279
 buy us the boat the first boat that 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.800
 let us buy from the store of the 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.150
 online and when they put us the gps of 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.279
 boat we will realize that instead 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.430
 from the map of gta 5 is the map of the 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.960
 gta 4 is a little curiosity our 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.600
 worth nothing but good is a small 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.850
 wink that the game does to the predecessor 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.920
 to the previous game 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.289
 the second clip that I show you is a 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.460
 area of ​​the map where you can find 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.100
 easy to a girl with breasts 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.129
 naked I'll teach with 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.690
 covered breasts I've gone when I was 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.360
 with the bikini on because I prefer not 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.250
 teach 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.260
 the breasts are not going to get me 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.430
 some fright and I take some dislike 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.650
 for the nonsense of teaching 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.780
 if you want to see you implementos 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.000
 approach the area a design of 12 of the 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.680
 night at 5 in the morning and you are testing 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.600
 until the light is very simple and if not 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.260
 you can always go to marion playboy is 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.960
 much easier 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.760
 the third clip that was taught is this 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.190
 airport area where as a 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.810
 kind of electric pole that is very 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.790
 good to troll you can tell 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.890
 any undo friend that you touch him 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.120
 they struck a shock and the truth that 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.310
 It's very funny because the character 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.920
 does the pescaílla quite 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.369
 the next clip that I'm going to show you 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.140
 It is a bar in the city where there are 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.149
 tickets with the face of the girl of 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.250
 grand theft auto san andreas other 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.980
 little wink that make you a game 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.020
 previous 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.360
 and after that I will show you a little 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.160
 clip also where in a barbershop I think 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.650
 that is a tattoo shop not so 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.230
 I teach you the location now what 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.580
 you will see on the ground there is an alien painted 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.930
 as with a gun in your hand up 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.090
 Pretty funny, it 's just the silhouette 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.740
 approved now for nothing to try another 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.880
 little curiosity that we have there for 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.880
 keep an eye on her 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.129
 and last but not least 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.810
 important is in one of the garages in 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:16.930
 one of the houses that we can buy in 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.030
 the game on one of the walls there is a 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.550
 shelf in which there is a kind of 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.200
 bumper and it's a bumper I think with 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.569
 a license plate that puts the liberty city 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.850
 is another small nod that the game will 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.650
 makes a previous game 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.150
 and nothing guys was just that 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.350
 they showed the curiosities that were 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.180
 found here to see what 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.370
 they seemed to say in the comments that you 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.380
 seems to give you the law if you liked a 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.380
 I welcome you and see you next time 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.959
