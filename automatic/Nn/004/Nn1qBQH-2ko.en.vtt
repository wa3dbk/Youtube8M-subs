 martín gómez 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.549
 hands to work where you start by 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.740
 the dispossession of being what is going to go 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:12.200
 counting the parts as they are called 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.559
 etcetera etcetera hands to work 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.559
 first 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:24.650
 the pig is the point 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.630
 let's say half a pig of pork slaughter 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.140
 that you were telling me that you have 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.059
 17 pico de kilo and thus arrives at the slaughterhouse 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.190
 and you will pass it closing is cut in two 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.190
 halves why we talk about half a line 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.320
 they use it to 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.800
 for 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.660
 perfect very well with the cut of the ham 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.550
 ham or pardon that is what is going to be 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.239
 convenience 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.110
 while not cutting it showed in the 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.369
 glove hundred of cases for not 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.909
 cut true this is a 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.590
 protection that 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.859
 Now it's not cold steel mesh 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.579
 true later to make the knife and 

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:19.579
 I do not have anything else 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:37.610
 since the ham the famous ham very well 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.610
 the little knuckle also the mind 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.710
 we are, I think he has the 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.820
 feature that is super usable 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.820
 it's from end to end 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.220
 as a natural thing 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:11.560
 in the part of the sidewalk is used a lot 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.560
 For these payments, long precautions 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.170
 perfect 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:41.260
 you can not use grandma for 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.260
 14 years of health 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.540
 Martin told me a little bird that is 37 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.540
 years and more or less 36 and a half of 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.540
 Butcher 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:06.110
 20 years of own carnage is to say 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:09.040
 demon other slaughterhouses 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.040
 this 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.079
 well it is not 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.079
 good friends 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.139
 it's the ham 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:32.430
 we cook we will inject also 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.710
 because it happens with these pieces you 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.240
 they will have passed sometime and give him chili 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.400
 I was dry, it completes for you 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.780

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.400

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.660
 pulling out all the others then the 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.120
 let's inject with the brine in a 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.100
 I think it's perfect apart, I go 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.520
 to need me to take Milanese for 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.140

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:58.590
 barbecue and of course it's going to come 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.650
