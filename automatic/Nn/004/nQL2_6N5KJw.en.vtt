00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.660
 hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.760
 welcome to x 5 x 1 today we bring you a 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.410
 different video we are going to try to do 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.570
 a new thing in this news 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.160
 from time to time there are no headlines 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.720
 really important and that are easy 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.970
 to develop to make a video to 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.460
 less than five minutes so we're going to 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.300
 try to use 34 minutes in saying 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.029
 several holders 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.590
 three minutes in say one for both 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.820
 what do you mean by this we are going to do 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.430
 a review of the most outstanding headlines 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.009
 in the last day and a half of agreement 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.350
 related to the world of apple and 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.629
 whose owners are going to be able to expand 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.190
 with the links that I will leave in the 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:38.960
 descriptions where are you going to be able 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.809
 find such items to expand 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.059
 that information if you have any 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.220
 doubt what I could say to you like that 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.899
 if you want to see this new format and 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.790
 then you like and you know you can support 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.609
 what I do not like as indicative of 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.410
 that you like this format because nothing 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.420
 we will continue to do so according to 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.379
 that as I say we go with the intro and 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.379
 we started that I mess 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.070
 good guys let's start talking about 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.570
 google play music because apparently this 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.950
 music service in streaming 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.630
 released by google in the middle of the year 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.090
 past and that came in November for the 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.890
 iphone version in the appstore is at 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.510
 about to launch its ipad version that 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.550
 surprisingly it is not yet 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.290
 available at this point where we are 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.509
 we are already almost summer 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.280
 next year apparently the boys of 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.960
 night time recognize that the launch 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.220
 is imminent and at times in the 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.530
 that we are recording this video I want 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.820
 stress that has not yet been released 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.990
 everything may be that maybe your mom in 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.360
 this video is already available in your 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.039
 version for ipad with this movement what 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.300
 that Google intends to finally fight in 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.119
 equal footing against 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.470
 radio services spotify or pandora that 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.789
 are your big rivals on the track of 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.110
 music in streaming, you know more 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.610
 information also you have it in the 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.780
 Our description article by 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.550
 Alberto GarcÃ­a 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.200
 and concepts of them 8 now there are 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.900
 lots but we want to be the one of 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.270
 Ryan Wilson, I'm going to publish a concept 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.490
 which is the least interesting about the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.600
 future version of 28 that soon in 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.820
 just 23 weeks we will see in the wwdc 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.890
 2014 in this concept we can appreciate 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.050
 as we see an interface completely 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.610
 renewed control center in which 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.370
 a widget widget has been added to 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.110
 see the music the calendar the time and 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.450
 also logically it has been modified 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.730
 you see now downloading the wifi and the 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.680
 Bluetooth to a menu or a submenu below 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.020
 of the three with which we can 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.090
 access options within settings 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.040
 they have also added a lower button in 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.690
 the part of adjustments and can also be 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.520
 appreciate other changes in the interface 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.420
 as for example the possibility of 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.120
 access certain applications 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.220
 simply drawing the initial or a 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.810
 gesture on screen much like tweet 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.430
 that we analyzed a few weeks ago here in 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.220
 I support five for one for example in the 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.110
 video showing this guy Ryan draws 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.610
 an ate and access to twitter these are 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.290
 some of the things that come out in this 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.640
 concept that are true or not from 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.170
 then it 's a lot of tourist and I think that 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.010
 everything will not be implemented but it is 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.810
 very interesting 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.519
 and if you want to see the full video that 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.870
 has posted two minutes or what 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.930
 we leave in the article that you have here 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.909
 down 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.489
 if storage means some 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:06.079
 problem in your day to day or at the moment of 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.299
 choose a device when you have to 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:11.569
 go buy it between an iphone 16 of 32 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.700
 64 or an ipad or an ipod touch as well 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.590
 if you have a lightning connector in those 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.659
 devices that can already be thing of the 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.159
 passed because the guys at the company 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.859
 hyper are working on a project 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.719
 called eye steve is a project that already 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:26.030
 also has support approval 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:28.639
 and that consists of a flash memory that 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:33.409
 can go or vary in capacity between 8 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:34.489
 16 32 64 and 128 gb of storage with 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.739
 the end of power 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.750
 at the end store all kinds of files 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.900
 It can be text files images 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.609
 of music of whatever it is besides being able to 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.390
 in this case through an application 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:49.150
 that would have this product itself 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.700
 do a file send / for example 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.290
 your mobile device and your computer 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.760
 I advise you to visit the article where 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.100
 there is and that we explain it more 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.569
 widely all capabilities all 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.180
 the concrete characteristics of this 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.340
 project with all good at the end all 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.010
 the types of files the formats that 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.350
 will store and that will share and above all 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.180
 the availability because it can be very 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.950
 very soon in our homes or at 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.630
 less put on sale to the public already 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.310
 that in summer it is estimated that it could be 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.150
 its launch do not miss it in the 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.250
 description is the article 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.620
 and we finish this review of the headlines 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.930
 today talking about iphone 6 and a 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.389
 patent that has been registered recently 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.710
 in which we could see the combined nfc 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.270
 with air touch and that's what 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.669
 this patent is registered the union of these 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.229
 two systems this could be fine 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.570
 and this we do not know if we will see it in the 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:39.150
 iphone 6 or iphone 7 by elephant 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:43.169
 6s but of course it's something we can 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.970
 see very soon since in China you are 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.340
 rumored that apple is negotiating with 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.590
 china unionpay which is a company that 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.780
 has more than 3 million machines 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.520
 quick pass with which in the end we can 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.380
 make use of these technologies that apple 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.380
 You can incorporate in your next iphone 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.190
 so nothing guys up here reviewing
