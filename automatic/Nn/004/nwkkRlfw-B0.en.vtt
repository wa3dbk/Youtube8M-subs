00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.610
 hi everyone I'm on 65 and 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.590
 I'm back with a video just as much 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.869
 as special as the last two were 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.460
 loaded today in fact I will deal with a 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.769
 easter egg on the map 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.590
 operation riverside that obviously 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.109
 belongs to the expansion and game 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.000
 the last exit for battlefield 3 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.369
 I state that the modality that you must 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.649
 choosing is only catching the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.870
 flag as in this mode 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.180
 to the playable area ie the one where 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.430
 do you want did not die tense remaining 10 seconds 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.809
 outside it is bigger than the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.570
 other ways at least as far as 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.820
 regards this map in addition to the faction 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.829
 what you have to choose and the Russian one 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.850
 but if you enter the American one 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.010
 enough that it rewards stubborn and you go in the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.559
 factions team menu to change 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.329
 obviously the team now take a 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.420
 vehicle a helicopter what you want 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.909
 go all the way to the right of the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.479
 always map with respect to your area 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.790
 of spawn of the Russian faction remaining 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.670
 attached to the delimitation 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.970
 playable area and at the back behind 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.970
 a big rock you will find this robot 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.460
 this flying drone that surely a 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.140
 very nice and special easter egg 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.509
 I respect all the others who are 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.250
 seen in battlefield 3 so far I have you 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.460
 also shown in my other videos 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.570
 this for those who had not taken a 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:40.159
 reference to battlefield 2142 as 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.030
 the symbol that is on the sides e 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.689
 corresponds to the symbol of one of the 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.320
 specific battlefield 2142 factions 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.479
 of the european union among other things 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.430
 could be considered as many 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.240
 others on the internet say how 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.600
 reference to battlefield 2.143 of which 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.360
 there were other easter eggs inside 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.640
 though this game is later discovered that 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.530
 actually the next chapter a 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.190
 battlefield 3 would later be 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.480
 battlefield 4 accordingly this 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.870
 futuristic battlefield could 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.959
 for a spin off or a game that will come out 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.819
 obviously after battlefield 4 of 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.060
 which obviously nothing is known for now 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.489
 neither on nor on development nor on his 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.250
 existence more generally 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.780
 now returning to your own robot 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.629
 within the game in question 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.049
 you just need to move a little closer 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:39.959
 to him and this robot will follow you inside 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:43.230
 a limited area 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.260
 small but still useful for 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.410
 have fun and maybe surprise some 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.390
 your friend during a game you 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.970
 you can try to shoot them but all 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.060
 blows over the pass away without leaving 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.040
 a sign as you can too 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.129
 jump on him and pass him 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.090
 through so it's not something 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:08.010
 material will follow you within 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.500
 this area demarcated and you will not be able to 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.799
 take it to other parts of the map 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.840
 maybe to create confusion or attract 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.849
 the players in some on some 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.599
 goal or things like that I don't know 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.910
 not even what 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.459
 one could do with a robot 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.709
 of the kind then also this video is 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.750
 finished and I know that in the last days 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.970
 I have uploaded from the videos that can be 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.900
 considered a bit short, not typical 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.569
 type I would treat as well 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.639
 you know but it's for a simple one 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.340
 lack of time and I decided to get me 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:44.069
 however not that they are videos made this way 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.549
 to the cabbage or why I didn't know what 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:50.700
 do but simply put them on 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.950
 also to prevent the channel 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.840
 remained empty for months and months without 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.190
 no sign of life as has already happened 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.500
 in the past 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:02.669
 in my next video I will explain a little 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.459
 better than what will happen in the months 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:07.470
 even later in the following month 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.660
 August and that's all for today 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.609
 follow me again in the coming days is 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.629
 all for today we'll see you at the next 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.629
 hello video
