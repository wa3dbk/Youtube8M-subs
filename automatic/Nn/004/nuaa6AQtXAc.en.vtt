Leatherman<00:01:52.210> was<00:01:53.210> I<00:01:53.540> got<00:01:54.470> thinking<00:01:54.740> about<00:01:55.160> my

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
Leatherman was I got thinking about my

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.219 
Leatherman was I got thinking about my
gear<00:01:55.640> even<00:01:56.060> more<00:01:56.300> than<00:01:56.509> I<00:01:56.630> had<00:01:56.840> before<00:01:56.990> and

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
gear even more than I had before and

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.580 
gear even more than I had before and
realized<00:01:57.920> that<00:01:58.330> by<00:01:59.330> going<00:01:59.509> ultralight<00:02:00.259> and

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
realized that by going ultralight and

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.059 
realized that by going ultralight and
ultra<00:02:01.340> simple<00:02:01.819> I've<00:02:02.780> basically<00:02:03.140> eliminated

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
ultra simple I've basically eliminated

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.510 
ultra simple I've basically eliminated
all<00:02:04.340> of<00:02:04.399> the<00:02:05.119> stuff<00:02:05.450> that<00:02:05.920> you<00:02:06.920> used<00:02:07.160> to<00:02:07.340> have

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
all of the stuff that you used to have

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.900 
all of the stuff that you used to have
break<00:02:07.850> down<00:02:08.119> like<00:02:08.509> God<00:02:09.069> you<00:02:10.069> know<00:02:10.190> I'll<00:02:10.460> ring

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
break down like God you know I'll ring

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.570 
break down like God you know I'll ring
on<00:02:11.090> a<00:02:11.120> stove<00:02:11.510> or<00:02:11.990> Jade<00:02:12.710> or<00:02:13.100> anything<00:02:13.400> like<00:02:13.430> that

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
bring up something that I really really

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.670 
bring up something that I really really
would<00:03:19.379> need<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.620> knife<00:03:19.920> for<00:03:20.190> but<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:21.000> far<00:03:21.680> nobody

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.399 
has that as far as i can tell but
overwhelmingly<00:03:27.269> above<00:03:27.629> and<00:03:27.810> beyond<00:03:28.079> anything

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
and I'm afraid that I'll cut myself with

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.830 
and I'm afraid that I'll cut myself with
one<00:03:59.159> and<00:03:59.340> that<00:03:59.459> would<00:03:59.609> be<00:03:59.640> bad<00:03:59.730> if<00:04:00.180> I<00:04:00.420> really

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
one and that would be bad if I really

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.319 
one and that would be bad if I really
cut<00:04:01.049> myself<00:04:01.230> bad<00:04:01.709> in<00:04:01.980> and<00:04:02.129> I<00:04:02.640> have<00:04:02.849> cut<00:04:03.120> myself

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
cut myself bad in and I have cut myself

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.270 
cut myself bad in and I have cut myself
a<00:04:03.780> few<00:04:03.959> times<00:04:04.019> over<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.680> years<00:04:04.769> with<00:04:05.040> knives

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
a few times over the years with knives

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.819 
a few times over the years with knives
and<00:04:06.180> it<00:04:06.629> was<00:04:06.750> usually<00:04:07.079> doing<00:04:07.230> something<00:04:07.349> that

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
and it was usually doing something that

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.170 
and it was usually doing something that
I<00:04:07.889> probably<00:04:08.340> should<00:04:08.639> have<00:04:08.669> been<00:04:08.849> using<00:04:09.030> the

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
I probably should have been using the

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.750 
I probably should have been using the
night<00:04:09.389> for<00:04:09.660> to<00:04:09.750> begin<00:04:09.870> with<00:04:10.230> I<00:04:10.549> really<00:04:11.549> cut

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
night for to begin with I really cut

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.690 
night for to begin with I really cut
myself<00:04:11.940> bad<00:04:12.419> on<00:04:12.569> utility<00:04:13.169> knives<00:04:13.380> and

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
myself bad on utility knives and

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.849 
myself bad on utility knives and
ironically<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:15.630> only<00:04:15.900> knife<00:04:16.109> I'm<00:04:16.349> carrying

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
ironically the only knife I'm carrying

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.990 
ironically the only knife I'm carrying
now<00:04:17.599> is<00:04:18.599> a<00:04:19.289> knife<00:04:19.590> with<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:19.950> utility<00:04:20.519> blade<00:04:20.789> in

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
now is a knife with the utility blade in

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.480 
now is a knife with the utility blade in
it<00:04:21.090> utility<00:04:21.930> knife<00:04:22.229> blade<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:22.560> replaceable

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
it utility knife blade a replaceable

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.330 
it utility knife blade a replaceable
blade<00:04:24.030> with<00:04:24.720> it<00:04:24.840> so<00:04:25.530> I<00:04:25.560> don't<00:04:25.680> use<00:04:26.010> that<00:04:26.039> a<00:04:26.250> lot

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
blade with it so I don't use that a lot

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.300 
blade with it so I don't use that a lot
when<00:04:26.669> I<00:04:26.729> do<00:04:26.849> I'm<00:04:27.090> very<00:04:27.479> very<00:04:28.139> very<00:04:28.650> careful

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
when I do I'm very very very careful

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.439 
when I do I'm very very very careful
with<00:04:29.430> it<00:04:29.580> so<00:04:30.360> um<00:04:30.630> I<00:04:31.169> think<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:32.520> next<00:04:32.550> question

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
with it so um I think the next question

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.860 
with it so um I think the next question
is<00:04:34.070> what<00:04:35.070> about<00:04:35.160> firearms<00:04:36.090> what<00:04:36.630> about<00:04:36.720> a

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
is what about firearms what about a

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.240 
is what about firearms what about a
small<00:04:37.229> handgun<00:04:38.599> is<00:04:39.599> there<00:04:40.440> any<00:04:40.590> reason<00:04:40.860> why<00:04:41.220> I

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
small handgun is there any reason why I

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.240 
small handgun is there any reason why I
should<00:04:41.639> carry<00:04:41.910> a<00:04:42.030> small<00:04:42.210> handgun<00:04:42.750> I<00:04:43.250> can

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
should carry a small handgun I can

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.469 
should carry a small handgun I can
probably<00:04:44.490> think<00:04:44.820> of<00:04:44.940> a<00:04:45.000> couple<00:04:45.240> ah<00:04:46.130> but<00:04:47.150> if<00:04:48.150> you

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
probably think of a couple ah but if you

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.120 
probably think of a couple ah but if you
want<00:04:48.690> to<00:04:48.750> post<00:04:49.020> your<00:04:49.110> comments<00:04:49.770> and<00:04:49.919> you're

the 40 I got on the last video if you'd

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.719 
the 40 I got on the last video if you'd
like<00:04:54.900> to<00:04:54.960> put<00:04:55.229> your<00:04:55.410> comments<00:04:55.860> on<00:04:55.979> what<00:04:56.460> do<00:04:56.639> you

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.930 
like to put your comments on what do you
think<00:04:56.940> about<00:04:56.970> carrying<00:04:57.510> a<00:04:58.940> small-caliber

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
think about carrying a small-caliber

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.050 
think about carrying a small-caliber
handgun<00:05:00.360> small<00:05:00.930> frame<00:05:01.229> handgun<00:05:01.760> probably<00:05:02.760> a

handgun small frame handgun probably a

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.129 
handgun small frame handgun probably a
revolver<00:05:04.050> I<00:05:04.229> would<00:05:04.740> think<00:05:04.979> would<00:05:05.760> be<00:05:05.940> the

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
revolver I would think would be the

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.930 
revolver I would think would be the
simplest<00:05:07.139> cheapest<00:05:07.740> latest<00:05:08.280> way<00:05:08.460> to<00:05:08.520> go<00:05:08.729> but

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
simplest cheapest latest way to go but

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.270 
simplest cheapest latest way to go but
