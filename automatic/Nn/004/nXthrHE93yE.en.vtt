00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
the bat it looks like she can do kind of

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.929 
the bat it looks like she can do kind of
a<00:01:12.960> big<00:01:13.260> out<00:01:13.470> move<00:01:13.770> with<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> jumpers<00:01:14.700> like<00:01:14.909> a

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
kind of a dive kick right after that's a

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.060 
kind of a dive kick right after that's a
move<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.880> I'm<00:01:18.060> really<00:01:18.900> liking<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.500> far<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.950> I

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
move that I'm really liking so far and I

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.670 
move that I'm really liking so far and I
know<00:01:20.130> that's<00:01:20.310> going<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.610> trip<00:01:20.880> some<00:01:21.060> people<00:01:21.360> up

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
know that's going to trip some people up

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.700 
know that's going to trip some people up
and<00:01:22.680> another<00:01:23.490> vein<00:01:23.820> kind<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.210> one's<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.710> big

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
and another vein kind of one's of big

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.649 
and another vein kind of one's of big
things<00:01:25.740> about<00:01:26.280> Batgirl<00:01:26.549> I'm<00:01:26.850> loving<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.450> that

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
things about Batgirl I'm loving is that

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.200 
things about Batgirl I'm loving is that
she<00:01:27.960> seems<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.979> projectile<00:01:29.700> counter

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
she seems to have a projectile counter

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.460 
she seems to have a projectile counter
now<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:32.670> IV<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.570> makes<00:01:33.900> her<00:01:34.020> need<00:01:34.229> only

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
now the IV this makes her need only

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.319 
now the IV this makes her need only
character<00:01:34.920> needs<00:01:35.130> higher<00:01:35.400> caste<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.000> far<00:01:36.210> to

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
character needs higher caste so far to

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.870 
character needs higher caste so far to
habits<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.560> thing<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.950> she<00:01:38.460> comes<00:01:38.700> in

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
habits and the thing is she comes in

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.390 
habits and the thing is she comes in
vertically<00:01:39.360> after<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.259> attack<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.220> think

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
vertically after the attack so I think

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.580 
vertically after the attack so I think
this<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.119> going<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.600> be<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> complete<00:01:43.200> major

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
this is going to be a complete major

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.190 
this is going to be a complete major
counter<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.430> any<00:01:44.700> zoning<00:01:45.240> character<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
counter to any zoning character in the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.350 
counter to any zoning character in the
game<00:01:46.229> especially<00:01:46.950> characters<00:01:47.610> like<00:01:47.759> Superman

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
game especially characters like Superman

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.960 
game especially characters like Superman
which<00:01:49.079> right<00:01:49.350> now<00:01:49.560> are<00:01:49.860> extremely<00:01:50.640> hard<00:01:50.850> to

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
which right now are extremely hard to

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.149 
which right now are extremely hard to
