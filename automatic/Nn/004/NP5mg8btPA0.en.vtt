you know

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.529 
you know
the<00:04:23.830> way<00:04:23.919> your<00:04:24.099> bones<00:04:24.310> are<00:04:24.610> in<00:04:24.759> your<00:04:24.940> arm<00:04:25.120> you

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
kind of draw a natural curve line you'll

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.600 
kind of draw a natural curve line you'll
notice<00:04:28.990> that<00:04:29.139> it's<00:04:29.349> really<00:04:29.770> actually<00:04:29.979> hard<00:04:30.490> to

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
notice that it's really actually hard to

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.350 
notice that it's really actually hard to
draw<00:04:30.970> a<00:04:31.590> line<00:04:32.590> like<00:04:32.800> this<00:04:33.069> because<00:04:33.909> you<00:04:34.270> know

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
draw a line like this because you know

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.360 
draw a line like this because you know
that's<00:04:35.080> not<00:04:35.289> how<00:04:35.470> your<00:04:35.650> bones<00:04:35.860> rotate

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
that's not how your bones rotate

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.499 
that's not how your bones rotate
naturally<00:04:37.210> so<00:04:37.900> sometimes<00:04:39.150> you<00:04:40.150> know<00:04:40.240> you're

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
naturally so sometimes you know you're

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.990 
naturally so sometimes you know you're
going<00:04:40.750> to<00:04:40.840> want<00:04:40.990> to<00:04:41.050> hit<00:04:41.169> are<00:04:41.409> and<00:04:41.860> this<00:04:42.789> will

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
going to want to hit are and this will

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.360 
going to want to hit are and this will
allow<00:04:43.120> you<00:04:43.300> to<00:04:43.419> rotate<00:04:43.750> your<00:04:44.020> canvas<00:04:44.650> so<00:04:45.310> you

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
allow you to rotate your canvas so you

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.490 
allow you to rotate your canvas so you
can<00:04:45.550> achieve<00:04:45.639> like<00:04:46.300> you<00:04:46.659> know<00:04:46.780> the<00:04:47.229> curves

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
can achieve like you know the curves

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.100 
can achieve like you know the curves
that<00:04:47.740> are<00:04:48.360> you<00:04:49.360> know<00:04:51.090> better<00:04:52.090> like<00:04:52.449> difficult

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
that are you know better like difficult

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.619 
that are you know better like difficult
for<00:04:53.319> you<00:04:53.409> to<00:04:53.500> you<00:04:53.710> know<00:04:53.740> usually<00:04:54.250> achieve

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:54.629 
for you to you know usually achieve
