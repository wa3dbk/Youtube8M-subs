this<00:04:02.650> is<00:04:02.859> the<00:04:03.540> sky<00:04:04.569> the<00:04:05.440> base<00:04:05.709> model<00:04:05.739> so<00:04:06.579> it

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
this is the sky the base model so it

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.270 
this is the sky the base model so it
only<00:04:07.359> has<00:04:07.690> seven<00:04:08.049> cogs<00:04:08.260> seven<00:04:08.680> speeds<00:04:09.069> in<00:04:09.250> the

a whole lot I think this is plenty and
if<00:04:17.019> you<00:04:17.229> go<00:04:17.739> down<00:04:18.549> you<00:04:19.000> can<00:04:19.150> see<00:04:19.539> again<00:04:20.169> the
