okay<00:00:00.599> so<00:00:00.659> today<00:00:01.050> today<00:00:01.530> we're<00:00:01.770> gonna<00:00:02.370> be<00:00:02.580> using

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
okay so today today we're gonna be using

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.660 
okay so today today we're gonna be using
the<00:00:03.000> active<00:00:03.330> FX<00:00:03.720> this<00:00:03.899> is<00:00:03.959> a<00:00:04.110> co2<00:00:04.640> Fraxel<00:00:05.640> laser

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
the active FX this is a co2 Fraxel laser

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.540 
the active FX this is a co2 Fraxel laser
and<00:00:06.740> this<00:00:07.740> is<00:00:07.919> one<00:00:08.069> of<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.220> newest

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
and this is one of the newest

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.150 
and this is one of the newest
technologies<00:00:09.090> available<00:00:09.230> to<00:00:10.230> put<00:00:10.980> some

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
technologies available to put some

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.129 
technologies available to put some
perspective<00:00:11.670> on<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:12.030> there's<00:00:12.210> many<00:00:12.540> lasers<00:00:12.840> on

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
perspective on it there's many lasers on

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.720 
perspective on it there's many lasers on
the<00:00:13.230> market<00:00:13.590> but<00:00:13.740> this<00:00:13.920> laser<00:00:14.190> in<00:00:14.400> particular

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
the market but this laser in particular

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.349 
the market but this laser in particular
is<00:00:15.269> an<00:00:15.509> ablative<00:00:15.929> laser<00:00:16.289> so<00:00:17.220> there's<00:00:17.580> more

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
is an ablative laser so there's more

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.910 
is an ablative laser so there's more
significant<00:00:18.869> results<00:00:19.350> than<00:00:19.470> non<00:00:19.650> ablative

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
significant results than non ablative

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.849 
significant results than non ablative
lasers<00:00:20.460> it's<00:00:21.150> gonna<00:00:21.480> give<00:00:21.869> dramatic<00:00:22.470> effects

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
lasers it's gonna give dramatic effects

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.710 
lasers it's gonna give dramatic effects
the<00:00:23.070> patient<00:00:23.490> but<00:00:23.609> there<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.000> approximately

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
the patient but there is approximately

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.720 
the patient but there is approximately
about<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.960> week<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.410> downtime<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.580> for<00:00:26.670> the

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
about a week of downtime so for the

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.580 
about a week of downtime so for the
patient<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.180> wants<00:00:27.390> dramatic<00:00:27.900> results<00:00:28.410> and

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
patient that wants dramatic results and

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.919 
patient that wants dramatic results and
wants<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.160> one<00:00:29.519> shot<00:00:29.849> one<00:00:30.150> treatment<00:00:30.480> this

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
wants it on one shot one treatment this

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.170 
wants it on one shot one treatment this
is<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.500> only<00:00:32.160> treatment<00:00:32.550> really<00:00:32.880> out<00:00:33.000> there

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
is the only treatment really out there

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.690 
is the only treatment really out there
that<00:00:33.329> will<00:00:33.420> give<00:00:33.570> those<00:00:33.719> types<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.200> news<00:00:34.380> loans

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
that will give those types of news loans

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.709 
that will give those types of news loans
okay<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:35.760> we're<00:00:35.940> doing<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.180> deep<00:00:36.360> setting

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
okay so we're doing the deep setting

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.020 
okay so we're doing the deep setting
with<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.899> deep<00:00:37.079> FX<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:38.340> we're<00:00:38.460> following<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
with the deep FX and we're following the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.190 
with the deep FX and we're following the
deep<00:00:39.239> lines<00:00:39.860> on<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.040> forehead<00:00:44.809> go<00:00:45.809> down<00:00:46.020> to

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
deep lines on the forehead go down to

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:55.580 
deep lines on the forehead go down to
this<00:00:46.320> line<00:00:46.649> here

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.930 

there's<00:00:56.590> a<00:00:56.680> line<00:00:56.920> right<00:00:56.950> here<00:00:57.430> so<00:00:57.489> we're<00:00:57.820> now

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
there's a line right here so we're now

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.430 
there's a line right here so we're now
doing<00:00:58.000> the<00:00:58.329> area<00:00:58.629> on<00:00:58.719> the<00:00:58.840> sides<00:00:59.110> of<00:00:59.290> the<00:00:59.410> eyes

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
doing the area on the sides of the eyes

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.360 
doing the area on the sides of the eyes
which<00:00:59.860> are<00:01:00.010> typically<00:01:00.370> known<00:01:00.640> as<00:01:00.670> crow's<00:01:01.149> feet

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
which are typically known as crow's feet

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.740 
which are typically known as crow's feet
this<00:01:03.370> is<00:01:03.430> an<00:01:03.670> area<00:01:03.970> that<00:01:04.089> we<00:01:04.180> often<00:01:04.510> treat<00:01:04.629> with

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
this is an area that we often treat with

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.810 
this is an area that we often treat with
Botox<00:01:05.199> to<00:01:05.350> prevent<00:01:05.680> these<00:01:05.830> lines<00:01:06.159> coming<00:01:06.490> but

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
Botox to prevent these lines coming but

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.760 
Botox to prevent these lines coming but
once<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.090> lines<00:01:07.300> are<00:01:07.479> formed<00:01:07.990> there's<00:01:08.530> no

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
once the lines are formed there's no

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.830 
once the lines are formed there's no
other<00:01:08.890> great<00:01:09.159> treatment<00:01:09.460> other<00:01:09.729> than<00:01:09.850> trying

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
other great treatment other than trying

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.690 
other great treatment other than trying
to<00:01:10.900> regenerate<00:01:11.200> new<00:01:11.590> skin<00:01:11.950> in<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:12.190> area<00:01:14.700> and

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
to regenerate new skin in the area and

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.070 
to regenerate new skin in the area and
so<00:01:15.880> this<00:01:16.030> is<00:01:16.240> sort<00:01:16.479> of<00:01:16.570> revolutionary

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
so this is sort of revolutionary

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:29.430 
so this is sort of revolutionary
technology<00:01:20.080> that<00:01:20.350> to<00:01:20.890> deal<00:01:21.100> with<00:01:21.310> that<00:01:28.440> so

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
technology that to deal with that so

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.230 
technology that to deal with that so
what<00:01:29.560> we've<00:01:29.710> done<00:01:29.890> so<00:01:30.160> far<00:01:30.190> as<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.759> right<00:01:30.940> side

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
what we've done so far as the right side

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.730 
what we've done so far as the right side
of<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.450> face<00:01:31.660> we've<00:01:31.960> done<00:01:32.140> both<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.530> deep

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
of the face we've done both the deep

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.950 
of the face we've done both the deep
modality<00:01:33.460> of<00:01:33.490> treatment<00:01:33.580> called<00:01:34.300> the<00:01:34.420> at<00:01:34.539> and

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
modality of treatment called the at and

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.359 
modality of treatment called the at and
deep<00:01:35.200> effects<00:01:35.649> and<00:01:35.890> now<00:01:35.979> we've<00:01:36.130> done<00:01:36.250> the

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
deep effects and now we've done the

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.940 
deep effects and now we've done the
superficial<00:01:36.820> act<00:01:37.240> of<00:01:37.420> FX<00:01:37.810> you<00:01:37.990> can<00:01:38.110> see<00:01:38.350> the

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
superficial act of FX you can see the

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.200 
superficial act of FX you can see the
difference<00:01:39.310> between<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.759> left<00:01:39.940> and<00:01:40.149> the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
difference between the left and the

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.550 
difference between the left and the
right<00:01:40.390> side<00:01:40.630> of<00:01:40.660> the<00:01:40.780> face<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.200> right<00:01:41.380> side

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
right side of the face the right side

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.650 
right side of the face the right side
has<00:01:41.710> all<00:01:41.920> these<00:01:42.070> laser<00:01:42.850> beam<00:01:43.119> holes<00:01:43.390> that<00:01:43.539> have

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
has all these laser beam holes that have

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.359 
has all these laser beam holes that have
been<00:01:43.780> made<00:01:43.960> into<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.350> superficial<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.310> the

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
been made into the superficial and the

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.999 
been made into the superficial and the
deep<00:01:45.520> layers<00:01:45.880> of<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.149> skin<00:01:46.539> and<00:01:46.990> this<00:01:47.710> is

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
deep layers of the skin and this is

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.499 
deep layers of the skin and this is
going<00:01:48.160> to<00:01:48.220> immediately<00:01:48.429> tighten<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.210> skin
