i pad because it does not have enough

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.750 
i pad because it does not have enough
power<00:02:13.400> for<00:02:13.700> that<00:02:14.150> there<00:02:14.659> is<00:02:14.870> basically<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.760> not

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
power for that there is basically it not

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.910 
power for that there is basically it not
much<00:02:16.970> else<00:02:17.269> I<00:02:17.480> can<00:02:17.540> say<00:02:17.959> you<00:02:18.409> see<00:02:18.590> right<00:02:18.739> there

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
much else I can say you see right there

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.910 
much else I can say you see right there
it<00:02:19.040> does<00:02:19.190> have<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.670> retractable<00:02:20.349> wall<00:02:21.349> plug

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
it does have the retractable wall plug

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.000 
it does have the retractable wall plug
and<00:02:22.959> so<00:02:23.959> that's<00:02:24.110> pretty<00:02:24.260> much<00:02:24.379> it<00:02:24.440> i<00:02:24.620> mean<00:02:24.830> this

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
and so that's pretty much it i mean this

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.000 
and so that's pretty much it i mean this
is<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.580> kind<00:02:25.610> of<00:02:25.819> thing<00:02:25.879> that<00:02:26.090> i<00:02:26.659> think<00:02:27.010> most

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
is the kind of thing that i think most

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.479 
is the kind of thing that i think most
people<00:02:28.400> would<00:02:29.440> use<00:02:30.440> because<00:02:30.739> you<00:02:31.069> know<00:02:31.190> if<00:02:31.310> you

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
people would use because you know if you

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.460 
people would use because you know if you
go<00:02:31.700> especially<00:02:32.510> with<00:02:32.629> the<00:02:32.720> new<00:02:32.750> smartphones

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
go especially with the new smartphones

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.830 
go especially with the new smartphones
with<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.650> bigger<00:02:33.830> screens<00:02:34.629> battery<00:02:35.629> life

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
with the bigger screens battery life

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.680 
with the bigger screens battery life
sent<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.200> be<00:02:36.290> even<00:02:37.250> shorter<00:02:37.280> than<00:02:37.879> that<00:02:38.120> used

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
sent to be even shorter than that used

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.160 
sent to be even shorter than that used
to<00:02:38.870> be<00:02:39.099> and<00:02:40.099> so<00:02:40.700> definitely<00:02:41.540> I<00:02:41.629> think<00:02:41.690> this<00:02:42.019> is

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
to be and so definitely I think this is

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.369 
to be and so definitely I think this is
a<00:02:42.200> must<00:02:42.470> have<00:02:42.709> in<00:02:43.010> any<00:02:43.879> backpack<00:02:44.870> that<00:02:45.290> you

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
a must have in any backpack that you

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.350 
a must have in any backpack that you
have<00:02:45.620> you<00:02:45.829> just<00:02:45.980> throw<00:02:46.220> it<00:02:46.310> in<00:02:46.370> there<00:02:46.610> even<00:02:47.180> if

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
have you just throw it in there even if

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.729 
have you just throw it in there even if
you<00:02:47.450> don't<00:02:47.599> use<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:47.810> very<00:02:47.989> often<00:02:48.379> you<00:02:48.650> know

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
you don't use it very often you know

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.650 
you don't use it very often you know
sometimes<00:02:49.220> it's<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:49.730> worst<00:02:50.060> times<00:02:50.390> when<00:02:50.569> you

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
sometimes it's the worst times when you

sometimes it's the worst times when you
