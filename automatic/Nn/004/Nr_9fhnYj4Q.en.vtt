00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:06.410
 Werner Daemen the dominator of the first race challenged with his BMW Group 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.860
 Good mood even with Stefan Nebel because he had sixth place in the KTM internal duel 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.909
 won against Martin Bauer 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:17.450
 Umea ca the apparently not with the two-cylinder engine 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.849
 from Austria 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:21.919
 Dario Giuseppetti on the podium 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:23.300
 finally again 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.329
 successes 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:25.669
 for the Berliner 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:27.810
 and refreshing for the heart 7 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.119
 and even moderate stands absence of Jörg Teuchert he had the important 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.860
 Points 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.820
 taken for second place that the requirements 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.790
 before the second race 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.050
 Marga Spiegel was the backdrop 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.600
 a phenomenal race track 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.240
 the Salzburgring 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.550
 in the ideal the top speed range 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.550
 the favorite place was Sascha Hommel 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.680
 the stunted similar to the start complete and hurried after the field 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.520
 this value reaches 7 0 in the lead 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.420
 with the Ducati actually still is the machine 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.190
 and already know »so that they are in front 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.900
 Schiereck came 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.140
 opposite uphill 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.140
 wished with karma the famous paddock curve 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.530
 Air France is on the left 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.880
 which should still play a role 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.620
 on this day 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.590
 nobody could stand down Werner Daemen 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.090
 the winner of race 1 in third position in wait 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.540
 this bet now on 2 and Marc Rich 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.090
 thus afford slides 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.090
 but rear wheel in the chicane 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.330
 Werner Daemen in the lead 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.650
 both are for his taste 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.650
 Unfortunately, the business was running 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.060
 neither the Poppea the in race 1 of the Belgians 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.650
 as well as the competition of it 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.940
 Of course the power of the BMW played a big role 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.420
 but Werner Daemen 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.830
 an absolute insider here on the Salzburgring Wotan Markus Eiche with the 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.099
 showacts 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.079
 a stop target 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.939
 an omen for the job 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.429
 Race 8 percent 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:20.439
 Marguerite game pushes the risk too high 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.260
 old Zabel to the red flags race call as well run two 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:30.179
 after the fall of the title candidate 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:33.079
 this act place 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.579
 right straw bales 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.299
 Huber is seen today 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.519
 only very rarely in the form of a restart the episode 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.079
 the place of 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.299
 skimmed milk 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.299
 how much the bike was nothing to pack up her 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:52.329
 and again the pictures delivered form there but that's Meier 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.799
 the stress 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.449
 there were some involved 

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:03.129
 Stefan fog 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.089
 and then 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:06.549
 Mathias Werth 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.219
 fog 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:11.299
 Fall victims in the initial phase after the restart 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.040
 because there who was a good result above all things for Stefan fog tears 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:22.719
 Martin Bauer but rear wheel of the two BMWs by TENNEMANN 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:24.159
 and 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.829
 Werner Daemen to the PC in fourth 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.889
 Heldt still the connection 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.889
 with the red-white Hertrampf guest 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.859
 ahead 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.829
 Fahnemann behind it 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:38.949
 and farmer 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:41.949
 significantly improved compared to the first race 

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:44.479
 the fight of the two-cylinder 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:47.479
 behind the two leading BMWs 

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:53.929
 and his men the teammates 

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:55.559
 really serious 

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:57.929
 not catch up 

00:03:57.929 --> 00:04:00.170
 the most powerful series 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.339
 Visitors wide world and this impact their formulations fox 

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:05.789
 the guest starter 

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:08.839
 with the series more in the way drove in the top group 

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:13.589
 and there came like Jürgen Fuchs himself 

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:16.189
 the racer ambition again with him through 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:19.919
 There was a lot of luck in the driver lay before birth bathing 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.559
 First, it was 

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:24.559
 the departure of Jürgen Fuchs a bit 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.949
 the two BMWs in front 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:33.689
 8th 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:35.059
 Werner Daemen 

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:38.059
 clearly the strongest harvest these weeks 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.370
 the one in his office 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.189
 Surprisingly, it was not a bad idea whether Berlin 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:45.039
 his teammate 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.460
 To watch Filip again and again remained in the chicane on the track 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.310
 Lumen, then 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.870
 also for the latecomers 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.059
 that's Meier 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:57.099
 his hunt behind the top 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:58.800
 too early on the gas 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.710
 Set 4 1 cyclists 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.490
 the second half 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.169
 racing failure 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.729
 and again flags threatened again so no demolition 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.750
 a da Burris Meier Suzuki burned after Stuhls certainly 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.600
 Nevertheless 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.330
 the Salzburgring Wood 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.460
 best advertisement for motorsport 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.159
 Of course, listen to the track between each individual 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:27.899
 yes it is different than other track but that is not so meanwhile 

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:31.249
 sure to come back which one is no longer there it is also upper 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:34.589
 Castle to get why and what justified my mother was then 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:36.599
 was stolen 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:40.679
 Ai work meeting they need to be from the corn snake while it is not mine 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.010
 I hope that it goes on is it is one thing is clear of course not 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:49.030
 relieve well so should not be stuck in it 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.259
 would not even say then 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.300
 he has a volley in there out 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.860
 At the same time all animals would dodge those 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.539
 what we're doing tonight 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:01.409
 Euro agreed 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:02.449
 7 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:06.820
 The nearly 20 million earned voters would be threatened at that time economy 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:09.819
 on descent and sporty on 

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.189
 Sarah total loss 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:16.069
 the weekend is over after the race
