00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
covering the hole all the way or maybe

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.030 
covering the hole all the way or maybe
your<00:01:33.570> thumb<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.990> coming<00:01:34.320> off<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.619> thumb<00:01:34.799> hole

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
the neck key that a flat key again so

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.210 
the neck key that a flat key again so
just<00:01:39.210> be<00:01:39.540> careful<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:40.409> your<00:01:40.560> good<00:01:40.860> hand

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
position and that will help to solve

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:43.990 
position and that will help to solve
that<00:01:43.380> problem

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
that problem

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.580 
that problem
okay<00:01:45.000> then<00:01:45.630> we're<00:01:45.780> going<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.930> go<00:01:46.140> from<00:01:47.040> low<00:01:47.460> a

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
okay then we're going to go from low a

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.819 
okay then we're going to go from low a
one<00:01:49.590> two<00:01:49.770> three<00:01:50.100> one<00:01:50.399> two<00:01:50.509> low<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:52.049> then

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
one two three one two low a and then

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.230 
one two three one two low a and then
we're<00:01:52.920> going<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.070> tip<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.549> register<00:01:53.939> key<00:01:54.119> and

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
we're going to tip the register key and

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:02.240 
we're going to tip the register key and
go<00:01:54.329> up<00:01:54.450> for<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.659> high<00:01:54.840> note

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.150 

okay<00:02:03.150> here<00:02:03.510> comes<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.870> harder<00:02:04.200> ones<00:02:04.410> the<00:02:04.980> more

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
okay here comes the harder ones the more

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.350 
okay here comes the harder ones the more
favors<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.580> we<00:02:05.670> have<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.030> more<00:02:06.180> difficult

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
favors that we have the more difficult

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.170

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.180 
this gets so you have one two three one

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.080 
this gets so you have one two three one
