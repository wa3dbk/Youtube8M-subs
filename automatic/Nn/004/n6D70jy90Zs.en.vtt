is<00:02:30.730> that<00:02:30.940> it's<00:02:31.150> just<00:02:31.360> so<00:02:31.660> loose<00:02:31.990> that<00:02:32.320> if<00:02:32.530> you

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
is that it's just so loose that if you

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.070 
is that it's just so loose that if you
move<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.220> iPad<00:02:33.400> a<00:02:33.610> little<00:02:33.940> bit<00:02:34.120> it's<00:02:34.870> going<00:02:34.960> to

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
move the iPad a little bit it's going to

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.300 
move the iPad a little bit it's going to
get<00:02:35.140> this<00:02:35.320> kanker<00:02:35.560> that's<00:02:35.860> why<00:02:35.980> I<00:02:36.010> can't

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
get this kanker that's why I can't

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.250 
get this kanker that's why I can't
really<00:02:36.460> show<00:02:36.580> you<00:02:36.790> what<00:02:37.570> this<00:02:37.720> that<00:02:37.930> has<00:02:38.110> to

this star's sky I'm just moving my iPad

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.110 
this star's sky I'm just moving my iPad
in<00:03:07.750> my<00:03:07.780> office<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:08.410> if<00:03:08.890> I<00:03:09.100> was<00:03:09.280> outside<00:03:09.489> that's

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
in my office and if I was outside that's

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.070 
in my office and if I was outside that's
what<00:03:10.480> I<00:03:10.510> would<00:03:10.780> be<00:03:10.930> seeing<00:03:11.700> at<00:03:12.700> my<00:03:12.880> location

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.770 

and<00:03:17.080> I<00:03:17.950> would<00:03:18.160> be<00:03:18.280> able<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.520> maybe<00:03:19.420> not<00:03:19.630> as

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
and I would be able to maybe not as

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.900 
and I would be able to maybe not as
clear<00:03:20.200> as<00:03:20.350> this<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:20.980> my<00:03:21.070> eyes<00:03:21.220> are<00:03:21.459> not<00:03:21.489> as

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
clear as this and my eyes are not as

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.330 
clear as this and my eyes are not as
strong<00:03:22.239> as<00:03:22.420> they<00:03:22.570> used<00:03:22.780> to<00:03:22.900> be<00:03:23.080> so<00:03:24.070> some<00:03:24.310> of

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
strong as they used to be so some of

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.100 
strong as they used to be so some of
these<00:03:24.489> may<00:03:24.760> not<00:03:24.790> be<00:03:25.150> as<00:03:25.239> visible<00:03:25.510> as<00:03:25.750> they<00:03:25.959> are

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
these may not be as visible as they are

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.840 
these may not be as visible as they are
here<00:03:26.500> but<00:03:27.900> it's<00:03:28.900> obviously<00:03:29.380> nice<00:03:29.820> option<00:03:30.820> to

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
here but it's obviously nice option to

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.960 
here but it's obviously nice option to
have<00:03:31.000> you<00:03:31.300> can<00:03:31.450> see<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.780> map<00:03:32.739> the<00:03:33.310> path<00:03:33.760> of

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
have you can see the map the path of

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.140 
have you can see the map the path of
Neptune<00:03:34.390> and<00:03:34.630> red<00:03:35.350> was<00:03:35.620> that<00:03:36.070> say<00:03:36.220> 9:30<00:03:36.430> now<00:03:36.970> is

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
Neptune and red was that say 9:30 now is

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.170 
Neptune and red was that say 9:30 now is
11<00:03:37.540> o'clock<00:03:37.720> so<00:03:38.080> a<00:03:38.310> lot<00:03:39.310> of<00:03:39.430> cool<00:03:39.580> stuff<00:03:39.610> here

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
11 o'clock so a lot of cool stuff here

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.460 
11 o'clock so a lot of cool stuff here
and<00:03:40.420> it<00:03:40.570> works<00:03:40.750> anywhere<00:03:41.080> you<00:03:41.170> don't<00:03:41.350> even

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
and it works anywhere you don't even

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.610 
and it works anywhere you don't even
need<00:03:41.620> that<00:03:41.680> a<00:03:41.830> connection<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:42.400> use<00:03:42.550> it<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:44.590> can

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
need that a connection to use it you can

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.560 
need that a connection to use it you can
take<00:03:45.100> it<00:03:45.250> outside<00:03:45.400> and<00:03:45.880> just<00:03:45.940> get<00:03:46.180> that<00:03:46.330> guide

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
take it outside and just get that guide

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.170 
take it outside and just get that guide
it's<00:03:46.870> like<00:03:46.989> an<00:03:47.140> interactive<00:03:47.520> map<00:03:48.520> of<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.880> sky

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
it's like an interactive map of the sky

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.510 
it's like an interactive map of the sky
so<00:03:49.690> you<00:03:49.720> can<00:03:50.050> get<00:03:50.200> a<00:03:50.230> better<00:03:50.410> understanding<00:03:51.190> of

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
so you can get a better understanding of

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.810 
so you can get a better understanding of
what<00:03:52.000> you're<00:03:52.150> looking<00:03:52.480> at<00:03:52.660> and<00:03:55.350> settings

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
what you're looking at and settings

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.160 
what you're looking at and settings
covered<00:03:57.820> everything<00:03:58.209> I<00:03:58.390> think<00:03:58.450> you<00:03:58.989> can

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
covered everything I think you can

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:07.860 
covered everything I think you can
change<00:03:59.650> the<00:03:59.860> visibility<00:04:00.040> of<00:04:00.459> stars<00:04:06.870> calculate

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
change the visibility of stars calculate

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:22.129 
change the visibility of stars calculate
for<00:04:08.019> your<00:04:08.140> own<00:04:08.290> location

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.610 

as<00:04:23.139> soon<00:04:23.350> as<00:04:23.440> I<00:04:23.560> take<00:04:23.830> a<00:04:24.160> come<00:04:24.790> out<00:04:24.940> of<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.240> path

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
as soon as I take a come out of the path

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:32.909 
as soon as I take a come out of the path
you<00:04:26.620> can<00:04:26.800> see<00:04:29.970> and<00:04:31.380> let<00:04:32.380> me<00:04:32.470> just<00:04:32.620> show<00:04:32.740> you<00:04:32.800> the

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
you can see and let me just show you the

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.530 
you can see and let me just show you the
planets<00:04:33.340> again<00:04:33.639> and<00:04:33.790> that's<00:04:33.970> about<00:04:34.090> as<00:04:34.360> I

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
planets again and that's about as I

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.850 
planets again and that's about as I
think<00:04:35.320> that's<00:04:35.500> best

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
think that's best

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.370 
think that's best
I<00:04:35.950> can<00:04:36.160> do<00:04:36.400> based<00:04:36.730> on<00:04:36.970> what<00:04:37.210> I<00:04:37.810> have<00:04:38.110> in<00:04:38.260> my

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
I can do based on what I have in my

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.740 
I can do based on what I have in my
office<00:04:38.410> so<00:04:38.889> you<00:04:38.950> have<00:04:39.190> solar<00:04:39.850> system<00:04:40.270> stars

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
office so you have solar system stars

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.380 
office so you have solar system stars
constellations<00:04:42.330> you<00:04:43.330> have<00:04:44.910> 3d<00:04:45.910> objects<00:04:46.300> that

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
constellations you have 3d objects that

00:04:46.390 --> 00:05:18.029 
constellations you have 3d objects that
you<00:04:46.510> can<00:04:46.660> see

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:19.859 

so<00:05:18.460> and<00:05:18.580> it<00:05:18.819> provides<00:05:19.330> you<00:05:19.479> with<00:05:19.599> information

00:05:19.859 --> 00:05:19.869 
so and it provides you with information

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:23.100 
so and it provides you with information
on<00:05:20.289> all<00:05:20.499> these<00:05:20.770> objects<00:05:21.309> so<00:05:21.969> this<00:05:22.270> is<00:05:22.449> sky<00:05:23.050> view

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
on all these objects so this is sky view

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.549 
on all these objects so this is sky view
pretty<00:05:23.740> cool<00:05:24.520> application<00:05:25.119> it's<00:05:25.839> very<00:05:26.229> simple

00:05:26.549 --> 00:05:26.559 
pretty cool application it's very simple

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:28.920 
pretty cool application it's very simple
