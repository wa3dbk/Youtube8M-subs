changes from tablet to tablet but for
example<00:02:05.100> for<00:02:05.400> me<00:02:05.550> it<00:02:05.940> cost<00:02:06.290> 645<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.650> make<00:02:07.800> a

example for me it cost 645 to make a
Camelot<00:02:08.369> tablet<00:02:08.880> and<00:02:09.619> then<00:02:10.619> Camelot<00:02:11.610> tablets

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
Camelot tablet and then Camelot tablets

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.140 
Camelot tablet and then Camelot tablets
will<00:02:12.720> sell<00:02:13.080> for<00:02:13.730> about<00:02:15.530> 956<00:02:16.530> each<00:02:17.010> so<00:02:17.640> that's

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
will sell for about 956 each so that's

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.630 
will sell for about 956 each so that's
over<00:02:18.540> 300<00:02:19.080> profit<00:02:19.560> per<00:02:19.740> tablet<00:02:20.010> which<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.490> in

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
over 300 profit per tablet which is in

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.520 
over 300 profit per tablet which is in
bed<00:02:20.850> since<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.900> can<00:02:22.050> make<00:02:22.200> them<00:02:22.380> pretty

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
bed since that you can make them pretty

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.580 
bed since that you can make them pretty
fast<00:02:22.920> so<00:02:25.850> your<00:02:26.850> once<00:02:27.240> you<00:02:27.420> gal<00:02:27.600> your<00:02:27.840> once<00:02:28.500> you

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
fast so your once you gal your once you

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.720 
fast so your once you gal your once you
get<00:02:28.710> your<00:02:28.770> inventory<00:02:29.190> set<00:02:29.370> up<00:02:29.490> you're<00:02:29.640> going

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
get your inventory set up you're going

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.780

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:49.530 

and<00:02:36.909> then<00:02:37.659> you<00:02:37.870> should<00:02:38.579> find<00:02:39.579> a<00:02:39.700> house<00:02:39.879> portal

people have really big houses and you're

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.270 
people have really big houses and you're
going<00:03:23.900> to<00:03:23.959> need<00:03:24.110> to<00:03:24.200> know<00:03:24.380> where<00:03:24.800> the<00:03:24.920> lectern

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
going to need to know where the lectern

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.580 
going to need to know where the lectern
is<00:03:25.489> so<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.330> easiest<00:03:26.480> way<00:03:26.840> that<00:03:26.989> I<00:03:27.020> know<00:03:27.200> to<00:03:27.410> do

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
is so the easiest way that I know to do

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.280 
is so the easiest way that I know to do
that<00:03:27.620> is<00:03:28.209> find<00:03:29.209> a<00:03:29.450> spot<00:03:29.750> in<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:29.900> map<00:03:30.110> where

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
that is find a spot in the map where

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.290 
that is find a spot in the map where
there's<00:03:30.470> one<00:03:30.709> person<00:03:30.980> standing<00:03:31.640> there<00:03:31.850> like<00:03:32.239> a

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
there's one person standing there like a

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.690 
there's one person standing there like a
1<00:03:32.600> dot<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:33.170> like<00:03:33.320> right<00:03:33.500> here<00:03:33.800> this<00:03:34.340> looks<00:03:34.610> like

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
1 dot so like right here this looks like

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.190 
1 dot so like right here this looks like
that's<00:03:35.150> probably<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.660> lector<00:03:35.989> because

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
that's probably the lector because

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.240 
that's probably the lector because
they're<00:03:36.380> all<00:03:36.530> stacked<00:03:37.310> up<00:03:37.520> right<00:03:37.760> there<00:03:37.940> so

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
they're all stacked up right there so

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
they're all stacked up right there so
I'm<00:03:40.250> going<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:40.489> go<00:03:40.610> right<00:03:40.730> there<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.090> see<00:03:41.209> if

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
I'm going to go right there and see if

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.810 
I'm going to go right there and see if
that's<00:03:41.450> the<00:03:41.570> lectern<00:03:42.080> and<00:03:42.290> yep<00:03:43.220> there<00:03:43.640> it<00:03:43.730> is

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
that's the lectern and yep there it is

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.990 
that's the lectern and yep there it is
so<00:03:44.480> there's<00:03:45.440> two<00:03:45.739> ways<00:03:45.920> you<00:03:46.310> can<00:03:46.400> make<00:03:46.550> them

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
so there's two ways you can make them

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.410 
so there's two ways you can make them
you<00:03:47.540> can<00:03:47.690> do<00:03:47.780> it<00:03:47.900> the<00:03:48.020> fast<00:03:48.320> way<00:03:48.680> by<00:03:49.580> doing<00:03:50.270> it

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
you can do it the fast way by doing it

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.530 
you can do it the fast way by doing it
one<00:03:51.110> by<00:03:51.260> one<00:03:51.400> which<00:03:52.400> is<00:03:52.430> a<00:03:52.549> lot<00:03:52.820> faster<00:03:53.060> than

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
one by one which is a lot faster than

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.890 
one by one which is a lot faster than
doing<00:03:53.870> it<00:03:53.989> like<00:03:54.799> all<00:03:55.100> at<00:03:55.310> once<00:03:55.730> because<00:03:56.720> you

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
doing it like all at once because you

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.840 
doing it like all at once because you
can<00:03:57.049> like<00:03:57.230> cancel<00:03:57.739> out<00:03:57.799> the<00:03:57.920> animation<00:03:58.519> and

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
can like cancel out the animation and

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.300 
can like cancel out the animation and
also<00:03:59.209> if<00:03:59.330> you're<00:03:59.480> doing<00:03:59.750> all<00:03:59.900> of<00:03:59.930> them<00:04:00.310> then

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
also if you're doing all of them then

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.390 
also if you're doing all of them then
you're<00:04:01.580> going<00:04:01.820> to<00:04:01.940> have<00:04:04.959> a<00:04:05.959> delay<00:04:06.530> I'll<00:04:06.920> show

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
you're going to have a delay I'll show

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.990 
you're going to have a delay I'll show
you<00:04:07.459> right<00:04:07.670> now<00:04:10.600> see<00:04:11.600> if<00:04:11.720> you<00:04:11.840> go<00:04:12.019> to<00:04:12.760> make<00:04:13.760> all

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
you right now see if you go to make all

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.469 
you right now see if you go to make all
by<00:04:14.330> right-clicking<00:04:15.280> you<00:04:16.280> have<00:04:16.430> a<00:04:16.459> pretty<00:04:17.299> big

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
by right-clicking you have a pretty big

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.020 
by right-clicking you have a pretty big
delay<00:04:17.840> between<00:04:18.410> when<00:04:18.709> you're<00:04:19.100> the<00:04:19.519> tabs<00:04:19.760> but

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
delay between when you're the tabs but

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.159 
delay between when you're the tabs but
if<00:04:20.120> you're<00:04:20.239> doing<00:04:20.419> something<00:04:20.600> like<00:04:20.750> watching

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
if you're doing something like watching

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.650 
if you're doing something like watching
TV<00:04:21.590> or<00:04:21.739> something<00:04:21.950> this<00:04:22.610> may<00:04:22.910> make<00:04:23.330> it<00:04:23.390> less

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
TV or something this may make it less

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.330 
TV or something this may make it less
boring<00:04:23.930> and<00:04:24.440> make<00:04:24.590> it<00:04:24.740> seem<00:04:24.979> like<00:04:25.160> it's

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
boring and make it seem like it's

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.640 
boring and make it seem like it's
actually<00:04:25.640> going<00:04:25.820> faster<00:04:26.390> so<00:04:27.140> it's<00:04:27.350> whatever

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
actually going faster so it's whatever

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.900 
actually going faster so it's whatever

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
about efficiency and this time you're

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.860 
about efficiency and this time you're
spinning<00:04:31.120> you're<00:04:32.120> going<00:04:32.360> to<00:04:32.419> want<00:04:32.570> to<00:04:32.660> do<00:04:32.780> it

to<00:04:53.810> peaches<00:04:53.990> tabs<00:04:54.530> these<00:04:55.100> are<00:04:55.490> around<00:04:56.000> 600<00:04:56.690> k

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
to peaches tabs these are around 600 k

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.020 
to peaches tabs these are around 600 k
per<00:04:57.140> hour<00:04:57.349> at<00:04:58.039> least<00:04:58.220> they<00:04:58.400> used<00:04:58.430> to<00:04:58.700> be<00:04:58.820> a<00:04:58.849> long

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
per hour at least they used to be a long

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.590 
per hour at least they used to be a long
time

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
time

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.950 
time
so<00:04:59.690> when<00:05:00.200> I<00:05:00.230> did<00:05:00.440> that<00:05:00.470> on<00:05:00.680> my<00:05:00.710> other<00:05:00.890> account

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
so when I did that on my other account

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.420 
so when I did that on my other account
which<00:05:02.960> is<00:05:02.990> pretty<00:05:03.590> good<00:05:03.860> money<00:05:04.040> but<00:05:04.480> you<00:05:05.480> get

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
which is pretty good money but you get

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.320 
which is pretty good money but you get
very<00:05:07.430> little<00:05:07.640> experience<00:05:08.230> from<00:05:09.230> this<00:05:09.410> and<00:05:10.330> so

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
very little experience from this and so

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.930 
very little experience from this and so
it's<00:05:11.510> up<00:05:11.630> to<00:05:11.660> you<00:05:11.900> and<00:05:12.110> then<00:05:12.530> if<00:05:12.650> and<00:05:13.190> to<00:05:13.280> be

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
able to make bones to peaches tabs you

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.090 
able to make bones to peaches tabs you
have<00:05:16.940> to<00:05:17.240> complete<00:05:17.750> the<00:05:18.050> mage<00:05:18.380> training<00:05:18.890> arena

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
still want profit you don't want to go

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.160 
still want profit you don't want to go
through<00:05:25.820> all<00:05:25.850> that<00:05:25.910> effort<00:05:26.060> then<00:05:26.960> you<00:05:27.050> can

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.170 
through all that effort then you can

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.650 
through all that effort then you can
also<00:05:27.290> make<00:05:27.590> house<00:05:27.860> tabs<00:05:28.280> house<00:05:28.970> tabs<00:05:29.300> are

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
also make house tabs house tabs are

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.460 
also make house tabs house tabs are
pretty<00:05:30.080> decent<00:05:30.470> money<00:05:30.620> and<00:05:32.230> you<00:05:33.230> don't<00:05:33.410> have

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
pretty decent money and you don't have

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:34.960 
pretty decent money and you don't have
to<00:05:33.620> do<00:05:33.800> anything<00:05:34.040> except<00:05:34.520> to<00:05:34.610> have<00:05:34.700> the<00:05:34.820> magic

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
to do anything except to have the magic

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.470 
to do anything except to have the magic
level<00:05:35.360> required<00:05:35.770> now<00:05:36.770> for<00:05:37.010> experience<00:05:37.610> the

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.480 
level required now for experience the

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.720 
level required now for experience the
higher<00:05:38.720> let<00:05:39.050> the<00:05:39.200> level<00:05:39.530> that<00:05:39.650> tab<00:05:39.920> is<00:05:40.190> then

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.730 
higher let the level that tab is then

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.670 
higher let the level that tab is then
the<00:05:42.280> more<00:05:43.280> experience<00:05:43.370> you<00:05:43.910> get<00:05:44.180> so<00:05:44.870> obviously

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
the more experience you get so obviously

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.850 
the more experience you get so obviously
the<00:05:45.860> very<00:05:46.070> best<00:05:46.430> tab<00:05:46.790> would<00:05:47.060> be<00:05:47.240> watchtower

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
the very best tab would be watchtower

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.740 
the very best tab would be watchtower
but<00:05:48.860> I<00:05:51.370> but<00:05:52.370> that<00:05:52.520> requires<00:05:52.670> not<00:05:53.360> only<00:05:53.390> to

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
but I but that requires not only to

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.860 
but I but that requires not only to
laurens<00:05:54.200> into<00:05:54.560> Earth<00:05:54.890> runes<00:05:55.280> so<00:05:56.150> you<00:05:56.600> won't<00:05:56.780> be

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
laurens into Earth runes so you won't be

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.570 
laurens into Earth runes so you won't be
making<00:05:56.990> as<00:05:57.230> much<00:05:57.350> profit<00:05:57.680> but<00:05:58.160> they<00:05:58.340> take

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
making as much profit but they take

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.950 
making as much profit but they take
longer<00:05:58.760> to<00:05:59.030> sell<00:05:59.330> because<00:05:59.480> not<00:05:59.720> that<00:05:59.840> many

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
longer to sell because not that many

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.920 
longer to sell because not that many
people<00:06:00.050> by<00:06:00.560> watchtower<00:06:01.100> tabs<00:06:01.460> so<00:06:02.240> usually

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
people by watchtower tabs so usually

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.440 
people by watchtower tabs so usually
what<00:06:03.440> most<00:06:03.650> people<00:06:04.040> consider<00:06:04.400> the<00:06:04.700> best<00:06:04.970> would

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
what most people consider the best would

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:10.780 
what most people consider the best would
be<00:06:05.480> are<00:06:05.720> doing<00:06:06.080> tabs<00:06:06.820> which<00:06:07.820> are<00:06:09.460> these<00:06:10.460> tabs

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
right here these are considered the best

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.290 
right here these are considered the best
