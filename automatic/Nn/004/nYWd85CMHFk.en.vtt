okay<00:00:00.930> it's<00:00:01.050> day<00:00:01.290> 18<00:00:01.620> of<00:00:02.070> this<00:00:02.370> garlic

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
okay it's day 18 of this garlic

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.519 
okay it's day 18 of this garlic
germination<00:00:03.120> experiment<00:00:03.870> and<00:00:04.080> nearly

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
germination experiment and nearly

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.309 
germination experiment and nearly
everything<00:00:04.799> I<00:00:05.160> see<00:00:05.400> has<00:00:05.730> germinated<00:00:06.319> except

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
everything I see has germinated except

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.620 
everything I see has germinated except
for<00:00:07.649> that<00:00:08.130> location<00:00:08.580> in<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:08.970> middle<00:00:09.150> where<00:00:09.570> I

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
for that location in the middle where I

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.259 
for that location in the middle where I
planted<00:00:10.110> an<00:00:10.320> entire<00:00:10.620> bulb<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.160> garlic<00:00:11.269> the

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
planted an entire bulb of garlic the

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.379 
planted an entire bulb of garlic the
other<00:00:12.509> locations<00:00:13.440> all<00:00:13.769> consist<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.670> sprouts

other locations all consist of sprouts
from<00:00:15.750> singular<00:00:16.260> cloves<00:00:16.770> from<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.850> other

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
from singular cloves from the other

from singular cloves from the other
three<00:00:18.240> bulbs<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.260> don't<00:00:19.529> know<00:00:19.619> why<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:20.010> is

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
three bulbs so I don't know why that is

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.140 
three bulbs so I don't know why that is
I'm<00:00:20.400> going<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.550> dig<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:20.850> there<00:00:21.029> and

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
I'm going to dig in there and

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.359 
I'm going to dig in there and
investigate<00:00:21.390> maybe<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.320> chute<00:00:22.710> systems<00:00:23.160> and

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
investigate maybe the chute systems and

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.890 
investigate maybe the chute systems and
root<00:00:23.490> systems<00:00:23.910> have<00:00:24.210> trouble<00:00:24.600> breaking

and<00:00:51.170> very<00:00:51.350> strong<00:00:51.739> and<00:00:51.949> they've<00:00:52.670> grown<00:00:52.820> so

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
and very strong and they've grown so

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.090

much in a short amount of time which is

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.710 
much in a short amount of time which is
a<00:00:55.129> pleasant<00:00:55.370> surprise<00:00:55.640> compared<00:00:56.390> to<00:00:56.480> all<00:00:56.600> the

most of them tend to have frail thin
roots<00:01:02.269> that<00:01:02.480> break<00:01:02.720> easily<00:01:02.960> I'm<00:01:03.379> removing<00:01:04.159> all

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
roots that break easily I'm removing all

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.980 
roots that break easily I'm removing all
the<00:01:04.580> residual<00:01:05.030> appeal<00:01:05.300> and<00:01:05.509> planting<00:01:05.869> the

the residual appeal and planting the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.230 
the residual appeal and planting the
individual<00:01:06.470> cloves<00:01:06.710> out<00:01:07.490> of<00:01:07.729> all<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:07.940> cloves

individual cloves out of all the cloves

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.150 
individual cloves out of all the cloves
in<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:08.540> center<00:01:08.810> bulb<00:01:09.080> only<00:01:09.410> this<00:01:09.590> big<00:01:09.950> one

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
in the center bulb only this big one

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.850 
in the center bulb only this big one
seems<00:01:10.520> to<00:01:10.610> have<00:01:10.759> generated<00:01:11.149> roots<00:01:11.539> and<00:01:11.860> it

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
seems to have generated roots and it

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.830 
seems to have generated roots and it
barely<00:01:13.100> has<00:01:13.399> any<00:01:13.430> germination<00:01:14.240> there's<00:01:14.630> not

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
barely has any germination there's not

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.710 
barely has any germination there's not
even<00:01:14.869> any<00:01:15.410> green<00:01:15.830> in<00:01:16.070> its<00:01:16.220> root<00:01:16.399> system<00:01:16.429> I<00:01:17.030> take

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
even any green in its root system I take

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.740 
even any green in its root system I take
this<00:01:17.899> to<00:01:18.110> mean<00:01:18.289> that<00:01:18.590> all<00:01:18.800> the<00:01:19.160> existing<00:01:19.750> chute

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
this to mean that all the existing chute

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.320 
this to mean that all the existing chute
systems<00:01:21.200> that<00:01:21.380> you<00:01:21.470> see<00:01:21.649> must<00:01:21.950> have<00:01:22.220> very<00:01:23.030> very

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
systems that you see must have very very

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.600 
systems that you see must have very very
long<00:01:23.539> root<00:01:23.899> systems<00:01:24.350> already<00:01:24.560> so<00:01:25.100> that<00:01:25.369> means

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
long root systems already so that means

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.090 
long root systems already so that means
I've<00:01:25.970> been<00:01:26.030> under<00:01:26.450> watering<00:01:26.810> if<00:01:27.649> all<00:01:27.920> the

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
I've been under watering if all the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.040 
I've been under watering if all the
other<00:01:28.220> roots<00:01:28.520> or<00:01:28.759> anything<00:01:29.149> like<00:01:29.479> that<00:01:29.509> then

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
other roots or anything like that then

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.840 
other roots or anything like that then
that<00:01:30.289> means<00:01:30.590> they've<00:01:31.039> gone<00:01:31.340> all<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.700> way<00:01:31.729> to

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
that means they've gone all the way to

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.060 
that means they've gone all the way to
nearly<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.630> bottom<00:01:32.840> of<00:01:32.929> the<00:01:33.020> pot<00:01:33.170> already<00:01:33.350> and

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
nearly the bottom of the pot already and

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.070 
nearly the bottom of the pot already and
I've<00:01:34.160> only<00:01:34.340> been<00:01:34.460> watering<00:01:35.090> enough<00:01:35.479> to<00:01:35.720> ensure

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
I've only been watering enough to ensure

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.620 
I've only been watering enough to ensure
that<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:36.440> top<00:01:36.710> portion<00:01:37.369> of<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.820> soil<00:01:38.060> in<00:01:38.330> here

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
that the top portion of the soil in here

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.559 
that the top portion of the soil in here
is<00:01:38.840> getting<00:01:39.409> moist<00:01:39.679> or<00:01:40.039> wet<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:41.000> I'm<00:01:41.420> gonna

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:41.569 
is getting moist or wet so I'm gonna

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:43.930 
is getting moist or wet so I'm gonna
have<00:01:41.780> to<00:01:41.840> water<00:01:42.289> all<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.619> way<00:01:42.709> through<00:01:42.979> some

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
have to water all the way through some

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.999 
have to water all the way through some
of<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.149> leaves<00:01:44.390> that<00:01:44.929> have<00:01:45.140> gotten<00:01:45.440> long<00:01:45.679> in

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
of the leaves that have gotten long in

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.190 
of the leaves that have gotten long in
this<00:01:46.340> pot<00:01:46.580> have<00:01:46.849> already<00:01:47.209> started<00:01:47.420> drooping<00:01:47.989> I

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
this pot have already started drooping I

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.710 
this pot have already started drooping I
think<00:01:48.890> that's<00:01:49.099> natural<00:01:49.849> actually<00:01:50.030> it<00:01:50.479> could

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
think that's natural actually it could

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.400 
think that's natural actually it could
be<00:01:50.929> due<00:01:51.259> to<00:01:52.000> just<00:01:53.000> under<00:01:53.330> watering<00:01:53.690> and<00:01:54.080> loss

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
be due to just under watering and loss

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.440 
be due to just under watering and loss
of<00:01:54.590> trigger<00:01:54.860> pressure<00:01:55.239> combined<00:01:56.239> with<00:01:56.420> a

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
of trigger pressure combined with a

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.320 
of trigger pressure combined with a
extreme<00:01:57.200> heat<00:01:57.500> in<00:01:57.709> the<00:01:58.220> afternoon<00:01:58.670> direct<00:01:59.030> Sun

in<00:01:59.569> this<00:02:00.110> small<00:02:00.380> pot<00:02:00.649> but<00:02:01.069> I<00:02:01.340> think<00:02:01.729> they<00:02:01.849> just

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
in this small pot but I think they just

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.290 
in this small pot but I think they just
naturally<00:02:02.270> droop<00:02:02.690> like<00:02:02.869> that<00:02:03.110> so<00:02:03.349> we'll<00:02:03.619> see

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
naturally droop like that so we'll see

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.969 
naturally droop like that so we'll see
okay<00:02:05.300> I've<00:02:05.450> got<00:02:05.660> a<00:02:05.690> bag<00:02:06.140> of<00:02:06.170> Miracle<00:02:06.770> Grow

one<00:02:09.379> of<00:02:09.410> these<00:02:09.619> to<00:02:10.009> a<00:02:10.039> 2-liter<00:02:10.550> bottle<00:02:10.970> right

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
one of these to a 2-liter bottle right

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.729 
one of these to a 2-liter bottle right
here<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:12.020> shake<00:02:12.650> with<00:02:13.069> just<00:02:13.310> half<00:02:13.489> water<00:02:13.730> and

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
here and shake with just half water and

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.229 
here and shake with just half water and
basically<00:02:15.739> this<00:02:16.129> has<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.849> high<00:02:17.060> nitrogen

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
basically this has a high nitrogen

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.790 
basically this has a high nitrogen

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.400 
content 24% you know has a phosphorous
content<00:02:22.280> that's<00:02:22.430> low<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:23.020> double<00:02:24.020> that<00:02:24.200> in

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
content that's low and double that in

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.920 
content that's low and double that in
potassium<00:02:24.879> here's<00:02:25.879> what<00:02:26.120> a<00:02:26.150> single<00:02:26.450> packet

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
potassium here's what a single packet

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.720 
potassium here's what a single packet
looks<00:02:27.110> like<00:02:27.349> I'm<00:02:27.890> just<00:02:28.069> gonna<00:02:28.160> rip<00:02:28.370> this<00:02:28.520> open

looks like I'm just gonna rip this open
and<00:02:29.120> pour<00:02:29.270> that<00:02:29.300> in<00:02:29.540> there<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:30.830> this<00:02:31.099> is<00:02:31.220> what

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
and pour that in there so this is what

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.400 
and pour that in there so this is what
the<00:02:31.430> final<00:02:31.640> product<00:02:31.910> looks<00:02:32.120> like<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:32.780> the

the final product looks like and the
goal<00:02:33.590> here<00:02:33.620> is<00:02:33.860> just<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.310> promote<00:02:34.519> a<00:02:34.849> lot<00:02:35.090> of

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
goal here is just to promote a lot of

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.170 
goal here is just to promote a lot of
vegetative<00:02:35.720> growth<00:02:35.750> as<00:02:36.230> fast<00:02:36.590> as<00:02:36.830> possible<00:02:37.370> so

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
vegetative growth as fast as possible so

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.640

this<00:02:46.250> should<00:02:46.580> grow<00:02:46.790> even<00:02:47.000> faster<00:02:47.480> than<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.720> has

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
this should grow even faster than it has

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.960 
this should grow even faster than it has
been<00:02:48.080> so<00:02:48.320> far<00:02:48.560> especially<00:02:49.310> as<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.670> plants

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
been so far especially as the plants

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:50.480 
been so far especially as the plants
grow<00:02:50.030> big

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
grow big

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.090 
grow big
and<00:02:50.880> have<00:02:51.150> more<00:02:51.390> foliage<00:02:51.630> they'll<00:02:52.590> be<00:02:52.830> able<00:02:52.950> to

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
and have more foliage they'll be able to

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.310 
and have more foliage they'll be able to
photosynthesize<00:02:53.850> more<00:02:54.300> and<00:02:54.630> growth<00:02:55.050> will

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
photosynthesize more and growth will

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.040 
photosynthesize more and growth will
occur<00:02:55.350> at<00:02:55.770> an<00:02:55.920> exponential<00:02:56.400> rate<00:02:56.580> I<00:02:57.090> normally

know there's a first leaf that kind of

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.490 
know there's a first leaf that kind of
serves<00:03:37.770> as<00:03:38.100> a<00:03:38.130> wide<00:03:38.760> circular<00:03:39.420> sheath<00:03:40.230> and

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.630 
that grows you know 2 to 3 centimeters a
day<00:03:44.520> closer<00:03:45.300> to<00:03:45.480> 2<00:03:45.780> I<00:03:45.840> would<00:03:46.080> say<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:46.830> then<00:03:47.460> you

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
day closer to 2 I would say and then you

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.850 
day closer to 2 I would say and then you
have<00:03:47.940> all<00:03:48.450> these<00:03:48.840> other<00:03:49.050> leaves<00:03:49.320> coming<00:03:49.710> out

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
have all these other leaves coming out

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.660 
have all these other leaves coming out
so<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:51.140> overall<00:03:52.140> height<00:03:52.530> increase<00:03:53.340> will

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
so the overall height increase will

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.420 
so the overall height increase will
taper<00:03:54.090> off<00:03:54.240> it<00:03:54.900> seems<00:03:55.290> but<00:03:55.680> there's<00:03:56.130> gonna<00:03:56.340> be

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
taper off it seems but there's gonna be

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.550 
taper off it seems but there's gonna be
a<00:03:56.580> lot<00:03:56.760> more<00:03:56.910> leaves<00:03:57.210> going<00:03:57.630> simultaneously

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
a lot more leaves going simultaneously

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.890 
a lot more leaves going simultaneously
so<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:59.250> increase<00:03:59.610> in<00:03:59.760> biomass<00:04:00.030> is<00:04:00.540> pretty

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
so the increase in biomass is pretty

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.080 
so the increase in biomass is pretty
substantial<00:04:01.110> with<00:04:01.800> every<00:04:02.160> passing<00:04:02.610> day<00:04:02.640> and

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
substantial with every passing day and

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.450 
substantial with every passing day and
that<00:04:03.960> bodes<00:04:04.170> very<00:04:04.320> well<00:04:04.500> for<00:04:04.710> a<00:04:05.040> future

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
that bodes very well for a future

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.270 
that bodes very well for a future
harvest<00:04:06.000> in<00:04:06.780> terms<00:04:07.020> of<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.320> timing<00:04:07.830> for<00:04:08.070> my

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
harvest in terms of the timing for my

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.390 
harvest in terms of the timing for my
planting<00:04:08.880> of<00:04:09.060> garlic<00:04:09.450> in<00:04:09.600> this<00:04:09.720> video<00:04:10.110> series

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
planting of garlic in this video series

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.340 
planting of garlic in this video series
it<00:04:11.400> turns<00:04:11.700> out<00:04:11.940> that<00:04:12.240> garlic<00:04:12.780> actually<00:04:12.930> should

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
it turns out that garlic actually should

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.530 
it turns out that garlic actually should
be<00:04:13.500> planted<00:04:13.800> in<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.130> fall<00:04:14.220> and<00:04:14.670> it's<00:04:15.090> late

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
be planted in the fall and it's late

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.410 
be planted in the fall and it's late
September<00:04:16.080> right<00:04:16.230> now<00:04:16.440> 2013<00:04:17.400> in<00:04:17.850> San<00:04:18.060> Diego

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
September right now 2013 in San Diego

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.380 
September right now 2013 in San Diego
California<00:04:19.100> so<00:04:20.100> I<00:04:20.460> didn't<00:04:20.790> do<00:04:21.060> this<00:04:21.210> on

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
California so I didn't do this on

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.870 
California so I didn't do this on
purpose<00:04:21.450> it's<00:04:22.260> just<00:04:22.650> somebody<00:04:23.280> suggested

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
purpose it's just somebody suggested

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.940 
purpose it's just somebody suggested
that<00:04:24.000> I<00:04:24.060> grow<00:04:24.300> garlic<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:25.020> I<00:04:25.290> followed<00:04:25.740> up<00:04:25.830> on

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
that I grow garlic and I followed up on

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.830 
that I grow garlic and I followed up on
the<00:04:26.070> suggestion<00:04:26.640> so<00:04:27.210> we'll<00:04:27.510> see<00:04:27.690> what<00:04:27.810> the

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
the suggestion so we'll see what the

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.260 
the suggestion so we'll see what the
future<00:04:28.170> holds<00:04:28.380> by<00:04:28.950> nearly<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.670> end<00:04:29.700> of<00:04:30.000> month

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
future holds by nearly the end of month
